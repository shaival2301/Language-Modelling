Tuesday, October 12, 1976

OPENING OF SECOND SESSION
THIRTIETH PARLIAMENT
Parliament having been summoned by Proclamation to meet
this day for the dispatch of business:
The Senate met at 1.45 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.
Prayers.
COMMUNICATION FROM GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SECRETARY

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have received
the following communication:
GOVERNMENT HOUSE
OTTAWA

October 12, 1976
Madam,
I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency
the Governor General will arrive at the main entrance of
the Parliament Buildings at 1.40 p.m. on this day, Tuesday, the 12th of October 1976, and when it has been
signified that all is in readiness, will proceed to the
Chamber of the Senate to open formally the Second
Session of the Thirtieth Parliament of Canada.
I have the honour to be,
Madam,
Your obedient servant,
Esmond Butler
Secretary to the Governor General.
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At 2 p.m. His Excellency the Governor General proceeded
to the Senate Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne. His
Excellency was pleased to command the attendance of the
House of Commons, and, that House being come, with their
Speaker, His Excellency was pleased to open the Second
Session of the Thirtieth Parliament of Canada with the following speech:
80003-1

[Translation]
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:

I have the honour to welcome you to the Second Session of
the 30th Parliament of Canada.
I am proud to be able to speak with you once more after an
absence occasioned by an affliction which forced niy withdrawal from public life for a time.
I now have a better understanding of our human frailty, but
I have also learned the depths of devotion of those who love us
as well as the strength of the human will to survive.
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my thanks to
all my fellow citizens who sent their best wishes for my health
and who remembered me in their prayers.
The activities of this year have taken me from the grounds
of Rideau Hall and across the country. Two of my engagements took me to Vancouver, for the United Nations Habitat
conference, and to Montreal, for the Olympic Games.
The whole world was our guest for these two events, and I
was struck by the contrast between those of us in Canada who
are sometimes inflicted with morbid self-analysis, and those
who come to us from other lands, and see Canada as a country
truly blessed.
[Text]

For the Olympic games, the Queen and her family came to
Quebec and Ontario, after a visit by Her Majesty and Prince
Philip to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; everywhere they
received a warm welcome.
Next year, of course, Her Majesty will celebrate the Silver
Jubilee of her accession to the Throne. She will be spending a
few days in Ottawa to celebrate it with us, and to celebrate
also the Jubilee of the appointment of the first Canadian-born
Governor General in Canada, and the 10th anniversary of the
foundation of the Order of Canada. This will be the seventh
time in ten years that the Queen has visited Canada.
As we assemble in this historic place the day after Thanksgiving Day, it is fitting for all of us to pause and give thanks
for the remarkable freedom we enjoy as Canadians, and for
those human and natural resources which give Canada a
favoured position among the nations of the world.
Because of the basic underlying strength of the economy,
and because of the co-operation of the majority of Canadians
which is making the anti-inflation program work, Canada has
better reasons for confidence and optimism than has virtually
any other nation. Our storehouse of natural resources, our
food-producing ability, our labour and management skills
present Canada with growth opportunities which are shared by

October 12, 1976

SENATE DEBATES
few other industrialized countries. The fundamental reality
which will guide your deliberations is that Canada is entering
upon a decade of opportunity.
It is our strength, and our confidence in ourselves which give
us the real opportunity to make greater progress toward those
goals which all Canadians share-national unity, equality of
opportunity, and the enhancement of individual rights.
I-National Unity
In order to promote that level of unity among Canadians
without which we cannot be truly free, truly one nation, nor
hope to achieve our shared national goals, the Government will
place a very high priority upon the promotion of better understanding among French-speaking and English-speaking
Canadians, and upon the achievement of formal constitutional
independence.
Since 1968 the policy of official languages, supported by all
parties represented in Parliament, has been based on the
principle of equality, and on the right of Canadians to speak
English or French according to their own will. An essential
consequence, agreed by Parliament, is that the federal government provide services in the two official languages in the
National Capital, and wherever else there is sufficient demand
for such services.
The policy is one of fairness and reasonableness toward the
people speaking the two official languages of Canada; and the
Government is of the view that it must be maintained in the
interests of justice and of the unity of Canada.
Canada is a diverse country. Unity can result only from a
recognition of that diversity, and not from any attempt to
impose rigid uniformity. In matters of language and culture, it
is important to recognize the personality of the various parts of
the country without departing from fundamental principles of
justice and generosity, which should apply everywhere.
The Government has established programs intended to give
real meaning to the official languages policy. Some of these
measures have proven successful, and will be continued.
Others have not, and will be modified.
Grievances originating from public servants through the
Commissioner of Official Languages will continue to be
reviewed, in order to fulfill the Government's commitment to
ensure maximum fairness and effectiveness in the implementation of the official languages policy.
The Government remains committed to the enhancement of
the bilingual capacity of the federal public service. However, it
believes that a better balance should be established between
the money spent to introduce bilingualism in the public service
and the money spent to enable more Canadians, particularly
young people, to learn to communicate in both official languages. The Government is convinced that a great majority of
Canadians are dedicated to the strengthening of bonds among
Canadians speaking our two official languages, and belonging
to our many different cultures.

[Translation]
Canadians appear particularly anxious that their children
have the best possible chance of understanding their compatriots of the other language. Consequently, the Government
intends to discuss with the provinces arrangements to increase
the effectiveness of training in both official languages in the
school systems across Canada.
The Government also intends to increase programs to enable
young people from various parts of the country to learn more
about one another.
II-Equality of Opportunity
While it is essential to national unity that all Canadians
believe we have an equal opportunity to be fully ourselves in a
cultural sense, it is just as essential to unity that we enjoy
equal opportunities for individual and regional economic
fulfilment.
To translate Canada's economic potential into real growth
and equality of opportunity, we must be both clear-sighted in
our recognition of the obstacles which lie in our path, and
united in our determination to remove them.
The most important obstacle is inflation; a destructive force
which we all know can take jobs and income away from our
workers, rob the elderly of the value of their savings, stunt the
dreams of families for a better life, impede the flow of capital
necessary for industrial growth, and obstruct the fight against
poverty and inequality.
The continued reduction of inflation, and the creation of
many more employment opportunities for Canadians, are and
will continue to be the Government's highest priorities.
To create the climate necessary for the achievement of these
two vital objectives, the Government will continue to practice
fiscal restraint. The control of inflation will remain the single
most important condition for economic stability in Canada,
even after price and income controls are removed. Determined
restraint in fiscal and monetary policy is essential to the
long-term control of inflation.
The Government remains committed to a reduction in the
growth of the public service. In the ten years prior to 1975-76
authorized man-years in the public service grew at an average
annual rate of 4 per cent. This year the growth rate was
reduced to 1.5 per cent, requiring actual reductions in 27
departments and agencies. The Government will reduce the
rate of growth to below one per cent in the coming fiscal year.
In a further effort to reduce the size of government as well
as expand the range of opportunities for private enterprise, all
federal programs will be reviewed to identify those government
activities which could be transferred to the private sector
without reducing the quality of service to the public.
The international trading environment will profoundly influence our economic performance, and significant progress will
be sought by Canada in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations
and through other trade development initiatives. To support
private industry in meeting greater international competition,

October 12, 1976

October 12, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

the Government will modify substantially its industrial assistance programs.
[Text]

The Government also places a very high value on the
contribution small businesses make to the economic and social
well-being of Canadians. Small owner-managed firms are a
mainstay of employment in cities and towns across the country. They supply goods and services essential to consumers and
to other business, and they demonstrate the innovation and
entrepreneurship from which successful enterprise must spring.
More than that, small businesses, and the people who own
them, manage them, and work in them, are the economic
backbone of countless communities throughout Canada.
The Government will introduce measures to assist small
businesses by improving local access to financial assistance and
other services provided by government departments, the Federal Business Development Bank, and financial institutions in
the private sector.
In response to concerns expressed by many Canadian businessmen, the Government will establish a better balance between the need for economic data, and the paperwork burden
thereby imposed on small firms. The number of firms required
to make statistical reports to government will be substantially
reduced. Those larger companies which will still be required to
submit information on a regular basis will be able to do so on
fewer and simpler reporting forms.
In pursuit of the goal of a higher rate of employment, it will
be necessary to improve the efficiency of the labour market
and actively hasten the return of unemployed workers to
productive effort. Adequate income is a pre-requisite to human
dignity; and the Government believes most unemployed
Canadians would much prefer to secure that income through
worthwhile work than through public assistance. In some
cases, and locations, this goal can be achieved only through
direct job creation by governments.
You will therefore be asked to approve a comprehensive,
year-round, direct job creation program, directed particularly
toward areas of chronic high unemployment. Other programs
will provide more job opportunities and improved employment
counselling for young people.
The Government will not compete with the private sector for
the services of unemployed workers, but will create jobs in
areas where its efforts will be a necessary supplement to
private sector activity.
You will be asked to amend the Unemployment Insurance
Act in ways which will permit insurance funds to be used to
maintain the income of Canadians being trained for new jobs,
and to help employers retain workers who might otherwise be
temporarily laid off.
To facilitate these improvements, the Government proposes
the merger of the operations of the Unemployment Insurance
Commission and the Manpower and Immigration Department,
so that Canadians may obtain employment support services at
a single source.
80003-1'/2

You will be asked to consider amendments to the Immigration Act, designed to promote Canada's regional and urban
development goals, promote family unity, achieve a balance
between immigration levels and employment opportunities,
and preserve Canada's reputation as an open, tolerant society
which welcomes the energy and cultural diversity of people
from all parts of the world.
[Translation]

The improvement of labour-management relations in
Canada is an essential pre-condition to economic stability.
While it considers the collective bargaining system to be one of
the important ways of ensuring fair wages in a democratic
society, the Government and Canadians generally are deeply
disturbed by the loss of productivity and increased social
tensions which frequently result from the inadequacies of that
system.
The solution is not to be found in excessive restriction of
collective bargaining rights, but rather in the development of
better mechanisms for settling disputes in a less adversarial,
more co-operative manner.
The Government therefore intends to work with the provinces and with labour and business communities to develop a
number of initiatives aimed at improving labour-management
relations.
It is intended to establish a collective bargaining information centre, which will offer objective economic and compensation data to all parties. It is also intended to encourage greater
participation by plant workers in decisions affecting their
working conditions; to expand labour education programs; to
develop a voluntary code of fair practices; and to establish a
national institution dedicated to improving the quality of life
in the workplace.
An industrial safety and health centre will be established to
assist companies and workers in their efforts to identify and
remove hazards.
The Government will work closely with its own employees in
various departments and Crown corporations to implement
innovative, co-operative methods of improving health and
safety conditions. In effect, the Government intends to use its
own operations to test new methods of improving working
conditions and labour-management relations.
[Text]

Measures will be proposed to improve the collective bargaining system in the public service, to reduce the adversarial
nature of the process and to ensure an equitable relationship
between compensation levels in the public and private sectors.
The Government intends to promote greater freedom and
efficiency in the marketplace, and thus reinforce the market
system's vital role in the allocation of national resources
among national needs.
Significant revisions to laws promoting competition in the
marketplace will be placed before you. The Government is
determined to preserve and enhance Canada's traditional
policy of reliance on individual enterprise as the mainspring of
economic activity.

SENATE DEBATES
The focus of the second stage of competition policy reform
will be a strengthening of the laws governing mergers and
monopolies in order to encourage a more efficient and dynamic
economy; one that rewards the creative and the industrious;
that allows prices to be determined by the free play of market
forces while protecting the marketplace from excessive concentrations of power. The more effectively competition governs
the marketplace, the less necessity there will be for detailed
regulation and control of the economy by governments.
On the other hand, where competition is inadequate the
Government must intervene to protect the public interest. For
this reason, changes will be introduced to the National Transportation Act to protect against unfair freight rates.
There is a growing awareness among Canadians of the need
for more careful conservation of vital energy resources such as
petroleum and natural gas. The Government will place further
emphasis on research and development of renewable energy
sources and on means of improving the efficiency with which
energy is used in Canada, particularly the thermal efficiency
of residential and commercial buildings.
To ensure responsible development of our indigenous
resources, the Government intends to introduce measures to
regulate exploration and development on federal lands.
With a view to conserving the food resources of the sea, and
improving the livelihood of Canadian fishermen, the Government will proclaim by the first of January its extended jurisdiction over waters within two hundred miles of our coastline.
As a further element of the Government's food policy,
measures will be introduced to make more farm-stored crops
eligible for advance payments. The Government will also work
with the provinces and farm organizations to strengthen the
structure and productivity of Canadian agriculture.
[Translation]
In the field of social policy, extensive federal-provincial
discussions over the past three years have resulted in a new
framework for the sharing of costs and for making social
service programs more responsive. Parliament will therefore be
asked to consider a new Social Services Act which will substantially improve the effectiveness of cost-shared social services in Canada, especially for the aged, children and the
handicapped.
In response to the need for good day-care services everywhere in Canada, the Government will help to provide more
and better day-care services by encouraging the provincial
governments to adopt a new system of fees related to incomes.
A great many more Canadian mothers who seek employment
outside the home will thereby be free to do so, because
partially subsidized day-care will be more widely available.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Canada
Pension Plan which would further recognize the value of the
contribution made to the family and society by both marriage
partners, in the event that one remains at home to raise
children while their partner works outside the home, or in the
event of marriage breakdown.

October 12, 1976

On January first, the indexing of family allowance payments
will be resumed to compensate for the rise in the cost of living
during 1976.
In the areas of medical insurance, hospital insurance and
post-secondary education, negotiations will continue with the
provinces concerning the gradual introduction of new financial
and administrative arrangements. These changes would not
only allow the provinces to exercise greater flexibility in the
provision of services, but would also serve the federal government's goal of co-operative restraint upon the rising cost of
health and social security programs.
Of equal importance to the social well-being of Canadians is
an adequate supply of affordable housing in a satisfactory
community environment. Therefore, the goal of one million
new homes over four years remains a key element of the
Government's housing policy. In concert with other levels of
government and the private sector the Government will work
to increase the efficiency and impact of Canada's total housing
effort.
The Government attaches continuing importance to meeting
the aspirations of Canada's native peoples and, in particular,
to the just settlement of their land claims. At this session, you
will be asked to approve the negotiated settlement of claims in
the James Bay region.
In the aftermath of the highly successful Montreal Olympics, and the gratifying results achieved by Canadian athletes,
federal support for selected amateur sport and fitness programs will be further augmented.
[Text]
This year, the Law Reform Commission of Canada submitted a report on family law which merits the attention of all
Canadians. The Government intends to carry on discussions
with the provinces to encourage the creation of unified Family
Courts with comprehensive jurisdiction over family law permitting disputes to be dealt with more constructively. In
addition the government will discuss with the provinces and
with the public other aspects of family law bearing on the
stability of marriage, the protection of children and the fair
sharing of the economic consequences of marital breakdown.
Canadians are becoming increasingly sensitive to the fact
that Canada cannot live in dignity as a nation while other
people, in less fortunate lands, live in a state of deprivation and
hopelessness.
It is not in Canada's economic, political or moral interest to
allow the gap to widen between the wealth of the few and the
poverty of the many. Therefore the Government will continue
to participate in the task of shaping a new international
economic order, designed to provide a greater measure of hope
to nations seeking the opportunity to help themselves.
The world is now confronted with a broad range of problems
of such complexity and widespread scope that no single nation
or group of nations is able to apply effective solutions. Only
global solutions will do.
Increasingly, therefore, Canada's international activities are
being directed toward broad-scale co-operative activities.

SENATE DEBATES

October 12, 1976

Human settlements, the law of the sea, environmental protection, food and resources production, terrorism, population
growth, control of nuclear armaments, economic development-all demand shared responsibility and universal

[Translation]

III-Individual Freedom
In speaking about the Government's plans to promote greater unity of spirit and equality of opportunity both in the world
community and here at home, it becomes obvious that the
achievement of both these goals demands a healthy respect for
individual rights, particularly the right of free men and women
to exert a real influence over decisions affecting their own
future.
At a time of growing complexity in public affairs it is
especially important to enhance the citizen's right of access to
the information necessary to make well-informed judgements
and take responsible action.
The Government therefore places great value on the continuing work of the joint parliamentary committee which has
been studying the question of freedom of information, and
plans to submit a policy paper to that committee in the hope
that early agreement might be reached on the best methods to
improve public access to government information. In the
meantime, the Government will increase the number and
range of internal documents available to the public.
To the same end, you will be asked to consider a Bill
designed to clarify the duties and responsibilities of the Auditor General of Canada, and to provide him with better means
of fulfilling his important function as a servant of Parliament.
In a similar effort to remove obstacles to information and to
equal opportunity, the Government will introduce a Human
Rights Bill. The major effect of the Bill will be to prohibit
discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, national or
ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, marital status, or physical
handicap. In particular, the Bill will establish the principle of
equal compensation for work of equal value performed by
persons of either sex. It will establish a citizen's statutory right
to gain greater access to personal records in federal information banks and to correct that information when it is in error.
It will also limit the gathering of personal information by the
Government.
[Text]

The Government and all Parliamentarians are concerned
about the extent to which the average citizen is informed about
Parliament. The Government wishes to provide access to the
Parliamentary process for as many Canadians as possible. It
will therefore seek approval to enable the proceedings of the
House of Commons to be broadcast.
IV-Role of Government
It is essential to the enhancement of unity, equality of
opportunity and individual freedom that Canadians work to-

gether in a spirit of co-operation and mutual respect. To that
end, it is important for all participants to have a well defined
view of their respective roles in the pursuit of national
objectives.
It is appropriate, therefore, to define the role of government
in economic and social planning and action. There are some
who acknowledge only a very limited role for government,
believing that the market system allocates resources most
efficiently for production and growth, is least wasteful, and
most conducive to individual liberty and initiative.
That view is vigorously opposed by those who insist on a
continually expanding role for government in directing economic growth, correcting the inadequacies of the market
system, and assuring a socially acceptable distribution of
incomes. This view asserts that government spending and
intervention must increase to compensate for the failure of the
market to serve social goals.
The Government favours a middle road between those two
extremes.
This middle road represents a commitment to a society in
which all Canadians can develop their full potential, a society
in which justice, compassion, tolerance and understanding lead
to a strong and united Canada, a society based upon individual
initiative and marked by personal freedom. The choice of the
middle road implies a reliance on the market to stimulate the
growth Canada needs, together with an enduring commitment
to social justice and equality of opportunity. On the other
hand, that choice also implies that the working of the market
must be improved and that less costly, less interventionist ways
must be found to pursue social goals.
These choices have shaped the Government's legislative
program for the coming months, just as it will shape appropriate policies for the post-control period.
Obviously, the development of the new strategies required
by the times in which we live will demand the closest possible
co-operation among governments, workers, businessmen, cooperative and voluntary organizations and all other sectors of
society. To that end, the Government will launch a major
series of consultations throughout Canada to secure a greater
sharing of economic and social responsibility among all
Canadians.
Consultation in this context does not mean simply informing
the public about Government decisions. Nor does it mean an
aimless search for the opinions of others. It means that the
Government will place before interested Canadians its assessment of the major problems we must solve together, and its
definition of the available options.
Parliament will have a vital role to play, as of course will the
provincial governments and their municipalities. For example,
the provinces will be asked to enter into early consultations
with the federal government on the renewal of agreements
relating to the anti-inflation program, and on the process by
which, at the appropriate time, controls may be removed.
The Government is confident that Canada will realize the
great potential of the next decade, because Canadians in all

SENATE DEBATES
sectors of our society are opening their minds to the future,
and are demonstrating a willingness to adopt the means necessary to translate opportunity into reality. Canada will make
steady progress toward the goals of national unity, equality of
opportunity, and the enhancement of individual freedom,
because the people of this country have the courage to tackle
difficult problems, the will to take our own future into our own
hands, and the wisdom to understand that we work effectively
only when we work together.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
Members of the House of Commons,
The Government intends to present a budget in this Session.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry
on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
HonourableMembers of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Governor General was pleased to retire.

THE LATE HONOURABLE J. HARPER PRO WSE
TRIBUTES

Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senators, we were
ail saddened to learn of the death on September 28 of our
esteemed colleague, Senator J. Harper Prowse. For over ten
years he was a distinguished member of this chamber, where
hie was a strong voice for Canada, for western Canada, and
certainly for his native Alberta.
Above ail hie wiIl be remembered by ail of us as a man of
infinite compassion, because hie was a humanitarian in every
sense of the word.
The late Senator Prowse was a graduate of the University of
Alberta Law Scbool. In 1938 hie had embarked on a career ini
journalism. He joined the Edmonton Bulletin-a publication
no longer in existence-and was a writer for that newspaper.
When the Second World War broke out hie enlisted in the
Loyal Edmonton Regiment. He spent six years overseas and
was twice wounded in action.
As many bonourable senators know, Senator Prowse was
first elected to the Alberta Legisiature in 1944 as one of three
non-political representatives of the armed forces, and at the
saine time hie continued bis journalistic career, writing a
popular veterans affairs column in the Bulletin entitled "The
Road Ahead."
He was elected leader of the Liberal Party in 1947, at a
difficult time for bis party in the history of politics in Alberta.
He was a cballenging opponent to the government of the day,
headed by our distinguished colleague, Senator Manning.
Senator Prowse held that position until resigning as leader of
his party in 1958, and retiring from provincial politics in 1959.
It was during the period when Senator Prowse was leader of
tbe Liberal Party in Alberta, and ail the challenges and
vicissitudes which that meant in terms of being in opposition to
a strong government, that I came to know bim personally and
came to be inspired by many of the concepts and ideals which
hie enunciated and propagated during that time.
He was summoned to the Senate in February of 1966 and
served on our Finance, Transportation, and Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committees, and worked with a great deal of
distinction despite bis physical disabilities.
The Edmonton Journal, in an editorial tribute to our late
colleague, wrote:

J. Harper Prowse was a man of many talents and many
interests. He tried much and accompiished much. He was
a man to wbom adversity was inspiration.
His deatb at the age of 63, an untîmely death, is a severe loss
to this chamber, and 1 am sure that ail honourable senators
will wish to join with me in expressing our deepest sympathy to
bis mother, bis wife Irene, bis daughter Dianne, bis son James,
and bis other relatives and inany friends.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, in Harper
Prowse death bas claimed a man of fortitude and vision, a
libertarian wbo fougbt valiantly and effectively in defence of
personal freedom. Senator Prowse was concerned about the
encroacbment of government, labour, the business community,
and indeed, of society in general, upon the rights and privileges
of the individual Canadian.
He was an exceptionally fine orator, one of the classical
variety, and bie was neyer better on his feet than when he was
castigating authoritarians and defending the little guy against
a buge, insensitive society mostly governed by bureaucrats.
We will miss Harper Prowse because hie saw so vividly the
dangers for the individual in an overgoverned society. Not o'nly
did bie see what most of us miss, but spoke out forcefully, with
the eloquence that commands respect and ensures a hearing.
Anger was not, to him, a vice; it was a cleansing virtue; and
tbough hie was a most pleasant, amiable and, indeed, very
sensitive man, Harper Prowse, as a politician and protector of
individual rigbts, could most accurately be described as an
angry man. He had another reason to appear to be an angry
man. A political career for a Liberal in Alberta in the last 40
years was as frustrating and punishing a career as it was for a
Conservative in Quebec.
Those of us wbo are concerned about the erosion of
individual liberty mourn the passing of Harper Prowse, a
comrade in arms. To bis wife and children I offer, on bebaîf of
my colleagues in the opposition, our most beartfelt
condolences.
Hon. David A. Croil: Honourable senators, we ail referred
to Senator Prowse as "Harper." His correct namne was James
Harper Prowse, and hie was born in Taber, Alberta. His
grandfatber was a member of the Senate from Murray Harbour, Prince Edward Island. He graduated from Dalhousie
University, and the University of Alberta, in law. He loved the
law, and, more particularly, the criminal law. He understood
its nuances and its compassion. He was a very good lawyer,
and one of tbe best jury lawyers in the west.
He was a reporter for the Edmonton Bulletin for a wbile,
and bad a radio program on CFRN in Edmonton. Then bie
practised law in Edmonton and subsequently enlisted in July

SENATE DEBATES
1940, and served until March 1945 during World War Il. He
was wounded in action in 1943 while serving with the Loyal
Edmonton Regiment in Ortona, Italy, and in 1945 was elected
as a representative of the army to the Alberta Legislature.
He was elected Liberal leader in 1947, and held that office
for 11 years, faced with a government of pragmatic competence. He resigned and went back to the practice of law, but
public affairs held his attention and he was called to the
Senate in 1966. He immediately made Canada aware of
western viewpoints; he presented them constantly and appealingly, and his advocacy was strong.

e

(1410)

We thought he was a great speaker, but the truth of it is
that he was more than that. He was an orator. There was
always a melody of syntax in his speeches. When he got on the
floor, words cascaded from his lips like a rushing brook, and he
used them unsparingly. He was a delight to listen to.
He served on many committees. He was Chairman of the
Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs. He was a man devoted to public service, and more
particularly to the needy and the helpless. He did that by will
and tradition.
In recent years he was plagued with illness, and it was
obvious to all of us here that the bell was beginning to toll for
him.
He was a decent man, who served this country in peace and
war; a great friend of the veterans and of the poor; a humanitarian. He did the very best he could. He was a credit to the
public service of Canada and to the Senate of this country.
I join my colleagues in extending to his wife and his family
the sympathy of this chamber.
Hon. Ernest C. Manning: Honourable senators, I would like
to join in the fitting tributes that have been paid to the late
Senator Prowse, and also in the condolences that we all wish to
express to his wife and family.
I knew Senator Prowse primarily in his capacity as Leader
of the Opposition in the Alberta Legislature for the eleven
years that he served in that capacity. He was a dynamic man,
but he was also a man, as has been rightly said, of deep
compassion, a man who was always quick to be a friend of the
underdog or anyone whom he felt needed somebody to speak
for him.
He made a significant mark in the political life of western
Canada, as I am sure we would agree he did on the broader
field after he became a member of this house. As a fellow
Albertan, and as one who also knew him in a rather different
relationship from others during his work in Alberta, I would
like to join in paying tribute to his memory and in offering
condolences to his family.
Hon. Earl A. Hastings: Honourable senators, I should like
to join in this tribute to Senator J. Harper Prowse. I do so in
the context of not only the loss of a colleague, not only the loss
of a seatmate of eleven years, or of having shared an office
with him for five years, but the loss of a close, dear, personal

October 13, 1976

friend of nearly 30 years in the public and political life of our
province, Alberta.
Some of the clearest memories I shall always have of
Harper are those of two qualities of character: concern and
courage. He had concern for the underdog, as has been stated,
the underprivileged, the handicapped, the native, for it was
Harper's view that ways and means had to be found to give
these people a square deal in the difficult vagaries of life. He
always exerted himself with all those capabilities which have
been alluded to in order to give them a better quality of life.
Courage: Harper displayed a courage in his younger years
that was exemplified in combatant sport. He loved to tell how
he became light-heavyweight champion of Military District
No. 12, but in all sports be excelled. He showed courage while
leading men into battle, himself being wounded twice at
Salerno; and courage when, a man 39 years of age, he returned
to university during the days when 39-year olds did not return
to universities, to attain a law degree by which he could better
fulfil his responsibilities in life. He had courage, as the Leader
of the Opposition has indicated, to lead men and women to
common goals.
Honourable senators, in joining in your expression of sympathy to his wife Irene, his son James, his daughter Dianne, and
particularly his mother, Mrs. Margaret Prowse, and the
Prowse family, I offer this totally sincere yet inadequate
tribute to a distinguished son of Alberta, James Harper
Prowse.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, as a former
Edmontonian it was my privilege to know Harper Prowse in
the days during which he was a student at the University of
Alberta. From the earliest times he displayed a tremendous
interest in public affairs and a determination to serve his
community in whatever capacity he could. Over the years be
achieved a certain measure of distinction serving his friends,
his neighbours, his province and his country. He frequently
came into my office at the university when be was a student,
and even in those days he had the determination to make a
career in the public service. As a consequence, I followed his
career with a great deal of interest and was delighted when be
became the leader of the Liberals in Alberta, in which capacity no man served with more dedication.
I was one of those who were very pleased when he was
appointed to the Senate, because I felt that, as so often
happens in public life, the people of his own province did not
reward his worth as well as they might have. He was a
dedicated chap; be gave everything be possessed to whatever
cause he was espousing. He was a warm friend and colleague.
The Senate has lost a distinguished member, and the community of Edmonton a dedicated public servant.
Hon. Harry Hays: Honourable senators, I also would like to
join my colleagues in paying tribute to J. Harper Prowse. I did
not know him until about 1960, at the time I became involved
in the political arena. I found Harper to be good company. He
never held a grudge; he liked to participate in debates and if
the debate became a little hot, why, he enjoyed that, and at the

SENATE DEBATES

October 13, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

October 13, 1976

conclusion was always able to shake hands with the person
with whom he had been debating.
• (1420)
It is rather unfortunate that he never had an opportunity to
be part of the government that was active in formulating
policies in Alberta. He was always a member of the opposition.
Had he had an opportunity of being a leader in Alberta, in my
opinion he would have done a great job.
I too would like to express my sympathy to his family. I
knew Harper as a friend, and western Canada certainly is
better off that he lived.

That the proceedings on the order of the day for
resuming the debate on the motion for an Address in
reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech
from the Throne addressed to both Houses of Parliament
be concluded on the eighth sitting day on which the order
is debated.
Motion agreed to.
PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA
EQUALIZATION GRANTS-QUESTION

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, yesterday the
Honourable Senator Croll rose to ask the following question:
Honourable senators, may I ask why the simultaneous
interpretation facilities are not available today?
When openings of Parliament are formal openings, simultaneous interpretation is not possible because the desks of honourable senators are removed to make way for benches in
order to accommodate the guests who sit in this chamber. In
the event of informal openings, such as the one held yesterday,
I am trying to find out whether or not simultaneous interpretation was provided in the past and, if not, for what reason.
However, after consultation with officers of the Senate and
with the media, I am now able to advise honourable senators
that simultaneous interpretation will be provided at all future
openings when senators' desks are in place.

Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I should
like to direct the following question to the Leader of the
Government: What arrangement did the Minister of Energy,
Mines and Resources have in mind when he said, as reported
in the press, that there was an arrangement whereby Nova
Scotia would receive an additional $10 million in equalization
grants this year related to assistance because of the higher cost
of fuel oil.
What is that arrangement? By what amount will assistance
be granted under this arrangement, and when will it be
received?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, having regard to the
technical nature of the question, I shall take this as a notice
and endeavour to provide a complete reply at the earliest
possible date.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Perhaps I might add by way of
reference, in the hope that it may be of some assistance, that a
report relating to this matter appeared in the Globe and Mail
on October 5.

THE SENATE

MINUTES OF THE PROCEEDINGS

On the presentation of petitions:
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, there are no petitions to present. However, may I state that I look forward to
working together with all honourable senators in another very
active and productive session.
It is the intention of the government to advance useful
legislation which, I am sure, will invite debate on occasionwill not provide too much debate, perhaps, but a certain
amount of spirited discussion.
It is good to see so many colleagues here this afternoon,
some of whom encountered health disabilities in recent months
and are once again restored to good health and spirits. I know
that all honourable senators join me in welcoming them back
in our midst.

TERMINATION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY ON EIGHTH
SITTING DAY

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(i) I move, seconded by
Senator Perrault:

80003-2

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, before the Orders
of the Day are called, I would like to draw the attention of this
chamber to an error in the French version of the Minutes of
the Proceedings made available to us this day.
At page ii of the Orders of the Day for today, the English
version reads as follows:
Consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech from the Throne at the opening of the Second
Session of the Thirtieth Parliament of Canada.
In the French version at the same page, under the heading
"Ordre du jour," the translation reads as follows:
[Text]

Étude du discours de Son Excellence l'Administrateur
du Gouvernement du Canada lors de l'ouverture de la
deuxième session de la trentième Législature du Canada.
[English]

The error is quite evident, and I hope it will be corrected in
due course.
Senator Flynn: It was probably copied from the proceedings
at the beginning of the last session.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Langlois: Or possibly from the closing of the first
session which also took place yesterday.
[Later.]
ERROR IN ENGLISH TEXT OF SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

Senator Greene: On a point of privilege, I should like to
draw the attention of honourable senators to page 4 of the
Minutes of the Proceedings of October 12, 1976, which purports to report the Speech from the Throne. The second
paragraph reads as follows:
In a further effort to reduce the size of government as
well as expand the range of opportunities for private
enterprise, all federal programs will be reviewed to identify those government activities which could be transferred
to the private sector without the quality of service to the
public.
If honourable senators will check Hansardof yesterday's date,
which correctly reports the Speech from the Throne, they will
see that it should read: ". . . without reducing the quality of

service to the public."
Senator Flynn: It is an obvious error.
Senator Greene: I think honourable senators will agree that
that is a very serious error, and one which should not be
permitted to be made permanent in our records.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY -DEBATE

ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of the session.
[Translation]
Hon. Paul H. Lucier moved, seconded by Hon. Irvine
Barrow:
That the following Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Jules Léger,
Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of
Canada, Chancellor and Commander of the Order of
Military Merit, holder of the Canadian Armed Forces
decoration, Governor General and Commander-inChief of Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, the
Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled, beg leave to
offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency for the
gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to
both Houses of Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, in introducing this motion I
ask for your indulgence because it is the first time that I have
the privilege to rise before you in this house.
The Speech from the Throne read yesterday by their Excellencies, Governor General Léger and Mrs. Léger, covers several major programs such as bilingualism, the fight against
inflation, appropriate steps to help small businesses as well as

October 13, 1976

the creation of new jobs. However, all those initiatives will be
useless unless we Canadians develop a positive attitude and
stop destroying, as we have done in the past, everything
governments try to do.
Government alone cannot accomplish much. No legislation
will give results unless we realize that our action will determine whether we will win or lose by it and in that respect we
try to create a better Canada.
The good intentions of the government to work in cooperation with the provinces as well as labour and business to
develop initiatives to improve employee-employer relations will
not be successful without the cooperation of all parties
concerned.
We are privileged in these difficult times to have a determined Prime Minister who has the courage to do what must be
done for the good of all Canadians. However, I must agree
that no legislation will give results without the cooperation and
the good will of each and every one of us.

Being fortunate enough to be honoured by appointment as
the first senator to represent the Yukon, I would like to take
this opportunity to help you better understand the Yukon and
its people.
On August 17, 1896, George Carmacks scooped a pan of
gravel from a small creek, panned it and found the bottom of
the pan littered with small gold nuggets. The greatest gold
rush in history was on. The word "Klondike" was heard all
over the world.
The journey to Dawson was no easy task. People poured on
to anything that floated in Vancouver or Seattle, made their
way to Skagway, Alaska, and walked over the rugged Chilkoot
Trail to Bennett, British Columbia, where rafts and boats were
built for the 500-mile trip down the Yukon River. Getting to
Dawson was very difficult, and only the very determined made
it. Where only a few tents existed, there suddenly appeared a
city of 30,000 people. In fact, Dawson was the largest city west
of Winnipeg at the turn of the century. Dawson presently has
a population of only 800. Parks Canada has recently revealed
the framework of a very ambitious restoration program which
will permanently secure the colourful history of the Gold Rush
for further generations of Canadians.
Things were relatively quiet in the Yukon until World War
Il when Canada and the United States decided that for
military purposes there should be a road linking Alaska and
the Yukon. In a period of approximately 10 months a road was
pushed through mountains and valleys, over creeks, rivers and
swamps from Dawson Creek, British Columbia to Fairbanks,
Alaska. This was 1,525 miles through absolute wilderness. It
would take us twice that long just to do a feasibility study on it
today, let alone build it!
Senator Croll: How true!
Senator Lucier: The Alaska Highway is a first-class, allweather highway with approximately one-third of the total
distance asphalt-surfaced.

SENATE DEBATES

October

The economy of the Yukon today is based mainly on mining
and tourism. We have a very healthy mining industry on which
the territory is heavily dependent for its economic growth.
Vast stores of copper, asbestos, lead, zinc, silver, gold and iron
produced half a billion dollars' worth of minerals during the
past seven years. The second major industry, tourism, has
grown over the years to the extent that within a recent
12-month period over 300,000 visitors to the Yukon spent an
estimated $25 million.
I now wish to discuss some of the major issues we are facing
in the Yukon which the Senate will deal with at some point in
the future. Other comments I make will be of a general nature,
and it is hoped they will assist you in understanding the vast
territory which is known as the Yukon.
The major issue facing the Yukon Territory today is settlement of land claims between the Government of Canada and
the Indian people of the Yukon. At the outset, may I say that
there must be a fair and just land claims settlement arrived at
with the Indian people in the Yukon Territory before any real
economic or political progress or change can be made.
The Yukon Territory consists of approximately 207,000
square miles of land which the Indian people used exclusively
prior to the coming of the Europeans to this country. This land
has never been given up by treaty, surrender or in any other
manner by the Indian people.
It is my view that there can be no fair, just and lasting
settlement in the Yukon unless it is done in such a way that it
results in one government administering to the needs of both
the Indian and non-Indian people. This is essential for the sake
of efficiency, but even more importantly it is essential to
ensure that the two groups will be working together rather
than separately. The old method of establishing reserves and
Indian governments under the Indian Act has proven unworkable. It breeds separatism, antagonism and conflict rather than
unity, brotherhood and understanding.
I would be remiss in not making certain comments at this
time about the role of the territorial government in settling
land claims in the Yukon. The Yukon territorial government is
involved in land claims to the extent that it is represented at
the bargaining table and is allowed to present its views. The
challenge facing the territorial government and its elected
representatives is to realize that when a land claims settlement
is made the governmental structures in the Yukon Territory,
as they know them today, will no longer exist. When the
elected representatives and territorial public servants clearly
understand this-and I do not believe they fully understand at
this time-they will have taken the first major step in settling
the land claims.
The next step which must be taken by the Yukon territorial
government is to recommend at the bargaining table alternate
forms of government which will accommodate both groups in a
partnership arrangement. In the meantime, however, I suggest
the Yukon territorial government must make firm commitments to the Indian people to resolve some of the day-to-day
problems which presently exist in the Indian communities.

80003-2/2

This will play a dual role. First, many of the day-to-day
problems of Indian people will be resolved prior to a land
claims settlement-which may take some time-and, secondly,
it will show the Indian people in a positive way that the
Territorial Council, the members of which are all non-Indian,
is prepared to deal with the Indian people in a responsible way
and to attempt to work out a partnership arrangement with
them. Unless this is done, there will be little trust and sympathy for a one-government system after land claims are settled.
Indeed, there will be little chance for a settlement of any kind.
The Indian people should be congratulated for their efforts
over the past seven or eight years. Only seven years ago there
were no Indian organizations in the Yukon, not even at the
band level in the communities. In this short period of time they
have organized themselves, elected leaders, taken over some
programs in their villages from the Department of Indian
Affairs and Northern Development, and prepared a position
for settling their land claims in the Yukon and presented it to
the Prime Minister. They have developed a network in the
communities for the purpose of exchanging information about
land claims negotiations, and they have commenced negotiations with the federal government to settle their outstanding
claims.
Another significant initiative of Indian people in the Yukon
Territory was their insistence that their land claim is an
ancestral claim which involves both status and non-status
Indians, and they have insisted on negotiating on that basis.
This is contrary to the wishes of the National Indian Brotherhood, but over the years it has gained favour and support from
several other Indian organizations, and it would appear that
one day status and non-status Indian people will again be
united. The Yukon Indian people can proudly take the credit
for instigating that move.
As I have taken this opportunity to provide free advice to
the territorial government, I would be remiss in not also
making suggestions to the leaders of the Indian people. The
Council for Yukon Indians must realize that the success of
their land claims negotiations depends to a considerable degree
on the support given to the proposed settlement by the general
public in the Yukon Territory, and in Canada as a whole. In
the last six months I have noticed a decrease in the support for
the Council for Yukon Indians primarily because of the delays
in arriving at an agreement in principle. This concerns me.
I would suggest that the Council for Yukon Indians not only
be prepared to negotiate, and negotiate diligently toward a
settlement, but also be seen to be doing this by advising the
public on a regular basis about their activities, the cause of
some of their problems, and by giving assurance that they are
sincere about coming to a settlement in the very near future.
This kind of information and assurance will go a long way to
regaining the support which, I feel, has been lost in the last
few months.
As senators, we will, I hope, in the very near future be
debating a bill to change the Yukon Act and the Territorial
Lands Act in order to incorporate into this legislation a

SENATE DEBATES
settlement of land claims with the Indian people of the Yukon
Territory.
The second issue in the Yukon which has gained importance
in the past few years, and which requires consideration in this
chamber, is the question of whether or not the Yukon Territory should be given the status of Canada's eleventh province. At
the outset, let me say that I am absolutely and totally in favour
of the Yukon people having the right to make their own
decisions about those matters which affect them directly. This
is not the case now in many areas, and I personally will
support any initiative to change the Yukon Act to allow more
responsibility to the local government. However, I am not
prepared to endorse provincehood for the Yukon without first
knowing what kind of financial arrangements can be worked
out with the Government of Canada and without a great deal
of discussion and debate about the probable results of
independence.
* (1440)

We have had the honourable leader of the official opposition
in the other place come to the Yukon recently and promise
provincehood within the first term after he is elected as leader
of this country. He attached no conditions or provisos to that
statement. In my opinion, provincehood at this time could
prove disastrous for the Yukon. In fact, funding for services
now provided by the Government of Canada through the
territorial government could be drastically cut because of a
lack of resource revenue.
I would be extremely unhappy to see the people of the
Yukon forced to sell the priceless resources of that vast area to
the highest bidder, allowing the area to be raped and pillaged
in order to sustain a standard of living which Yukoners have
become accustomed to through the stability and funding provided by the federal government.
The Yukon consists of an area equal to the combined size of
all four Atlantic provinces, with a population of only 22,000,
which is approximately 8,000 fewer than the City of Prince
Albert, Saskatchewan. Of this number, some 5,000 or 6,000
are natives; approximately 5,500 are under 18 years of age,
and of the remaining 11,000 a large percentage have resided in
the Yukon for less than five years.
A provincial legislature, to bc effective, would require a
minimum of 25 to 30 members. In the last territorial election,
held in 1974, a total of 6,145 people voted. It is possible that
Yukoners would be electing members of a legislature with only
75 votes and, indeed, a cabinet of 10 ministers could theoretically be formed with only 700 or 800 votes having been cast in
their favour. This, in effect, would mean that any influential
pressure group, such as the mining industry, labour or conservationists, could, with a minimum of effort and organization,
control the province. As long as they have satisfied some 700
or 800 people, they could theoretically gain control and govern
the Yukon to the detriment of all other Yukoners and, indeed,
all other Canadians.
There would, without the proper planning and foresight, be
a very difficult transitional period, and possibly an economical-

October 13, 1976

ly depressed situation in the Yukon for a number of years. It
would be during this time that entrepreneurs and foreign
speculators would be able to move into the Yukon in abundance and, with their huge bankrolls, literally buy the entire
area. When a mere 22,000 people, a large proportion of whom
are transients by nature, find that their educational system
cannot be supported, that the welfare system cannot be supported, that roads cannot be maintained, and that the recreations facilities in many areas cannot be serviced or maintained,
then I predict they would be prepared to make financial
arrangements which, in the long run, would not be beneficial
to the Yukon or to Canada as a whole.
Are we prepared for provincial status before there exists a
permanent population, committed to the future of the Yukon
and willing and able to become involved in the democratic
process? 1, for one, am not.
Another question which must be answered before provincial
status can become a reality concerns the role of Indian people
in the Yukon. Provincial status is not a question of "if"'; it is
only a question of when.
I would suggest to the honourable leader of the official
opposition in the other place that there are many questions to
be answered before the Yukon can become a province "during
his first term of office." My only reassurance is that his "first
term of office" is likely so far away that the Yukon will have
time to properly plan for provincehood.
The third matter about which I wish to speak today is the
much publicized natural gas pipeline which is proposed from
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska through the Yukon Territory and into
Alberta for delivery of gas to the lower 48 states. Let there be
no misunderstanding: this is an American line for the delivery
of American gas to Americans. It will not be used to move gas
from the Mackenzie Delta and the Beaufort Sea to Canadian
markets.
We have always welcomed development in the past and will
continue to do so. However, future development must fit into
our social, political and economic environments. It must also
provide some real benefit to Yukoners. We recognize that the
heavily populated areas of our continent require some of the
vast energy supplies of the north. Pipelines have been a part of
Yukon history and a familiar component in our daily lives. We
have experienced satisfactory developments in the past, and
have services which could be expanded to accommodate new
development in the future. However, if pipelines are to be built
across our territory, appropriate safeguards rnust be maintained and we must reap a fair share of the benefits. The
Yukon is an economic and political reality and must be treated
as such.
I have stated publicly before, and wish to reiterate now, that
unless there is a direct and substantial benefit to the Yukon
people, we do not want to see a pipeline built across the
Yukon, and i suggest to you that unless there is a direct and
lasting benefit to the people of Canada, the Government of
Canada should not entertain allowing its land, services and
resources to be used in this manner.

I have yet to see any facts or figures which convince me that
there will be benefits for Canadians in this entire matter. That
is not to say I cannot be convinced. I am simply saying that at
this time no one has brought forward the facts to do so.
Like everyone else in this great country of ours, we have a
few problems in the Yukon. However, it is probably one of the
most interesting and exciting places in Canada to call home.
While we have a wealth of natural resources, the greatest
resource of the Yukon will always be its people.

years but, with your assistance and your indulgence, I propose

[English]

Hon. Augustus Irvine Barrow: Honourable senators, in
rising to support the motion for an Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, it is with a sense of pride and, at the
same time, humility, that I do so. First, I should like to
congratulate Senator Lucier on his excellent maiden speech,
and on his territory's colourful flag and pin.
If I may reflect on a personal note, slightly over two years
ago I entered this chamber, a rather awestruck freshman not
knowing quite what to expect and still hearing admonitions
from some of my provincial confreres that I would not find the
challenge that exists in other fields. How wrong they were. I
discovered, contrary to widely held opinion, that I was not one
of the youngsters, except as a novice-instead, I was a middleman-and that here was a group from various walks of life
who brought to the parliamentary process a depth of knowledge, experience, understanding and feeling for the problems
of this country that is unsurpassed.
Also, I have learned that there is a sad lack of understanding of the role intended for and being played by the Senate in
our parliamentary process by those who should be better
informed, as well as by the general public. To whom this
deficiency might be attributed is a moot point. To correct this
the direction to be taken must be that of proper publicity in
order to heighten the awareness of the public of the work of
the Senate and its committees.

•

(1450)

Having participated in the work of this chamber during the
past session, I look forward to this new session of Parliament
and to making a further contribution during the months ahead.
As part of this parliamentary process, we have heard the
Speech from the Throne-Her Majesty's government's outline
of existing conditions and the measures which it feels are in
the interests of all Canadians and which it proposes to implement during the coming months. In proposing these measures
the government is not laying down hard and fast rules but,
rather, setting out the guidelines which it believes are necessary in these troubled times.
One has but to look at what has happened and is happening
to the economy of some of the great countries in Europe and

other parts of the world to wonder if any sensible pattern will
develop upon which the peaceful economic stability of the
world as we know it will survive. What one sees is not very
encouraging, nor is it any great satisfaction to know that most
of the problems are man-made, and can be solved by man.
This will require more than a little tolerance and understanding, and of many it will require some sacrifice.
In Canada today we have problems of all kinds and it is not
my intention to minimize them. There are, however, two or
three that I would like to comment upon.
First, I would comment on the economy of the country in
general. There is a strong condemnation of the government's
anti-inflation program by organized labour and that part of
business represented by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
Indeed, some of our more outspoken business and union leaders have been more than just vocal in their opposition. Both,
however, want the government to do the same thing, but
apparently for different reasons. The program may be unpopular with some, considered to be bad medicine by others, and
not managed according to the expertise of the "second guessers", but we should look at the effect on the people it was
intended to protect, the general public. If we ask ourselves
what could have happened, and what are the good effects of
this program, perhaps we will find we are not that badly off,
and that prices have been contained to a much greater degree
than otherwise would have been possible. We should be asking
ourselves why it is we have so many strikes and, at the same
time, find ourselves being told there are many able-bodied
people willing to work but unable to find it.
The government was not stampeded into the anti-inflation
program, so let it not be scared into dropping it until there are
adequate safeguards or reliable assurances that we will not be
faced with a scramble to increase salaries, wages, profits and
prices that will result in such economic chaos that even the
most vocal of the abolitionists will wish they had used tolerance and understanding instead of seeking ways to upset
further the delicate economic balance of this country.
Secondly, government has to realize this country was built,
however imperfectly, on our so-called free enterprise system,
and, except for times of emergency should restrict its role to
that of formulating fiscal and monetary policies instead of
competing with or replacing private business. Therefore, I am
pleased to see that the Speech from the Throne sets out
measures to be adopted to encourage financing for small
business and reduce the amount of red tape now required by
government from all businesses. Both people and businesses
have to stop asking governments to do more and more, the
inevitable result of which is high or higher taxation. We must
encourage governments at all levels to effect a reduction in
rates of taxation by putting a stop to the syndrome of the
spiralling upward of spending which can only lead to higher
taxation and further feed the fires of inflation.
The third topic I would like to touch upon is that of
bilingualism. Whether we like it or not it is with us, and is
something that has to be solved through an understanding of
both the problems and the possible solutions, and a display of

SENATE DEBATES
statesmanship by those in high positions. We cannot let this be
a divisive force in this great country of ours; rather, we must
use it to make us stronger, and proud of the heritage we have
been given. In some parts of our country it calls for greater
understanding and forbearance, and in all parts for a willingness to try to meet the problem instead of adopting the
unbending stance of those whose short-term parochial concerns are intended to insulate themselves from the rest of the
country.
To me the most obvious and logical approach to finding a
satisfactory solution is to adopt a program which will concentrate our efforts on Canada's youth, beginning at the elementary school level. Most parents that I know have a keen desire
for their children to be able to speak more than one language.
They want their children to be given the opportunity, denied to
themselves at a similar age, to become totally immersed in
both languages from Grade 1. I would therefore suggest that
the federal government should, by whatever means possible,
seek cooperation from every province in concentrating their
efforts on our young so that, a few years down the road, this
country will be on its way to being truly bilingual. It is a great
satisfaction to see the change of course advocated in the
Speech from the Throne.
I would now like to comment on three or four major
problems confronting the maritime region, and Nova Scota in
particular. These problems, if left unresolved, can only result
in a further widening of the economic gap which exists between Atlantic Canada and other parts of the country. For
fear of being accused of being unduly apprehensive, i would
quickly add that if these problems are solved, and advantage
taken of our many opportunities, then tremendous progress
will be made in overcoming, if not eliminating, those economic
disparities which have plagued us for so many years.
The number one problem facing Nova Scotia today is the
extremely high cost of electrical energy. Next to Prince
Edward Island, we have at this time the highest power rates in
the country, and, in addition, the Nova Scotia Power Corporation has an application before the province's Board of Public
Utilities for a further substantial increase in its electric power
rates.
The reason why Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island find
themselves in such an unenviable position in respect to high
power rates is their almost complete dependence on imported
oil for the generating of electricity. They just do not have the
vast hydro resources of most of their sister provinces, and
therefore must rely on fossil fuels to fire their thermal generating plants. Nova Scotia is 65 per cent dependent on oil to
generate electricity, with the balance of its power coming from
coal and a small amount of hydro.
From an historical point of view, former provincial governments and public utilities faced with the then high cost of coal
and the lack of hydro power, opted to use oil as the primary
fuel to generate electricity. Consequently, a number of thermal
plants were converted from coal to oil burning capability. This
was perhaps a wise decision at the time because the oil-produc-

October 13, 1976

ing nations of the Middle East and Venezuela were, by today's
prices, practically giving away their petroleum.
However, as we are all well aware, following the armed
conflict in the Middle East in 1973 the OPEC nations entered
into a price-fixing arrangement that has resulted in more than
a 500 per cent increase in the price of oil. Oil which cost $1.75
per barrel then costs in excess of $13 a barrel delivered today.
The overall effect of this on Nova Scotia, its people and its
economy, is, to say the least, devastating.
The Nova Scotia Power Corporation requires in the order of
10 million barrels of oil a year to generate the electricity
needed by our people and industry. In these circumstances the
only possible way for the corporation to keep operating is to
pass the additional cost of buying that oil to the consumer in
the form of higher prices.
In the meantime, the province must embark, and has in fact
embarked, on a program of energy conservation and efficiency
as well as the development of alternate power sources, so as to
enable Nova Scotia substantially to reduce its dependency on
expensive foreign oil. But this takes time.
The most immediate alternate source of energy is coal, of
which the province has a good supply. The Nova Scotia Power
Corporation is building two new coal-fired thermal plants in
Cape Breton, the first of which will be in operation late in
1979 and the second in 1981. Two others are possible by
mid-1984. A total saving of approximately 8 million barrels of
imported foreign oil is possible by the time the last two are in
operation.
* (1500)

Two long-range schemes are potentially exciting and would
certainly do much to change the province's dependency on
fossil-based fuel. The first is the much talked about Fundy
tidal power, and the second is the construction of a power grid
in eastern Canada from which could be tapped surplus power
from Labrador, Quebec and New Brunswick when it becomes
available.
From the foregoing I think it can be seen that Nova Scotia
has a unique and terrifying energy problem, and that it is
trying, by whatever means at its disposal, to cope with what
can only be considered an unforeseen disaster of gigantic
proportions. However, at best it will be some years before the
province can realistically gain any significant advantage from
its medium to long term power options.
I should point out that further heavy increases in power
rates will inevitably force some industries out of business,
because they will not be able to absorb the costs and remain
competitive, let alone survive. The resulting increased unemployment would only compound the socio-economic problems
faced by Nova Scotia at the present time. Many Nova Scotian
homeowners, particularly those on fixed and low incomes, are
already finding it difficult, if not impossible, to cope with the
present high rates. Imagine the agonizing effect that further
rate increases will have.
In this context, I suggest to my fellow senators that the
request of the Government of Nova Scotia for assistance from

Ottawa in the form of a five-year subsidy is in no way
unreasonable. The province needs that interim assistance to
help cushion the crippling power rate increases that face
householders and businesses alike.
I would now like to turn to what might be called a "problem
opportunity" situation in Nova Scotia which, if solved and
developed, would have a phenomenal effect on the maritime
economy and, indeed, be good for the rest of Canada. I refer to
the proposed Canstel project for industrial Cape Breton. In
order to speak intelligently about Canstel I must, first of all,
mention briefly the situation at Sydney Steel, or Sysco, as it is
known.
The Sydney steel plant was formerly owned and operated by
British interests, Hawker Siddeley, who in the late 1960s,
because of heavy financial losses, decided to walk away from
the operation. Dosco, as it was then known, was the cornerstone of industrial Cape Breton, and employed directly some
3,000-plus people. In view of this the provincial government of
the day under Premier, now Senator, G. I. Smith, moved in
and took over the operation of the plant. Thus Sydney Steel
became a provincial crown corporation.
In spite of the aged condition of the plant, record production
was at first obtained over that which its former owners had
been able to achieve. However, the cold hard fact of the matter
was that the plant was very old and barely hanging together. If
the operation was to continue, then an extensive and costly
rehabilitation program would have had to be undertaken. In
addition, an expansion program was desirable in order to give
the plant some long-term viability, and perhaps some diversity
in terms of product, in view of the fact that its chief claim to
fame was the excellent rails it produced for Canada and other
countries around the world.
Feasibility studies were carried out by some of the foremost
steel consultants in the world, and it was concluded that if
Sydney was to retain a long-term viable steel industry the
answer lay, not in patching up an old orphan plant, but in
constructing a major new steel complex capable of world
production levels, along with the capacity to expand.
Another very convincing factor in the decision was the fact
that no major steel interest would invest five cents in the old
plant, but considerable interest was shown in becoming
involved in a major new steel effort located at tide-water.
Coupled with this was the fact that Nova Scotia, with its
limited resources, could in no way come up with the hundreds
of millions of dollars required to do justice to the old plant.
Consequently, a consortium of steel companies, including
Dofasco, an American company, and two of the largest European steel producers, as well as the Province of Nova Scotia,
through its crown-owned agency Canstel, was put together.
mainly through the efforts of Premier Regan. This consortium
is presently looking into all aspects of establishing a new steel
complex in Cape Breton, and just a few days ago completed
another round of talks in Hamilton, Ontario.
The prospects for a world-scale steel operation in Sydney
appear to be excellent. Cape Breton is probably one of the

best, if not the best, site for a major new steel plant in the
world at this time. I say this because there is a ready supply of
metallurgical coal, good availability of iron ore, generations of
steel-making capability found in the Sysco work force, a deep
tide-water harbour, as well as an existing social infrastructure.
The foregoing, coupled with the fact that the partners must
find additional steel-making facilities to meet future needs,
whether this be achieved at home or by investing abroad in a
complex such as Canstel, all adds to the desirability of the
Cape Breton project. However, in order for this project to get
off the ground, it is necessary for the Government of Canada
to become involved, and its support and cooperation are vital
to Canstel's success.
Having said that, I would point out that when Canstel does
start, the resulting impact from the plant itself, plus all of the
spin-off activity that will be generated, will, without question,
turn around the economy of Cape Breton, if not indeed the
entire province.
In addition to curing Cape Breton's long-standing economic
and unemployment ills, Canstel would also reflect very favourably in terms of its effect on Canada's balance of payments
figures. A good portion of its steel products would be earmarked for international export, thus earning valuable export
dollars for Canada.
Turning to yet another area of concern for Nova Scotia, I
would point out that successive governments have long recognized the need to reduce regional economic disparity, and
have, through legislative and other action, shown the important role that transportation plays in reducing such disparity.
The Maritime Freight Rates Act and the Atlantic Region
Freight Assistance Act are two legislative examples of how the
federal government has attempted to respond to the continuing
problem.
Unfortunately, transportation problems of the Atlantic
region have not been resolved, and are as evident today as they
were 50 years ago. Our principal problem continues to be one
of distance from and access to our principal markets. We are
remote from the large central Canadian market by a considerable distance, which discriminates against us in competing
with manufacturers closer to the population centres in Quebec
and Ontario. Not only does this result in higher transportation
freight rates, but it discriminates against us in that we are
unable to provide adequate service levels from the viewpoint of
both supply and customer contact.
Central Canadian manufacturers are most often able to ship
directly from their plants to their customers, while Atlantic
region manufacturers must incur not only higher transportation costs but added distribution costs in that they must
frequently warehouse in the central Canadian market in order
to provide adequate service.
The two major ports of the Atlantic region, Halifax and
Saint John, have in recent years a remarkable success story in
serving as a Canadian gateway for import and export traffic.
There is no question that these ports play a significant role in
contributing to the National economy, at least equal to the St.

SENATE DEBATES
Lawrence Seaway, and they should be given strong federal
support for their ambitious growth plans. The recently
announced new federal ports policy, which provides more
autonomy to these ports, is a move in the right direction,
provided recognition is given to the significant national economic role they play.
The success of these two ports is a somewhat mixed blessing
to Atlantic region producers. While it enables Atlantic producers to obtain steamship service to many countries on a
frequent basis, it does not give them an ocean freight advantage, which should be their right owing to their geographical
location closer to the European market. The steamship ocean
conferences have established a freight rate structure whereby
ocean freight rates from a port such as Montreal are at exactly
the same level as they are from Halifax and Saint John. Not
only are we more remote from the central Canadian market,
but we enjoy no cost advantage in dealing with most overseas
markets.
Marine transportation in the coasting trade has long been an
important element in maintaining Atlantic region transportation costs at a reasonable level. Competitive freight rates for
such important industries as steel have been maintained
through the availability of Commonwealth ships. Proposed
amendments to the Canada Shipping Act, which would restrict
the Atlantic region coasting trade to Canadian ships, represent
a real threat to the viability of certain industries and would
undoubtedly resuit in increased transportation costs to a region
which can ill afford them.

October 13, 1976

While the Atlantic region has come a long way, the transportation problem of distance to our principal markets is still
very much with us and, as recognized by previous governments, is and should continue to be one of national concern.
Another vital issue to the Atlantic provinces is the 200-mile
offshore limit in relation to fisheries, a resource that plays an
important role in the overall economy of Nova Scotia. I am
sure aIl Nova Scotians, and indeed aIl Canadians, were
delighted with the announcement by the Honourable Allan J.
MacEachen last June of the federal government's decision to
extend the fisheries jurisdiction of Canada out to the 200-mile
limit from the coast, effective January 1, 1977. It was certainly gratifying to hear reference to this in the Throne Speech.
While this action was and is welcomed by our fishing industry,
it does not come any too soon. Fish stocks have been and are
being depleted to such an extent that before very much longer
the commercial significance of the resource will be questionable at best, and many fishermen in the Atlantic provinces
were beginning to feel as endangered a species as the fish they
so ardently pursue.

With proper conservation and management measures in
force, the Atlantic region of Canada can once again become
the fishing resource that will see ail our processing plants
working to capacity and, at the same time, ensure that our
people obtain optimum benefits from the sea resources off our
coast.

Bilateral agreements with such fishing powers as Norway,
Poland, the U.S.S.R., Spain, Portugal and Japan by Canada
must provide for the effective protection and rebuilding of our

comments do not refer only to the private sector. Strikes
within the public sector are in many instances even more
damaging, especially when they involve the disruption of federai or provincial services and programs designed to serve the
needs, or protect the rights, of citizens as a whole. I can tell
you most emphatically that the public's level of tolerance for
strikes in both the private and public sector has about reached
the breaking point.
In conclusion, I would point out again that Nova Scotia has
problems for which we need assistance now, but, more importantly, Nova Scotia has many exciting potentials and opportunities, as does the maritime region as a whole. If these are

indicative of the determined resolution of Her Majesty's government to orchestrate, in those areas for which it is responsible, the many facets of our business and personal life for the
benefit of all Canadians. For this reason it is a pleasure for me
to second the motion of my colleague, Senator Lucier, for an

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
ADJOURNMENT

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I move, with leave
of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(g), that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Tuesday
next, October 19, at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Honourable senators, before the question is put I would like
to state that next week we will continue with the debate on the
motion for the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne
at the opening of this session.
On Tuesday Senator Everett will table a copy of the report
prepared last session by the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on the estimates of the Manpower Division
of the Department of Manpower and Immigration. This report
was published and distributed during the summer adjournment, pursuant to the authorization of the Senate of June 16
last. Senator Everett will, with leave of the Senate, give notice
that on Wednesday, October 20, he will call the attention of
the Senate to this report.
Motion agreed to.
THE SENATE
ATTENDANCE OF CONSERVATIVE SENATORS

Senator Greene: Honourable senators, I wonder if the
Leader of the Government could inform the house as to
whether the Conservative senators are away in such great
numbers because they are marching with Joe Morris, or

whether they are just away because of the traditional delinquency of their party.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I am sure there is
no question at all as to the dedication to work of the members
of the opposition in this chamber.
Senator Macdonald: We are on the side of the labouring
man.
Senator Flynn: I was wondering if the Leader of the Government could make a calculation to determine whether the
proportion of absentees on our side is higher than that on his
side.
An Hon. Senator: It is just more noticeable.
Senator Argue: We might as well drop it right there.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His
Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Senator Lucier, seconded by
Senator Barrow, for an Address in reply thereto.
[Translation]

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, Senator Greene
said precisely what I intended to say, that is, that the absentees
on this side know what to expect, contrary to those who sit on
the other side. But the long applause I have just been given
moves me deeply. Still, I don't know whether it is cause for
comfort or worry. My task is singularly onerous in this debate
on the reply to the Speech from the Throne. As I say, my task
this afternoon is to speak to you, and yours to listen to me. I
wonder which of the two is the more thankless. Yours more
probably, but I trust you will not finish it before I finish mine.
When I resume my seat, there will be the usual awakening..
Some will feel stronger, others more rested.
First of all, I wish, on behalf of the official opposition, to
extend my respects to Their Excellencies the Governor General
and Madam Léger. All of us were happy to see that the
Governor General's health has improved considerably.
We saw and heard, with admiration, Her Excellency
Madam Léger read a major part of the Speech from the
Throne. The courage and determination of Their Excellencies
moved us deeply. We wish His Excellency the Governor
General a complete recovery, and Her Excellency continued
good health, that they may continue to discharge their heavy
responsibilities.
Secondly, I wish to extend to Madam Speaker of the Senate
the compliments of the opposition. Her initial nervousness-I
was about to say her occasional anxiety-is gradually giving
way to assurance which alters in no way her very personal
charm.
Above all, I wish to mention to her that she is an outstanding ambassador for the Senate. I was personally able to notice
that, wherever she goes, she leaves the best of impressions. I

present anti-inflation program.

October 14,1976

SENATE DEBATES

The benefits of that program are uncertain as yet, but the
costs have become quite clear. The government bas done
serious damage to business investment and productivity by its
extended controls program. The fact that profit and wage
restraints might last at least another two years has had a
debilitating effect upon business and consumer confidence.
And there was nothing in the Throne Speech to indicate an
early end to this troublesome program.
Already profit controls have fostered business cost inefficiency, discouraged productivity, and deferred investment. The
longer the controls stay in place, the more serious will be the
economic damage. Long-term profit controls will achieve a
purpose exactly the opposite to the original strategy against
inflation of the present administration.
It will be recalled that John Turner argued that inflation
could be reduced by encouraging investment to increase the
productive output of the economy. Mr. Macdonald has put in
place a policy which will discourage investment, a complete
reversal from previous policies. No wonder business confidence
is weak when the strategy of government so often reverses
itself.
The anti-inflation program has changed substantially from
what was envisaged at its inception. Instead of being a small
tightly knit group regulating a few critical areas of the economy, the Anti-Inflation Board has mutated into a bureaucracy
larger than many federal departments, involving itself in
nearly every area of economic activity.
The most terrible description of the government's performance in the areas of growth, unemployment and trade deficit is
that it is the equal of its performance to date in the anti-inflation program.
The government, it appears, continues to hope that the
principal stimulus to growth in the economy will come from
recovery in Canadian export markets. It is legitimate to hope
for the recovery of the export sector, but surely it is not
advisable for any administration to base its economic policies
on happenings in foreign economies. Yet, that is what we are
doing. Where is the sense of purpose and direction in that?
The Throne Speech made much of the new-found desire of
this government to help people find jobs. Parliament is to be
asked to approve a "comprehensive, year-round, job-creation
program."
a

(1420)

Will wonders never cease? A year-round winter works program! Will this government never learn from its past disasters?
It is simply not capable of creating jobs. That is mainly or
should be mainly the role of the private sector. When government interferes it ends up wasting the taxpayers' money on
projects that have very little merit, except to help the government's shaky image by reducing the number of people collecting unemployment insurance.
With a 5 per cent real growth target for this year-and
nothing in the Throne Speech indicates that that has
changed-we are virtually guaranteed that unemployment will
continue to increase.

The cornerstone of federal economic policies is said to be
restraint in wage demands, in price setting, in profits and in
economic growth. All this was again referred to in the Throne
Speech, and the authors of that pool of platitudes and blanket
of blandness again assured us that the government "will
continue to practice fiscal restraint." I ask you, honourable
senators, how can you continue something you never even
started?
This government has the gall to preach restraint; it bas the
gall to let on that it has been practising restraint; it has the
gall to limit wage increases to 12 per cent, profit margins to 85
per cent of previous levels and dividends to 8 per cent. Yet,
while the provinces restrain their spending to an average Il
per cent increase, the federal government increases its own
spending by 16 per cent. How is that for good example! How
can anyone have faith in an administration that does not
practise what it preaches? It is either hypocrisy, duplicity or
sheer incompetence!
The unfortunate truth of the matter is that it is this government's sad and sorry record, devoid of any semblance of
self-restraint, which has brought us to where we are and which
now promises to inflict new hardship on those Canadians least
able to bear it.
In examining the government's self-restraint program, one
can only start from a position of profound skepticism. Since
Mr. Trudeau became Prime Minister, federal spending bas
risen by more than 300 per cent-from less than $10 billion in
1968 to a projected $42.2 billion for this fiscal year. Indeed, it
has more than doubled during the last three years alone. And
all the while we have had the same litany of solemn promises
and undertakings by the government to hold its own demands
upon the economy in check.

because I have had the pleasure of having had an excellent

because I had the pleasure of being a member of a Senate
delegation to the Soviet Union in 1970, and on that occasion
we were so well entertained that we will never forget it.

SENATE DEBATES
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from earlier this day consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening
of the Session, and the motion of Senator Lucier, seconded by
Senator Barrow, for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, coming back
now to less pleasant thingsSenator Bourget: You did not have to add that.
Senator Flynn: There has to be a transition.
I was mentioning the attitude of the government and its
policy of restraining its own expenses, and I had said that all
the while we have had the same litany of solemn promises and
undertakings by the government to hold its own demands upon
the economy in check.
We have further reason to doubt this government's sincerity,
especially when we consider the kind of spending reductions
they have promised in the past. The magic figure in the last
budget was $1.5 billion. That is the amount, it was claimed,
that was being lopped off spending plans for this year. However, when one looked closely at the figures provided by the
Treasury Board it became abundantly clear that these were
not spending cuts at all, but simply reductions in the amounts
of money which government departments asked for during the
normal preparatory discussions for any set of spending estimates. The figure for real reductions-and even this was
suspect-was less than $450 million out of a total budget of
more than $30 billion.
The fact of the matter seems to be that goveriment spending on a national accounts basis will increase by at least $5
billion this year to a record high of, as I said before, well in
excess of $42 billion. The Auditor General of Canada is never
done criticizing government spending control practices, and
saying that this government, when it comes to financial management and control systems, is a complete washout.
So much for the government's record and its credibility in
preaching self-restraint.
Frankly, and frighteningly, the outlook for the economy is
not improving despite the hardships experienced by Canadians
in recent years. Federal policies will continue to yield slow
growth, high unemployment, persistent inflation and a dangerous trade deficit. But little else can be expected from an
administration that leaves leadership in restraint to the provinces, and leadership in growth to foreign countries. They do
not lead; they do not govern; they just hang on to power for all
they're worth, and that's not much.
Senator Buckwold: It seems to me they have been pretty
successful.
Senator Flynn: Oh, there is no doubt that over the years the
Liberal Party has been able to maintain itself in power four
times longer, I would say, than any other party, but, of course,
that is why we are in such a bad state today.
Senator Greene: The Tories are always in a bad state.

October 14, 1976

Senator Flynn: I must say that I have not heard from
Senator Greene since the beginning of my speech. If he wishes
to intervene I should like to hear what he has to say, if, for
once, it has some merit.
Senator Greene: Don't hold your breath!
Senator Flynn: What we saw in the Throne Speech, honourable senators, was a bunch of guys eating crow. We learned
that the government "is determined to preserve and enhance
Canada's traditional policy of reliance on individual enterprise
as the mainspring of economic activity."
Oh, the changes that can be wrought by a few Gallup polls!
Marvel at the very humbling reversals in philosophy! Galbraith
is no longer the Prime Minister's guru; he no longer "permeates" the Prime Minister's thinking.
Remember last Christmas? The Prime Minister was convinced then that large sections of the economy-big business
and big unions-had escaped the law of supply and demand
and were no longer subject to the discipline of the market. He
said, "We haven't been able to make even a modified free
market system work in Canada." That is what he told Canadians then. He denied that government intervention had been
excessive and asserted that it was the government's duty to
intervene when necessary to stimulate employment, to redistribute income, to control inflation and pollution, to protect
the consumer, to promote conservation and productivity and to
assure an adequate supply of the things we need.
* (1430)

Mr. Trudeau's view of last December was referred to as
"extreme" in the Speech from the Throne. Well, I could have
told you that last December-in fact, I think I did a number of
times. The government now turns its back on the view that
government spending and intervention must increase to compensate for the failure of the market system to serve social
goals. The once-despised market system is now relied upon to
stimulate the growth Canada needs, and the government will
be looking, according to the Speech from the Throne, for "less
costly, less interventionist ways" to pursue its social objectives.
The Prime Minister is backing away from the "new-society"
gimmick. Hopefully, he has come to realize that one of the
reasons the economic system has not been working well in
recent years is that there has been too much government, not
too little; that government has led the way in taking more out
of the system than the system can afford. Mr. Trudeau should
never be allowed to get away with the argument that governments have only been responding to the public's demands.
For years, Liberal politicians, for their own selfish endsand that has been indicated by Senator Buckwold-the main
criterion being to remain in power, have been selling the need
for services and promising more programs. What was Mr.
Trudeau's just society, apart from being a fraud, but an
arousal of greater expectations?
The system which Mr. Trudeau derided last winter and has
rediscovered this fall has provided Canadians during the last
30 years with a period of growth and prosperity unsurpassed in
this country's history, and perhaps anywhere in the world.

October 14, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

And as I re-read this vague and innocuous Speech from the
Throne yesterday, certain questions arose in my mind, such as:
Why has the government only now come to the realization that
perhaps much of what it is involved in could be better done by
private enterprise?
Why has it only now come to the realization that the private
sector, especially small and medium-sized business, is the
backbone of our economy?
What sort of programs will provide more job opportunities,
and will these provide what the government calls "worthwhile
work," or will they provide the sort of "busy work" that
characterized the Opportunities for Youth Program and many
of the undertakings that have come under the Local Initiatives
Program?
The government plans to merge the UIC with the Department of Manpower and Immigration. Why were they ever
separated in the first place? And this, probably the most
secretive government in our history, is going to open up and
allow greater citizen access to information as to what the
government is doing and what it knows about its citizens! I will
have to see this to believe it.
And what, pray tell, is meant by, and I quote: " ... the
Government will place a very high priority upon ... the
achievement of formal constitutional independence"? It is all
so vague, all so uninspired. It is the program of an administration that is reeling from the pummelling it bas received at the
hands of public opinion polls.
The government does not know where it is going. It is
casting about looking in vain for public support from people
who are completely disenchanted. It is seeking to be all things
to all people, which is typical of a Liberal government, and is
making all sorts of compromises and humiliating "aboutfaces"-anything to regain popularity. What it so sadly does
not seem to realize is that the Canadian people have had
enough of this very attitude. Canadians are fed up with a
government that says: "We have a very clear-cut set of principles in which we firmly believe; but, if you do not like those,
we have plenty of others."
Surely this attitude must have influenced such men as Jean
Marchand, James Richardson, and John Turner in arriving at
their respective decisions to leave the cabinet. They saw the
mess, the confusion, and the intellectual dishonesty. And such
must also have been the case for the 26 other ministers who
have quit, been fired, or been defeated since Mr. Trudeau took
over leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968. I doubt that any
Prime Minister ever had a similar eight-year record.
There is obvious dissension and confusion in the government. There is manifest disenchantment with the Prime Minister, even among his own lieutenants. While they bicker
amongst themselves, we are left to flounder about in the
morass and chaos they have created for us.
Some government this is!

[Translation]
Before concluding, I would like to say a word about the
Senate. After sitting here for 14 years, I note that the Senate

23

has certainly gained in prestige. There is a lot of respect for
the Senate in several circles, but I would say even more for its
committees. The good work accomplished in our committees
undoubtedly improved the reputation of this house.
During the last session our committees did excellent work in
sometimes very complex and very difficult subjects. The chairmen of these various committees did not spare their efforts and
time and they certainly deserve the warmest congratulations
and the gratitude of all members of this house.
However, I deplore that the debates in the Senate itself are
not always as vigorous and objective as the deliberations of our
committees. That may be due to an overly great majority in
favour of the administration. It would undoubtedly be very
difficult for a great number of Liberal senators to boast about
the accomplishments of the government but they prefer to
abstain.
As to the opposition, it will continue to do much more
considerable work than the proportion of its representation
would warrant. However, I hope that the internal opposition in
the majority will continue to second the efforts of the opposition to keep the government on its toes. That internal opposition played a useful role in certain circumstances even if
sometimes it capitulated before promises or under pressure
from certain ministers.

[English]
I would like to see more government legislation initiated in
the Senate, allowing honourable senators first crack at it,
especially legislation of a specialized or technical nature, as we
have the expertise to deal with such matters. I think it is only
fair that we should give the other place greater opportunity to
plagiarize us.

•

(1440)

Now, about the last session: the length of it prompts me to
wonder whether the government intends to do away with the
practice of having one session every year. It is intimated in the
BNA Act-not said, but intimated-that we should have one
session per year.
Does the government no longer see the need for the yearly
interruption of the work of Parliament by way of a prorogation? Does the government no longer see the need of having a
Throne Speech every year? And is that because this government has made Throne Speeches generally quite meaningless
and not at all indicative, in practical terms, of what legislative
program will be submitted to Parliament? Does the government want long sessions so it can avoid having to introduce
anew controversial bills which meet with prolonged resistance
in the house? The government should let us know what its
intentions are in this respect. If the last session indicates a new
trend, then certain practical adjustments should be made in
the operations of both bouses and a relatively fixed calender
should be adopted.
Honourable senators, the official opposition stands ready, as
I said, to do more than its share of the work awaiting the
Senate in this session. It will do its best with the legislation
introduced, but it can in no way alter the main difficulty

SENATE DEBATES
facing Canada and Canadians, which is that we have a government that has lost all credibility. The government has lost its
credibility because it has totally mismanaged the economy. It
has lost it because it did not level with the Canadian people. It
was elected on a program of refusal to impose price and wage
controls, yet it imposed these very controls a year later and did
so in a manner far more rigid than that proposed by the
Progressive Conservative Party during the 1974 election. If
that election had turned out differently, we would have been
through with controls by now. The program would have been
ended at this time.
The "just society" became the "new society," and all that
seemed to guide either one was the whim of the Prime
Minister. First, he was permeated by Galbraith; now he is
back sounding for all the world like a member of the Junior
Chamber of Commerce. The Speech from the Throne suggested a transfer of responsibilities from the public sector to the
private sector, a suggestion that comes only a few months after
the Prime Minister was condemning the private sector and
proposing more government intervention and control.
I have one final word, and that is about bilingualism. In this
area the government succeeded in arousing the extremists of
both sides. Mr. Lang's abject capitulation to CALPA and
CATCA, in an effort to win at any price the settlement of an
illegal strike, was shameful. That incident became a major
issue, and is responsible for much of the present backlash in
areas where people are less exposed to all the complexities of
the problem.
Among the Anglophones, some extremists pointed to the
government's action and said, "You see? We were right; the
government agrees that bilingualism is impractical." The
Francophone extremists pointed to the government's action
and said, "You see? We were right; this government is not
really convinced of the need and value of bilingualism in the
public service."
Let's face it. The government fouled up this question as it
has so many others. Ineptitude, lack of fortitude-the weakness that fosters problems and delays their solution-that's
what this government is all about.
In the area of labour-management relations, the government
has lost the confidence of the unions, and it is difficult to
imagine how it can regain it. A storm of irresponsibility and
illegality blows in that sector today-today especially, though
I am happy to see that the demonstration in front of the
Parliament Buildings was less than a success. I hope our
friends of the NDP will see the handwriting on the wall.
Labour is fed up. There is no doubt of that. Business is fed
up. There is no doubt of that either. Hell, everybody is fed up
with this government. Even many of its own backbenchers are
fed up with it. It has even lost confidence in itself, as I have
indicated, and as is proven by so many resignations and
departures.
What this country needs is a new government, a government
which is strong where the present one is weak; one which is

October 14, 1976

strong in foresight and planning, strong in decision and
implementation, strong in courage and vision.
Senator Greene: Joe who?
Senator Flynn: Not Joe Greene. We need a government that
would be strong in the western provinces where, because of
geographical alienation, the aspirations of the people of
Quebec are so sorely misunderstood.
We need a new government, and the people of Canada are
going to give themselves one; but the problem is that they are
likely not to have the opportunity to do so for another two
years.
Our most sincere hope is that the present administration, in
those two years, will not so complicate the major issues, and so
muddy the waters, that solutions will have become almost
impossible to find by the time a Conservative government
comes to power.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I shall be happy to
entertain any questions by Senator Greene. He is my favourite
interlocutor, because I can more easily reply to him than to
anyone else; but I would hope that he would stay quiet for a
while, because I do not like to hurt him. Every time I exchange
ideas with Senator Greene, I come up with a blank.
Honourable senators, speeches are like babies: easy and
pleasant to conceive, but difficult as hell to deliver. But I do
not mind taking all this time, because i know that a political
speech pleases everyone. Those who agree lap it up; those who
do not are glad it is over.
It is over.
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senators, together
with the esteemed Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, I
join in the good wishes and expressions of appreciation that
have been extended to His Excellency the Governor General
and Madam Léger for their superb performance the other day.
We always appreciate their presence in our midst. We are
thankful for the diligence, ability and dedication which they
demonstrate in carrying out their important responsibilities.
We are proud of both of them.
As far as Senator Lucier is concerned, he made what all of
us considered to be a great speech on behalf of the Yukon
Territory. I listened with interest, as did other honourable
senators, to the historic background he gave us of that particular part of Canada. This territory has a great history, and it
has an even more magnificent future, and I hope that just as
soon as possible we can send a Senate committee into the
Yukon to discuss with the people Senator Lucier represents the
important problems and difficulties which he brought to our
attention.
We are also grateful to Senator Barrow for his constructive
contribution to the debate, and for his lucid development of a
number of ideas relevant to his important and historic province. The problems of the maritimes, and the province of
Newfoundland, are problems not only for the people who
reside in those provinces, but for all Canadians. When an

October 14, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

energy crisis afflicts the people of the maritime provinces, then
all Canadians, wherever they live, must be concerned.
We are, of course, honourable senators, well served by our
distinguished Speaker. She has led us through very productive
years, and we look forward to working with her again during
this session. We are also served superbly by the Senate officials and staff. I know that we all join in thanking them, as
well as those who work in the library, and other officials, for
their unfailing assistance to all of us, wherever we sit in the
bouse. We look forward to their continuing good work.

(1450)

I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his
non-partisan speech this afternoon. He admonished me, I
recall, for at times seeming to support the government with too
much vigour. I am happy that the message got through to him,
apparently, that I am supportive of the government's policies.
Certainly, the message got through to us this afternoon that
the Leader of the Opposition is indeed a Tory in the old blue
Tory tradition. That colour was well chosen by the Conservative Party.
Senator Flynn: Better than red, anyway.
Senator Perrault: I made no accusation that the Leader of
the Opposition was red-but he was very blue. We heard a
dreary and lugubrious litany of Tory pessimism enunciated by
the Leader of the Opposition. You see, one of the real keys to
Liberal retention of governmental responsibility in this country
is the fact that Canadians are inherently optimistic.
Senator Flynn: I would say they need to be.
Senator Perrault: For years our friends in the opposition
have told us all the things that are wrong about Canada, but
they seldom tell us what is right about this country. People like
to be told that there is a great future for Canada, because
Liberals believe that there is. I think that the opposition
leader's speech, his kind of presentation, may have been
intended as one of the opening guns this session in the opposition drive for governmental power in Canada.
Senator Flynn: You flatter me.
Senator Perrault: I am not saying anything about the
calibre of the gun. I am saying it may have been a gun.
Senator Greene: A lousy peashooter.
Senator Perrault: It could have been intended as anything
from a pop-gun to a cannon. However, it must make Canadians question again whether the governing of this great nation
could be entrusted to such an inveterate band of pessimists.
They are so gloomy; they are so negative. I do not think
Canadians share the myopia of the esteemed Leader of the
Opposition. The opposition seern to be concerned with picking
over the dry and arid bones of past political controversy; going
back into history and questioning what might have been
instead of what can be. I think that this is the time for
Canadians of all parties to look into the future, and see what
kind of future can be carved.

The honourable Leader of the Opposition made some worthwhile suggestions, which I fully support, however. One is that
efforts should be made to initiate more bills in this chamber. I
think that during the last session we had almost 40 measures
of one sort or another initiated in this chamber, and we made
numerous amendments to the various bills that came before us.
It was one of the more productive sessions in the history of the
Senate. I agree with him that there is an increasingly important role for the Senate to play, especially during sessions
featuring heavy legislative programs. The Senate can and
should initiate many more measures. I will certainly convey to
my colleagues in the government the support of the Leader of
the Opposition in that regard, and every effort will be made to
bring more proposed legislation to this chamber.
I believe, as well, that the Senate has an important role to
play in the next few years in the matter of strengthening
Canadian unity, understanding and reconciliation, and in the
next few days I hope to discuss with the Leader of the
Opposition how we may go about this task.
Few of us can be serene about the future of Canada, in view
of the stresses and strains that have been placed on Confederation over recent months. I think that feeling is shared by many
of us. I know it is easy to dismiss many of the attitudes in
relation to language and culture, for example, as prejudice and
bigotry. But so often people, wherever they live, with seemingly extreme and strange notions of what Canada is all about in
1976, those with narrow notions about language rights or
cultural rights, or the pros and cons of entrenching language
rights in the Constitution-questions of that kind-really
suffer from a lack of information and lack of understanding.
The worst possible thing for any of us to do is to dismiss them
as mindless bigots; I believe that we have an immense task of
education to perform.
I said this at the beginning of the last session, honourable
senators, and I say it again. I think the Senate should remind
itself of one of its great historical functions, which is to
represent regional interests of Canadians here at the heart of
government. Consideration should be given to a Senate committee on regional aspirations to meet Canadians in many of
the small towns and villages and other population centres in
the regions of Canada, and to prepare a report for the Canadian people and for our colleagues in Parliament-a report
relating to the hopes, aspirations and problems of the Canadian people. I believe that would be a contribution to solidifying
national unity, reconciliation and understanding. As I say, I
hope we can have some useful discussions on this point in the
next few days.
I come from a part of Canada where there are some
misunderstandings about the issue of language and culture,
but the remarkable thing is that young people in this country
with access to bilingual training are beginning to understand
what Canada is all about in 1976, that a nation with two
languages is something unique and very special, and that
bilingualism can be a very important treasure and gift. Many
of those, whether they live in Quebec or English-speaking
Canada, who say, "They are not going to ram English or

SENATE DEBATES
French down my throat" dare beyond redemption; most would
be unable to assimilate another language because of their
attitude. I believe the hope lies in the future generation. One of
the most welcome aspects of this Speech from the Throne is
the suggestion that the government, as part of the long-range
plan, is going to attempt to provide greater support for the
education of young people in the two languages of Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: Of course, in the short term we need
appropriate measures to enable Canadians, where numbers
warrant, to do business and speak to the federal government in
French or English anywhere in this country. I am pleased that
this kind of approach is outlined in the Speech from the
Throne.
I know that some critics will say, "Well, why didn't you
pursue different language policies originally?" The whole
"journey" involved in establishing working bilingualism in the
federal service has been an adventure and an experiment not
without difficulties, mistakes and hazards, and I am proud to
be part of a government able to say, "There is such a thing as
a second look", a government able to say, "We are willing to
make changes and to improve our policies."
Honourable senators, there are many subjects covered by
this Speech from the Throne, but much of the Speech hinges
on the subject of economics. Unless we have a prosperous
country, an economically viable nation, able to provide economic opportunities for our people, Canada's future cannot be
a good one. For this reason I should like to direct most of my
remarks this afternoon to the state of the economy and the
anti-inflation program.
As the Leader of the Opposition reported earlier, we had a
demonstration against the program in front of the Parliament
Buildings this afternoon. The anti-inflation program is just
about one year old. It may be worth while to recall the
conditions that existed twelve months ago, and why an offensive against inflation was thought by the government to be
necessary.
A year ago double digit inflation, something like eleven per
cent, was threatening the capabilities of the Canadian economy to grow and to create jobs for Canada's growing labour
force. You will recall the many meetings that took place in
1975. You will remember the earnest effort made by this
government, from coast to coast in Canada, to meet with
business, labour, management, the professions, agriculture, the
cooperatives and credit unions to discuss with them the problem of inflation. I can report to you that there was a unanimous view by them twelve months ago that important, effective and strong action must be taken to halt inflation, or we
risked Canada's economic future.
e (1500)

Senator Flynn: Well, it was the same thing two or three
years ago.
Senator Perrault: Business, labour and agriculture, all the
sectors of the economy, expressed this view in these consultations which took place between government and the various

October 14, 1976

sectors early in 1975. Some of you may have participated in
arranging those meetings, or even attending some of them. The
discussions were about the prospects of runaway inflation.
Urgent efforts were expended to bring about a system of
voluntary restraints. For a number of reasons, it was not
possible to achieve this program of voluntary restraints. However, one profound fact emerged, and that is that Canadians
everywhere agreed that inflation threatened the economy, their
personal well-being and Canada's competitive position in the
world. So the question was this: Who would provide leadership? Without voluntary restraints, the leadership, obviously,
had to come from the federal government. There were no other
volunteers to be first in the fight.
I remember a telephone call that I received from the Prime
Minister's office about one year ago. The message was, "You
had better eat your Thanksgiving dinner early, because we
have an important meeting of cabinet on Monday and there
are some disturbing economic facts which must be dealt with."
I know that our friends in opposition could say, "Well, that
Thanksgiving you Liberals ate crow instead of turkey," but the
fact is that when we sat down in Ottawa, Mr. Leader and
honourable senators, this was the essence of the situation: We
had virtually a zero increase in Canada's productivity; we had
an 11 per cent growth in inflation; and on the desk were wage
demands for one-year increases of 30 per cent, 40 per cent, 50
per cent, and up to 75 per cent. The message was clear to the
members of that cabinet, that despite possible political penalties, Gallup polls, or popularity, any government failing to act
in face of that kind of devastating information would be
culpable in history of criminal neglect.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Flynn: You should have said that to the electors in
1974. It means about the same thing.
Senator Perrault: Senator, may I remind you that Sinclair
Stevens, the economic critic for the Conservative Party in the
other place, made a statement in early 1975 in which he said
that the economic conditions which prevailed in 1974 were
totally inappropriate for the imposition of controls which were
proposed by the official opposition at that time. He went on to
say that the situation had changed in 1975. That was the
economic spokesman for the Conservative opposition in the
other place speaking.
Senator Flynn: He is not the only one.
Senator Perrault: He had a lucid grasp of the situation.
Senator Flynn: Well, I value my own opinion as much as his.
Senator Perrault: You have your own opinion, but the
economic expert which that party so assiduously recruited to
its ranks to provide them with economic guidance differs with
your economic views. Well, let me tell you this, that measured
in political terms a call for restraint is no way to improve a
party's position at the polls. Indeed, one great work entitled
Freedom, Welfare and Inflation by a great, small "" liberal
economist, said that the disconcerting fact before all governments determined to fight inflation is that they often win the

October 14, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

fight at the expense of political power, but these tough choices
must be made. I want to tell you that I am proud to be part of
a government willing to put its political future on the line in
the interests of making sure that Canada has a good, viable
economy.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: May I just mention to the Leader of the
Government that I belong to the political party that risked the
election in 1974 on that basis, and lost it? That is even
tougher.
Senator Perrault: That was not bravery; that was bravado.
Restraints do not constitute the route to political popularity.
Those who, in a very superficial way, measure the performance
of our political parties by probing the entrails of the Gallup
poll every month-which has gone up 4 points, for the government, incidentally, in the past four weeks-do not understand
what responsible government is all about.
Senator Flynn: But there was no place to go but up.
Senator Denis: Wait another four years.
Senator Perrault: The present program of restraints, with its
difficulties, inconveniences, frustrations and admitted shortcomings, was chosen as the best way to get the economy back
on the course to full employment without inflation.
All of us recall the words of the Prime Minister 12 months
ago when he said that this anti-inflation program would be
"rough justice." He said that the government introduced the
program with reluctance because it knew that certain Canadians would be inconvenienced and would be caused difficulties.
He said that we introduced restraints with reluctance because
voluntary restraints had not been accepted. However, it would
be better, he said, than the "rough injustice" of inflation which
was wiping out those least able to protect themselves. This
government at no time promoted the anti-inflation program as
a painless panacea. The government said that it was going to
be tough and difficult, but the process, hopefully, would lead
to better results for all after its conclusion.
It can be said now, 12 months later, that we have made a
good start, an encouraging start, but the battle is not won. Let
us look at some of the figures. We had some statistics from the
Leader of the Opposition today and he said that everything is
going from bad to worse. Not so. Twelve months ago we were
rapidly becoming a society of grab and greed. That is not an
accusation against any one sector of society. No one sector
should bear the sole blame. All of us shared some of the
responsibility. Inflation was running at Il per cent, and I gave
you the other figures. At the rate of inflation that we had one
year ago, the 1975 dollar would be worth 50 cents in 1981, and
a nickel in the year 2000. Many people, especially those who
were on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, were being devastated by inflation.
I look back to 12 months ago, for example, to my own
province of British Columbia. Still unsettled was a dispute
between the supermarkets, bakeries and their unions. Meat
cutters were asking for over $30,000 a year in wages and

benefits; checkout girls were asking for an increase from
$11,000 to $16,000 per year. The supermarkets warned that
they would eventually be forced to settle, and would have to
pass the costs on to consumers. Well, what would have been
the result? The consumer price index would have soared.
Workers in many other industries had contracts linked to the
cost of living; they would have received automatic increases.
And who would have lost in the squeeze between big business
and big labour? The unorganized, the pensioners, the persons
on fixed incomes, those in our society who did not have strong
negotiating teams to muscle themselves big increases. Well,
little wonder the government had to act, and when it did act
the government made this pledge to the people of Canada:
That under the controls program the people of Canada
would not be expected to endure a real loss of income.
Instead they would have to accept a rate of increase in
real income consistent with the growth rate of the
economy.
That makes eminent good economic sense.
*

(1510)

Twelve months later it can be reported, despite the rhetoric
and the accusations, that the pledge has been kept. The
purchasing power of Canadian workers has improved, and
labour's share of net national income is rising.
Let us review the facts. Wages first. The rate of increase in
nominal wages is slowing down-nominal wages. However,
Anti-Inflation Board data, to be released very shortly now, will
show that while compensation increases were in the order of 15
per cent in the pre-control days-that was the average-they
are now down to about 10 per cent.
At the same time, Canada's rate of inflation at the end of
September over September of 1975-these are the new figures-has been limited to 6.5 per cent. This means that the
Canadian worker has made significant gains in real earnings3.6 per cent. It means that the worker and his wife have more
purchasing power than they had a year ago.
I challenge the CLC, some of whose members are manning
picket lines from coast to coast in Canada today, including,
apparently, the leader of the New Democratic Party, who is
reported to be picketing in Oshawa, to tell us of other countries where the workers have achieved the real gains in purchasing power achieved by Canadian workers during the past
12 months.
As of October the inflation rate may not be lower in Canada
than in the United States, but the inflation rate in Canada is
now diminishing, as of October, at a faster rate than it is in the
United States. Yet we are supposed to be having a day of
protest about an anti-inflation program which is producing
some of the most encouraging economic facts of any nation in
the world.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: So far as our rate of inflation is concerned, we have donc exceedingly well in the international
arena, and it is time for Canadians to take pride in their
performance.

SENATE DEBATES
The average rate of inflation in the OECD countries-these
are the latest figures just obtained-is 8.1 per cent for the 12
months ending August 1976. Canada's rate is the fourth
lowest behind Switzerland, Germany and the United States,
but we are catching up.
Let us look at the inflation rate among some of our trading
partners and competitors: Japan, 8.8 per cent; France, 9.5 per
cent-the same France which a year ago said there was no
need for restraints or controls, and now has a wage freeze to be
followed by a controls program; The Netherlands, 8.3 per cent;
Sweden, 9.4 per cent, and a new government, largely because
of the inflationary situation, could not handle the situation.
The United KingdomSenator Flynn: That is the solution I proposed.
Senator Perrault: The United Kingdom, 13.8 per cent; Italy,
17 per cent; Australia, 12.3 per cent; New Zealand, 17.7 per
cent; Brazil, 36 per cent for the first six months of this year.
The final Brazilian figure will be 50 per cent again this year.
And we are told by the opposition here that Canada's antiinflation economic policies have been a failure.
By worldwide standards, honourable senators, our controls
program has worked and worked well, and it has worked well
for the benefit of the workers of Canada who should perhaps
be celebrating a day of thanksgiving and not a day of protest.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: Controls have benefited the trade unionists, and quite a number of them realize it, protests
notwithstanding.
I hold in my hand a letter which I have received from an
official of a CLC affiliate in Canada, from an experienced and
responsible union official, with the union letterhead on top, in
which he writes:
Dear Senator,
I have been secretary of our union for the past 25 years.
So I am well acquainted with the rank and file. And I
could tell you how 95 out of 100 workers in our union are
going to vote politically.
You will find on the October 14 protest that nearly all
of our province will be closed down. But I tell you that 70
per cent are doing it to save face.
Most workers are not against control. They are against
the unfairness of certain AIB judgments.
Which may be fair comment, depending upon the circumstances of the situation to which he refers. This respected
25-year veteran trade union official, well known in Canada,
goes on to say:
My own opinion is that there had to be controls, and if the
government gives in to the CLC, God help Canada. There
will be inflation so bad it will be completely out of hand.
It took courage to write that letter.
Senator Macdonald: Who is the author of that letter?
Senator Perrault: I will be glad to show it to you privately,
senator.

October 14, 1976

Senator Macdonald: If you quote it, you should table it.
Senator Perrault: I will be glad to show it to the honourable
senator privately. I want to protect the man's position, insofar
as I am able to do so.
Senator Macdonald: Is it not a parliamentary rule that if
one quotes a letter one should table it?
Senator Perrault: Not necessarily.
Senator Flynn: We will make an exception in this case.
Senator Perrault: I commend to honourable senators a
speech given by Donald Secord, President of the Canadian
Brotherhood of Railway, Transport and General Workers, in
Montreal earlier this month. I sent for a copy of his speech,
because there are many great and perceptive people in this
trade union movement. The people who purport to be the
public spokesmen are not necessarily the valid spokesmen for
the working people of this country. This is what he said to his
membership:
I am quite sure that the government did not want to
impose controls, particularly in view of its promise during
the last election not to do so. Inflation was then at a
double digit figure. The people, including trade union
members, were concerned, and with good reason, and no
one, including the economists, was coming forward with a
solution.
Labour, as represented by the Congress, was still concentrating on the high level of unemployment, urging the
government to further increase the money supply as a
cure. This at a time when inflation was heading for the
skies and wage settlements were running as much as 20
per cent or more per year.
Mr. Secord continued:
Privately many union leaders were saying this was
economic madnessAnd privately, honourable senators, this is exactly what they
were telling the government in those consultations of 1975.
Privately many union leaders were saying this was
economic madness, which it was, but were telling their
members they were going to get more for them than "that
other union", and were telling all and sundry that it was
to keep up with the cost of living.
Mr. Secord goes on, and no one can question his credentials as
a union leader:
As usual, business was saying it was labour's fault in
demanding high wages, and government's fault in its high
level of spending, while government was saying everyone
else was at fault, and, besides, the people were demanding
that it spend more. The awful fact is that there was a
great deal of truth in all that was said.
Business wasn't saying anything about the fact that to a
large extent it charges what the market will bear. Each
segment of our economy was striving for a larger share of
the economic pie with a total disregard for others and the
future, and no political party, economist or trade union
leader was giving us a solution.

October 14, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Did honourable senators ever hear a more accurate description
of the way it was 12 months ago-not by a businessman, not
by the government, but by a trade union leader speaking to his
membership? This is how he concluded:
It was in this atmosphere that the public became
uneasy, sensing that we were on the road to disaster, and
it was this reason there was a general public acceptance of
the wage-price controls. That includes, to a considerable
extent, union members, because when the worker goes
home at night lie is a citizen-he is the public with all the
problems and concerns of his fellow man.
I commend union leaders of that kind, who know what is
happening in this country of ours, who know that we must not
allow the economic situation to deteriorate, as it has in Britain,
so that desperation measures have to be put in place.
What of profits? Last night I heard one of the leaders
saying "It's because the government won't restrain profits. It's
that profit rip-off that they are allowing, but they are restraining us."
Profits before taxes in the first half of 1976 were up 5.5 per
cent over the first half of 1975. That is, in 1976 they were up
5.5 per cent over the first half of 1975. The share of GNP had
fallen over this period from 11.3 per cent to 10.3 per cent.
Nevertheless, profits in Canada have been consistently higher
than they have been in the United States since early 1973. The
largest single reason for this has been the higher level of
economic activity in Canada. But I listen appalled, honourable
senators, as perhaps you do, when I hear reports of one leader
of a national political party trailing around Canada attacking
the very idea of profits, and in effect saying, "Isn't it a
shocking thing that XY corporation has had three times as
much profit this year as last year?" without stating that in
terms of return on invested capital, and when last year may
have been 2 per cent and 1976 may be 6 per cent. This misuse
of economic facts to divide, to distress and to cause alarm, is
an irresponsible way for any person in public life to perform.
* (1520)

Let us look at prices. It appears certain that the increase in
the consumer price index in the year ending in October will be
well below the anti-inflation target of 8 per cent. In other
words, the target is going to be met. As of September, all items
had risen by 6.5 per cent, while food items dropped one-half of
1 per cent compared with a year earlier. The rise in non-food
items in September is the result primarily of oil and gas price
increases. Here is an interesting point. The opposition says,
"Isn't it a shocking thing how the inflation rate has gone up
from 6.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent in one month; that is federal
government mismanagement." And yet the provincial governments, many of whom share the same political beliefs as some
of these federal critics, are the ones supporting increases in gas
and oil prices.
Let us look at food. Many spokesmen have stated: "Look,
the reason for Canada's excellent performance in the fight
against inflation is because of food, and it is not controlled."
Farm gate prices and import prices are not controlled. How-

ever, depending on the item, from 30 per cent to 55 per cent of
the price which the housewife pays for food is made up of
transportation, processing and distribution costs. And these are
being controlled by the anti-inflation program, as are many of
the costs to the farmer who produces the food in the first
place. The slowdown in the rate of increase in wages and other
costs faced by processors and distributors are being passed on
to the shoppers. Our controls program has halted the spiralling
cost of food which had much to do with the high wage
demands of only one year ago.
The controls program limits price increases essentially by
setting ceilings on the profit margins that firms are allowed to
earn, and most firms have priced their products so as to stay
within the limits, or prices have been held within the limits by
market circumstances.
The first compliance period for most firms ended in December 1975, and in that period about 100 firms earned higher
than permitted profits, and as a result they had to file compliance plans with the Anti-Inflation Board. Examples of such
compliance plans are Monarch Fine Foods and General Foods,
to name two. Also, about 500 of the largest firms in the
country have to give the AIB prior notice of all significant
price increases. About 1,000 price pre-notification cases have
been reviewed to date. In most cases, the firms did not make a
formal request for a price increase because after meeting with
the AIB it became clear to them that such increases would
result in excess revenue, and so they did not proceed. In other
cases, formal requests for price increases have been reduced.
Let me name some names-Gulf Oil, Texaco Oil, BP, Imperial Oil, la Brasserie O'Keefe Ltée. and Travellers' Insurance
Company. That is just part of the list.
So, honourable senators, controls have been fair to all sides,
and have been to the benefit of Canada as a whole. But this is
not to say that they are perfect. But instead of labour organizing days of protest, and business people having the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce meet in convention to pass resolutions
in opposition to the program, why not more constructive
cooperative efforts by all Canadians to strengthen the program
and to advance positive alternative ideas to make the program
more equitable?
What is really to be gained by raising a CLC fund of
$500,000 to fight restraint and controls when, in their heart of
hearts, CLC leaders know it is to the ultimate benefit of the
Canadian worker that restraint should work and inflation be
defeated? These are the challenges the government is continuing to issue to all sectors of the economy.
It seems likely that the Canadian economy will generate
about 250,000 new jobs this year. Perhaps the CLC spokesmen
would like to give us the names of other countries matching
this performance. This growth in Canada has matched the
number of entrants into the labour force. Consequently,
although the rate of unemployment has averaged 7.1 per cent
in 1976, the great majority of heads of households in this
country are employed. That 7.1 per cent figure does not
represent the same devastating social impact that 7.1 per cent
would have represented, for example, 15 or 20 years ago. The

SENATE DEBATES
adult male rate of unemployment has remained fairly constant
at 4 per cent.
So here we are one year after controls were first instituted.
The program is working; it is on the way to success. The
program will end in 1978, and, as the Prime Minister said
yesterday, the government would be tempted to end controls
today if it could be guaranteed that we would not return to the
high rate of demand for various forms of income that was
present one year ago. The CLC has been asked, "If you would
like to abandon controls, what alternative can you provide that
will ensure that we will not go into another round of one-year
demands ranging from 30 per cent to 75 per cent?" And the
response has been less than encouraging. We are waiting.
Perhaps some ideas are under development. They are most
welcome. Certainly this process would be a more useful exercise than days of protest.
Honourable senators, if we, as individuals, corporations or
governments, relax our cooperative efforts to win the battle
against inflation, we are going to run the risk of prices
accelerating again.
It is the view of this government that the success of the
anti-inflation program outweighs the importance or the significance of political popularity polis, and any other consideration.
The national interest transcends in importance the course of
battle in the political arena or political rivalries. With inflation
rates coming down in the economies of our most important
trading partners, our international competitive position could
not withstand a new acceleration in costs.
Our current account deficit, as the Leader of the Opposition
has stated, is very large and we are borrowing from abroad.
This has been partly due to the impact of recession abroad on
our exports, but some recovery is now under way. As you
know, it is also partly because of our growing dependence on
imported oil, and this can be turned around only slowly by our
energy strategy. But it is also partly due to challenges to our
competitive position.
The most fundamental policy we must pursue to improve
our balance of payments and to slow down the rising pricewage spiral is to bring inflation under control in this country. I
want to assure you again that the federal government is
committed to winding up mandatory controls by the end of
1978. This bears repeating. This government does not wish to
have to make detailed interventions in private decisions, and so
the present restraints and guidelines will not become permanent features of our economic life. That is the philosophy to be
found in the Speech from the Throne.
Senator Flynn: Not in those words.
Senator Perrault: This is a time for testing-a time of
testing for ail of us. It is a testing of the national will and
resolve to overcome our economic problems, and, as the
Speech from the Throne points out, our problems relating to
national unity and keeping Canada together.
The nation is on trial and, more than that, our system is very
much on trial. We have talked a great deal about a free
economy in recent months from coast to coast in Canada, and

October 14, 1976

there was a vigorous controversy about a well-known speech
made by the Prime Minister last New Year's eve. A profound
truth is evident: Confederation and all of our free institutions
are going to be tried and tested as never before, in the years to
come. How are we going to meet the test?
0

(1530)

I think that we all share the belief that, while we may
disagree politically, we will beat inflation. You have your
theory, Senator Flynn, on how it will be beaten, and we on this
side may have other views, but I am confident that if we
continue to work together we can win that fight.
Much is being spoken and written about the era of post-controls, and a white paper has been produced on the subject-the
kind of society which will exist after today's formal economic
restraints are gone. It will be an important dialogue. But one
fact becomes increasingly evident to all of us: Canada and the
world will never be the same again. Gone are the relatively
easy years of economic growth just after the war, when
investors lined up at Canada's door and said, "We are eager to
put our money in your country." We now have rough, tough
competition internationally for money and markets. Gone are
the times of war-created shortages in which people would buy
everything we could sell and were not concerned too much
about the price.
It will be a tougher and more competitive world, economically and ideologically. Yes, ideologically. Out of 144 nations
in the world today, honourable senators, there are only 51 left
with any semblance, even an elemental semblance, of democracy; and of those only 21 have a full democracy in the sense
that we know it in Canada. Senator McDonald reminds me
that that represents only 17 per cent of the population of the
world. And every year two or three more governments give
way to some form of authoritarianism or totalitarianism,
usually because of some economic difficulty or disaster. People
in despair born of economic misery say, "Weil, if we cannot
make our free economy work and protect the integrity of our
money, give us a strong man. We will trade off our democratic
freedom and accept more direction over our lives in return for
economic stability and money that will retain its purchasing
power." All too often the trend toward undemocratic and
authoritarian government is triggered by some economic crisis.
In recent years we have seen many examples of rampant
inflation and economic mismanagement leading to the establishment of undemocratic forms of government.
I believe, and it is the philosophy of this Speech from the
Throne, that if we ever come to a point in Canada where a life
of thrift, energy, hard work and enterprise will be rewarded in
devalued dollars-dollars worth five cents in the year 2000, for
example-and a debased currency, the result of rampant and
unfettered inflation, then our economic system as well as our
free society will be placed in jeopardy. And the time could
come in our own nation when an angry and frustrated population might not only demand a change to the Conservatives, the
Liberals, the NDP or any other party, but a change in the
system.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

The other day the respected British Prime Minister said that
if the economic situation continues to deteriorate in Great
Britain the citizens of that country will face the danger of a
dictatorship of the left or of the right. We do not want that in
Canada. But if we fail to make our free society operate fairly
for all, and if we are unwilling, or unable, to accept the
burdens of individual responsibility imposed by a free society,
then we may find that the people of this country, in their anger
and frustration, will forego some of today's cherished freedoms
in order to bring more stability to this nation's economic life.
And so today and in the era ahead, Canadians will be required
to demonstrate an unparalleled degree of cooperation. Are we
capable of it?
Honourable senators, I realize I have been speaking at
length, but I believe so acutely that this situation is a serious
one in Canada that I feel I must make certain points clear.
Senator Flynn: Don't become a pessimist!
Senator Perrault: I am never a pessimist, but the recent
record of work stoppages, strikes, lock-outs and wildcat disputes, of slowdowns and economic disruptions, demands new
ways to bring labour, management and government into closer
relationship; and the government is striving for this new relationship. It is not a matter of attributing blame here. It is a
matter of saying that unless we work together we will be in
serious trouble again after today's restraints have been lifted.
All of us must do better, whether we serve in government or in
the private sector.
Yes, Senator Flynn, the government does have to accept
some of the responsibility for the events of recent years, as do
all governments. You are quite right. We have many programs, most of them supported by the opposition parties in
Parliament, open-ended programs, which today are accelerating in cost far more rapidly than the improvement in the gross
national product. You are quite right in what you have said in
that respect. But those people who criticize this increase in
government expenditure so seldom tell us how major expenditures can be reduced or cancelled. There is real restraint in
government spending. Yet, you say there has been a 16 per
cent increase in the government's budget this year. Surely,
senator, you are aware of the enormous amounts involved in
transfer payments-for the senior citizens, for medicare costs
and for hospitals. You could cancel 300 Information Canadas
and Opportunities for Youth programs and still not reduce
significantly the federal budget. Today, honourable senators,
we could fire every civil servant in Canada, God forbidSenator Flynn: Are you sure?
Senator Perrault: -and we would reduce the budget by
only 1 per cent. We are talking in terms of enormous figures.
But the whole idea of restraint and responsibility applies
equally to the federal government and to the other sectors of
the economy, and it certainly applies to those in the opposition
parties as well.
Cooperation is the key. It is no accident that the economy of
West Germany is the strongest in Western Europe, and one of

the most powerful in the world. Since 1972 West German
workers have had fewer strikes than workers in all other
countries. By 1974 the difference between the West German
record and that of other countries had increased to the point
where for every 48 days lost by German workers because of
strikes, French workers lost 201 days, British workers lost 650
days and Canadian workers lost 930 days.
Senator Flynn: It is awful!
Senator Perrault: This is the situation that we have in this
country, and I think it is more important than Liberals blaming Conservatives and NDPers, and Conservatives and
NDPers blaming Liberals, or any one segment of society
blaming any other.
Senator Flynn: I agree with that.
Senator Perrault: As a recent report on the state of the
unions and labour relations in West Germany states, West
Germany's successful economic performance raises questions
about an economic system which can bring a country from a
state of complete ruin in 1945 to the point 30 years later of
becoming one of the world's most stable economies during a
period of serious world recession.
Canada's system of free collective bargaining has brought
great advances to the workers of this nation and to the entire
country, but it must be vastly improved if we are to remain a
competitive and prosperous nation.
All sectors of the economy must improve performance. We
cannot afford to indulge in the dubious luxury of long and
costly labour-management squabbles, which in all too many
cases are unrelated to productivity, to profits or to our competitive position in the world, but are related solely to a testing
of economic muscle and strength. How many more Pyrrhic
victories can this nation afford with both sides engaged in long
and costly battles, and the public interest crushed in the
process? It is no accident that those nations with strong
economies-and the increase in the West German Consumer
Price Index, incidentally, averaged over the past 12 months,
was just over 4 per cent-have sought and established new
paths to economic cooperation, including labour, management
and government.

Honourable senators, I suggest to you that, despite our
vicissitudes, there are many more reasons for a day of thanksgiving than for a day of protest. We are some of the most
fortunate people on the face of the globe, and it would be a
tragedy of monumental proportions to have our economy, our
competitive position in the world, and, yes, our national unity,
placed in jeopardy because during this time of testing for all of
us we were unequal to the challenge, unable to lift our sights
and unable to place the national interest before all other
considerations.

SENATE DEBATES
report, did not limit its investigation to the recommendations
but went considerably further afield in reviewing this very
important subject.
I should like to deal briefly with some of the major recommendations of the committee's report, which I believe could
have a significant impact on legislation which might follow.
First let me give a few facts and figures on collective
bargaining in the public service. I quote from the report, as
follows:
The Government of Canada is the largest employer in
the country. Though not all government employees are
public servants, there were in April, 1975, almost 250,000
public servants represented under the Public Service Staff
Relations Act by 14 different bargaining agents in 104
bargaining units.
According to evidence presented to the committee,
between the introduction of collective bargaining in the
Public Service in 1967, and November 30, 1975, there
have been 449 collective agreements-73.9 per cent by
voluntary agreement; 15.1 per cent following arbitration;
8.6 per cent following conciliation; and 2.4 per cent
following a legal strike.
There were 449 collective agreements signed during that
period, and there were only 1l legal strikes.
Though Parliament has several times enacted back-towork legislation for disputes falling under the Canada
Labour Code, at no time has such action been necessary
for the l1 lawful strikes under the Public Service Staff
Relations Act. There have been, however, more than 50
unlawful strikes, since collective bargaining was introduced to the Public Service of Canada in 1967 and more
appropriate means appear to be necessary to curtail
unlawful activity. If the record had been different then we
might have very well concluded that the assumptions
underlying collective bargaining in the Public Service of
Canada ought to be changed.
In other words, a good deal of consideration was given to the
whole principle of the right to strike in the public service. The
committee felt that because there were only l1 legal strikes,
representing 2.4 per cent of the agreements, in a period of
eight years, it was a reasonably successful record and one
which justified continuation of that particular principle.
A good deal of thought was given to the public's interest in
public service bargaining. Some witnesses wanted to eliminate
the right to strike, as I have said, and others argued that it
should be extended. It must be pointed out, however, that this
is not just a federal government problem. It is estimated that
more than two million persons are employed in public service
in Canada-in the federal government, crown corporations,
provincial governments, municipalities, school boards, hospital
boards, et cetera. I hasten to add that I am not justifying that
figure; I am merely reporting it as a fact.
If I am allowed, I shall read again from our committee's
report:

October 19, 1976

Considering our terms of reference, the immediate
requirements for change, the evidence of the interested
parties and the record of collective bargaining in the
Public Service of Canada, your committee concludes that
there is much merit in the system created by the legislation enacted in 1967. After all the evidence was heard and
debated, Parliament added new dimensions to collective
bargaining in Canada. In- the future, the assumptions
underlying collective bargaining may change but your
committee's mandate and direction focused on finding
solutions to today's problems. Therefore, our purpose was
to strengthen and improve the collective bargaining process in the Public Service of Canada wherever possible.
I would like now, honourable senators, to discuss with yousome, certainly not all-of the recommendations contained in
this report. First, I would draw to your attention the improvement that was recommended in the process and scope of
designated employees. When the right to strike was given to
federal employees, inherent in that right, as contained in the
1967 legislation, was the idea that the safety and security of
the public must be assured. To bring this about a category
known as "designated employees" was created. These designated employees are named, and are required to be available
to maintain the safety and security of the public. This is a
means of guaranteeing, supposedly, that safety and security
during a time of strike. The committee recommended:
That when Parliament is dissolved, the Governor-inCouncil be empowered to suspend the right to strike,
whenever in its opinion a strike is adverse to the public
interest.
In other words, we suggested that in that period when Parliament is dissolved, and when the country is experiencing something of a hiatus insofar as getting people back to work is
concerned, that right should be given to the Governor in
Council.
As I have indicated, certain employees were designated as
being required to provide safety and security, and were therefore denied the right to strike. The committee recommended
changes which would include a wider range of interests insofar
as protection of the public was concerned. Those would include
such things as health and the protection of public property.
Improvements were also recommended in the designation
process.
This brings me to what, in my opinion, is one of the most
pressing problems facing the federal government insofar as its
employer-employee relations are concerned, and that is the
problem of illegal strikes or walk-outs, and how they should be
handled, especially where such illegal activity by designated
employees is involved. If anything is complicated in the whole
process of collective bargaining and relations between employer and employee, it is this matter of illegal strikes.
It is not my purpose today to go into the whole procedure,
but the fact is that very little has been done in the past to take
action against those who walk off the job illegally in contravention of their contracts. There are many reasons for this, and

October 19, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

perhaps at some other time we will have an opportunity to look
at them. However, at the present time there is the cumbersome
system of getting permission to prosecute from the Public
Service Staff Relations Board, and then going to the courts. In
this connection, the committee's report states that the judicial
process has proven to be cumbersome and expensive and that
court decisions lacked uniformity. It goes on:
The present two-stage process with its substantial costs,
delays, fragmented administration, absence of precedents,
and inconsistent penalties has led all parties to agree that
the present system for dealing with unlawful activity is
not working well and is inappropriate.
o

(2020)

The committee's Recommendation 23 is:
23. That three procedural remedies be available for
dealing with unlawful actions:
(i) Disciplinary action by the employer, reviewable
through the grievance process and adjudication.
(ii) Prosecution of an offence before the Public Service
Staff Relations Board, and disposition of the case by
the Public Service Staff Relations Board.
(iii) Prosecution of an offence in the courts after
obtaining consent to prosecute from the Public Service
Staff Relations Board and disposition of the case by the
courts.
As I indicated earlier, it is the third one which is presently
the only means of prosecuting such illegal activities-that is,
by permission of the Public Service Staff Relations Board. We
have suggested that it is important to add the other two.
The committee has also recommended:
26. That where "designated employees" have interrupted or impaired services by an unlawful strike or there has
been an unlawful lockout and no action has been initiated
by the employer or bargaining agent against the contravening parties, then a Special Commissioner whose office
shall be independent should be empowered to initiate legal
proceedings.
That recommendation was made with a view to making sure
public interest was always protected, and that, somewhere
along the line, a deal would not be made to forego prosecution
in order to get people back to work.
The committee also recommended a schedule of financial
penalties for those guilty of unlawful activity. To that end the
committee has identified the following classes of actions
which, under the present act, are unlawful:
(a) Declaration, authorization or incitement of unlawful
strike.
(b) Discrimination against employees or employee organizations prohibited under the act.
(c) Participation of employees in an unlawful strike.
(d) Intimidation of employees.
(e) Other prohibited acts by unions, employers or representatives thereof.

80003-3½

Changes were also recommended in the areas of classification, technological change and long-term layoff. Technological
change is especially important, and the recommendations of
the committee in that respect should be carefully assessed.
These include the following:
That changes in technology, operations, organization or
any other dimension of the structure or character of the
employer's resources to provide service to the public be
recognized as a prerogative of the employer.
It is the employer's right to institute such changes, but we
qualify that by saying that the "employer be obliged to
bargain the impact of adverse changes on employees which
may occur as a consequence of the employer's actions"
referred to in the above recommendation, "including the
advance notice of such changes and the details to accompany
the notice." We also recommend that the "Public Service Staff
Relations Board have the authority and responsibility to provide for a *mediator to assist the parties where there are
differences."
Honourable senators, I believe that some of the present
problems in the Post Office could possibly-and I emphasize
"possibly"-have been avoided if these procedures had been
operative.
The Speech from the Throne indicates that the government
will attempt to ensure an equitable relationship between compensation levels in the public and private sectors. That is
certainly desirable, and it is to be hoped that sound legislation
to that end will be enacted. I should point out, however, that
the committee rejected the idea of an all-embracing good
employer concept, "as the basis of a model of compulsory
arbitration and the removal of the right to strike."
It is indicated in the Speech from the Throne that action
will be taken in an attempt to improve the present employeremployee bargaining process in the public service. I draw the
attention of honourable senators to the committee's report and
its recommendations, and I sincerely hope that these will be
carefully considered, as I am sure they will, in any future
legislative program.
Senator Lang: I wonder if I might ask the honourable
senator a question arising out of his remarks?
In the deliberations of your committee, did you consider the
question of whether public service employees, as opposed ta
those in the private sector, have in fact tenure of employment
and, if so, is that tenure of employment consistent with the
right to strike?
Senator Buckwold: I think it would be fair to say that that
was considered. One of the reasons we were unable to completely accept the "good employer" concept was because of
security of tenure in government service. I do not think we
related it to the right to strike in the sense of a direct
relationship, but we did consider it in the light of trying to
make use of the "good employer" concept-that is to say,
those who would be considered the best employers, and relating them to the federal service. We felt it would be somewhat

SENATE DEBATES
of an invidious comparison because of the very nature of the
question you have raised.
Senator Lawson: Will the honourable senator permit a
further question?
When you talked about your committee's recommendations
with respect to illegal strikes and penalties, I did not hear any
recommendation as to what agency or tribunal would make the
determination as to what would constitute an illegal strike.
As background to my question, it was the general belief
across the country that the recent strike at Anvil Mines was an
illegal strike. I think many people in the labour movement felt
it was an illegal strike, but when the issue went before the
appropriate tribunal, it was deemed to be a legal strike-a not
unlawful strike.
What agency or tribunal, under your recommendations,
would make that determination?
Senator Buckwold: I indicated that there were three different directions that it could take. Over and above that, we
recommended the appointment of a special commissioner
whose responsibility would be to ensure that the public interest
was protected, and if he felt that justice had not been served he
would then be free to take whatever action he felt his office
should take.
Senator Lawson: Would the special commissioner take
action while the alleged illegal strike was taking place, or at
some subsequent date? Are you talking about "curb side"
justice, or what are you talking about in this instance?
Senator Buckwold: There are limitations in the report as to
the time in which he will have to act. He should do so within a
fixed number of days so that the public can see that action is
being taken. The whole concept of the recommendation is to
satisfy the public that those who take it upon themselves to
carry out illegal activities will have to face the consequences,
which, I am sorry to say, at the present time does not seem to
be the case.
Hon. Keith Laird: Honourable senators, it is always a
pleasure to commend Madam Speaker, not just for the very
effective manner in which she carries out her duties in the
chamber but-and this is more important-for the tremendous
job she does in the matter of entertaining and other activities
outside the chamber. Her efforts do much to enhance the
image of this body.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Laird: i certainly found the remarks of the mover of
this motion, Senator Lucier, and the seconder, Senator Barrow
most instructive and helpful, and as I proceed I shall perhaps
have more to say specifically about them.

Needless to say, I commend the other two participants in
this debate, both of them my friends, namely, Senator Perrault
and Senator Flynn. Senator Perrault's remarks were very
helpful, and this even goes for Senator Flynn. Tonight, however, in view of the fact that some of you have had a frightfully

strenuous evening at another function, I have no intention of
talking at any great length. I know you want to get back to
your homes or hotel rooms to relax in front of the television.
Senator Flynn: Why?
Senator Laird: I understand there is a certain athletic event
on television tonight, although, of course, that is pure hearsay.
Very briefly, I would like to say something which will be a
contribution to this debate.
Honourable senators, this summer I had the unique opportunity to go out west, and to the great northwest. I would
recommend to any of my colleagues who have not undertaken
such a journey to do so as soon as possible. I had been out
before to the western provinces and British Columbia on more
than one occasion, but never had I been to the northern
territories or the Yukon until this summer.
My journey was not made all in one leap. I took occasion to
pause here and there, and I owe a particular debt of gratitude
to my colleagues, Senator Everett, Senator Buckwold and
Senator Lucier, for all the help that they gave me in making
this trip so memorable. I can tell you that those gentlemen
kept me rather well occupied. There was a speech to make
here and there, for instance, but I must say that that sort of
thing keeps me happy. My visit did establish in my mind,
however, the firm conviction, fortified by the speeches of
Senator Lucier and Senator Perrault, that what every one of
us from the Senate should do is to get around this country
more. It is all very well to read what people say in Hansard,
and it is all very well to hear all sorts of reports about what is
happening in other parts of Canada, but there is no way to get
the real facts in your head except by going there.
They have some very special problems in the north. Naturally I am more alert to the problems of the Yukon, having been
there no more than a matter of six weeks ago, where they have
a very different point of view on a lot of things. Having in
mind the very fine speech of my friend, Senator Buckwold, and
the theme which he dealt with so ably tonight, I must say that
when I was in the Yukon I was amazed at the seriousness of
their labour problems, which seemed to me to result from poor
union leadership. I have been a supporter of unions all my life,
so I think I can speak rather freely and say that the leadership
of some unions alarms me. Without appearing to be a racist, I
would say that too many of these leaders are expatriates, if
you want to call them that, who have come here from some
other part of the world-and I think the United Kingdom has
contributed the worst. If you analyze the situation for yourselves, you will find that the most troublesome labour situations seem to have arisen where the leaders of the unions have
not been Canadian-born. I repeat, I am anything but a racist,
but I cannot help but speculate as to why these people left the
countries they were born in to come here and give such poor
leadership to certain unions. This is not universally true, but
the situation as I have described it does exist, as you know only
too well.

Senator Denis: Hear, hear.

October 19, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Laird: If you go to the Yukon you will find out
about these things for yourselves by making the right contacts,
and you will discover in particular the tremendous area of
concern that exists regarding the native peoples. My friend
Senator Lucier spoke very ably and at some length about that
problem, so I will say no more except stress that this is a very
real problem.
Another thing that Senator Lucier touched on, and which
will interest you very much, I have no doubt, is that there has
been a lot of talk about the desire of the Yukon to become a
province. Let me assure you, as I believe he did, that up to this
point there is no demand in the Yukon for provincial status. In
fact, if a vote were taken I wager that there would not be 10
per cent of the people who would vote for such a proposition. I
hope I am not exaggerating, Senator Lucier. They are simply
not ready, as I see it, for the responsibilities of provincial
government, with all the problems that arise in raising revenue, creating a bureaucracy, and so on.
Honourable senators, you can learn of all these things at
first hand, if you will just take the trouble to go and find out
for yourselves, instead of just reading about them and then
bemoaning the situation. I urge you to go and find out for
yourselves. It is my recommendation that any member of the
Senate who has not done so should travel from one end of the
country to the other.
I have been in the Maritimes on more than one occasion.
Although I have not been there too recently, God willing, I
hope to go back in that direction next year. However, somehow
or other, I must go again to that fascinating part of the
country that Senator Lucier comes from-the Yukon.
If any of you go out there, honourable senators, be sure to
make an important investment in a little paperback book
called Songs of a Sourdough, and again read, as you must
have in the past, "The Cremation of Sam McGee" and "The
Shooting of Dangerous Dan McGrew". These works will give
you an idea of the background of so many of the people who
are there now. They are really still pioneers.
The Throne Speech, unfortunately, took a lot of the thunder
out of what I was going to say. I was going to let out the usual
blasts about various things, but I find the Throne Speech has
jumped the gun on me.
Senator Flynn: No, no; you are too humble. The Throne
Speech has not stolen the thunder from anyone up to now.
Senator Laird: I am referring to the thunder I am going to
get to in one minute. The Throne Speech deals with things
which, as you know, I have thundered about in the past, even
though they were government measures. Let us take bilingualism, for instance. I have said publicly all along that the
method chosen was not the right method. Long before it was
said by Keith Spicer, I said there was no sense in spending a
lot of money trying to teach English-speaking public servants
to speak French. Instead, it should be done at the kindergarten
level. This, by the way, is what is being done in Windsor. I do
not know about other Canadian cities, but when I went to the
public school graduation of one of my numerous grandsons not

long ago, I found he had been taking French for about four
years, and that around the school were many signs in French.
This is the way to go at it.
Then there is the matter of the creation of jobs, not through
government action but by private enterprise. That principle is
now the declared policy of the government.
* (2040)

There are so many other things like that. As I say, the
Speech has taken some of the thunder out of my speech.
Senator Flynn: You mean you are interested in the reversals
of government policy.
Senator Laird: As far as I am concerned, there may have
been some reversals. If so, all to the good. What I say to my
colleagues is, the main thing is that it seems to impose an extra
burden on us in this chamber to see, for example, that these
various policies are carried out in the way in which they are set
out in the Throne Speech. Naturally, as has been pointed out,
it is easy to make general statements, which is the normal
thing in the debate on the Throne Speech. However, when we
get down to specifics we come into our own, and this raises the
other aspect about which I wanted to talk, very briefly I assure
you.
I consider one of the most dangerous tendencies today to be
the increasing amount of government by bureaucracy. This is
really the first step towards totalitarianism. To paraphrase
Arnold Toynbee, the great historian, in his Study of History,
he said that a civilization is not destroyed by enemies from
without, but by decay from within; that is, the suicidal tendencies of a civilization, which are exhibited in various ways, of
which increasing bureaucratic control is one. As I say, it is a
step on the road to totalitarianism.
You may ask: how does it come about that we let this go by?
First of all, let us consider a member of the House of Commons. With his work there and his constituency work, which
he has to do or else he does not get re-elected, I can safely say
that most members of the House of Commons are swamped
with work; they have not got too much time to attend to some
of the ideas of some civil servants. By the way, in case my
speech gets any publicity, I want to make one thing plain right
now. Although, as I am reminded, there is nobody in the Press
Gallery, they may well read the "blues" or look at Hansard.I
want to make it very plain that I think the majority of civil
servants are conscientious and hard-working.
However, there are two types of civil servants that I find
extremely obnoxious. The first are those who will not give an
honest day's work for an honest day's pay. Believe me, they are
bad. However, they are nothing to the somewhat smaller group
of empire builders, who are so intent on heading an organization that they will conjure up some new ideas just to bring in
more and more people whom they can have in their department. The more I think of it, the more I believe that all things
evil really boil down in the end to avarice. I do not mean
merely an unreasoning love of money; I mean an unreasoning
love of power. There are, unfortunately, some individuals in

SENATE DEBATES

October 19, 1976

the civil service who have that absolutely overwhelming desire
to create an empire. We must watch this.

Senator Forsey: You get some wild and woolly interpretations sometimes.

Instead of dealing only in generalities, I am going to give
you a specific example of what we did here, which will
illustrate what I am trying to urge on you now, that we have
an unusually important role to play in the Senate in making
sure that this sort of thing does not happen. In the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce we
made a study of the subject matter of Bill C-60, respecting
bankruptcy and insolvency, in advance of the bill coming
before the Senate. Some of you here are members of that
committee and heard us in action. You know what we did to
that bill. We emasculated it to the point where the government
took it back, and are now going to start all over again.

Senator Laird: That is right. The whole trouble is that most
people simply give up because it is so complex; they take the
word of the permanent official in the department and let it go
at that. That is how it comes about that we have so much
bureaucratic government in this country already. Let us stop it
right at this point.

What that bill proposed was fantastic. It proposed to set up
an administrator, so-called. What was this character going to
do? Just about everything you could think of. He was going to
assume so many functions that I will not try to go over them
all. He was going to assume many of the functions now
performed by the courts. That is the sort of thing we have to
lick right here before it even gets started.
Let me tell you further, honourable senators, that that bill
provided, in effect, for the creation of all sorts of new offices
all over Canada so as to make it very easy for anybody to go
bankrupt and get his discharge in 90 days. With the creation
of all these new offices, can you imagine the number of new
people who would have to be hired, the number who would
then increase the empire of this administrator? I give you that
specific illustration, which occurred in Senator Hayden's committee, because it is a perfect illustration of precisely what we
in this chamber have to do. We must watch for that with every
piece of legislation we review.
Let me tell you another thing that leads, of course, to
government by bureaucracy, and that is the complexity and
the proliferation of legislation. Proliferation does not mean
necessarily bringing in new acts. It can mean taking an
existing act and putting in it so much that is new that it then
becomes so frightfully complex that nobody can really understand it, and therefore in desperation you turn to some permanent official in the department to get an interpretation. We
have got to stop that sort of thing. That is all there is to it.

Senator Flynn: Let us all sit on the left of Madam Speaker.
Senator McIlraith: You would be very lonely.
Senator Langlois: There would be chaos then.
Senator Flynn: Oh no. It could even be better.
Senator Laird: This is our job here. I mean all of us,
everybody in the Senate, no matter what party he is in, it is his
or her job to make sure that this thing does not happen. I am
sure we agree there is absolutely no argument between the two
sides on the desirability of that. We all know the dangers
involved. It is one thing that I frankly consider downright
dangerous under our present system, and we simply must
watch it.
Unfortunately, I repeat, the members in the other place are
literally swamped with work. If they are swamped, then cabinet ministers are hopelessly swamped; they have to turn for
help to their permanent officials, and as a result they obviously
on occasions do not examine as carefully as they should the
implications of a proposal.
To me, a lot of things that it is tempting for the opposition
to blame on a cabinet minister are really not his fault; they are
simply the result of our system, which unfortunately overworks
the elected people. Fortunately we here do not have to face
that problem, and that is why we have a special duty. We can
take time to plough into things, and we can definitely serve a
real purpose in so doing.
I said I would be brief. I hope I have made at least one
punchy point. With that, I simply express my appreciation to
you for listening to me for this length of time under these
circumstances.
Senator Flynn: That is the best speech we have heard up to
now.
On motion of Senator Langlois, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

SENATE DEBATES
matters pertaining to Nova Scotia he does so with both
knowledge and authority.
He mentioned the extremely high cost of electrical energy in
the province. Without doubt this is a matter of grave concern
both to individuals and to industry. Only in Prince Edward
Island is the cost of electrical energy higher than in Nova
Scotia, and I expect that when the Public Utility Board of
Nova Scotia gives a ruling on an application now before it for
increasing the electrical charges, Nova Scotia will have the
dubious distinction of paying the highest rate in Canada for
electrical energy.
I endorse and support the suggestion of Senator Barrow, and
that of the Government of Nova Scotia, that assistance be
provided by the federal government. Nova Scotia has asked for
assistance from Ottawa in the form of a five-year subsidy, and
I wholly agree with Senator Barrow that the province needs
such interim assistance to help cushion the crippling rate
increases which face both householders and businesses alike.
I also endorse what he said about the proposed Canstel
project for industrial Cape Breton. If such a plant becomes a
reality it will give a tremendous uplift not only to Cape Breton
but to the whole of Nova Scotia.
I was pleased to hear Senator Barrow say that in his opinion
the prospects for a new steel plant appeared excellent, because
statements I have heard to date have not been too optimistic.
It should be realized that the proposed new plant is a tremendous undertaking and one that would require a vast amount of
capital investment. I understand that the feasibility study
mentioned by Senator Barrow is expected to be completed in
either late February or early March, 1977. However, we must
remember that even if the report is favourable, the actual
financing of such a project will be a tremendous undertaking
and, indeed, likely to be a major problem. No doubt it is for
that reason that Senator Barrow feels it necessary for the
Government of Canada to become involved. Together with all
Nova Scotians, I personally hope that we shall get that new
steel complex in Cape Breton, because it would be an asset to
us and would give a tremendous boost not only to the economy
of Cape Breton but to all the province.
When discussing Canstel, perhaps a word of warning is in
order. I recently reread the speech given last February by Mr.
Ralph D. Hindson, Managing Director of Canstel Corporation, in which he said that he was dealing with facts. He
certainly was. He mentioned 23 of them. In the course of his
remarks-some of which scared me-his general attitude was
of restrained optimism. He did not appear to be too optimistic
about the future of the present Sydney steel plant if a new
plant does not materialize. We must remember that the old
plant has been the backbone of the economy in the Sydney
area for many years, and in our search for a new one the old
one must not be neglected. It must not be allowed to wither
and eventually die, because that plant still provides employment for 2,500 men, although the number is diminishing each
year.

October 20, 1976

I know that the Government of Nova Scotia is sympathetic
toward the plant. As a Cape Bretoner, I give great credit to the
government of G. I. Smith, now Senator Smith, who in 1967
had the courage to take over the plant, thus saving the
economy of the Sydney area. I also give credit to that government for committing large sums of money to be used for
modernizing the plant. Credit is due also to the government of
Gerald Reagan, which has continued not only to commit but
also to spend large sums of money to keep the plant in
operation.
To change the subject, honourable senators, I personally
cannot get too excited about the statement in the Speech from
the Throne that the government will preserve and enhance a
policy of reliance on individual enterprise as a mainspring of
economic activity. In the area of Nova Scotia which I represent, namely, the Island of Cape Breton, the Sydney steel plant
is government-owned; the coal mines are government-owned,
and most of the transportation comes under the CNR or its
direction so it is government-owned. The fishing industry has
had major assistance from governments. And in the service
industries the main source of employment is education. All
these are not individual enterprises, and personally I would
hate to think what the situation would be if we were depending
on private or individual enterprise as the mainspring of our
economic activity.
* (1410)

The Speech from the Throne is, in my view, a rather
depressing document. Like most such speeches in recent years
it is rather long; it touches on many subjects but says little if
anything specific about any of them. Personally, I think it is
but a hollow shell, and we are asked to trust the government to
bring in legislation which would, I suppose, in God's good time
bring these objectives to us.
Honourable senators, for this government to ask us to accept
the vague outline of policy contained in the Speech from the
Throne is asking a lot, and I shall tell you why. It is because
the government has lost its credibility, and I think that its
attitude towards the problem of inflation is largely responsible
for that loss of credibility.
Recently I looked over some previous Throne Speeches, and
I noticed in the Speech from the Throne delivered on February
27, 1974, the government had this to say:
The Canadian economy, perhaps more than any other,
is closely tied to international trade and markets. The
principal inflationary pressures have come from outside
the country. It would have been singularly inappropriate
under such conditions to have resorted to general income
and price controls and the government rejected them for
these reasons.
I am sure we all remember the attitude of the Liberal Party
in the election of 1974 when from one end of this country to
the other scorn and ridicule was heaped on the very idea of
income and price controls, and in the Speech from the Throne
of September 30, 1974, no mention was made of controls. But
it did mention inflation. It said:

October 20, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

For Canada as well as for most of the world the most
serious problem is inflation; it is necessary both to deal
with its causes and to mitigate its effects.
The Speech went on to mention that this was going to be
achieved by increasing the supply of goods and services, and by
asking for voluntary restraint on the part of employers and
employees. There was still no mention of controls; inflation
was still a world problem, but it was a small step in the
direction that something could be donc in Canada by voluntary
restraint.
Honourable senators, it is history now that the government
finally decided it had been wrong in proclaiming that since
inflation was a world problem, Canada could do nothing about
it. It is history now that in the last election the Liberal Party
was wrong in ridiculing the idea of controls. And the result has
been that the government lost its credibility when it imposed
controls, having opposed them so vigorously and having persuaded the electorate that controls were unnecessary, unwise
and unworkable. In my opinion, the day is past when this
government can bring in a Speech from the Throne like the
one we are now considering, which in effect asks the Canadian
people to trust it. How can it expect to be given such trust? I
believe that if the government is sincere about the objectives
mentioned in the Throne Speech, then it must set out in very
specific terms the legislation it proposes to bring before Parliament to attain these objectives.
I was particularly interested in that part of the Throne
Speech dealing with unemployment. After mentioning that in
pursuit of the goal of a higher rate of employment certain
things need to be donc, it states that in some cases and
locations higher employment can only be achieved by direct
job creation by government. Without any doubt this is correct.
The Speech then went on to say:
You will therefore be asked to approve a comprehensive, year-round, direct job creation program, directed
particularly towards areas of chronic high unemployment.
Other programs will provide more job opportunities and
improved employment counselling for young people.
Honourable senators, coming from an area where there is
chronic high unemployment, I certainly hope the government
will bring forth its program without delay. Certainly, such a
program together with more job opportunities for young
people would have widespread support, but any delay in giving
the specifics of such a program will cause not only uneasiness
but also grave misgivings as to the very existence of such a
job-creating program.
Even now there is considerable unrest about the Local
Initiatives Program, which is in itself a job-creating program.
In many cases there has been substantial reduction in the
amount of money allotted to LIP. In the constituency where I
reside, for example, last year, that is the 1975-76 fiscal year,
$830,000 was allotted for LIP, and something over that
amount was actually granted. The allotment for the 1976-77
fiscal year has been reduced by almost one-half to $432,000.
In order to reassure the unemployed, therefore, I believe it is

80003-4

essential that the government announce its job-creating program at once, and I certainly hope it will do so.
Honourable senators, I do not propose to discuss the other
items in the Speech at this time, but one thing does disturb me,
because in my opinion it is a backward step. Let me just quote
from the Speech itself:
In the areas of medical insurance, hospital insurance
and post-secondary education, negotiations will continue
with the provinces concerning the gradual introduction of
new financial and administrative arrangements. These
changes would not only allow the provinces to exercise
greater flexibility in the provision of services, but would
also serve the federal government's goal of co-operative
restraint upon the rising cost of health and social security
programs.
We should have an explanation of just what is meant by that,
because surely the health and social security programs are the
very last things which should be tampered with, and any
attempt to do so should be strenuously opposed.
Honourable senators, I would not like to end my remarks
today on a note of even mild criticism; so I want to quote one
portion of the Speech with which I wholly agree:
The government also intends to increase programs to
enable young people from various parts of the country to
learn more about one another.
Of course, this again gives no details, but I would hope it
means that opportunities will be provided for young people to
visit parts of Canada other than their own homelands. Such
visits would be an effective way to remove any existing barriers
preventing people from different parts of Canada from understanding each other, and I believe that such a program,
involving young people mingling with other young people from
various parts of the country, would in time solve many of the
problems we face today.
Honourable senators, as the Speech from the Throne is so
general and so vague, I do hope that, when the debate on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne is over in both
houses, legislation will be introduced at once so that we can see
if the government has any effective programs to present to
Parliament, especially programs dealing with unemployment
and inflation.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I am sure we
were all most delighted to notice at the opening of Parliament
that His Excellency the Governor General had proceeded so
far along the road to recovery. And, if I may say, with respect,
of Madam Leger, it seems to me that the exhibition of ber
devotion to her consort, to his welfare and, certainly, to his
office, was matched only by the excellence of her performance
in this chamber that day.

•

(1420)

Like all honourable senators, I am more than delighted to
sec that Madam Speaker will continue to preside over our
affairs in this chamber. She is a distinguished and worthy
occupant of the Chair of the Speaker of this chamber, and she
has performed with distinction, not only within the chamber

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
but, as well, outside it. Just the other evening-and, unfortunately, I did not know about this program in advance-I was
flicking the dial on my television and all of a sudden saw the
portraits on the screen of Madam Speaker, Senator Walker
and Senator Forsey. It was obvious that they had been talking
about the Senate.
The person in charge of the program was the Honourable
Judy LaMarsh, and it was obvious that they had impressed
her, which is an achievement, I should think, and I am sure
that they impressed the viewing audience. It is my hope that
perhaps that program might be available to all senators at
some convenient time, because it seemed to be a particularly
good one. I congratulate Madam Speaker and her colleagues.
I thought, too, that we heard excellent speeches from the
mover and seconder of the motion for an Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne, Senators Lucier and Barrow. As
Senator Buckwold said, one speech was a cool breeze; the
other one a salty breeze. They spoke from the perspective of
two oceans, in this case, the Arctic and the Atlantic, not the
Pacific and the Atlantic. One was speaking about the problems
of what I think we must describe as a frontier in this country,
and the other about the problems of a long-settled area-the
problems, perhaps, of a more primitive society and the problems of the more developed, perhaps even sophisticated, society
of Nova Scotia.
What came out of both speeches was that, notwithstanding
that there are problems in both areas, as there are problems in
every area of Canada, both speakers emphasized the opportunities which are available to Canadians who live in their
respective regions, and both of them were optimistic about the
future. This is gratifying for parliamentarians to hear.
Honourable senators, the gracious Speech referred to Her
Majesty's visit to North America. The Queen and Prince
Philip went first to the United States and there, unquestionably, Her Majesty captivated and charmed the Americans as
much as George III and Lord North had outraged them in
1776. Her Majesty's visit to the United States coincided with
the bicentennial celebrations. I knew through people who had
personal experience at some of the events in which Her
Majesty participated, that they were not only delighted but
were most grateful for Her Majesty's presence in helping them
celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of U.S. independence.
The quality of the monarchy today is of a very high order
indeed. It was demonstrated again in the visit of Her Majesty
to eastern and central Canada, and perhaps in the unique
circumstances at the time of the Olympic Games in Montreal.
I think the Canadian journey had an additional aspect which
arose because of the presence in Canada, perhaps for the first
time outside the United Kingdom, of the entire royal family. It
was a personal and domestic aspect which was friendly, warming and reassuring.
Honourable senators, the speech I propose to make today is
somewhat different from those normally made on the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. On this occasion I feel
constrained to make some remarks about the Olympic Games

October 20, 1976
October 20, 1976

which were held in Montreal in July of this year. This was a
notable occasion. Too often we accept success without reflection, though reflection can be good for our souls and our
feelings as a people.
The Montreal Olympic project was not an initiative, nor a
responsibility, of the federal government, though I think the
response and assistance given by Ottawa were proper and
effective. That the Olympic Games project would be expensive
was expected, but that it would prove expensive beyond anyone's dreams was not. However, it was obvious that in order to
carry out an undertaking of such magnitude there was going to
have to be a lot of money spent.
Canada was the host, and as the host Canada performed
well and to her credit. The Games were directed from Montreal, perhaps from Quebec, but Canadians from all provinces
contributed and cooperated in making them a success.
At the time the games were to open serious problems arose.
There was, for example, the Taiwan issue and the withdrawal
of many of the African teams. That these two issues should
have emerged was regrettable. Certainly I might have been a
lot happier if the International Olympic Committee had been
left to settle the Taiwan issue. But I am not overcritical of the
decision of the Government of Canada to be forthright and
even to court criticism, as it did by objecting to a public
posture from the visiting Taiwan team which was deemed by a
great many Canadians to be objectionable in this country. The
withdrawal of the African teams was a loss to the athletic
programs of the games, and was detrimental to the feelings of
amity which otherwise existed among the participating
nations.
No one in this country, and few, if any, people in the
international community, would support apartheid, regardless
of where it is practised. But there is a time and a place to
register objections on counts of this kind, and I think it was
hardly appropriate for countries, most of whom are friends of
Canada, and most of whom have had the benefit and use of
our foreign aid programs, to threaten the success of the Games
for which many Canadians had worked so long and so hard.
It is to be noted from the gracious Speech that Canada's
foreign aid is to be maintained and developed. There is no
suggestion, either there or in programs that have been
announced, of retaliation against any of the countries that
withdrew from the Games, though Canadians would have
preferred to see more prudence and maturity displayed by the
governments concerned in this unfortunate development.
Both of these political developments evoked comment in the
media, on the editorial as well as the sports pages, but they
were not universally criticized. In some quarters, however, the
demand was made, "Let's give these Games back to the
athletes. Let's keep the politicians out of them." Of course, the
word "politicians" in the context in which it was used carried
all of its sinister implications. Honourable senators, I do not
propose to embark upon a defence of the actions and motives
of people in public life in this country, but I do point out that it
was the initiative and perseverance of the Mayor of Montreal,

When rising costs threatened the whole structure of the
event, another politician, the Honourable Robert Bourassa, the
Premier of Quebec, took his courage in bis hands and underwrote the financial commitments that had been made. He, too,
deserves commendation for decîding that the project, as a
project in Canada, should not fail at that late date.
There is another politician, Dr. Victor Goldbloom, who is
flot talked about very much. He is the Quebec minister whose
persistence and direction saw the enterprise through in the
face of difficulty with supply personnel and public criticism,
wben the whole enterprise could have been wrecked. From the
tîme Dr. Goldbloom took over, the ship remained on course,
and he should be given credit.
At this stage, may 1 add that 1 thought about making these
commendations several weeks ago, and I hope they will flot be
taken as part of the provincial election campaign in Quebec.
Senator Flynn: They would flot be very useful, anyway.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West): Not very mucb, either for
you or for me.
What about soaring costs and the financial crisis? For these,
the politicians will answer to their electors. This is the responsible course, and I am sure they are content to comply. There
is security, I suppose, for the spending in some of the impressive and valuable real estate that is now in place in Montreal
and elsewhere. There is a social advantage, too, in the architecture and the useful public facilities-the Stadium, the
Velodrome and the other installations. A great city and great
sports centre like Montreal will, I am sure, through the years
be able to use them to great advantage.
Everyone who watched the Gamnes on television was struck
by the superb coverage provided by the CBC. The selection of
events, the commentators, the transmission in both Canada
and abroad, were of the highest order.
For the Canadian Olympie Committee and the International
Olympic Committee there is, and should be, great acclaim.
The incredibly complicated scbedule of events, with participants speaking every language under the sun, was carried out
with precision and without delay.
One must surmîse, too, that the facilities for the events
which were staged were as good as they could be. Wben so
many records, botb Olympic records and world records, were
broken, not only must one admire the athletes who performed
these incredible feats, but also the people who designed and
installed the facilities where they performed.
Just recently the International Olympic Committee, meeting, I think, in Geneva, expressed some criticism of the heavy
security that was provided in Montreal. I do flot accept this
complaint. After what had happened in Munich and in
Mexico, the Olympics were on trial. Had there been a single
killing in Canada, the Olympic structure would have been

80003-4Y2

threatened for ail time, and, in my opinion, if one killing was
prevented the security provided justifiled îtself.
Let me speak briefly about tbe Games tbemselves. The
youth of the world may be getting older, but they are getting
better. Neyer have so many records been broken in a single
Olympic meet. Neyer has the competition been as keen. It is
worthwhile to remark that there would appear to be mucb
more satisfaction for the athietes and for their countries in
participating in athletic training and competition than being
involved in military posturing. One can only hope that in this
respect the Olympic ideal will prevail.
What, then, of the participants, the athietes who were in the
Games? Wbat namnes emerge? The Iist is very long and the
names will become, perhaps are, illustrious.
There was Comanechi, the Rumanian gymnast. She had the
grace of a ballerina, the virtuosity of a violinist, and when she
was motionless she looked like a Drcsden doîl.
There was the great Italian diver, Dibiasi, who had won the
gold medal on two prevîous Olympic occasions, and who won it
again this tîme.
There was Juantorena, the Cuban runner, who made older
fellows like myseif think of the great thrill we got when Percy
Williams won the i 00-metre dash many years ago.
There was the 30-year old Polish mother, Szewinska, who
won the 400-metre race, flot only in Olympic record time but
in world record time, and who has won on two other Olympie
occasions.
There was the great young East German swimmer, Ender,
Who won four gold medals, two of themn within a space of 27
minutes.
There was Alexeyev, the Russian weightlifter, probably the
strongest and perhaps the biggest man in the world.
There was Naber, the United States swimmer. He did flot
win seven medals, as Spitz did at Munich, but hie did win four
medals, and that is a tremendous achievement.
There was Drut, the French hurdler, who astounded the
75,000 people in the Olympic stadium.
There was Viren, the new "Flying Fin", who reminded older
viewers of the older "Flying Fin", Paavo Nurmi. Viren won
gold medals in the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres, and
was fifth in the marathon, although hie had neyer run the
marathon before, and bie did this two days after hie won bis
second gold medal.
Honourable senators, it is misleading to single out winners,
and it is equally misleadîng to single out so few. However, I do
think that when Jenner, the young Californian decathlon
champion, trotted around the Olympic stadium after his last
event, and after compiling the highest score ever in the decathlon-that most exacting series of tests that continued over two
days-75,000 people in the stadium knew they were looking at
the best athlete in the world. I do not suppose there was ever
an acclamation at the ancient Olympics in Greece, or a Roman
triumph, comparable to what hie receîved that afternoon-and
deservedly.

examination of ongoing programs. There is a proposal for the
Privy Council Office to make a series of examinations of
ongoing programs for Cabinet study, but this has not yet been
implemented, and I wonder if it really can be implemented.
Cabinet ministers are not people with a great deal of time on
their hands, and if they are going to take a long-term interest
in anything it would be with respect to legislation of a future
nature, rather than examining programs that already exist.
The Treasury Board, strangely enough, does not do this, but
deals with budget A and budget B. Budget A is a list of the
ongoing programs and additions thereto. Budget B, on the
other hand, deals with new programs and major alterations to
existing programs. The Treasury Board examines only budget
B, and it exercises control over spending in two ways. It says to
a department, "If you want new programs under budget B,
then you had better find the money by reducing budget A."
Alternatively, it says, "If you want money, you had better
reduce your real spending." Either way, the department
decides what is to be cut in the ongoing programs. This means
that the cut is confined to that particular department, and
there is no outside look at the ongoing programs to see which
should be amended, reduced or abolished.
0

(1450)

The House of Commons, in its case, looks at the estimates,
and refers the estimates of each department to the appropriate
committee, which hears evidence on those departments. The
problem in the House of Commons, of course, is that the
examination is a highly partisan process, and making a general
examination, such as they do in a partisan atmosphere and
being constrained by time, does not get at the root problem of
the policy and implementation of policy in ongoing programs.
One might ask, "Then what about the Auditor General?"
The Auditor General, under his mandate, can comment on
how government policies are carried out, but he is discouraged
from commenting on whether those policies are right or wrong.
It is true that the independent review committee made a
cautious recommendation-an extremely cautious recommendation-that perhaps the Auditor General might take a little
more interest in policy, but I question very much whether the
Auditor General would take a strong position in that element
of examining government programs.
Therefore, I suggest that here is a unique opportunity for
the Senate. We are in a position to make a detailed examination of a department or program. We can see how policies
which are in place have been implemented, and we can examine them to see if they are the correct ones for the people of
Canada. It seems to me that all this has pointed the way to a
meaningful job for the Senate Finance Committee, which is, as
I have said, to make a detailed examination of departments or
programs going to the root of the policy itself and how it is
implemented.
In addition, there is our annual study of the main estimates,
and of their effect on the economy; and, of course, from time
to time, a study of the supplementary estimates when they are
referred to the committee.

The committee has been moving in that direction over a
number of years. In 1971 it undertook the study which resulted in the report entitled Growth, Employment and Price
Stability, a major study of the Canadian economy in which we
invited outstanding witnesses from Canada and throughout the
world to give us the benefit of their knowledge on how the
Canadian economy operates and should operate. It is still one
of the definitive texts on the operation of the Canadian
economy, and made a number of departures from the conventional wisdom of the day-departures which have become
accepted today.
It suggested that the then norm of full employment being set
at 3 per cent unemployment was no longer valid and that, in
fact, full employment meant considerably higher than 3 per
cent unemployment. This freed the economic planners from
the concept that they had to get to 3 per cent unemployment,
which caused the economy to overheat.
We took a strong position against the concept of zero
growth, which was then very popular and pressed by the Club
of Rome, which has since taken a position not wholly dissimilar from the position taken in the Senate report.
We suggested a gradualism in the application of fiscal and
monetary policy as opposed to the then popular counter-cyclical policy. The concept of gradualism envisaged in the report,
Growth, Employment and Price Stability, has been accepted
in the United States and in many other countries.
In 1974 we made an examination of Information Canada. It
was our first experiment in trying to discover whether or not
the committee could take an intensive look at a program or
department. We chose Information Canada because of its size.
At that time its budget was $10 million, of which $4 million
was recovered from its book operations.
It turned out to be not a study of Information Canada but a
study of goveriment information services, which we would
presently estimate to cost in the neighbourhood of $200 to
$300 million per year. They were not under the control of the
Treasury Board but of the individual departments, and were
subject to an incredible amount of waste and duplication.
We made suggestions in that report as to the proper control
of those expenditures. We suggested also a detailed inquiry
system which would allow any Canadian throughout the
nation to telephone for information on government programs,
and detailed how it could be done at no cost to the citizen and
at a total cost to the government of $670,000 per year. We
brought to light the exorbitant rentals being paid by Information Canada for its book stores throughout the country.
Our final report, and the one we are dealing with today, is
on Canada Manpower. It is our first attempt at trying to
examine a major department in detail. Canada Manpower, in
the year under examination, spent $655 million. It was the
fourth largest program in government.
The question was: Could the Senate committee, with a small
staff, answer the question of whether, for an expenditure of
$655 million, the Canadian taxpayer was getting value for his

SENATE DEBATES
money. I would suggest, honourable senators, that the answer
is an unqualified yes.
I stated that the committee was assisted by a small staff. I
should like to say a word or two about that staff, because a
competent staff, albeit it small, is essential to the success of
this committee and many other Senate committees. The
resources of government departments are extremely large, and
therefore we have to have a competent staff who know the
questions which have to be asked and, most essentially, can get
the cooperation of the department, which we have been able to
do.
Therefore I should like to pay tribute, on behalf of the
committee, to the Parliamentary Centre and Mr. Peter Dobell,
and most especially to Mrs. Helen Small; to the Parliamentary
Library for lending us Mrs. Barbara Reynolds as our research
assistant; to our administrator, Greg Cocks; to the Committees
Branch, and to the staff of the Senate generally, for all the
assistance they have given us. Also, of course, I should personally like to thank the members of the committee for the
prodigious amount of work they did.
* (1500)

In looking at the report on Canada Manpower, you will see
that it is based on a number of hearings, submissions, investigations by the staff and visits-numerous visits-to Canada
Manpower centres and training institutions made by members
of the committee. One of the hallmarks of this report is that it
contains a comprehensive description of the way in which the
department operates. If you have never been exposed to the
operations of Canada Manpower, you can read this report and
understand immediately how it operates, how it is doing its job
and how it could do its job better.
There are three sets of major recommendations in the
report, and the first one is that Canada Manpower should not
operate like a private employment agency. It is in fact an
unemployment agency. It is an unemployment agency for the
reason that it cannot refuse to assist job seekers who want
help. And it must by its mandate fill vacancies from the job
seekers who are registered with it. That means that, unlike a
private employment agency, it cannot go out and hire somebody who has a job and who is not registered with the agency.
Now, regrettably, employers have been led to believe otherwise; they have been led to believe that there is very little
difference between a private agency and Canada Manpower.
The result is that when, as often happens, Canada Manpower
sends the employer a less than qualified applicant, and this
happens half a dozen or a dozen times, the employer eventually gives up listing his employment vacancies with Canada
Manpower, or he lists only the low-paying jobs. The result is
that Canada Manpower is caught in a vicious cycle. Employers
have generally lost confidence that Canada Manpower can
handle other than the low paying jobs, and, of course, qualified
employees begin to get the idea that Canada Manpower is not
the place to go because the good jobs are not listed there.
Our recommendations are along these lines: we say that
Canada Manpower, first of all, must level with the employers

October 20, 1976

and explain to them that their main obligation is to the
unemployed job seeker, and that it is from Canada Manpower
that the employers' job vacancies are going to be filled. In
addition to that, Canada Manpower must fully understand the
employers' job requirements so that they will know that the
person they refer is qualified to fill those job requirements. If
the person is underqualified, then they must inform the
employer that they are sending an underqualified person, and
in those circumstances they must seek the help of the employer
in taking an underqualified person, even if it means they have
to offer the employer training assistance to bring the qualifications of that job seeker up to the employer's level. We believe,
and with some justification, that employers would cooperate in
this type of request, that as a result the distrust that exists
between employers and Canada Manpower would disappear,
and that Canada Manpower would then be able to do a much
more effective job on behalf of unemployed job seekers.
The second area of recommendation is in the field of
training activities. Out of the $655 million spent annually by
Canada Manpower, $418 million is spent in training. We
believe that that training should be more related to the job
market as it exists today and to the job market which will exist
in the future. Therefore, we say that the Manpower Department, the manpower needs committees and the provincial
community colleges must be aware of and must offer training
courses that are more relevant to the job market, and Canada
Manpower must step up research in the future requirements of
the job market. We go further than that and say that Canada
Manpower should introduce competition for the training
dollar.
The bulk of skilled training is given by the provincial
community colleges, and I think some of their courses are
excellent. But you do not have to talk to very many businessmen to realize that there is a theoretical quality about the
training given by provincial community colleges, and that very
often graduates who come to a business environment require a
considerable amount of additional training to fit them for the
job. We suggest, therefore, that there should be more training
in the industrial environment and less in the theoretical environment of the provincial community colleges, because we
think that industrial training is more practical, and, because a
lot of the capital needs are in place, it would be less costly. So
we suggest that more dollars be directed towards industry in
order to train for their own staff requirements.
However, we go even further and suggest that industry
should be encouraged to develop skill training courses which
they would offer to Canada Manpower on a competitive tender
basis and in competition with the courses offered by the
provincial community colleges. We think that as a result
Canada Manpower would get a great deal more for its training
dollar, because it would have a comparison between the course
offered by industry and the course offered by provincial community colleges, and also because the provincial community
colleges for the first time would realize that there was competition for the courses and that, as competition always does,
would improve the quality of the courses and lower the cost.

SENATE DEBATES

To our amazement, when we got into training we found that
out of the $418 million spent annually on training, $100
million was spent on up-grading basic educational qualifications so that the people involved could take skill courses. Now,
it might be said that that must be because of immigration; it
must be because of teaching people language, and so on. Not
so. Three out of four of the people who required an up-grading
of basic educational qualifications were Canadian born. In
other words, the federal government is spending $75 million a
year on Canadians, and $25 million a year on immigrants, in
this respect, and is thus basically taking over a provincial
responsibility, and coping with a failure of the provinces to
educate people properly. So we recommend that this area be
the subject of intense negotiation between the federal government and the provinces.
* (1510)

The committee also recommends that training expenditures
be brought under strict parliamentary control, and if there is
to be any increase it should be fully justified to Parliament,
and that Parliament take the attitude that Canada Manpower
should first see whether, through industrial training or through
competition for the training dollar, we can get a lot more for
our expenditures.
Finally, in the major recommendations, we look at the
assistance that Canada Manpower gives to the disadvantaged
to obtain employment. Over $260 million was expended on
clients below the poverty line. No one would argue that aid
should not be given to the disadvantaged, but we say that
Canada Manpower must not lose sight of its core function,
which is to find jobs for unemployed job seekers who have
registered with Canada Manpower and who are job-ready or
can be made job-ready through the normal placement training
and counselling functions of Canada Manpower. What we
found was a tendency for Canada Manpower to move into the
welfare field. We have noticed this when we have looked at
other government departments. So we say to Canada Manpower, "Look, we realize that people who require welfare assistance are going to come to you, but your job is confined to
placement, to counselling and to training. Stop getting into the
welfare field. If people require welfare assistance, refer them
to the existing agencies that can do the job."
In this regard we noticed that one of the criteria for hiring
manpower counsellors was that they should have a socialworker background. Obviously, if you hire people who think in
those terms, they will tend to move policy that way. So we
make a strong suggestion that, in hiring placement officers,
Canada Manpower not hire people with a social-welfare background but rather people who have work experience, especially
in the lines for which they will be placement officers.
There are other recommendations on areas like private
agencies, the mandatory listing of jobs, the temporary help
field, job creation and evaluation programs, but I leave it to
honourable senators to read the report rather than take up
their valuable time now. I should, however, like to mention
some of the reactions to the report, because they are really
what are important.

How was the report received by the government, the public
and the department? Well, first of all, the then Minister of
Manpower and Immigration, the Honourable Robert Andras,
issued a statement which I should like to refer to:
The Report on Canada Manpower by the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance is a straightforward, constructive document that will be immensely helpful to us in our efforts to provide Canadians with a better,
more effective Manpower service.
Mr. Andras said be was grateful to the committee for pointing
out areas where changes and improvements were indicated,
and added:
I consider the committee's criticisms to be very helpful
and constructive ... I don't feel that the report is in any
sense an attack or an indictment. The members of the
Committee have called the shots the way they saw them,
and that is bound to be helpful to us. I am grateful to
them for the time and effort they have expended in their
study, and for the frankness and honesty they have shown
in their Report.
Mr. Andras also said that he and his officials would be
studying the report carefully, and implementing its many
worthwhile suggestions as quickly as possible. He hoped
employers, unions and others responsible for labour market
activities would do likewise.
Senator Rowe: Could you tell us the date of that statement,
Senator Everett?
Senator Everett: September 18, 1976, Senator Rowe.
That is the reaction of the minister, but what of the reaction
of the department? Well, the report has been sent to every
Canada Manpower centre in Canada. This week there is a
meeting in Ottawa of all Canada Manpower senior management people from across the country, and the report is a major
item on their agenda.
What of the editorial comments? This is from the Winnipeg
Tribune:

The Senate committee has shown outstanding ability to
penetrate the bureaucratic maze in Ottawa and to come
up with strong and clear cost-benefit studies of the operations of some of the government departments.
Margaret Piton, F. P. Publications, Ottawa Bureau:
The Senate Committee report makes a number of
useful recommendations for improving the operation of
the Manpower program.
Charles Lynch:
Senate Committee reports usually wind up on the
shelves but if the government could get its mind away
from its other problems for a moment, this report deserves
attention.
The Winnipeg Free Press:

The recommendations regarding the operations of
Canada Manpower put forward this week by the Senate's
Standing Committee on National Finance are as pertinent, logical and as easily understood as those it put

SENATE DEBATES
forward regarding Information Canada more than two
years ago.
The Senate Report on Manpower represents a thoughtful, non-partisan look at the problems of this government
department and offers some solutions to these problems
which should be carefully considered.
The Toronto Globe and Mail:
It is clear in which direction the changes should go and
the senators have given a useful push that way.
The Calgary Albertan:
The Senate Finance Committee in its latest careful
study has addressed itself to the basic question: whether
at $550 million, the sum requested for the operation of
the Manpower Division for the year under review,
Canadian taxpayers are receiving the full value for their
money?
This is not only the proper question, it is one that ought
to be posed with respect to other very expensive programs.
The Saint John Telegraph-Journal:
A word about the Senate Committee. Its membership
of 21 includes a formidable array of administrative, business and academic talent and experience, including no
fewer that four former provincial premiers, Smith and
Hicks of Nova Scotia, Robichaud of New Brunswick and
Manning of Alberta.
The FinancialPost:
Its recommendations, based on a year-long evaluation
of Canada Manpower, offer hope of closer cooperation
between the employment service and the private sector.
The report includes several proposals that newlyappointed Manpower Minister J. S. Cullen may wish to
heed.
Those are only examples of the reaction of the newspapers,
which was complemented by an equal reaction on radio and on
television.
What follow-up procedures do we have, having created this
interest, because the one question we are constantly asked is:
Will the report be implemented? We have developed procedures to help the process. First, we have invited the minister to
come before the commitee in order to comment on the report,
and to tell us where he agrees, and where he disagrees, with it.
Secondly, from time to time we propose to review the recommendations which have been agreed to and, from an examination of the estimates and government department activities,
determine whether those recommendations have been implemented. We will also ask the department to appear before the
committee to describe the action that has been taken.
In closing, honourable senators-and I apologize for taking
up so much of your time-the question I should like to pose is
this: What is the worth of the work of the Senate Finance
Committee? I suggest to you that it is worthwhile work. It is
work that is not done anywhere else in government. It gives the
public an input into the policy and operation of government
programs and departments. It gives the department a com-

October 20, 1976

parative standard on which its officials can judge their
performance against a non-partisan independent review. It is
of assistance to the minister, especially in the case of a new
minister, who, after all, on taking over a portfolio, has to
obtain his knowledge about the department in question from
the people who have been running it.
*

(1520)

In this instance, the Honourable Jack Cullen, for the first
time, will have a comprehensive report on the operations of the
department, the policies of the department as well as the
carrying out thereof, and a set of recommendations that he can
make use of in his discussions with departmental officials in an
effort to arrive at the type of policies that would be best for the
department.
Finally, in such undertakings we are helping to make government more efficient, and that is one thing that you can be
sure the public wants, and for which the Senate will get
immeasurable public support.
Honourable senators, I have spent the last half an hour or so
blowing the bugle of the National Finance Committee, and for
that I apologize. I did so because I think we are performing a
worthwhile task, and we can only continue it while we have the
support of honourable senators and the government. I suggest
to you that this is crucially important to the public of Canada
and to the Senate of Canada.
Senator Rowe: Honourable senators, I wonder if I might ask
a question of Senator Everett. Before doing so, I should like to
take this opportunity to congratulate him on a magnificent
presentation-one of the finest, in my view, that I have heard
in my five years in this chamber.
The honourable senator made reference to information services during the course of his presentation. As he will recall, I
had the privilege of serving on the National Finance Committee during the time of its inquiry into Information Canada,
and I was appalled, as were other members of the committeeand I use the word "appalled" deliberately-at the duplication
in the field of government information.
I understand that the government has now abolished all of
the Information Canada outlets across Canada. My question is
whether that decision was announced prior to the receipt of the
report of the National Finance Committee on Information
Canada, in which some of the government's information services were criticized?
Senator Everett: I thank the honourable senator for his
generous compliment. I hold him in high regard and his
compliment means a great deal to me.
In answer to his question, Information Canada was abolished after the report of the National Finance Committee was
issued.
Senator Flynn: Long after.
Senator Everett: Well, not that long.

excuse-I have always been extremely impressed by the usefulness of the Parliamentary Library and its staff, and the
effectiveness with which they respond to requests for help.
"Usefulness" is not very eloquent word, but it is a good word
to express what I mean in this connection. I speak here not
merely of their services in relation to the work of this committee, but of my own personal experience of the library and its
services.

Honourable senators, I think I have said enough to indicate
that I personally think that the work of the committee, as
illustrated by this report, is well justified. I think the chairman
takes the right line when he says that we are not really able to
make a thorough-going global examination of government
expenditures, but that we are qualified and able to make a
detailed examination of particular areas of expenditure. I
believe-and I can say this, I think, with less chance of having
the accusation of boastfulness levelled at me than most people,
since, as I say, I was there only a relatively short time-that
its activities as I observed them, and which have resulted in
this report, were excellent, and made a very useful contribution to the effectiveness of government. I think one of the"best
things that can happen to a government department is to have
this committee looking over its shoulder, and causing it to say

October 20, 1976

to itself, "I wonder what that Senate committee will say about
us?"
Senator Inman: Honourable senators, I wonder if Senator
Everett would permit a question? What happens to people who
refuse employment when positions are offered to them by
Canada Manpower? I know that people who have applied to
Manpower have refused to take the jobs they were offered.
Senator Everett: There is nothing Manpower can do if
somebody who applies for a job is sent to a vacancy, and then
decides it is a vacancy he or she does not want to fill.
Manpower, of course, cannot force them to work. Manpower
can only try to assist them with the facilities it has, and, if the
problem is more deep-rooted, refer them to the appropriate
welfare agency for whatever help is required. There are,
however, increasingly heavy restrictions being imposed by the
Unemployment Insurance Commission, so that if people persist in refusing to take jobs they can lose their entitlement to
unemployment insurance. As the honourable senator knows,
there has now been an amalgamation of the two departments.
This sort of operation will continue, and I think the intensity of
it will increase. It will, therefore, be increasingly difficult for
those who do not want to work to draw unemployment
nsurance.
On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.

Senator Connolly: Honourable senators, 1 risc on a point of
personal privilege. Yesterday when 1 was speaking in this
chamber I made a very serious omission froin the remarks that
1 had intended to make. 1 did flot acknowledge the work of the
Leader of the Government and of the Leader of the Opposition
in this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Connolly: 0f course, for any senator to do this is
like cutting bis life-line; it is însulting the boss, and 1 really
thougbt that I should risc in my place today and make amends.
I did intend to say, and I do say, now that I have been here for
a great many years and have seen leaders come and go. We
have two leaders in this house who are dedicated men. They
take second rank to no one in the day-to-day work of the
Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Connolly: If there is anything more to say it is this:
as leaders they become over-exposed. There is really no cure
for this. I recaîl that when I was the leader 1 got tired of
hearing rny own voice, but I do hope that the two leaders do
flot get themselves into that frame of mmnd.

Motion agreed to.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Rowe: We only need to look at what happened in
Italy or in Germany in recent days, and at what appears to be
happening, or is likely to happen, in England where, certainly,
the administration is on shaky ground. Demands are being
made from many quarters in England for a composite government to be set up in an effort to deal with the critical
situations affecting that country. Another example is the
situation in the United States. No one knows, I suppose, what
will be the result of the upcoming election in that country, but
no one, certainly, would want to bet any great amount of
money that the present administration will not be removed
from office.
So, we have this turbulence, this turmoil, at the political
level, and it is merely a manifestation, of course, of the turmoil
at the economic and social levels, and it is just as true here in
Canada as it is in other democratic countries and under other
democratically elected administrations.
I do not think I can be accused of having been unduly
partisan during the five years I have been a member of this
chamber. I am a Liberal. I make no bones about that. I am a
Liberal by philosophy, by ideology. I grew up that way, and I
certainly do not mean that entirely in the sense of the capital
"L" liberal.
Senator Flynn: There are very few of you.
Senator Rowe: Having said that, no one, I repeat, can
accuse me of having been unduly partisan during my years in
the Senate. Nevertheless, I want to say now that as a Canadian I feel we are very fortunate in having, as the head of the
administration in Canada, a man who has refused to panic, a
man who has faced up to these crises that are confronting us,
and while we may not agree with all the measures that his
administration has been responsible for, ai least we can attest
to his courage. I am very happy, as a Canadian, that at this
time we have a man possessing those characteristics heading
up the administration of this country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Greene: A non-partisan statement.
Senator Rowe: I do not apologize for making that statement
at all.
Senator Smith (Colchester): He is a vanishing breed.
Senator Rowe: In making reference to the administration,
may I also express, as a Newfoundlander-and here I know I
am echoing the sentiment of all Newfoundlanders-our
gratification at the recent appointment of Newfoundland's
representative in the federal cabinet to the important post of
Secretary of State for External Affairs. Those of us who know
and have known Mr. Jamieson, as I have, ever since he was a
boy, who know his background and who have followed the
extraordinary career of this man, whose father died when he
was only a boy, and who as a boy had to take on family
responsibilities, are very proud to sec how much he has accomplished, and what a splendid name he has made for himself,
not only in Newfoundland but in Canada as a whole. We are
all familiar with his great ability to communicate, and with

October 21, 1976

another characteristic that Newfoundlanders know better than
other Canadians do, namely, his tremendous ability to grasp
and comprehend. I predict that, in spite of the difficulties of
the times, Canada will have a good spokesman vis-à-vis the
rest of the world in the person of the Honourable Don
Jamieson.
*

(1420)

I said just now that Canada has many problems; indeed, the
problems she faces are greater and more complex than perhaps
at any time in her history. The very existence of these problems, and the very existence of the complaints we are making
and the dissatisfaction we are expressing, may lead us to forget
another fact, on the other side of the ledger, which has been
borne in on me and impressed upon me more and more
frequently in recent years as I have done a fair amount of
travelling in other countries of the world. I refer now to the
fact that there are millions, tens of millions, perhaps hundreds
of millions of people who, given the choice today to select any
country of the 140-odd on the face of this earth to which they
could emigrate, would select Canada as their first choice.
Senator Perrault: Hear, hear.
Senator Rowe: There has to be a reason for this. Why is it
that, given a choice, the people of Pakistan, of Sri Lanka, of
the Caribbean, would opt for Canada? It is surely not our
climate.
Senator Flynn: It is certainly not our government, either.
Senator Rowe: But there must be some reason for it, and I
believe the reason is that it has become part of the folklore of
these countries that Canada is a desirable place in which to
live. Speaking personally-and I am sure in saying this I echo
the feelings of the other 22½ million Canadians-I have no
desire to live in any country other than Canada on a permanent basis, and this is not in any way derogatory of any other
country.
I mentioned the millions who would like to come here. We
are already receiving a great many, and perhaps the time will
come on another occasion when I can elaborate on the problems that are inherent in that very fact. We 22½ million
Canadians occupy the second largest country, geographically,
on the face of the earth. It is a country with tremendous
resources, a country that is relatively unpopulated, and we
cannot expect to go on enjoying the physical advantages that
are present here in such abundance without being called upon
to share them with the disadvantaged peoples of the world.
This idea, of course, finds expression in their desire to emigrate from those disadvantaged and over-populated countries
to a country like Canada. We have a moral responsibilityand I would suggest that the dictates of common sense would
tell us that this is so-to accept, in so far as it is reasonably
possible, as many people from these countries as we can.
At this point, however, I would issue a word of caution.
Every time I go to England, as is the case with all of us who
have visited England in recent years, I cannot help being
alarmed by the problems created as a result of what was, for a
period, virtually uncontrolled immigration into that country.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

At this point I should like to draw the attention of honourable senators to an essay which appeared in, I think, the
August edition of a periodical which, in my view, is one of the
best in the English literary world. I refer to the Illustrated
London News. The article is by that great and respected
historian, Sir Arthur Bryant, and deals with the problems
inherent in immigration. I would strongly recommend this
article to every public man and woman in Canada who is
concerned about the problems of immigration and the responsibilities inherent in a discussion of those problems. I will not
say anything more about it now, other than to say that this
article by Sir Arthur Bryant is one that every Canadian
occupying a position of public responsibility should read.
Having attested to the fact that we do have good things here
in Canada, I do not think we should allow that to deter us
from talking about our defects and examining those defects,
with a view, of course, to remedying them. As I said earlier, I
do not intend to go into great detail, and it is my intention and
hope not to repeat myself too much.
In recent days I have been receiving, as I am sure other
senators have, publications coming from the Advisory Council
on the Status of Women. These are well worth reading. They
come from a responsible body that has been examining, in
particular, the problems associated with injustices to and
discrimination against women in our Canadian society, some
of which injustices are entrenched in the Criminal Code of
Canada.
This is a subject to which, it seems to me, we must increasingly give more attention. I am not thinking only of the aspect
I have just mentioned, discrimination against women or the
rights of women. I am thinking of the administration of justice
and law enforcement throughout the spectrum. This country,
which has so many advantages and so many blessings, has one
of the highest, if not the highest, jail populations, on a
percentage basis, in the free, democratic world. There must be
a reason for that. That very fact alone should be cause for
concern.
Are there in our jails people who should not be there? We
know our jails are overcrowded. Are people in them who
should not be there? I do not mean that they have not been
guilty of some wrongdoing, or have not broken the law. I am
sure the majority of those in our jails have broken the law in
one way or another. The question is: Should everybody who
breaks the law be put in a penitentiary? Are there people who
at present are put in penitentiaries for certain misdemeanours
and infractions of the law who should not be put in a
penitentiary?
Related to that is another question, to which I think the
answer is obvious. Do we have, increasingly, people walking
our streets who should be in a penitentiary and who are not
there?
Senator Greene: Like the Leader of the Opposition!
Senator Rowe: The matter that troubles me, which I have
mentioned before, is this: We are confronted with a physical
fact-the physical fact that our law enforcement agencies are

finite. They are so much and no more. Therefore, it becomes a
matter of priority, and priority itself becomes a very serious
matter. I shall not go into detail, but we read in the newspapers a couple of weeks ago that in one city in Canada, in order
to deal with a situation that was undesirable, the normal detail
of 10, I believe, officers assigned to deal with it was increased
by 60, making a total of 70 officers of the law who were
concerned with this problem over a period of weeks and
months. Here, I say, the question of priority enters the picture.
* (1430)

As I said, I do not wish to go into detail, but we know that
for a period the law enforcement agencies and the courts of
Canada were preoccupied with the problem of soft drug users.
No one in his right senses would wish to encourage the use of
either soft drugs or hard drugs. Again we have this matter of
priority. Having a finite quantity, and quality also, for that
matter, of law enforcement resource, the question is one of
how best to apply it. We have experienced generally in
Canada, I think, an increase during the last two or three years
of robbery with violence. We have certainly seen during the
last ten years an increase in murders of one kind or another.
We have had an increase in criminal assault. There has
been, as the Advisory Council on the Status of Women has
pointed out, an increase in rape-criminal assaults on women
particularly, but also on children. As to the latter, I was
interested, when reading the literature submitted to us, to
learn of what to my mind are some appalling facts. Of all the
rape cases officially reported during the last year for which we
have statistics, only 17 per cent ended up in court. Of all cases
that were reported, 7 per cent resulted in convictions. I repeat,
out of every 100 cases of rape officially reported only 7
convictions were registered in the courts. Does this mean that
93 out of every 100 women lodging complaints of that nature
were lying or making up stories? Of course not. We know also
that judges, police, welfare workers and doctors tell us that the
number of rape cases reported is insignificant compared with
the number that actually occur. So we are left with this fact: If
only 7 per cent of the cases reported end up in convictions, the
probability is that only 2 or 3 per cent of the actual incidents
of rape result in conviction.
Then there is the matter of child abuse, and our attention
has been focussed on the fact that quite literally thousands of
children are battered and brutalized by parents and other
adults, and that every year several hundred children lose their
lives because of this. How much emphasis are we placing on
that problem? We can provide and detail 60 police officers for
the other undesirable situation, but what about the battered
and brutalized children? I acknowledge that this is a very
difficult area of operation because it involves the family.
However, the question in my mind is: What are we doing
about it?
We know that in our society, especially in the cities and
urban areas, loan-sharking, extortion and intimidation are
being practised on a huge scale, and that as a result the victims
are forced into crime that they would not otherwise commit.

SENATE DEBATES
This is a pretty well established fact. Again I ask the question:
What are we doing about it?
It seems to me that we must examine-"we" being the
people of Canada-this whole matter with a view to determining priorities. We do not have sufficient law enforcement and
court resources to deal with all the problems and solve every
criminal case. However, surely we should be doing more with
respect to some of those which, in my opinion, are far more
serious problems of society. The fact that an innocent threeyear old child is battered to death is, in my opinion, a far more
serious matter than the fact that a twenty-year-old college
student smokes marihuana. However, if that is the intent of
the Criminal Code and the opinion of the law enforcement
agencies of Canada, in recent years it certainly has not been
manifested in any way of which I am aware.
I want to make it clear that I do not question the right of
cities, municipalities, provinces or, for that matter, federal
agencies, to enforce the laws, whether they be those with
respect to marihuana or some of the other problems to which I
have alluded. However, I do question our sense of priorities. I
will summarize my remarks on this matter by saying that these
facts are apparent to me and, I believe, to a great many other
Canadians. There are more people in jail than should be there.
To put it in another way, there are many people in the jails of
Canada who should not be there. Many people are loose on the
streets who, with a proper sense of priority on the part of the
governments and the authorities concerned, would not be loose
and jeopardizing the lives of innocent people. The situation is
so bad that one cannot even walk, we are told, at the back of
the Parliament Buildings without the danger of being assaulted, mugged or something of that nature. In my latter comment
I am repeating something I have read, but certainly there are
parts of our cities in Canada in which we do not dare to walk
alone at night or, in some cases, during the daytime. I do know
that certain segments of our society, particularly women and
children, are not adequately protected. When only 2 per cent
of all the incidents of rape result in conviction, there is
something wrong. I suggest that our limited law enforcement
resources are being dissipated to deal with admittedly undesirable situations while other more serious problems of society
are neglected. That is all I have to say in that respect.
I wish to say a word or two regarding bilingualism, with
which I shall conclude. We are given to understand by the
Speech from the Throne that it is the intention of the government to shift its emphasis in this matter. Perhaps I am
oversimplifying it at this point, but it has now been recognized
that rather than endeavouring to force or cram a new language
down the throat of a fifty-year old civil servant, perhaps there
is some other, more rational way to approach this matter. This
has reminded me of something which is not new in my
thinking, something which I have thought about before.
* (1440)

It seems to me that when this matter of bilingualism first
emerged in a serious way, in the late 1950s or early 1960s-I
am referring to the right of each of the two founding races in
Canada to enjoy the use of its own language, and the need for

October 21, 1976

each race to be able to approach government agencies in the
language of its choice-the government of the day ignored the
fact that it was dealing not with a racial problem, or a
government administrative problem, but a pedagogical
problem.
I read in the press yesterday of an experiment being conducted in Toronto in which children in grades 1 and 2 are
learning two languages with no difficulty. The newspaper
article refers to it as being something new. There is nothing
new about that. Educators all over the world have known that
fact. There is no need to conduct an experiment of that kind.
Honourable senators may recall that President Conant of
Harvard University was appointed chairman of a United
States presidential committee on education. I have not recently
refreshed my mind on this but, speaking from memory, it was
either a presidential committee or an important United States
commission. It is also my recollection that the committee or
commission was established shortly after the end of the Second
World War. Senator Croll might recall the date.
The findings of that commission were published and given
widespread circulation. Its report became one of the great
educational documents of our time. It was entitled Education
in a Free Society, and was published over the name of the
distinguished American educator I have mentioned.
In educational and scientific publications the fact was
stressed over and over again that if one is to learn a second
language, the time to start is the cradle, or as soon after the
cradle as is humanly possible. We are now being told that we
should put the emphasis on learning a second language in our
classrooms. We are now giving thought to that after spending
millions of dollars in an artificial and largely futile attempt to
make Canadian adults adept in two languages.
When Senator Bonnell and I were in Switzerland last year
we met many Swiss who spoke three, four or five languages,
and some spoke six languages. Almost all the Swiss seem to be
able to speak two or more languages with no great difficulty.
However, they did not start learning those other languages
when they were 45 years old.
A few days ago, while travelling to Ottawa by plane, I was
in conversation with a stranger who occupied the seat next to
mine. From the way he spoke I thought he was an Anglophone. Regrettably, while I can read French reasonably well, I
cannot speak it with any degree of facility. We conversed in
English. When we exchanged cards at the end of the flight, I
said to him, "You have a French name," and he replied, "Yes,
I am French. I was born in Quebec. I am a French Canadian."
He told me his native language was French, and when I asked
him to explain how he could speak English with no accent at
all, he said, "My mother was English and I spoke English with
my mother, but I spoke French with my father. I have no
problem at all."
If honourable senators will permit a personal analogy, one of
my sons is married to a French Canadian. They have two
children, the elder of whom, a little boy, is now five years old.
That little boy has never spoken a word of French to me in his

October 21, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

life. He speaks to me always in English. When he visits his
French Canadian grandparents at Shawinigan, he speaks flawless French with no difficulty at all. Each day his mother
speaks to him only in French. She does so deliberately,
although she is perfectly bilingual. However, when he is with
his father he has no choice but to speak English. My son's
children are growing up in that manner. There is a lesson to be
learned in that situation, which is multiplied a thousand times
across Canada.
The important thing is that if this country is to become
bilingual-and I hope the time will come when most of us will
be bilingual-the approach should be through our children
and our schools.
I suggest, honourable senators, that if the money which has
been spent on bilingualism during the past 10 to 15 years had
been applied to providing adequate and competent French and
English teachers in Canadian schools in areas where they were
needed, perhaps we would now be well on the road to solving
the problem of bilingualism.
I am not aware that the government approached any educational body in the early days of the introduction of bilingualism. Perhaps it did. If so, it certainly kept the fact well hidden.
I wish now to make two comments in the form of a cliché.
First, I do not think there is any disagreement about the fact
that the rights of the two founding peoples of Canada have to
be protected in this matter. I am sure that no fair-minded
person would disagree with that. The second point is perhaps
not quite so obvious. There is a danger that the problem of
bilingualism could activate the forces of bigotry, chauvinism
and racism-forces which are under the surface but always
ready to emerge. Surely we do not need to be told that, or to
argue about it. Those forces are always there. We saw those
forces emerge in the Germany of the 1930s, and they are
emerging in London at the present time. Those forces exist in
Canada at this moment, and they can emerge in such a way as
to threaten the continuing unity of this country. I suggest to
honourable senators that the months and years ahead will be a
test of the good will, common sense and decency of Canadians.
We tend sometimes to live in a fool's paradise. This country
can be Balkanized. I repeat, this great nation, making up half
a continent, can be Balkanized, with all the serious implications arising from that.
It is also possible that the relatively civilized way of life
which we now enjoy could be threatened by violence and
terrorism. Indeed, there is a potential in Canada for such
insanity-I use the word deliberately-which has already characterized the history for the past several years of another
country related to us by political, religious and ideological
bonds, and by ties of blood. That potential exists in Canada,
just as it is a reality in that other country to which I refer.

displayed on that television program which Senator Connolly
(Ottawa West) mentioned yesterday.
Senator Connolly also mentioned that our colleagues Senator Forsey and Senator Walker participated in that program,
and while watching it I took a great deal of pride in listening
to these three colleagues of ours describing the work of the
Senate, the role of the Senate and its place in the parliamentary democracy of which we are a part. I must say that it
seemed to me that the Honourable Judy LaMarsh was easier
on them than she was on me when I was on her hotline show
some little time ago in Vancouver, but our colleagues took
advantage of that kindness and pressed on to make it a very
interesting and, indeed, valuable show.
Honourable senators, how can I follow Senator Connolly in
his tributes to our leaders? I do not think I should even try. I
can only say that we are very fortunate indeed to have men of
that ability and of such honourable aspect as leaders of our
respective parties in the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Senator Stanbury: Senator Lucier and Senator Barrow have
been the recipients of sincere congratulations, so they do not
need any more from me. They upheld the best and finest
traditions of the Senate in their speeches moving and seconding this motion. Senator Lucier tells me that that was the first
time he had made what might be called a prepared public
speech. If that was the effort of an amateur, then all I can say
is that I am very much looking forward to what it will be like
when he becomes a professional.
I noticed when I entered the Senate today that my name is
now the second to last in the first half of the members of the
Senate listed in order of seniority on the board in the corridor.
That reminded me that in eight short years we have lost
through retirement, resignation or death more than 50 per cent
of our colleagues who were here at the time of my appointment. It was also a poignant reminder that we had lost my
good friend, Senator Harper Prowse. He was a man who was
articulate, intelligent, persuasive and credible. He was a man
with a great enthusiasm for both life and humanity.
I have taken this opportunity of speaking on matters related
to the Speech from the Throne because I am worried about the
general mental attitude displayed by Canadians these days.
There is an aura of discontent which is very hard to define.
Part of it is no doubt due to the revolutionary period we are
living through, and the feeling of insecurity caused by changing moral standards, and changes in the pecking order of
society, which have elevated great sections of labour into the
middle and upper-middle class and reduced the commercial
value of a university education. Some of it may be due to the
recognition that, having moved through a period of great
a (1450)
affluence and careless exploitation of our resources, we are
Hon. Richard J. Stanbury: Honourable senators, may I going to be required to take much more care, and some of it
begin by expressing my admiration for Madam Speaker, not may be due to the fact that our institutions have become so big
only because of her increasing confidence in conducting the and so complex that we can feel no identity with them or any
affairs of this chamber but also because of the great talent she sense of the way in which they are intended to serve us.

SENATE DEBATES
I know, honourable senators, that there are not very many
things that you and I can do about some of these mattersthey are facts which we have to face both as government and
governed-but what we can do is use the tools available to us,
understand their limitations, and refine and mold them the
better to serve our society. And that is precisely what the
Speech from the Throne is all about.
The most important tool we have available to us is our
system of parliamentary democracy. I recently attended an
international conference at which the theme discussions centered around "The Decline of Parliamentary Democracy." It is
not difficult to demonstrate that there has been a decline in the
number of countries governed in accordance with the principles of parliamentary democracy, and particularly, because of
the problem of the great population of India, the number of
people so governed as well. If I remember correctly, Senator
Perrault gave us the figures the other day when he said that
now only about 17 per cent of the world's population is so
governed. Depending on one's interpretation of what a parliamentary democracy is, there are somewhere between 20 to 50
parliamentary democracies represented in the United Nations,
which is comprised of 144 sovereign states.
The discussion at that conference prompted me to think
through the evidences of weakness of parliamentary democracy, and I came to the conclusion that parliamentary democracy is not in decline in all respects, that it is well worth saving,
and that we can save it in our country.
Here in Canada it is only 15 years since the cabinet was
all-powerful in decision making, with caucuses and party
organizations having little part to play in that process. Now
there is a strong caucus in each party exerting considerable
influence, and a party organization which develops policy and
monitors its implementation. So in actual operation, parliamentary democracy is improving, not declining. It still needs
mechanical changes, but it is getting increasingly better. This
is amply demonstrated by both chambers of our Parliament.
Parliamentary democracy also provides effective government. During the difficult sixties other regimes were repressing demonstrations. Parliamentary democracies, on the other
hand, were co-opting the revolution, reacting positively to
demands, and were succeeding in rolling with the punches,
thus avoiding repression. It is where parliamentary democracy
failed to deal with those situations that it disappeared-for
instance, in India.
Where parliamentary democracy is in trouble is in terms of
public acceptance. Why is that? It is because people are better
educated, better informed, have higher expectations and are
released from many old taboos. Consequently, parliamentary
democracy has been under a much closer and much more
sophisticated examination. Its warts are showing. And parliamentary democracy, having its base in traditions and established institutions, has found it difficult to respond quickly
enough to this new examination.
That is not a fatal weakness in the system, honourable
senators. It is, indeed, its great strength in that it can undergo

October 21, 1976

a type of examination which the autocratic systems cannot
stand, and it can adjust itself to the results.
As a result of this examination, we now have election
expenses legislation, conflict of interest legislation, right-toknow legislation, and participatory techniques for involving the
public in the process. All of these have either been brought
into being or are heralded in the Speech from the Throne.
But there are many things still to be done. Perhaps the most
important one is to balance the present media monopoly with
other methods of communicating with the public. People are
now getting only interpretive-in other words, biased-reporting, which is almost entirely negative, and not just against the
government but against the whole parliamentary process. How
can any institution survive such a barrage of destructive
comment for long without seeking to balance it in some way?
Certainly there must be an unfettered press to act as one of the
vehicles for the continued examination of government, but
there must also be some means of letting the public see the
facts and actions at first hand so that they can judge.
* (1500)

A perfect example of how that balance cari be effected is to
be seen in the way in which the American political system
handled the Watergate situation. The media, as part of the
examination process, dug out the story. But there was great
danger that in their unbridled enthusiasm they would ruin
reputations, and that citizens might be provoked to violent
action based on emotional stories. Congress then stepped in
with the Irvine and Rodino committees to lire-empt the media
and to lay all of the sworn facts befoSe the public in a
straightforward manner. Once the facts are properly laid
before a responsible public, no amount of interpretive reporting can destroy its good judgment.
So we must look for ways to accomplish this balance in our
system-more topical debates in Parliament; television coverage of Parliament; committees organized to use the media;
media time and space for parliamentarians to be devoted to
serious topical parliamentary matters, both in separate blocks
and as part of an integrated news service; and more frequent
criticism of newsmen's interpretations through a proper media
council. The Throne Speech begins this'process by proposing
the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House of Commons.
It does not go far enough, but it is a start.
Another tool we have available to us is the excellent Public
Service of Canada. I say "excellent" advisedly because, in my
limited contact with the public service, I have found those I
have had to deal with intelligent, helpful and dedicated to the
general wellbeing of the people of Canada. But even they
would agree that the public service, with its structures and its
practices, could stand a thorough examination and assessment
in light of where it has been and where it is going, and what its
proper role is in relation to the people of Canada. I appreciate
that when the Throne Speech records the limited growth of the
public service during last year, and promises a further limitation to 1 per cent growth during this year, it implies that the
pressures of limited growth will cause re-thinking of demands
for additional personnel, but much more than that is required.

SENATE DEBATES

It is now 15 years since Mr. Glassco made his study, and the
public service today bears no resemblance to the public service
of that time. Medium-level public servants have told me they
are sure that, if they looked around their departments, they
could cut $200 million without its even being noticed. Mind
you, when they are asked to be more specific, they all have the
same problem as the Treasury Board. Every official, from
deputy minister down to head of section, bas good reasons why
he needs the people, the equipment and the space he bas, and
why he needs a great deal more. Internal reorganizations
simply become games of musical chairs. Nothing is ever
reduced in size; everything always grows. A fair share of the
blame must be accepted by the politicians, because it goes
back to political decisions.
It is time for a new, objective look at the leviathan, but only
after Parliament bas thought out and set down what it is the
people of Canada want the public service to do for them. With
such a set of principles in hand, competent management
consultants could tell us what we need to do; without them, the
exercise would be fruitless. It may well be that this is a task
the Senate should undertake-a study of the role that the
public service should play in relation to the government and
the people of Canada.
In the Speech from the Throne, and in the document
entitled The Way Ahead, the government has been very frank
in outlining the options which are available to Canadians. If
we opt for the middle road as defined in both the Speech and
The Way Ahead, it will have implications for the Public
Service of Canada different from those in either of the other
two options outlined. Personally, I agree with the Prime Minister that we should choose the middle way-neither socialism
with its smothering paternalism, nor unfettered enterprise with
its devil-take-the-hindmost philosophy.
Since His Excellency delivered the Throne Speech, I have
heard time after time from the opposition and the media that
the Prime Minister has backed away from what he said on
December 28 of last year. The fact is he never said what most
people think he said at that time. That was an invention of the
media. What he said was:
Obviously, some have very doctrinaire and ideological
solutions-it's just a matter for the government to step in
and take over the big corporations and everything will be
solved. That is not our view. Others at the other extreme
say bring back the market economy and everything will be
solved. Well, we don't think that extreme is possible
either. So I don't say that the long-term answer is necessarily a greater involvement of the state. I am saying that
we need an intervention of the state now to give us a
breathing space. We have to be more and more concerned
with a blunt fact that the market economy does not exist
in its pure form. We cannot return to that ideal society
where the state doesn't have to regulate. I hope we won't
have to continue to regulate as much as we are now in the
height of this anti-inflation control system. If we find that
the trade-off between unemployment and inflation is not
as costly as it bas been, then we won't need to have any

more state controls in the future than in the past. It will
depend really on all of us and how we think through the
next two or three years.
And now the Prime Minister is asking us to think it through
and come to conclusions with respect to how we want to live,
and the kind of self-discipline we are prepared to exert upon
ourselves to make it possible to live in that way. He recommends the middle way which bas, after all, been the Canadian
way for generations. Those who suggested in December that
Mr. Trudeau had become a raving socialist, and those who
suggest now that he has flip-flopped, are the people who are
trying to mislead the public.
I hope that in addition to studying the legislation which will
arise as a result of the Speech from the Throne, the Senate will
perform two basic tasks: first, study and debate The Way
Ahead; and, second, prepare a careful definition of the kind of
public service we will need to serve the Canadian people and
their future objectives.
Parliament and the public service are the most visible levers
of power in a parliamentary democracy. They are the ones
seen most clearly by the public and are the ones where
credibility is most important. However, there are other tools,
including administrative boards, contractual arrangements,
crown corporations and, indeed, political parties. The Speech
from the Throne does not deal with these other areas so I shall
not spend time on them today. Perhaps it is sufficient to say
that every arm of government, every emanation of the parliamentary system, must be seen to be attentive to the public,
responsive to the public and fair to the individual. So long as
governmental agencies take high-handed action, take advantage of their power to do something which a private individual
may not do, or are seen as anything but the protectors of
human rights, then the people's respect for the whole process
of parliamentary democracy and their willingness to accept the
rules of society voluntarily will be in question.
The Speech from the Throne deals at some length with the
important role which the government expects business enterprise, particularly small business enterprise, to play in the
maintenance of dynamism and stability in the Canadian
economy after the removal of wage and price controls. I
suspect there is no one in this chamber who would not applaud
those objectives. I think there has been a tendency over the
years-perhaps since the days of C. D. Howe-for successive
governments and mandarins in the public service to concentrate their efforts on putting together units of capital and
technology big enough to do the massive things which have to
be done by business in Canada and, as Canada's agents, in the
world.
There have been two false assumptions. The first is that
Canada's small businessmen are so independently minded and
self-sufficient that they need and want no particular help from
government. The second is that no differentiation is needed
between small and big businesses when it comes to government
demands for accounting and statistical procedures. Well, with
the reorientation of the old Industrial Development Bank into
the Federal Business Development Bank, and with the promise

SENATE DEBATES
of the Throne Speech to reduce the red tape for small businesses, the government is making it clear that it now appreciates that both of those assumptions were wrong-and that is
all to the good. But it must be remembered that we still have
great inadequacies in the operation and capacity of our big
businesses.
*

(1510)

The Honourable Jean Chrétien, in a recent speech, told the
Canadian Export Association frankly that while he and his
department would do everything possible to obtain the necessary agreements, organize the necessary missions, and open the
necessary doors around the world, it would be up to the
businessmen of Canada to walk through those doors and to do
business where there was business to be done.
The fact is, honourable senators, that the businessmen of
Canada have not been out in the world selling, with the
exception of a few major national and multinational companies, some of which sell primary products while others are
proving that it really is possible for processing or manufacturing companies in Canada to invade world markets.
I realize that there have been reasons for Canadian businessmen to stay home, or reasonably close to home. Many
large companies in Canada which might normally export from
Canada are prevented from doing so by restrictions placed
upon them by their head offices in some other country.
Another factor is that the United States has been so close and
so amenable to Canadian products that Canadian businessmen
have been able to stay close to home and still sell all of their
production. A further factor, and a very important one, of
course, is that we have not been as .hungry as other nations.
Japan, Belgium, Holland, Italy and others have no choice but
to market aggressively. They have no resources of their own;
they live by adding value to someone else's product and
exporting. If they cannot find customers, they die, and that has
been the source of the problems of some of those nations
during the recent worldwide recession. Our businessmen have
not had that kind of motivation.
In the days ahead we must move out into the world and sell,
and we must find the means of selling, not only primary
products but our technological skills, our ability to deal in
either of two international languages, and our highly competent labour and management capacities. This means that we
have to solve some of our problems at home. The government,
in the Speech from the Throne, has put considerable emphasis
on finding the techniques of solving our labour-management
problems. And that certainly must be done. We will not be
able to do really well, either at home or abroad, until we have
set aside our petty grievances and settled down to working
together for the good of the nation. But even if we settled that
problem tomorrow, our foreign trade would increase very little.
What we have to begin to realize is that the world is not the
same as it was. We have depended all these years on a pattern
of continuing economic growth in North America. Now the
massive growth is taking place in other parts of the world.
I pause to refer to the August 1976 issue of Fortune
magazine, which lists the principal nations of the world in

October 21, 1976

order of economic growth. It cites, first, Saudi Arabia, followed by Iran, Brazil, Turkey, Algeria, Spain, Japan, Greece,
and then Canada. Canada ranks eighth in the world in terms
of economic growth. Our traditional trading partners, the
United States and Britain, are twentieth and twenty-first
respectively in terms of economic growth.
We have to move into those areas of the world where there
is growth and where markets are available to us. Fortunately,
we have a great deal going for us in this regard, such as the
fact that we are now the only industrialized country in the
world with a contractual link with the European Economic
Community-and that presents fantastic opportunities for
Canadian businessmen, if they are only there to take advantage of them-and the fact that Spain is now anxious to do
business with us. Spain stands on the threshold of the European Economic Community, just as we stand on the threshold
of the great markets of the United States.
We have signed, or are about to sign, trade agreements with
countries of the Middle East with the greatest business potential for us. The principal need of those countries at the present
time is for infrastructure-roads, railways, power plants,
sewers, pipelines, harbours, air fields, farms, fisheries and
forestry. All of these areas are meat and drink to us, and we
should be the ones who are supplying the major share of those
needs. But we are not there; or if we are, we are there in the
form of consortia which are headed up by consulting engineers. I love consulting engineers-if it were not for them,
there would be no Canadian presence in the Middle East at
all-but consulting engineers were never meant to be the
fulcrum for a consortium which is going to have to enter into
multimillion-dollar, and even billion-dollar, deals. Consulting
engineering consortia are put together by each of several
organizations throwing $5,000 into the pot for travel money. If
they lose a foreign bid they are lucky, because the federal
government picks up at least part of their costs. If they win it,
their troubles begin. They have to find the capital, the suppliers, the contractor, and the labour to fulfill their obligations.
It is like putting together an ad hoc hockey team to play the
Russian pros-sometimes it works but, more often, it does not.
The pros-the West Germans, the Russians, the Japanese, the
Americans, and the French-go into the competition with a
structure all put together and headed by a business organization with convincing capital formation. They throw in the
engineering consultants free of charge. Until we can persuade
the corporations which have the big formations of capital in
Canada-Argus Corporation, Power Corporation, and so onor those corporations which have major potential as suppliers-such as General Motors, Westinghouse, and Canadian
General Electric-to take the leadership in such consortia, we
will never be convincing as builders of major turnkey projects
in the world.
Since I have already taken the liberty of mentioning two
tasks which the Senate might undertake, I now suggest that
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce undertake a study to determine how government policy
and incentive might be used to encourage the organization of

SENATE DEBATES

Canadian business in such a way as to take advantage of the
opportunities available to Canadians in international trade in
both commodities and services.
Honourable senators, I have already spoken for too long. I
wanted also to discuss with you this afternoon the need for
attention to be paid to the subject of tourism in Canada. It is
sufficient for the moment to remind you that at one time the
Senate had a Standing Committee on Tourism, and perhaps it
would be appropriate for the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce, under whose jurisdiction this
concern now resides, to initiate a fresh study of tourism in
Canada.
If there is any message to be drawn from my ramblings this
afternoon it is that, even from what the honourable Leader of
the Opposition has called a vague and general Speech from the
Throne, it is relatively easy to see that, if we take up all of the
challenges contained in the Speech, the Senate will have more
than enough to do during the coming session. I am excited by
the prospect, and look forward to participating with my colleagues in the work ahead.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators, as usual, I shall
be very brief.

[Translation]
Honourable senators, for the time being I would like to
dispense with the traditional remarks which round off the
opening of a parliamentary session. I would simply like to
thank all participants, regardless of their titles and functions.
If I make the effort to participate today, it is not to be
critical, even less to endorse the Speech from the Throne of
this session, but rather to support my colleagues who, because
of their limited number, must bear the full workload of the
opposition in a democracy such as ours.
[English]
Honourable senators, as I said, it is not my intention either
to be critical or supportive of the Speech from the Throne as
read by their Excellencies, the Governor General and Madam
Léger. I only wish to support my colleagues who, despite their
restricted numbers, have had to bear the workload of the
official opposition in the Senate.
•

(1520)

As you know, I used to enjoy the debates in this chamber,
and I had the greatest respect for those who did not share my
views. The difficulties I now experience in speaking fluently, as
a result of the loss of many faculties, do not allow me to
engage in discussions of controversial subjects. I had very little
brain to start with, and there has been no improvement.
During the five years when I was able to participate in the
debates I was present at many of them, and I enjoyed taking
part. However, on my doctor's advice, I now have to remain
silent and avoid such discussions. Sometimes I ask myself why
I am here in the Senate if I cannot carry out my duties the
way I used to. I often wish I could be more active and more
helpful to my colleagues, and increase my contribution to the
Senate.

When I look around I fear that many difficulties lie aheadand it is not about politics that I am thinking now. I am
thinking rather about the structure of our so-called democracy.
I am thinking of freedom, justice, private enterprise, corporations, social services, schools, medicare, labour movements,
news media, misconduct, misfortunes and abuses, often leading
to corruption, including the corruption of religion.
It is true enough that every century outlives itself, but at no
time since the beginning of the world have we seen the
evolution of so many problems at the same time.
[Translation]
Today all nations of the world live in the shadow of a
destructive element that we all know under the name of atomic
or nuclear bomb. You can be sure, honourable senators, that
one of these days someone irresponsible is going to use it. The
secret of nuclear explosion is no longer one that we are trying
to protect. Then you can imagine the consequences that would
follow, to say nothing about the arms race, the greatest curse
of all nations.
[English]
The conventional arms race, in the course of which we spend
millions, if not billions, of dollars-very often on training our
enemies and supplying them with our so-called obsolete equipment such as tanks, airplanes, vehicles, guns and ammunition-is some day, honourable senators, going to catch up with
us; but then it will be too late. How can we expect to survive a
program designed to harm our enemies? Perhaps the oldest of
us will avoid it, but our children will certainly be in the front
line.
Today the challenge is to feed the world. One-third of the
population has to feed the other two-thirds. Due to many
adverse policies, including red tape, price controls, poor transportation, boycotts, expensive equipment, and a lack of interest
in producing enough food for our own needs, agriculture
cannot compete with the demands made upon it. Agriculture,
however, is essential to life. Life without food, as a rule, does
not last too long.
[Translation]
The democracy in which we live is deteriorating rapidly
from several standpoints. Unions are being carried away by
their ambitions. Strikes depend on the mass media. Parliamentary authority is often questioned. Revolutionary winds are
blowing from all sides.
People seem to forget that freedom has its limitations,
authority has its duties, and the nation has its obligations.
[English]
We should remember that the fall of many empires was
caused mainly by over-taxation imposed by overzealous leaders
and emperors who ransacked their subjects at will. Are we not
ourselves walking blindfolded in that very direction, into a
situation in which half of the working population is supporting
the other non-producing half? Are we taking sufficiently seriously the decline of the purchasing value of our dollar, and
inflation in all its forms? Can we survive? And for how long

SENATE DEBATES
are price and wage controls going to be the answer? Are we,
on the other hand, caught between two evils?
[Translation]
That is why today 1 arn afraid of the future. When 1 think
about it and look at the overail picture, 1 see ail the problems
of the universe. What frightens me most is that the greatest
difficulties are flot always created by underdeveloped nations
but mainly by those nations we supported financially, morally
and even physically by giving them military training. Too
often they are created by the most educated, civilized-if 1
may use the word-modernized and financially welI off
nations.
Let us say also that the problem does flot stem only from
nations or countries, but let us look at our own environment
where, unfortunately, disorder seems to have priority over
order and good conduct. Ail segments of our society must face
and overcome conflicts that were unknown yesterday.
Honourable senators, when 1 look at ail the problems we
must face, 1 must admit that we are living in a very sick
society.

That is the way it is.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
PRIVILEGE

Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I rise on
a question of privilege which has to do with the shortness of
the notice with which we were summoned to return today.
I should like to draw attention to the fact that yesterday, at
approximately noon-at any rate, immediately after conclusion of the question period in the other place-the leader of
the house in the other place, the Honourable Mr. MacEachen,
said, at pages 301 and 302 of yesterday's Hansardof the other
place:
Tomorrow it is my intention to interrupt the debate on the
Address in reply, to deal with a bill which is to be
introduced by the Minister of Labour (Mr. Munro) concerning the port of Halifax. Assuming we get consent, we
would proceed with that bill tomorrow.
When we met yesterday afternoon in this chamber Senator
Langlois made a statement concerning the expected business
of the Senate for the coming week. He was then asked by
Senator Flynn, as reported at page 52 of Hansard:
Is there any possibility that the Senate will be recalled to
deal with emergency legislation with regard to the strike
of dockworkers at the Port of Halifax?
Senator Langlois replied:
That possibility is not foreseen as yet.
Now, in common with a number of other senators I received
notice of today's sitting at about 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon
just when I was about to depart. I am sure the Leader of the
Government was very much in the same position. So it seems
to me to be somewhat peculiar that, since the Leader of the
House of Commons made it public knowledge at about noon
yesterday that this matter was to be dealt with by the other
place today, the Leader of the Government in this chamber
could not have been informed at a much earlier hour of the
likelihood that this chamber would be recalled to deal with this
legislation today. If this had happened it might have mitigated
to some degree the inconvenience which many senators suffered, and it might have ensured the attendance of a much
greater number of senators this afternoon.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, if I may reply on
that point, may I say that together with the distinguished
senator from Nova Scotia I regret that it was necessary to send

out messages to ail honourable senators after we had in fact
adjourned yesterday until next week.
Yesterday afternoon I communicated with the Minister of
Labour in an endeavour to ascertain what kind of legislative
schedule would be involved in the passage of this emergency
measure. The reply which I received was duly communicated
to honourable senators, and that is that there was a possibility
of legislation being introduced this day. There was no suggestion at that time that it would be the intention in the other
place to have this measure passed through ail three stages of
debate in the other place and in the Senate by this afternoon.
The decision to proceed through ail stages was, I understand,
made after consultation with all parties in the other place and,
finally, at a cabinet committee meeting after the Senate had
adjourned yesterday afternoon. The cabinet committee meeting continued, I am informed, until something like 5.30 in the
afternoon, and there was a rather extensive discussion about
the economic impact of the strike upon Nova Scotia and the
rest of the Atlantic provinces.
I understand that from an economic standpoint the labour
strife down there is causing a loss of something like $1 million
a week, and the decision was taken by the government committee that under these very pressing economic circumstances we
should endeavour to pass this legislation as quickly as possible.
That is the only explanation I am able to give.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I thank
the Leader of the Government for his explanation, but I want
to make it quite clear that I was not in any way objecting to
the celerity with which the legislation is being dispatched. I
agree that it is something to be dealt with quickly. Rather, I
was being critical of the shortness of the notice, which could
easily have been given as early as 12 o'clock yesterday to the
Leader of the Government here and to this chamber.

PORT OF HALIFAX OPERATIONS BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem informed the Senate that a
message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-14, to provide for the resumption and continuation of
longshoring and related operations at the port of Halifax.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, when
shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 44(1)(f), moved that the bill be now read
the second time.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving the second reading
of this rather important and urgent bill, I want to reaffirm the
government's extreme reluctance to end labour-management
disputes by legislation. It should not be necessary for governments to interfere with the free collective bargaining process.
However, the unusual circumstances in this case led to the
government's introducing in the other place this morning Bill
C-14, to provide for the resumption and continuation of longshoring and related operations at the port of Halifax.
As the Minister of Labour said in the other place in
introducing this bill, there are times and situations when the
government, as custodian of the economy and the defender of
public interest, must assume its responsibility. Because of the

October 22, 1976

circumstances which prevail in Halifax today, and which have
prevailed for some considerable time, there was unanimous
agreement among the parties in the other place that government action was clearly required in settling the dispute involving the Maritime Employers Association and Local 269 of the
International Longshoremen's Association at the port of
Halifax.
As a result of the dispute, the port has been closed since
August 8. It is estimated that the economic loss is now running
at well over $1 million a week. The number of workers laid off
as a result of this dispute is close to 3,000. In other words,
3,000 people have been rendered unemployed since August 8
because of this dispute.
Given those circumstances, it is difficult to see how any one
side can benefit, or the public interest can benefit, from the
continuation of the strike. Considerable economic damage is
being sustained by both the city of Halifax and the port itself,
and the reputation of the port is suffering in the process. For
all of those reasons, it is the opinion of the government that
Parliament must legislate an end to the dispute.
The proposed act, to be known as the Port of Halifax
Operations Act, if passed, will result in the port being reopened while further attempts are made to settle the dispute.
It should be emphasized, again, that the government remains
committed to the principle of free collective bargaining, and it
should be pointed out that considerable efforts, strenuous
efforts, have been made over the past 10 months to resolve the
dispute.
It may be useful if I were to summarize, as briefly as
possible, the sequence of events that led to the present impasse.
The parties to the dispute, the Maritime Employers Association, which acts for its member steamship companies and
agents employing labour, contracting stevedores and terminal
operators handling vessels in the port of Halifax, and Local
269 of the International Longshoremen's Association, representing some 650 workers, have been seeking to negotiate
revisions to their collective agreement, which expired on
December 31, 1975.
The parties met in direct negotiation on a number of
occasions prior to the expiry of their previous collective agreement. As these meetings were not successful, on January 2 of
this year the Minister of Labour appointed Mr. C. A. Ogden
and Mr. R. L. Kervin, of Labour Canada's Halifax office, as
conciliation officers to assist the parties in their deliberations.
Numerous meetings were held with the parties during the next
two months, and the officers filed their report on March 4,
1976, recommending as the next step in the conciliation procedure the appointment of a conciliation mediator to deal with
the items still in dispute.
On March 7 of this year the minister therefore appointed
Judge Nathan Green of Halifax as negotiating commissioner
in the dispute. Judge Green met extensively with the parties
during the course of the following three months, and then he
filed a report containing his recommendations on all issues in
dispute on June 24, 1976.

October 22, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

force that they sought. The minister, therefore, suggested to
the Maritime Employers Association that they give the proposed terms of settlement careful reconsideration, but they
replied on October 13 that they would not accept this proposal
as a basis of settlement.
As a result, the government was faced with two options after
this very long and difficult process: first, to allow the lockout
to continue in the hope that the pressure of economic strain on
the parties would eventually lead to resolution of the dispute,
or, second, to legislate an end to the lockout and bring about a
resumption of operations in the port, while presenting a
method for resolution of the dispute. The government bas
opted for the second solution because, having exhausted over
the last ten months all procedures and all good offices to
resolve the dispute through mediation, it is clear that the
serious adverse economic effects are now such as to warrant
legislative action.
Many members of the Senate may be aware-and I am sure
that our distinguished colleagues from the Atlantic provinces
are painfully aware-of the adverse economic repercussions of
this industrial dispute. The government has received numerous
representations from business and labour representatives,
including people in the shipping industry, as well as elected
officials at all levels of government and of various political
affiliations, to put an end to.the dispute because of its severe
adverse effects on the economy of the city of Halifax, the
province of Nova Scotia, and, indeed, the whole Atlantic
region.
As I said carlier, it bas been estimated that the economic
loss is now well over $1 million a week-which is one of the
reasons why it was decided that no further time must be lost
with respect to legislative action-and that the number of
workers laid off as a result of this dispute is close to 3,000. Of
course, the multiplier economic effects of this dispute in the
port of Halifax cannot be measured accurately.
That this situation can no longer be tolerated, in light of the
continuing deterioration of the port's reputation, will be evident to all present. Therefore, the Port of Halifax Operations
bill orders the immediate resumption of longshoring and related operations. The longshoremen will return to work under the
terms of the tentative agreement reached on September 25,
with the exception of certain contentious items relating to the
rules of dispatch. Immediately upon signing of the agreement,
Local 269 of the International Longshoremen's Association
will draft Rules of Dispatch to cover the outstanding items for
submission to, and the approval of, the Maritime Employers
Association. The proposed rules of dispatch must be submitted
by Local 269 of the ILA to the Maritime Employers Association not later than December 10 of this year. If the Maritime

The Maritime Employers Association notified the Department of Labour of its acceptance of the recommendations
contained in the report last July 7. However, the union rejected the recommendations, as they said, "in part" and requested
mediation assistance based on terms of reference put forward
by the union.
On July 13, Mr. R. L. Kervin, of the ministry's Halifax
office, was appointed mediator pursuant to section 195 of the
Canada Labour Code, with instructions to assist the parties,
but without placing any restrictions on whàt areas of the
dispute were to be mediated. Mr. Kervin was able to arrange a
settlement between the negotiating committees on August 2,
subject to its ratification by the union membership. This
settlement was rejected by the union membership through a
vote held on August 5 last. It was following this rejection that
the Maritime Employers' Association locked the longshoremen
out of the port of Halifax on August 8, effectively closing
down the operations of the port.
On September 17 the Honourable the Minister of Labour
assigned Mr. William P. Kelly, assistant deputy minister of the
federal mediation and conciliation service, to this dispute, to
assist the parties in reaching a settlement. Mr. Kelly, a man of
great skill and ability, began meetings with the parties on
September 20, assisted by Mr. Kervin, and on September 25 a
settlement was reached and a memorandum of agreement
executed by the parties, subject to ratification. The membership of Local 269 rejected the mediated settlement by a 56 per
cent majority.
Because of the threat to the port's reputation, and indeed to
Canada's reputation, as well as the serious economic effects
resulting from the shutdown, Mr. Kelly was instructed to
return to Halifax on October 4 and assist in the situation
following the rejection of the mediated settlement reached on
September 25. Mr. Kelly resumed mediation sessions with the
objective of developing a formal proposal of terms of
settlement.
On October 6 the Honourable the Minister of Labour joined
Mr. Kelly, met with both parties, and submitted a formal proposal setting out suggested terms of settlement. The proposal,
basically, involved the acceptance by both sides of the agreement reached on September 25, but reserved for further negotiation and arbitration, if necessary, four of the contentious items
dealing with the dispatching of longshoremen. The parties
would be given until December 10 to reach agreement on the
four contentious items of the rules of dispatch. Failing this the
minister would appoint Judge Nathan Green to arbitrate the
items, and his award would be incorporated into the collective
agreement effective January 1 of next year.

80003-5

SENATE DEBATES
the Maritime Employers Association by December 10, either
or both parties may notify the Minister of Labour, who will
appoint an industrial inquiry commissioner to make a determination on these specific items in the dispute. In such event,
within 15 days following his appointment the industrial inquiry
commissioner shall render an award prescribing rules of dispatch which shall be final and binding on the parties and
incorporated into the collective agreement effective January 1,
1977, or as soon as practicable after that date.
There is some detail here which I shall give to honourable
senators. It may be additional background, and it is not really
too lengthy. Perhaps it should be explained why the bill
presently before the Senate departs in at least two aspects
from the recommendations in the Minister of Labour's proposed terms of settlement. The first matter concerns the date
on which the minister had proposed the rules of dispatch be
incorporated into the collective agreement-that is, January 1,
1977. It has been brought to the attention of the minister by
the legal officers of the Crown that we must guard against
unforeseeable events. The severe illness of the industrial inquiry commissioner is one example of such unforeseen circumstances that would prevent the fulfilling of this obligation.
Thus it is thought to be necessary to incorporate into the bill
the wording:
January 1, 1977 or, where in the opinion of the Minister
of Labour that date is impracticable, on a date after
January 1, 1977 that is designated by the Minister of
Labour as the earliest practicable date.
The second change to the original recommendations concerns the person of the industrial inquiry commissioner. In the
minister's proposal, which was approved by the union, the
commissioner charged with the determination of the four items
in dispute was identified in the person of Judge Nathan Green,
a provincial magistrate of the city of Halifax. Again, legal
officers of the Crown have advised that the industrial inquiry
commissioner should not be specifically identified in the bill,
should unforeseeable events prevent this individual from
accepting or carrying out this important assignment. The
Minister of Labour has placed on record that the commissioner he intends to appoint, however, is Judge Green, whose
labour relations expertise and knowledge of the matters in
dispute-he was the conciliation commissioner-eminently
qualify him for this task.
The minister also wishes to assure all concerned that in his
mind the date on which the rules of dispatch are to be
incorporated into the collective agreement, whether by agreement of the MEA as submitted by Local 269 of the ILA, or as
presented by the industrial inquiry commissioner, is January 1,
1977, and both parties have his pledge that he shall see that
this is indeed the effective date.
Finally, the government emphasizes that considerable
efforts have been made in recent years to transform the port of
Halifax into an efficient year-round harbour, and it looks to
both employers and workers, who have so much at stake here,
to fully cooperate to ensure that the productivity of this port is
such as to guarantee its competitiveness.

October 22, 1976

Honourable senators, I urge your support for Bill C-14, an
act to provide for the resumption and continuation of longshoring and related operations at the port of Halifax. I believe you
are aware of the fact that there was substantial all-party
support for this measure in the other place when it was
debated there earlier this day.
Before I resume my seat, I take the opportunity to say how
much all of us in this chamber appreciate the fact that Senator
Macdonald of Colchester has taken the Chair today, and
served in his usual efficient way.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Riley: Would the Leader of the Government permit
a question? In clause 4 of the bill-I do not know if it is
proposed to go through it clause by clause-blank spaces
occur. We see:
-on October , 1976 and recorded as document number Does the leader have that date and number?
Senator Perrault: Officials of the Department of Labour are
present, and I shall obtain the details the honourable senator
requires. I think they can be provided before the debate is
concluded.
*

(1530)

Hon. George . Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I
rise to support the remarks of the Leader of the Government. I
should like to join in his complimentary comments about my
colleague from Nova Scotia who now occupies the Speaker's
Chair. Although we would like to claim him for Colchester, I
have to admit that he is from Cape Breton.
In rising to support the bill, I do not intend to delay the
house very long, but there are a few comments I should like to
make.
I noted-and I suppose there is no doubt about it-that the
Minister of Labour is a strong believer in the efficiency of
collective bargaining, and it is only with great regret that he
has concluded that in this case legislation must be placed
before Parliament in order to deal with what obviously is a
very protracted and costly labour dispute. In supporting the
bill, I wish to say that I too believe-as I am sure do all of us
on this side of the house, and no doubt all honourable senators-in the principle of free collective bargaining. We realize,
however, that there are times when things have reached such a
difficult stage that matters cannot longer be left to the disputing parties because of the great impact of their dispute upon
the public weal.
I do not think the Leader of the Government overstated the
adverse effects which this labour dispute has had; nor do I
think he exaggerated in the least when he said that those
effects have been felt not only in Halifax, Nova Scotia and the
Atlantic region, but in Canada as a whole. There is no doubt
that if this dispute is left unresolved for much longer, irreparable damage will be done, if indeed it has not already been
done, to the port of Halifax and to the economy of the country.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

If I have any word of criticism, it is that the decision to
produce this kind of legislation came just a little later than it
should have-and I am not speaking about the time of day. It
seems to me that the appropriate time might very well have
been earlier in the dispute. I realize, however, that this is
always a matter for judgment, that the Minister of Labour is a
man of substantial experience. I therefore accept the fact that
he felt-and no doubt he has been kept well informed of the
facts-that the appropriate time was not sooner. I wish it had
been, and that it might have been possible for him to have
reached his conclusion earlier. However, he did not. I am glad
that be has now done so, and I am pleased to support the bill.
I dislike always being agrecable in every aspect of a matter
before the house, but I have to say that I agree with the
Leader of the Government in his opinion of Judge Green.
Judge Green is a gentleman who has had very long experience
in labour matters, and has served as an arbitrator, and in all
the various capacities necessary in these matters, over a long
period. I believe he has the confidence both of labour and of
management generally in our province.
I look forward therefore with some satisfaction to the probability that Judge Green will, in fact, be the person chosen to
deal with this matter.
I shall conclude by saying-and this may also be the wish of
the Leader of the Government-that it would be a good thing
if we were to pass the bill through all its stages today, so that it
could receive royal assent before the day bas closed.
[Translation]
Senator Côté: Honourable senators, since we have had no
time to consider it, I wish to ask the government leader if this
bill is very much different from other pieces of legislation
which Parliament bas adopted in the past. Is it very much
different from other legislation which Parliament has already
passed to send other workers back to work such as, for
instance, Montreal or Vancouver longshoremen, or railway
employees? Is the bill now before us quite similar to those
other bills or is it different and, if so, in what regard?
[English|
Senator Perrault: Yes, it is very similar to legislation which
we have seen in the past with respect to ports such as Montreal
and Vancouver. It provides an ultimate solution for the resolution of the differences of opinion between labour and
management.
The proposal contained in the bill places great reliance on
the goodwill of both labour and management; but should it not
be possible to obtain that kind of cooperation, a commissioner
would then be appointed to ultimately resolve this labour
difficulty.
Honourable senators, a question was asked earlier by Senator Riley with respect to page 3 of Bill C-14, which I believe
honourable senators now have before them. The date which
should have been inserted in clause 4 is October 22, 1976, and
the document recorded as number 302-7-3. Those details were
not available when the bill was being printed and, because of
80003-5'/2

the time urgency, it was felt important to print the bill and to
leave those details until later.
Senator Smith (Colchester): May I have those details

again?
Senator Perrault: The date to be inserted in clause 4 of the
bill is October 22, 1976, and the document is recorded as

number 302-7-3.
I must also apologize to Senator Smith for attempting to
appoint two honourable senators for Colchester. I am pleased
that Senator Smith drew that inadvertence to my attention.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, when

shall this bill be read the third time?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, with leave of the

Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(b), I move that the bill
be read the third time now.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Agreed.

Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

PATRIATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
EXCHANGE OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER
OF CANADA AND THE PREMIER OF ALBERTA

Edmonton, Alberta.
October 14, 1976
The Right Honourable Pierre E. Trudeau
Prime Minister of Canada
House of Commons
Ottawa, Ontario
My dear Prime Minister:
Further to my letter of September 2, 1976 and my telex of
October 4, 1976, I wish to inform you of the outcome of the
deliberations by the ten Canadian Premiers on the issues
raised by you in your letter of March 31, 1976 relative to
patriation of the Constitution from Westminster to Canada.
Your letter of March 31, 1976 outlined three possible
options and served as a framework for our deliberations. The
provinces agreed in May 1976 to proceed with an examination
of all three options. You will recall that your option 3 includes
patriation, an amending formula and a number of other substantive changes to the British North America Act which were
contained in the draft proclamation appended to your letter of
March 31, 1976. You will also recall that when the premiers
had private discussions on this matter at your residence during
the evening of June 14, 1976, you indicated that you would be
prepared to accept any proposal which had been unanimously
agreed to by the provinces.
At the same time, you indicated that you hoped we could
consider the matter over the summer and report to you early in
the fall as to the outcome of our deliberations and discussions.
As Chairman of the Annual Conference of Premiers, I
would like to now deal with the matters as they were outlined
in your letter of March 31, 1976.
Patriation
All provinces agreed with the objective of patriation. They
also agreed that patriation should not be undertaken without a
consensus being developed on an expansion of the role of the
provinces and/or jurisdiction in the following areas: culture,
communications, Supreme Court of Canada, spending power,
Senate representation and regional disparities. Later in the
letter I will endeavour to give you some idea of our discussions
on the above matters.
Amending Formula
Considerable time was spent on this important subject and
the unanimous agreement of the provinces was not secured on
a specific formula. Eight provinces agreed to the amending
formula as drafted in Victoria in 1971 and as proposed by you
in your draft proclamation. British Columbia wishes to have
the Victoria Formula modified to reflect its view that British
Columbia should be treated as a distinct entity with its own
separate veto. In this sense it would be in the same position as
Ontario and Quebec. Alberta held to the view that a constitutional amending formula should not permit an amendment
that would take away rights, proprietary interests and jurisdic-

tion from any province without the concurrence of that province. In this regard, Alberta was referring to matters arising
under Section 92, 93 and 109 of the British North America
Act.
Matters Unanimously Agreed To
A number of matters were dealt with and unanimously
agreed to. Specific texts were considered and given approval,
subject to revision by draftsmen.
a) A greater degree of provincial involvement in
immigration.
b) A confirmation of the language rights of English and
French generally along the lines discussed in Victoria in
1971.

c) A strenghtening of jurisdiction of provincial governments of taxation in the areas of primary production
from lands, mines, minerals and forests.
d) A provision that the declaratory powers of the federal
government to declare a particular work for the general
advantage of Canada would only be exercised when the
province affected concurred.
e) That a conference composed of the eleven First Ministers of Canada should be held at least once a year as a
constitutional requirement.
f) That the creation of new provinces should be subject to
any amending formula consensus.
As already mentioned under the remarks on patriation, the
provinces were of the view that while patriation was desirable
it should be accompanied by the expansion of provincial
jurisdiction and involvement in certain areas. The Premiers
believed that discussions on these matters should be held with
the federal government because they involve the federal government to a significant degree.
a) Culture-You will recall that culture was referred to in
Parts IV and VI of the draft proclamation. The interprovincial discussions on culture focused on the addition of
a new concurrent power to be included in the Constitution. This power would refer to arts, literature and
cultural heritage and would be subject to provincial
paramountcy. On this matter, there was a high degree of
consensus on the principle and considerable progress was
made with respect to a solution. There was also, however, firm opinion from one province that the provinces
and the federal government should have concurrent
jurisdictional powers in the area.
b) Communications-In the draft proclamation, communications was referred to in Part VI. Discussions on this
subject related to greater provincial control in communications, particularly in the area of cable television.
c) Supreme Court of Canada-In general, discussions on
this topic developed from those articles found in Part II
of the draft proclamation. The provinces unanimously
agreed to a greater role for the provinces in the appointment of Supreme Court judges than provided for in the

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
draft proclamation. In addition, a number of other
modifications were suggested to the provisions found in
the draft proclamation.
d) Spending Power-Discussion on this matter focused on
the necessity and desirability of having a consensus
mechanism which must be applied before the federal
government could exercise its spending power in areas of
provincial jurisdiction.
e) Senate Representation-Discussion on this subject related to British Columbia's proposal that Senate representation for that province be increased.
f) Regional Disparities and Equalization-In the draft
proclamation, Regional Disparities was referred to in
Part V. The discussions on this topic focused on the
expansion and strengthening of this section to include a
reference to equalization. There was unanimous agreement on the clause contained in the draft proclamation
and a high degree of consensus on incorporating clauses
in the Constitution providing for equalization.
Other matters were discussed, but it was felt by the
Premiers that their deliberations had been of a preliminary
and exploratory nature. As such, in any future meeting it is
possible that individual provinces may present additional
suggestions for consideration.
The Premiers were of the view that significant progress on
this complex matter had occurred. It was felt that further
progress would require discussions between the provinces and
the federal government. It was concluded by the Premiers that
the next step should be for you to meet with the Premiers and
develop the discussions reflected in this letter. The Premiers
felt that it would now be appropriate for them to accept your
invitation for further discussions in the near future, at a
mutually agreeable time.
Given the importance of this subject and the reference to it
in your Throne Speech of October 12, 1976, the other
Premiers may wish to join with me in tabling this letter before
our respective provincial legislatures or otherwise making this
letter public on October 20, 1976. If you have any objection
could you please advise me forthwith.

October 22, 1976
October 22, 1976
Ottawa,
October 18, 1976.

My dear Premier:
Thank you for your letter of October 14th advising me of
the outcome of discussions on the Constitution by the Premiers
of the provinces at the meetings in Edmonton and Toronto.
As I am leaving on an official visit to Japan tomorrow, I
thought it desirable to send you a short reply forthwith,
although, as you will appreciate, I have had no opportunity to
give detailed consideration to the far-reaching matters that are
raised in your letter or to discuss them with my colleagues in
any way. I note, however, that you, and possibly the other
Premiers, contemplate making your letter public on October
20th. That will be during my absence in Japan but I have no
objection whatever. I shall ask Mr. MacEachen, as Acting
Prime Minister, to table your letter in Parliament on the same
day along with this reply.

I have noted the conclusion by the Premiers at the Toronto
meeting that the desirable next step would be to meet with me.
I would be glad to join in such a meeting and hope it can be at
an early date. I will be in touch with you and the other
Premiers after my return in order to suggest an appropriate
time.

Without attempting at this time to deal with the matters
referred to in your letter, may I say that I am disappointed
that the meetings of Premiers do not seem to have brought
matters much closer to a solution. We had agreed in April,
1975, that we would see if "patriation" with an amending
formula, could be achieved without getting into the distribution of powers. Your letter suggests to me that the Premiers, at
their meetings, seem to have turned the process upside down
and to have concentrated on increasing provincial powers
without agreeing either on a basis for "patriation" or on a
procedure for amendment. Beyond saying that the objective of
"patriation" is a desirable one, your letter merely states circumstances where "patriation should not be undertaken".

Yours truly,
Peter Lougheed

My comment at our dinner last June, to which you refer,
about being prepared to accept any proposal unanimously
agreed to by the provinces was, of course, made in the context
of what we were trying to achieve-"patriation", with an
amending procedure, without becoming deeply entangled in
the distribution of powers. As you, yourself, put it in the
second paragraph of your letter, the "substantive changes"
referred to in "Option 3" in my letter of March 31st were not
to stand alone, but were to be part of a whole which "includes
patriation (and) an amending formula". I make this point
without attempting to limit the kind of things we might wish to

October 22, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

discuss at our forthcoming meeting. You will appreciate, however, that I cannot consider myself to be committed in advance
to anything the Premiers may seem to have agreed upon, when
the points of agreement are entirely apart from the central
objective of the entire exercise.
Finally, I note that on page 4 of your letter, you indicate
that "in any future meeting it is possible that individual
provinces may present additional suggestions for consideration". May I suggest, in return, that our further meeting may
prove of little purpose if the provinces merely seek to gain

powers rather than return to our central pursuit of "patriation" and an amending formula?
Sincerely,
P. E. Trudeau

Premier of Alberta,

Tuesday, October 26, 1976

The Senate met at 8 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.
Prayers.
THE HONOURABLE FREDERICK M. BLOIS
TRIBUTES ON RESIGNATION FROM SENATE

Hon. Léopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I have the
honour to inform the Senate that the Honourable Senator
Frederick Murray Blois has resigned from the Senate as of
October 12.
On behalf of the members on this side of the house I should
like to pay tribute to our esteemed colleague Senator Blois. We
deeply regret that ill health has robbed this chamber of a man
who has been one of its most distinguished representatives for
over 16 years. However, it is typical of Senator Blois that he
felt he could not continue because he could not give 100 per
cent of himself to his work here. Our colleague is that sort of
man. It is this attitude of giving nothing but his best that has
accompanied Senator Blois throughout his business and political career.
He was an experienced and successful businessman and a
notable public servant both in civic and provincial politics. It
was a happy day for this chamber when he was summoned to
the Senate in 1960. He served diligently and purposefully on
various committees, Banking, Trade and Commerce, Agriculture, Transport and Communications, and Science Policy. To
ail of them he brought an analytical mind and a capacity for
hard work. Above ail, he is a gentleman.
On behalf of the Leader of the Government and my colleagues, I wish to say that we have missed his presence these
last few months. We will miss it ail the more in the future. His
resignation leaves a large gap in this chamber.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, it is my pleasant duty on this occasion, on behalf of the Leader of the
Opposition and those of us in this group who will most miss the
presence and the wise counsel of the Honourable Fred Blois, to
thank the Acting Leader of the Government for the tribute he
has paid to Fred Blois and for the opportunity he gives us to
say something about the importance of the 16 years of Senator
Blois's service in the Senate of Canada. It is not for us to
question his decision, under the circumstances, to resign from
the Senate. However, we are ail aware that he will continue his
interest in the public affairs of Canada, and particularly those
of his beloved Nova Scotia and the County of Colchester and
the constituency of Colchester-Hants, in which he was born
and to which he devoted so many and so much of his talents
over the years.

While we may regret his decision, I think we can ail
understand why Fred Blois has made this decision. He has not
been in good health for some time and he is now in his
eighty-fourth year.
As the Acting Leader of the Government has said, it is
typical of Fred to make this kind of decision under these
circumstances. If ever there was a man who was entitled to
pass on the mantle of public service to others, surely it was
Fred Blois. His career in the public service goes back at least
45 years to the time when he first became a member of the
council of his native Truro, and over the years he, of course,
represented Colchester in the provincial legislature, becoming
Leader of the Opposition, and, if I may say so, having a great
deal to do with the change of government which came about
there subsequently, after he had ceased to be Leader of the
Opposition.
If my remarks seem brief it is only because I am so fully
aware that in this chamber this evening are those of his
colleagues who knew him more intimately than I did, although
I have known him well for many years. I refer, of course, to
Senator John Macdonald, his roommate, seatmate, and his
very close and dear friend and, of course, to Senator G. I.
Smith, who has the unique distinction of having had Fred Blois
as his executive assistant at a time when Senator Smith
(Colchester) was a cabinet minister in Nova Scotia. It is
perhaps typical of Fred Blois that after having held the high
office of Leader of the Opposition in the Nova Scotia Legislature, he came back in an emergency and agreed to become the
executive assistant of a cabinet minister considerably younger
than himself. I am quite sure that we will have appropriate
tributes paid to Senator Blois from those two very great
friends of his.
Senator Blois was distinguished, I am sure, by those qualities that tend to endear us to men. If we say this evening how
much we are going to miss him, not merely in this group, but, I
am sure, in the Senate as a whole, it will be something that his
modesty, which is part of his great charm, would lead him to
deny or disbelieve. But we shall miss him. He had that quality
of charm, of warm charm, that made him friends in ail parts of
the house. I am sure that ail honourable senators join with me
in wishing him a long and continued career, and interest and
concern, in the public life of Canada. Although he has decided
to pass on the mantle as far as serving the public life in
Canada through the Senate is concerned, certainly he will
continue that intense interest he has always had in the welfare
of Canada, his county, his constituency, and his province.
This is not an occasion on which we extend condolences.
Fred Blois bas not left us. Honourable senators will, I am sure,
be glad to know that there are some of us who are already

October 26, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

of the Senate, but the atmosphere of the Senate. He enjoyed
the friendships be made here and the companionships which
we all have, apart from politics, one to another.
While we regret that he felt it was necessary for him to
resign, I do think that his retirement is going to be a very
active one. I am sure that in his home town of Truro he will
once again take an active part in community life and community affairs.
Personally, I am going to miss him greatly. There is no
question about that, because I cherish his friendship and I
think he liked me too. While it is a matter of regret to me that
Fred felt lie must resign, I do wish him well and hope that he
will have a long and happy retirement.
Hon. George . Smith: Honourable senators, perhaps I
might be permitted a word or two about the Honourable Fred
Murray Blois, since I have known him for nearly half a
century, and since I have been privileged to enjoy his friendship and association with him in many walks of life, particularly in political life, during most of that time.
I want to extend my thanks to the Acting Leader of the
Government in the Senate, the Acting Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and to Senator Macdonald for their very
kind and yet not in any way exaggerated words about the
0 (2010)
career of this very distinguished Nova Scotian.
I should like to mention something in a more personal way.
I do not know which facet of his many-sided service to his

It will be seen that I came to know him, appreciate him,

Fred was this type of man: in all these years I have never Senator Blois bas always exhibited. It is quite true that lie had

bear that out. He is a man who likes people, and I know he is Macdonald said on this point, in those days this was not an

arranging to have what we would all expect to have for Fred
Blois, a party, in the near future. He will be back, and I hope
at that time all of us will be prepared to join us in giving him,
not a last hurrah, but the kind of hurrah that his service in this
Senate deserves.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, 1, too,
thank the Acting Leader of the Government .and the Acting
Leader of the Opposition for the very kind references they
have made to Fred Blois.
The ParliamentaryGuide gives a sort of bare bones account
of his career. It tells us, for example, that for 40 years he was
the General Superintendent of Stanfields Ltd. of Truro; that
he was a member of the town council for many years; that he
was Deputy Mayor; that be was a member of the Legislative
Assembly and House Leader of the Opposition in the Nova
Scotia Legislature for a number of years; and also that he
became executive assistant to the Honourable G. . Smith,
when he was Minister of Highways. All that, of course, only
emphasizes this: That the people who knew him best in his
home town of Truro liked him and respected him, and had
confidence in him. He served them well, and they were glad to
be served by him. Apart from all that, he was a great Nova
Scotian.

SENATE DEBATES
great turbulence in the province in the realm of highways, and
as I turned to look for someone of experience, as well as
ability, to help me I thought of Fred Blois. I was almost afraid
to ask him to take the position as my executive assistant.
However, I explained my problem to him, and in almost less
time than it took me to explain it he had decided that he would
give me a hand, and a very effective hand it was.
With those who have spoken I express my deep regret that
his health, which has served him so well for so long, has made
it necessary for him to resign from this distinguished body. I
was not here very long during his tenure of office, but from
everything I have heard about his time in the Senate, it seems
to me that he must have been a man of many parts and terrific
energy to have accomplished what he did.
Fred Blois was, and still is, a splendid servant of the public
in the best sense, a great gentleman, a wonderful husband and
parent and a loyal friend. I want to thank him publicly, as I
have done so many times privately, for his great help to me. I
thank him, too, on behalf of his fellow citizens of the community in which he and I both live for the great service he has
rendered them in so many ways over the years. We will all
miss greatly, I am sure, his lively, cheerful and able presence
here. I extend to him my very warmest good wishes and look
forward to many years of active association with him in his
retirement.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Margaret Norrie: Honourable senators, I should like
to join with the other members of the Senate who have spoken
of Senator Blois's resignation. I should like to praise him as
one of the honourable men who come from Nova Scotia. His
work in the province and in the Senate has been outstanding,
and I wish to add my words of commendation for one who has
been so devoted to the public throughout all his days. With
those few words I join the others in conveying to Senator Blois
the regret we feel in hearing of his resignation from this
chamber.

THE CROWN
REVENUES--QUESTION

Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I should like to
address a question to the Acting Leader of the Government, in
the absence of the minister. I think he will probably have to
take this as notice, in spite of his vast knowledge of the law.
Has the Crown any casual revenues or any revenues not
provided by Parliament? I assure the Acting Leader that I am
not asking this out of idle curiosity. Something has come to my
ears which made me wonder what exactly is going on and I
would like to be assured by the highest authority of what the
legal position is in this regard.
Senator Langlois: I would be very pleased to take this
question as notice and revert to it at a later stage.

SENATE DEBATES
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 21, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Lucier,
seconded by Senator Barrow, for an Address in reply thereto.

October 26, 1976

Senator Walker: At this time, I pay tribute to Senator Blois,
a most remarkable gentleman from Nova Scotia. There is
something about the people from the maritimes which distinguishes them from other Canadians.
This is an important question, to my mind, and I would ask
honourable senators to give it some thought. I repeat that we
are all in the same boat. We want to see a good, efficient
Senate, but how can we 15 stand up to the 68 on the other
side? I hope that honourable senators understand my point.
This is the way we feel so often. We become embroiled in
legislation such as the Time magazine bill, as I now call it, and
it was almost impossible for us to win, or even to get anywhere,
although we finally did because the chairman of the committee
was instrumental in making an arrangement with the government for amendments to be made.
It is discouraging to try to do all the work that falls upon us
because of the fact that we are few in number, and, at the
same time, be enthusiastic about fighting those on the other
side who represent a very powerful government body.
The Prime Minister is getting hell every day from most
Canadians but, on the whole, I pay tribute to him. In my
opinion, he has done remarkably well in the appointments he
has made to the Senate. I would respectfully suggest to
honourable senators that we have as fine, if not better, a body
of senators as we have ever had since Confederation. That is
true. I had prepared a list of them, but my wife said, "No,
don't use that because you are sure to miss someone and they
might be offended," so I shall not read it. However, I shall just
ask you to look at the senators here at the present time. I shall
not name any of them, but look at the distinguished people we
have. They are not here because they cannot do anything else;
they are here to make a contribution to Canada through the
distinction they have achieved as professional men and as most
able and brilliant businessmen. We have here leaders in
finance, farming, mining, engineering, medicine and law. The
Senate is comprised of an amazingly able group of people from
all over Canada, representing the provinces and the territories
in an admirable way, and in probably a far better way than
would have been the case if they had been elected.

Hon. David Walker: Honourable senators, the Throne
Speech this year is important not for what it contained but for
what it did not contain. We can be sure, I think, that new
legislation which we have not yet heard about will be presented
in the current session.
I am therefore going to ask honourable senators, in all
sincerity, because to my mind we are all in the same boat, to
turn their minds with me tonight to the future of the Senate.
I would respectfully suggest that it is about time we
answered, or at least discussed in depth, the government white
paper of 1969, prepared no doubt by the Prime Minister, and
the recommendations of the Special Joint Committee on the
Constitution of Canada brought forward in 1972. When we
are presented with legislation, it is to be hoped that we shall at
least have crystallized our thinking on some important matters, and not have the legislation, whatever it might be,
suddenly descend upon us.
May I speak first about the lopsided Senate. It is really a
pity to see the lack of balance in the Senate. At the present
time there are 87 members of the Senate out of a possible 104,
so there are 17 vacancies to be filled. There are only 15
Conservatives, two Independents, one Independent Liberal,
and one Social Creditor.
I understand that the Prime Minister is quite concerned
about this problem, and I say publicly that I believe we all
appreciate the interest taken by Senator Perrault, the Leader
of the Government in the Senate, in this matter. He realizes
that it is a major problem; one that has to be eased in some
way, and solved if possible.
I understand also that there has been a rule of thumb
arrangement with the Prime Minister by which when a Tory
resigns another Tory takes his place. I believe that has happened-how many times?-about twice. We have with us in * (2030)
I would also point out, honourable senators, that we have

much publicity because we work efficiently rather than on a
partisan basis, and so are not good copy for the newspapers, I
have noticed that year after year-and I have been here for 13
years-the volume of work in the Senate bas increased, and
the type of work donc and the expertise of the Senate has
grown and is still growing every year. It is now at a higher
pitch of efficiency, capability and activity than it has ever been
before.
But that has not happened without reason, honourable
senators. We have had some good leaders. I must give great
credit to the late Senator Aseltine, who was a tremendously
able leader, and also to the late Senator Ross Macdonald, who
was another remarkable and fine man. The Honourable John
Connolly, who is even now in hospital awaiting open heart
surgery, was, to my mind, a tremendously able and conscientious leader.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Walker: He was not at all egotistical as leader, and
yet he had more earned degrees than any other member of the
Senate. Many of us get our degrees honoris causa, but he
really earned his. As the leader he was a human, kindly, good
man, and simply because he was John Connolly, because he
knows was the man he was, I used to work harder.

anything but what it thinks is best, but many of the weaker

particulars of this at this time, honourable senators, because
my distinguished colleague, Senator Forsey, discussed this
matter in detail one day. Ever since 1949 Canada has been
able to amend its own Constitution regarding federal affairs,
but not in regard to provincial affairs. Head 1 of section 91 of
the British North America Act, 1949 sets out the exceptions to
Canada's powers, and these exceptions do not include the
Senate. So, a vote of the House of Commons and of the Senate
could bring about the end of the Senate. Then, of course, the
question arises: Would the Senate itself vote for that? I think
that even if it were dragooned it would not so vote. But even if
the Senate should so vote-that is, vote for its own abolitionthe provinces would not allow it. I say that because the Senate
has been, since Confederation, the protector of the weak and
the people who do not have proper representation. They get a
square deal through the Senate. This is regarded all over
Canada as being one of the assets of the Senate and so, as I
say, even if the Senate were to vote, under pressure, for its own
abolition, the provinces just would not allow it. I personally am
satisfied that its abolition could not happen.
However, honourable senators, there are really many more
basic reasons for not abolishing the Senate, the most important
being that it is not practical to do so. Why? Because the

elements in the country would be badly crunched and badly

squeezed without the protection of the Senate. It is also
interesting to note that, quite apart from what we think, the

rest of the democratic world is also in favour of having two
houses of Parliament. The parliaments of Great Britain, the
United States, France, Italy and Ireland-yes, even Irelandare bicameral.

Senator Choquette: Why "even Ireland"?
Senator Walker: Because they can fight in two places at the
same time, I guess.

But, all joking aside, honourable senators, every one of the
dominions with the exception of New Zealand has a second
chamber, and that fact speaks for itself.
In addition to that we can take the government white paper

of 1969, written, I think, by the Prime Minister because it
seems to be his prose, and that is in favour of retaining the

Senate. The Special Joint Committee on the Constitution of
Canada, of which many of you were members, was unanimous
in favour of retaining the Senate. It is significant to note as
well that at no federal-provincial conference was it ever suggested that the Senate should be abolished, and never has

there been any criticism of the Senate at any of the federalprovincial conferences. In other words, although we do not get

Senator Walker: I now come to our present leader, with
whom I do not always get along very well, but I respect him as
being one who is doing his best for the Senate and who is
cognizant of the problems we have, particularly with respect to
getting the sides more evenly divided and getting more members on the opposition side. He is, as I have said, a very fine
man, and I noticed particularly the ability with which he
handled all the trouble we encountered on the Time bill.

Senator Greene: Would the honourable senator permit a
question?
Senator Walker: Certainly.
Senator Greene: The honourable senator has eulogized the
Senate as being the strongest in history. He is one of the
leading counsel in the courtrooms of Canada, and he is used to
dealing in logic. If this is the strongest Senate in the history of
Canada, would he not consider it wise to maintain the present
proportions and keep it as strong as it presèntly is?
Senator Walker: Touché. Let me say, honourable senators,
that this body would be very much weaker if Senator Joe
Greene were not here.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

78

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Walker: If this is so, and Senator Greene admits
that it is so, what work does the Senate do to make it so
indispensable? I will be brief with this, because most of you
know it, but I want it to be on the record. In the first place, the
House of Commons cannot get along without the Senate. That
is a truism under the present working arrangements. Of the
bills passed during the last session, 27 were introduced in, and
passed first by, the Senate, after which they went to the House
of Commons. The Senate then amended six of the bills sent
over by the House of Commons, and one of them, the Canada
Corporations Bill, through the efforts of the Chairman of the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, was amended in 27 places. Twenty per cent of all
government bills originate in the Senate, and that percentage
is increasing each year.
e

(2040)

The next question is: How does the Senate do this work
which makes it so essential? Well, there are the nine standing
committees, each of them chaired by a most able senator.
These committees, which make detailed studies of all bills, are
Banking, Trade and Commerce, National Finance, Foreign
Affairs, Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Rules, Transportation, Health, Welfare and Science, and Internal Economy.
Then there have been special committees appointed to study
such subjects as narcotics, human rights, national housing,
poverty-and I have always called that one Senator Croll's
committee-land use, inflation, manpower and aging. You
know, it would not be at all inappropriate to use a slang
expression and say, "You name it, we've got it or we've done
it." This is amazingly so.
How does a committee operate? Again I shall be brief.
Every bill, whether it originates in the Senate or the House of
Commons, is considered by one or other of our committees:
and I say this-because usually I eat with at least the Tory
members of the House of Commons in the diningroom upstairs
at noon each day-that I know the members have learned to
rely on the Senate to correct the bills which the House of
Commons passes, and to date they have accepted almost all
the amendments we have made.
The House of Commons needs the help of the Senate. It
already has far more work than it can do, because of its long
sittings and the multiplicity and complicated nature of the
legislation with which it has to deal. Each year that goes by
finds more and more cooperation between the Senate and the
House of Commons. No longer in the House of Commons do
you hear the sort of derogatory remarks I used to hear when I
was there-"Those old so-and-sos in the Senate." You do not
hear that any more. Now they respect the Senate more than
any House of Commons ever respected it in the past.
It is because the Senate is not an elected body that it can
consider the real merits of legislation. The Senate is not
swayed by the legislation's ability, or lack of it, to collect votes.
We do not have to think about that. We have to think about
nothing except whether or not it is good legislation.
As you know, these committees, presided over by the able
senators about whom I spoke earlier, generally speaking have

October 26, 1976

more expertise than committees of the House of Commons.
Let us make no mistake about that. The members of these
Senate committees have had greater experience, and they have
more time to develop that expertise. As a result of this they are
able to function more efficiently. They can summon witnesses
from all over Canada, as well as the appropriate cabinet
ministers and senior government officials, to give evidence
about a bill before a committee at a particular time. The bill is
then considered clause by clause, and any necessary amendments are made before the bill is returned to the Senate.
I suggest to you, therefore, that it is no wonder that, in
terms of priority, Senate committee work ranks very high. It is
right at the top of the work on Parliament Hill.
Now, it is not the fault of the members of the House of
Commons that they do not match the Senate in this regard.
The turnover of members of the House of Commons is quite
extensive because of elections. Moreover, they have not the
time to do the work which the Senate does. They have too
many other things to occupy their attention, including taking
care of their respective constituencies.
Another aspect of Senate committee work is the amount of
preparation which must be done my members of committees
before they even attend committee meetings. You know yourselves that it is sometimes necessary to read voluminous briefs,
which may actually take hours, but if this preparation is not
made it is impossible for the committee members properly to
examine or cross-examine witnesses. Again, at peak times,
committees of the Senate are sometimes forced to work morning, afternoon and evening.
A Senate committee presents a more judicious milieu in
which to work than any committee of the House of Commons
could. Why would it not? The members of the committee do
not need to worry about such things as pleasing their constituents; they do not have to wonder, "Am I doing that which is
going to appeal to the voter? Am i going to please the cabinet?
Am I going to spoil my chances of promotion?" No, we do not
need to worry about such things, and, for that matter, most of
us cannot be promoted any further anyway. So all we try to
do-and I say this sincerely-is the best we can under all
circumstances.
I remember well as a cabinet minister having some foreboding about appearing before a Senate committee concerning
public works matters about which they were to question me. It
was a great surprise to me to be so well and intelligently
treated. I believe my experience as a cabinet minister must
have been the same as Senator Joe Greene's, and it must be
the same as the experience of the present-day cabinet
ministers.
Another interesting question is: What power has the
Senate? It has tremendous power. I doubt that the public
actually appreciates the power the Senate has. Since 1867 the
concurrence of the Senate to any bill has been necessary, and
that does not exclude money bills. We hear so much about the
Senate's not handling money bills. We pass money bills, and
we could, in fact, reject or veto them or simply cut the

October 26, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

amounts in them. Under section 53 of the BNA Act it is not
for the Senate to initiate money bills, either by way of
appropriation of money or for the imposition of taxes. Quite
properly, such bills must all originate in the House of Commons, because they represent the voters from whom the taxes
are collected. It is natural, therefore, that a money bill should
be initiated and handled first in the House of Commons.
I wish now to say just a word in passing about the salaries of
senators. Senators receive a salary of $24,000 a year, and
$5,300 a year in expenses to reimburse them in part for the
extra cost of living so much of the time in Ottawa. In other
words, a senator's salary is approximately equivalent to that of
a first rate plumber, and it is perhaps $ 1,000 more than that of
a high school teacher-at least, a high school teacher in
Toronto. High school teachers receive $23,000 a year when
they have been teaching for 11 years, which, I suppose, may be
higher than in other parts of the country. But then I think of
what a county court judge gets paid. Is it $40,000 a year? In
any event, a senator's salary is considerably less. I understand
it is about two-thirds of the salary of a county court judge.
Senator Choquette: And consider what his widow would
receive.
Senator Walker: Yes, you are quite right. When you retire
you receive one-third of your salary, and if you die your widow
receives one-third of one-third, which is rather ridiculous.
However, it is not something that worries me. It is a small
point, but none of these things has ever really been explained.
What reforms are contemplated? Why am I worried
tonight? It is because some day we will have to face these
things, and it will be necessary to make decisions on them. We
are all in the same boat. I am not being political tonight; I am
not trying to make political hay. I am trying to help members
of the Senate.

mind, and to use his best judgment for Canada, to be put into
that position. I hope honourable senators will never vote to put
a senator of Canada in that position.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Walker: There is a suggestion made in the white
paper that the Senate should be made up of appointments by
the provincial and federal governments, half by the provinces
and half by the dominion.
The United States bas already had that type of experience.
At the time of the formation of the United States, the constitution provided for two senators to be appointed from each of the
states of the union. They went along with that from 1786 to
1912, when they finally got rid of it. Why? Because there was
an awful shemozzle in the United States Senate during the
years when senators were appointed by the state governments.
The Senate became corrupt. The senators from Maine combined with the senators from Massachusetts and worked
against other combinations in efforts to gain grants for themselves. It was a question of combinations of states against
combinations of other states. Everybody was for the individual
states, and very few people for the United States. It takes a
long time to bring about changes in the constitution of the
United States, but finally in 1912 that system of the states
appointing senators was abolished.
Why should we put ourselves in the position the United
States was in up until 1912, a position in which half our
senators, or any of our senators, are appointed by the provincial governments? I ask honourable senators to give this some
thought. Let us be dispassionate and non-political about this.
I suggest to honourable senators some further reasons. Is it
not natural, if the provinces have these plums to offer, that the
premiers would appoint those to whom they are or were
beholden? Is it not natural that they would appoint people who

and women of broad vision, with a national rather than a
provincial point of view, as most of the present members of this
house appear to be. They do not have to look back and say, "I
owe something to the province that appointed me. I had better
watch out." Today a senator can be completely independent.
He or she can act for Canada, and Canada needs at this time a
lot of people to act on its behalf. What a pity, given the
bicameral system, if the non-elected house were to have its
affairs confused, mixed up and politicized by members
appointed by the provinces.
There is one further matter I should like to speak to. The
House of Commons is a dominion-wide legislative body, elected over and above the provincial legislatures. Why not appoint
the Senate on the same basis, dominion-wide just as the House
of Commons is dominion-wide, and avoid the possibility of
provincially appointed senators ganging up to veto the elected
house's legislation, or vice versa. Were that the case, this house
could become a veritable tower of Babel, as did the American
Senate in the early days.
As a senator, you cannot have two masters. As a matter of
fact, you cannot have two masters at any time. You cannot
serve Canada and a province with equal skill. You have to
serve either the one or the other; you cannot possibly serve
both to the best benefit of Canada.
The next question is whether there should be an amendment
to provide for the House of Commons having the power to
overrule the veto of the Senate. That is indicated in the Prime
Minister's white paper, and it has also been recommended by
the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution of Canada. It
is very simple. The House of Commons passes a bill; the
Senate vetoes it. That is something you would have to go back
into history to find, but it could take place. If it did take place,
then under what is known as the suspensive veto, the House of
Commons must wait for a period of six months before passing
the bill again, at which time it would become law. That is the
proposition of the Special Joint Committee. What do you think
of this? I am not sure what I think about it, but I would ask
honourable senators to think about it; give their best thought
to it. Some people feel that a suspensive veto might give the
House of Commons a second chance to change or rescind a bill
to which objection was taken by the Senate; other people think
it would be easier henceforth for the Senate to veto bills more
often. They would get into so much trouble knowing that if the
Commons insisted, they could again pass the bill six months
hence. Others wonder, and I am one of them, whether the
suspensive veto does not remove the teeth from Senate power.
It must be remembered that that was done in the House of
Lords in England, and at once the House of Lords lost
tremendously in power, reputation and usefulness.

•

(2100)

If we were offending in any way which would interfere with
the good government of Canada by our use of the veto, that
would be another thing; but why introduce a suspensive veto?
Where is the need for it? When has the occasion arisen when
we have used our veto to no purpose? The Liberal opposition
in the Senate vetoed one of the Honourable Mr. Nowlan's

October 26, 1976

bills, did it not? I was in the government at the time, but was
paying no attention to Mr. Nowlan's problems; I had my own.
The Liberals vetoed the bill, the Tories took it back, considered the veto, and did not introduce the bill again.
There is merit in the veto, in my view, and before doing
away with this power must some misuse of it not be demonstrated? Will you please, honourable senators, give this matter
your most serious consideration? Presently, and I have not
completed my thinking on it, I do not see any reason why our
veto should be removed, or why there should be a suspensive
veto introduced. For 110 years what we have at present has
been acceptable. Why should it be changed now?
Then follows another suggestion, which may be a sop to
console us if we have the veto taken away, although, you know,
sometimes sops look sappy. In this case the sop is that we
should be the final arbiters in the appointment of Supreme
Court of Canada judges. But why should this be the case?
What do we know about Supreme Court of Canada judges? I
used to, because I used to practise in the Supreme Court of
Canada, but since I have come here I do not even know who
many of them are. What skill do we have which would enable
us to make appointments in that domain? That is something,
surely, for the Department of Justice to take care of. They
have a very able minister at the present time in the Honourable Ronald Basford, who is non-partisan in his outlook and is
doing a very good job. Why should we interfere? Can they not
do the job? Can they not go to the law associations and the
benchers of the law societies in order to find out all about the
people it is proposed to appoint? What can we do in that ball
game? I do not see that we can be of very much use. I think
the sugge 3 tion is made merely to help our pride a little in the
event that the veto is taken away from us. Apart from that,
however, it really does not mean very much.
It is also suggested that we be the final authority in the
appointment of ambassadors. This would be a new duty. What
do we know, however, about ambassadors? What do we want
to know about them? We have a very good Department of
External Affairs. At least, it used to be a very good department, and I think it still is. They watch every man in the field
all over the world. There are constant progress reports on how
they are getting along, and they are promoted one by one.
Some people are shuffled out and some people are brought
home, and so on, but great care is taken in the appointment of
ambassadors. I admit that there are occasions when it is
necessary to get away from the Department of External
Affairs, and away from the professional ambassadors, in order
to appoint a person who is qualified because of his experience
in the House of Commons or in the Senate. The Honourable
Lester B. Pearson, when he was High Commissioner for
Canada in the United Kingdom was very able, as was the
Honourable Howard Ferguson, the Tory Premier of Ontario.
Senator Langlois: And Michener.
Senator Walker: Yes, and Roland Michener. Why do we
need to get into that field? I think that responsibility should
stay where it is, and that the experts and the cabinet should
decide on matters of that kind.

October 26, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Now get ready for this: We are going to enshrine in the
Constitution a charter of fundamental human rights. Well, we
should be careful about such a charter of human rights. We do
not want anything with some hidden meaning in it. I am sure
that that would not happen intentionally, but we already have
the Bill of Rights which has been considered by the courts and
which, because of its simplicity, has been very successful.
We do not want to be sidetracked into those things that, on
the surface, look so very important, but which, in fact, are not
important at all. What is important, however, is *thatwe should
keep what we have, unless somebody can give us good reason,
from the events of the last 110 years, for having any of our
powers eroded.
The Special Joint Committee on the Constitution, for the
members of which I have the greatest respect, made various
other suggestions in 1972. They did not suggest that the
appointments should be made half by the provinces, but that
each province should make some nominations, and that the
government of the day should choose senators from those
nominations. That is certainly better than having the provinces
make the appointments, because out of several names submitted by the provinces it should be possible to pick one, at least.
However, I do not see why the provinces should get into this
act at all.
Then there is a formula proposed for the appointment of
senators, which I have outlined, and which I will not expand
upon any further. They say that instead of giving you six years
in the Senate, with a further extension of six years if you are a
good boy, senators should retire at age 70. When, as a matter
of interest, do the county court judges and supreme court
judges retire? I think it is at age 75. Looking around me now,
on both sides of the house, I can only wonder what would
happen to the Senate if everyone were to be retired at the age
of 70. Of course, I can appreciate that one is prejudiced after
one passes the age of 70.
In conclusion, I should like to refer to certain maxims that I
have selected and which are applicable to the Senate. Some of
these have been uttered by other senators, and some of them I
have had the temerity to make up myself. Before I go to that,
however, I would mention that if you want to read an interesting article on the Senate, which is both up to date and
illuminating, by one of Canada's outstanding journalists, read
what the Honourable the Speaker of the Senate wrote. You
can get it from the library. It is an amazingly illuminating and
instructive article.
To continue, it is nice to have maxims sometimes. Arthur
Meighen said, "The House of Commons is a theatre. The
Senate is a workshop." The House of Commons must be a
theatre, in view of all the horseplay that used to go on there,
and still does. This is because the members are thinking of
their constituents. The Senate is indeed a workshop. We do not
get any credit for what we do here from the press, and we do
not expect it. We do the best we can. We do not have to appeal
to constituents, and our work should speak for itself.

My second maxim is: The Senate works with the House of
Commons, not against it. This is very important.
Third: In the House of Commons a member of Parliament
addresses himself to his constituents. He is bound to do that,
particularly at the time of the Throne Speech debate. Senator
Greene will remember that lie and I had to listen to them. In
the Senate, however, the senator addresses himself to the
question at issue. Why would he not?
Fourth: Abolish the Senate? If you do, you must have
something to take its place. The Senate is indispensable in one
form or another.
* (2110)

Fifth: The Senâte is indispensable, not only for what it does
but also for what it prevents being done.
Sixth: The Senate considers the real import of legislation,
not its ability to attract votes.
Seventh: A senator speaks not for his party, but only for
himself. We are getting more and more that way. I am getting
less political than I used to be, and it is a good thing. It takes a
long time to overcome the habits of the House of Commons.
Of course, I can speak only for myself at the moment.
Senator Greene: It is easier for a Tory.
Senator Walker: I know who that comes from without
looking up.
Eighth: A senator says what he thinks. He does not have to
get elected.
Ninth: Much of the law is judge-made. We appoint our
judges. Much of the law is Senate-made, with the concurrence
of the House of Commons. Why should we not continue to
appoint senators?
Tenth: In the chambers of the Honourable the Speaker is
the motto Sapare Aude, meaning "Dare to be Prudent." Is
that not what we are doing? Horace wrote that a long, long
time ago.
Eleventh: The Senate is a house of sober, second thought.
This is Sir John A. Macdonald's own phrase, which, because
of the words, shows that he knew all about it.
Finally, there are the words of Arthur Meighen, if I may be
bold enough to intrude him, one of the truly great intellectuals
in Canadian public life, and probably the greatest debater-I
must not say that, but he was one of the greatest debaters the
House of Commons ever had. He said:
The duty of senators is to lift their minds far above the
hard-drawn party lines or they can't serve their country.
The duty of senators is to give every government fair play
regardless of whether it has a majority in the Senate and
not to stand in the way of legislation unless it must be
defeated on its merits.
The task is to see each piece of legislation when it
passes from the Senate's hands is a work well donc. The
task of the Senate is to make laws practical and sensible.

Hon. Paul Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, before I
embark on what I have to say about the Throne Speech, I want

SENATE DEBATES
to say a few words about Senator Walker's speech this
evening. He invited us to think about the Senate, and he is
right. There is food for thought for all of us along these lines.
The time is ripe for it. I must say, without partisanship, that I
agree with most of what he said. I believe honourable senators
will find much of his speech useful in making their own
assessment of what the Senate should be and what can be done
about the Senate.
Next, I should like to say a few words about Senator Blois,
as I have known his name pronounced for a long time, if I may
say so, without introducing his origins, and so on. I thought it
was a French name. I join other senators in what they have
said about his resignation. I am sorry that he is leaving us. We
are losing a valuable contributor to the Senate.
[Translation]
I would like to make my remarks on the Speech from the
Throne in French. May I first quickly convey my congratulations, which I add to those of my predecessors, to the Governor
General and Mrs. Léger for the excellence of their performance in this Chamber. I should like to join the preceding
speakers and congratulate very warmly the mover and seconder of the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne,
Senator Lucier and Senator Barrow.
I would like to congratulate all honourable senators who
spoke before me and I want to convey my congratulations to
Senator Walker for his contribution which will not be
forgotten.
I do not think that the Speech of October 12, 1976 fully
indicated all the intentions of the government. The government
used a rather prudent and conciliating phraseology. It tried to
avoid controversy and did not tell immediately to the electorate, as was the case before, what bills would be introduced in
Parliament. The Speech also took care not to mention anything
too specific about controversial subjects.
Unlike previous speeches, it did not announce daring and
controversial cultural, economic or political measures which,
as we have seen, had unexpected consequences in the Canadian public opinion.
I was glad, I was comforted, I was even happy. The Speech
of October 12 and the Prime Minister's press conference which
followed showed that the government has adopted a new
approach toward the political and economic problems of
Canada.
In no way does it echo the concept adopted during the last
few months about the just society, the deficiencies of the free
market system and the role of government in our Canadian
society.
In some ways, the Speech opening the new session shows that
the government is preoccupied with getting a consensus and
with accepting the opinions of the Canadian electorate which
it had somehow neglected during the last few months.
It contains little clarification on the controversies resulting
from the Anti-Inflation Act and the wage and price controls. It
deals with new approaches for patriating our Constitution,
with serious attacks against our legislation concerning bilin-

October 26, 1976

gualism and the use of both official languages. Indeed, those are
well chosen subjects which are current issues and very important for all Canadians.
I noted with personal satisfaction that the government has
now opted for consultation with the worker, the industrialist
and the businessman before drafting legislation "to secure a
greater sharing of economic and social responsibility among all
Canadians".
For once they talk about extending the fiscal and monetary
restrictions of the government and reducing public expenses by
limiting public services growth. In the circumstances, those are
well-timed measures. They seem to understand now the importance of close cooperation with the actual creators of jobs,
those who produce for our domestic market or for profitable
exports which add value to our economy.
The businessman and the public will be pleased to know that
our industrial assistance programs will be reviewed toward
ensuring better support for Canadian industry to allow realistic international competition.
The small and middle businessman will recognize that the
proposed legislation will give him better access to credit and
ensure flexible economic growth.
The Speech from the Throne also informs Canadians about
a very reassuring decision concerning government activities
which can effectively be taken over by the private sector and
transferred without any loss in the quality of services to the
public.
The worker was also given significant consideration.
Through the unemployment insurance funds, the government
takes a stabilizing measure by maintaining a fair guaranteed
income for the worker during his retraining period. The
Speech from the Throne also contains other commitments
which must be clarified, in my opinion; I refer to co-management rights concerning labour conditions.
The Speech from the Throne states as well that the government intends to create jobs in high unemployment areas.
Personally, I wish they will and I am pleased about it. However, I remember the stagnation and difficulties which we have
witnessed and which have resulted and still result from the
government policy regarding imports of textiles and processing
goods such as the glove and footwear industry.
The Senate, as you will recall, made positive recommendations on textiles. They were implemented. Most of you will
probably remember how many times I criticized during the
last session the obsolete character of our labour legislation,
particularly the mechanism developed for collective labour
bargaining. As all of you do, honourable senators, I welcome
the new initiatives which are proposed in order to improve the
latter. I listened with some satisfaction to the appropriate and
fine comments made by my friend, Senator Laird, in this
regard. I shall come back to it later on.
Such measures are realistic and positive. They concern
issues which involved some difficulties and are presently creating important social problems. These measures should be

October 26, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

considered in a positive way and they should, in my opinion,
get some priority.
Some people are blaming the government, and are wrong to
do so, for giving up its quite daring experimental policy to
choose to come back to policy programs, in accordance with
the wishes of Canadian voters, while emphasizing those measures which have been agreed to by the people. Then, the
government is finally giving up its aggressive and control
action, which had become so unpopular among Canadian
voters. I, for one, welcome this change.
*

(2120)

[English]
The message in the Throne Speech in this respect is "middle
of the road." The government evidently rejects the views that
the market system is functioning adequately and well, just as it
rejects the views that increased government spendings and
interventions are necessary to compensate for its deficiencies. I
believe this suits Canadians well, and the Throne Speech states
it well in the following sentences:
The choice of the middle road implies a reliance on the
market to stimulate the growth Canada needs, together
with an enduring commitment to social justice and equality of opportunity. On the other hand, that choice also
implies that the working of the market must be improved
and that less costly, less interventionist ways must be
found to pursue social goals.
I do not think we can now give the interpretation that the
government has changed its political and economical directions. It does reveal, however, to voters and pressure groups
that it is much more conciliatory. Labour, business, voters do
not any longer appear to be led by the hand, so to speak, into
what has been called for political reasons the "Just Society."

e

(2130)

If there is no change from the thinking found in the Throne
Speech, we are now to expect to have a constructive consultation while leadership will be exercised in a less provocative and
in a more judicious manner. My own reservations about the
Throne Speech result from its general vagueness and the fact
that it could lead to the retention of as many options as
possible by the government. To be sure, there is no assurance
to be found in the Speech that the basic goals have been
changed. As I read it again, I am of the opinion that if it is
indicative of a sure trend, the legislation it proposes will be
economically and socially helpful to Canadians.
There is an area of our Canadian activities I should like to
touch on while I have the opportunity. On Wednesday last, I
listened with great interest to what our colleague, the Honourable John Connolly, said so eloquently about the Olympics of
1976. I concur fully with his views.
I should like to comment briefly on the Olympics and have
my remarks recorded here. The Olympics of 1976, the greatest
sports event ever, was Canada's most successful publicity and
public relations scheme. Its worth to the country cannot be
easily evaluated. We know the financial cost was high, but its
favourable effects will last for a great many years.

Canada, I am proud to say, chose to host and preside over
the international Olympics brought to Canada by Mayor Jean
Drapeau of Montreal. The event made a favourable impact on
the world, even if, because of the Taiwan affair, the Olympics
became rather political for a while. I make no apology here for
its high costs. When planned over four years ago, the estimates
tabled appeared to be acceptable and reasonable. It was on
that basis that Mayor Drapeau committed Montreal to the
Olympics. No one then expected its costs to run away because
of Canada's own run-away inflation.
You may recall that this occurred about the same time that
the James Bay hydro project estimates had to be revised
upward from $6 billion to over $16 billion. At about the same
time, some other government projects had to be revised
upward two or three times, while some were cut in size in
order that their costs might appear acceptable.
When it was agreed, four years ago, to hold the Montreal
Olympics, the original plans were approved and Montreal was
then committed to build the facilities. There was no possibility
of backing away from that commitment from then on. Whatever were the unforeseen increased costs, they had to be met.
It was most unfortunate and distasteful to witness, during the
following four years, the repeated outright blackmailing of the
Montreal committee by certain large labour unions which
should not have been allowed to escape their responsibility for
the incurred extra costs resulting from breach of contract,
renegotiated higher salaries, special overtime, holiday and
night double-wage scales, strikes and slow-downs. Far from
blaming or criticizing Mayor Drapeau or the committee for
their behaviour throughout the last few years, I compliment
them, especially the mayor, for the realization of his dream for
his Montreal, and for the creation of needed work and employ-,
ment when unemployment stood at more than 11 per cent in
his city.
He lightened the load of unemployment and welfare payments. He was responsible for providing a good deal of dignified employment for distressed Montreal workers. He was
responsible for the surplus income taxes that were paid to both
the federal and provincial governments by these workers. He
was responsible also for some tax revenue from material-supplying firms and their employees from all over Canada. Mayor
Drapeau found good ways to pay for the Olympics high costs.
His request for an extension of the Olympic Lottery for the
next few years to pay for the added costs was fair, reasonable
and fully justified.
He had great dreams, all of which were on a large scale.
They were usually realized, and has some practicality. He
realized most of them with the help of others.
Expo 67, the Montreal downtown trans-Canada throughway, the east to west Metropolitan Boulevard, the Decarie
Speedway, the beautiful Montreal Metro, and the Olympic
installations were some of his achievements. Let us take a look
at what has happened to Old Montreal during these past few
years-and at no cost to the citizens of Montreal. Old Montreal has now become one of Canada's major attractions. All
have become monuments to his initiative.

SENATE DEBATES
*

(2140)

When I hear accusations that he is ruining Montreal, I
simply compare Montreal's total per capita debt with that of
Toronto and other large metropolitan centres to find the
unfairness and injustice of such accusations. And when I
compare his city's tax rates with others, I feel somewhat
ashamed of the accusations so freely directed against Mayor
Jean Drapeau.
I want to pay high homage in the Senate to one of the most
civic-minded and civic-spirited Canadian citizens, a most
remarkable accomplisher of great things for his city, His
Honour Mayor Jean Drapeau of Montreal. I know that the
homage I am paying to him now has the approval, is understood and shared by many of my colleagues here. This hardworking Canadian is, in my judgment, one of the greatest
achievers of our time, and this is not a myth. What he has
done will stand for generations as his monument.
He helped the regional economy when it was most necessary
and in want. He saved the payment of very large unemployment benefits and welfare by our federal and provincial governments. He provided his city with permanent installations
that are and will remain tremendous attractions and great
monuments by any standard. I would be just and fair to
recognize his last concrete achievement, the Olympic installations, that benefited all Canadians and of which we have been
so proud this summer of 1976.
On motion of Senator Macdonald for Senator Asselin,
debate adjourned.

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
SILVER JUBILEE CELEBRATION-QUESTION

Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the honourable Leader of the Government. In view of the fact

October 27, 1976

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

that the Queen's Silver Jubilee falls on February 6, 1977, what
plans has the government for a special issue of stamps or coins,
or both, to celebrate the event?
Senator Perrault: I must take that question as notice, but I
want to assure honourable senators that we are deeply aware
that next year will mark Her Majesty's Silver Jubilee, and it is
the intention of the Government of Canada to honour this
significant occasion appropriately in many ways.
PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA
EQUALIZATION GRANTS-FURTHER QUESTION

Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I should
like to ask the Leader of the Government if he expects soon to
be able to answer the question I asked on October 13, 1976,
concerning equalization payments to Nova Scotia in respect of
increased oil prices and the comments of the Minister of
Energy, Mines and Resources thereon.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, because of the technical nature of the question it has required rather more
research than we had anticipated originally, but I am sure the
answer will be available shortly.
INTERNAL ECONOMY, BUDGETS AND
ADMINISTRATION
NOTICE OF COMMITTEE MEETING

Senator Laird: Honourable senators, before the Orders of
the Day are called, might I have permission to make a short
announcement?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Laird: The subcommittee on classifications of the
Standing Senate Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets
and Administration will have a short meeting in room 483-S at
2.45 today.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Lucier, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Barrow, for an Address to His Excellency the Governor
General in reply to his Speech at the opening of the
Session.-(HonourableSenator Asselin, P.C.)
Senator Asselin: With leave, honourable senators, I would
yield to Senator Quart.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Thank you very much. That is very
gentlemanly.
Senator Asselin: Always for a lady.

Senator Quart: Yes, of course.
Honourable senators, may I add my congratulations and
best wishes to Madam Speaker. It was delightful to hear the
complimentary remarks by my male colleagues on ber ability
and charm. It is obvious that male chauvinism does not exist in
this chamber. Well, not much anyway. We are proud of
Madam Speaker, a hostess par excellence.
It was very gratifying to note that His Excellency the
Governor General is well on his way to complete recovery.
Madam Léger deserves great credit for the excellent manner
in which she played ber role, in perfect English and French, in
reading the portion of the Speech from the Throne assigned to
ber. It was truly a magnificent example of family solidarity.
The mover and seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne acquitted themselves creditably.
The Leader of the Government, Senator Perrault, and the
Leader of the Opposition, Senator Flynn, seem to be in great
form to continue the fray. The Senate is fortunate to have two
dedicated leaders, both endowed with a rare gift of witty
repartee.
In the Speech from the Throne I was particularly interested
in the passage referring to the Law Reform Commission of
Canada, which said:
This year, the Law Reform Commission of Canada
submitted a report on family law which merits the attention of all Canadians. The government intends to carry on
discussions with the provinces to encourage the creation of
unified family courts with comprehensive jurisdiction over
family law permitting disputes to be dealt with more
constructively. In addition the government will discuss
with the provinces and with the public other aspects of
family law bearing on the stability of marriage, the
protection of children and the fair sharing of the economic consequences of marital breakdown.
At the top of my list of priorities in women's rights legislation is equal pay for equal work of equal value, and equal
opportunity for promotion and training on the job. The
Ontario government is taking a great step forward by introducing changes to family law and giving husbands and wives
an equal share in the family assets.
Honourable senators, I am sure you expect me to speak
about women, so I shall try to give an evaluation of the extent
to which International Women's Year advanced the cause of
women's rights. It certainly did something to focus attention
on the inadequate legislation for women in most countries.
International Women's Year had a particular value in bringing
together women and men of different countries to compare
notes and stimulate the so-called backward countries into
positive action. International Women's Year produced many
recommendations but little legislation. Anyway, International
Women's Year is over and done, amen.
The conference in Mexico was officially opened by the
Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and he was followed by President Luis Echeverria, who
stressed that the important and major thrust of the Interna-

SENATE DEBATES
tional Women's Year conference should be to reorganize the
world economic order and fight for the establishment of a new
international economic order that would benefit women and
men equally.
Despite the angry discussions and political frustrations, the
Canadian delegation participating in the International
Women's Year conference at Mexico labelled the two-week
conference a success, which was contrary to the opinion of
many delegations.
The conference approved a plan for a world redistribution of
wealth and an anti-Zionist motion. The Canadian delegation
voted against both these motions. It is a fact that International
Women's Year has not produced any miracle solution or
impact on discrimination, and many claim it was a wasted and
costly year. A reporter of the Toronto Star described IWY as
follows:
International Women's Year was launched with such a
naive optimism that only starry-eyed feminists could fall
for all the publicity and hoopla, or believe in the promises
of equality that would end all discrimination between men
and women. But the best joke of all was to ensure 100 per
cent integration of women in economic, social and cultural fields.
In my opinion, even if nothing else was accomplished,
International Women's Year created an interest in what actually emerged at great cost of money, time and energy and has
generated some serious thoughts as to the value of the United
Nations suggestion at Mexico. That suggestion was approved
at the UN General Assembly on December 15, 1975, and
proclaimed the period of 1976 to 1985 the United Nations
decade for women devoted to equality, development and peace.
Now, surely, honourable senators, we are not going to be
subjected to all this wrangling for the next ten years-and at
what enormous cost? A representative of a Canadian women's
national organization commenting on the proposed decade for
women said:
The politicians are at it again with promises and promises.
They want to lull women into a stupor by setting up more
conferences and advisory committees to hash over
women's rights, equality, et cetera, et cetera-and will we
have to listen for a decade to the militant women libbers'
jargon and whining?
Why spend money in Canada on more action committees,
surveys, conferences, et cetera to advise the government on
women's rights and equality? The government is well aware of
what women want and of the discrimination where it exists, so
why not legislate where needed and be donc with it? It is truc
that legislation as to women's rights has made progress, but
the so-called "long-suffering women" still have inadequate and
only patchwork legislation.
In fairness to the Honourable Marc Lalonde, on October 15,
1975, he organized a one-day conference for over 300 male
executives from the world of business, labour, industry, education and the media. Apart from the men, approximately 100
experienced women were invited, including women senators

October 27, 1976

and members of Parliament. The participants were treated to
an analysis of prevailing attitudes toward women, and Monsieur Lalonde stated in the keynote address that "the principle
of equality must become a reality." Good luck, Mr. Lalonde.
Dr. Barbara Landan, Director of the Adolescent Unit of the
Queen Street Mental Health Centre in Toronto, pointed out
that successful women are few, and that most women undergo
an internal struggle because success is associated with aggressivity or masculinity. She pointed out that when women are
successful their male peers frequently have difficulty accepting
them as equals.
The activities undertaken by women's organizations during
International Women's Year made men more conscious of
women's search for equality and personal identity. That statement makes me think of a survey taken in the United States on
working wives, which showed:
0

(1420)

That the majority of men agree that any reasonable man
should share home tasks with a working wife.
That is fine in theory, but does it always work? Take the case
of a Boston businessman who is all out for equality for career
women and working wives. He agreed that his wife should
work, and she asked him to draw up a contract for both to sign
in order to avoid future controversy.
The husband drew up a list of home chores that he was
willing to do without any persuasion from his wife. All went
well for a short while, but then he claimed that he was worn
out trying to cope with his part of the bargain. His wife would
not let him revise the list, and when he could not persuade her
he decided to sabotage the arrangement by an "accidentally
done-on-purpose" technique of ruining his cooking, and by
doing his cleaning chores only when he felt like it. So "wifey"
had to shoulder more than her share of the work if she wanted
a clean house and palatable meals.
Let us bc honest. Most men resent doing housework. The
stereotyped ideas about "man's work" and "woman's work"
are so ingrained that what we think does not always jibe with
what we feel. As honourable senators know, men work from
sunup to sundown but woman's work is never done! Men are
stunned by the amount of time and energy housework requires,
despite all the push-button electrical devices used in the
modern household. It is said that when two people marry they
become one. The husband usually is the one. The poor man
may be the head of the house, but the woman is the heart, and
we all know that the heart is what keeps one alive and kicking.
Bankers claim that the best way for a woman's rating to go
down is for her to get married; if her husband is a financial
risk, her credit rating suffers.
In July, 1976, the federal government reported a substantial
increase in unemployed women. In fact, in July the actual
number of jobless women climbed to some 357,000 from
321,000 in June, a decrease of 36,000 jobs in a month. It
makes one wonder if this is "male employer chauvinist"
retaliation to women's lib.

October 27, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

A recent United States survey showed that older men who
look upon marriage in traditional terms, and who grew up in
an era when women normally stayed at home, often find it
more difficult to accept the idea of a working wife. In contrast,
many younger men have never known a woman who did not
continue to work or follow a career after marriage. So, working wives and shared responsibilities present no problem for
them.
Strangely enough, a University of California study revealed
that the sharpest increase in broken marriages occurred among
women who did not have jobs outside the home, which proves
that idleness is the devil's pastime.
Honourable senators may recall that in September, 1975,
the National Organization for Women of the United States,
known briefly as NOW, called upon all women to go on strike
on October 29 to show the United States how much it depended on women. Ms. Davlyn Jones, the coordinator of the strike,
a militant women's libber, appealed to housewives, women
teachers, industrial workers, clerks, nursemaids, telephone
operators, domestics, lawyers, doctors, dentists, and even
professional prostitutes, to join in a one-day strike in the
United States and Canada in order to leave their menfolk in a
mess, wondering how to carry on without women. I think it
was in Chicago-I cannot recall her name, but bless her-that
an unknown housewife used the media to beg women of
common sense to ignore NOW's campaign to strike. The strike
was a complete failure and, in the wake of that failure, NOW
was stunned and humiliated.
The newspapers on October 30 reported the strike as a
"flop" and said that it was "frivolous and counter-productive"
to the women's movement-which proves what is generally
believed, that there is a revolution going on in the women's
liberation group. Recent reports indicate a lag in women's lib
in Europe and the United States, and here in Canada the place
of the woman as a family figure still predominates. This
counter-revolution seems to be gaining ground with younger
women and teenagers. It is quite a different kind of liberation
they want; a liberation that does not support aggressive militancy, one that does not denounce all men in general as
chauvinist manipulators of women. They want liberation which
is based on common sense, cooperation and teamwork with
men. My bet is that this tolerant and understanding attitude
will succeed.
What concerns me sufficiently to brave the wrath of the
women's lib is that with all their real and imagined gripes and
an undercurrent of hatred of men, they will cause normal
women and men to become so confused on issues that we will
be getting our signals crossed. These extremist groups are an
insult to the intelligence and delicacy of most women who
support equal rights.
For women aged 50 years or over there can be very little
basic changes in deep-rooted attitudes. In fact, no women's lib
or any other feminist group has any right to ridicule or
attempt to force denial of choice on any woman on any issue
such as a way of life.

And now I come to the recent survey commissioned by the
Honourable Marc Lalonde at a cost of $110,000, only to find
out that Canadian attitudes have not changed significantly
during 1975 and 1976. The most frequent recommendation
was for equal pay and equal employment opportunities for
women.
The survey concluded that male chauvinism remains deeply
entrenched in Canadian society, perhaps because some men
perceived the impact of International Women's Year as a
threat to their own jobs and economic position by removing
barriers to women in the labour force. So, to sum up, the cost
to Canada of International Women's Year was $5 millionworth of advertising, programmed hoopla, grants to organizations, special projects, et cetera, not to forget the "Why Not,
Pourquoi Pas" buttons! Was the survey truly worth it only to
learn what many suspected, namely, that International
Women's Year had failed to impress 87 per cent of the adult
population where attitudes remained static as to change? So,
Monsieur Lalonde, legislation, where needed, is what is
needed. Obviously conferences and surveys are not the answer
if one wants to achieve equality. Maybe I'm becoming somewhat militant regarding women's legal inequalities. Laws are
made by parliamentarians and these laws reflect the exclusion
of women's opinions from the law-making process. Legislation
concerning women is uniform in many provinces of Canada, as
it should be, but whereas the province of Quebec is far ahead
of the country in some legislation, it is a century behind in
others.
I shail quote from a brief presented to the Canadian Law
Reform Commission by a group of women from Quebec:
It is the only province which in International Women's
Year permitted women to be fired because they were
pregnant, and allowed employers to refuse to hire married
women, and accepted union contracts which stipulated
that women were to receive as little as half the salaries of
men in the same jobs. In Quebec it is permissible for an
employer to refuse to promote women because of their
sex, and to admit it openly.
Therefore, Monsieur Bourassa, take heed.
In the federal field, Monsieur Lalonde, it is up to you and
the three women members of the cabinet to convince the Prime
Minister, your colleagues and the members of Parliament to
pass laws to improve women's status. Don't worry about the
approval of the Senate, Monsieur Lalonde. This chamber has a
perfect record of giving assent to any legislation approved by
the cabinet-and in justice to honourable senators, women can
trust their common sense, justice and gallantry to support any
reasonable approach to equality, and equal opportunities for
women.

Hon. Martial Asselin: Honourable senators, first of all I
want to congratulate Senator Quart for ber speech. If the men
do not soon get together and form an association to fight for
their equality and their interests, they will soon be outstripped

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
by the women, especially by those who in the House of
Commons and in the Senate make speeches of the calibre of
that delivered this afternoon by Senator Quart.
Of course, as in years past I intended to take part in the
debate on the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
I hesitated to do so because, naturally, my learned colleagues
in this chamber went over almost all the topics mentioned in
the Speech from the Throne. I wondered whether my comments could bring anything to the debate. On second thought,
I decided that I too should do my share and bring my
contribution.
As tradition would have us, when we speak to the Speech
from the Throne, we congratulate the movers of the Address in
reply. In my turn, I therefore congratulate them and say to
them that they performed their duty with courage. Courage
because on glancing at their intervention they did not say
much about the Speech from the Throne but spoke of the
problems of their respective provinces. I want to congratulate
them because they did so beautifully.
Madam Speaker, I also want to congratulate you for the
way you carry out your responsibilities as Speaker of the
Senate. You do it in an unbiased manner. Moreover, you are
assured of all the cooperation of honourable senators on this
side of the bouse.
Today I am very pleased indeed to see that Senator Perrault
is still Leader of the Government.
Senator Choquette: You had doubts?
Senator Asselin: Yes, I doubted seeing him back in his seat
because, if you read over the statement made by Mr. Marchand when he left the federal scene to go to Quebec, you will
see he said, "I had several options. I could have taken over
another department because the Prime Minister invited me to
come back in cabinet in September. I refused on principle. I
was also offered another option. I was told: why not go to the
Senate to become Leader of the Government there?" Obviously these words by Mr. Marchand grieved us a little because,
although the Leader of the Government does his job well, it
remains that he is the one who must be answered. Now and
again we must refute the arguments he brings before the
Senate. I think he has an important position here, among the
official opposition, because he is a good target; however, he
still defends himself very well. Senators on the government
side were so concerned that Senator Connolly decided to set
the matter straight. Having read Mr. Marchand's statement,
Senator Connolly rose on a question of privilege to say how
much we wanted Senator Perrault to remain Leader of the
Government in the Senate. It is obvious Senator Connolly was
reminded of his adventure when Senator Martin was appointed
government leader in the Senate. So I believe he bas done a
good job. I commend him for having reassured the Senate,
particularly the senators on the government side, that Senator
Perrault would still be with us at least for another session.
Incidentally, I would like on my behalf to wish Senator
Connolly well. I am told he is in hospital. I would like, on my

October 27, 1976
October 27, 1976

behalf and on behalf of the official opposition, to wish him a
speedy recovery.
Senator Perrault will, of course, have to leave some day, and
we are ready to take his place since we know that we will very
soon be called upon to form the next government. I can assure
you that we have here a leader who is fidgetting, ready to cross
the floor of the house and take Senator Perrault's place. I am
sure it will be an excellent choice on the part of the next
government when the Leader of the Official Opposition will
become the Leader of the Government.
I read the Speech from the Throne. Not unlike many others,
I found it was vague, lacking in precision and mute about
many very important matters. I think the Speech from the
Throne amounts to an electoral proclamation for restoring the
fortunes of the government. Somebody in the other place
said-and he was not wrong-that the Speech from the
Throne was written by Dr. Gallup, of Gallup poll fame, to give
back to the government the prestige it had lost during these
last months.
I was waiting for a Speech from the Throne which would
first grapple with priority economic matters. I told myself that,
because our country was in a difficult situation as concerns the
economy, unemployment, inflation and high taxes, we would at
last have a Speech from the Throne which would show us at
once the economic and legislative priorities of this government.
I was very disappointed last week when the Leader of the
Government in the other place presented a list of legislation to
be immediately introduced. The matter was urgent. In this list
I have here with me I cannot see any legislation which would
give priority to the economic problems of Canada. Indeed, that
is the one and only very important problem this government
now has to meet. The point is to get this country out of the
present economic stagnation. Let us see now what we have as
legislative priority.
*

(1440)

We have a bill to amend the Canada Deposit Insurance
Corporation Act and one to amend the Canada Lands Surveys
Act. That surely is good for the economy. We have a bill
respecting Diplomatic and Consular Privileges and Immunities
in Canada. All that is economically viable. We have an act
respecting the administration and development of certain fishing and recreational harbours in Canada. That is also
economically viable. We have an act respecting the national
anthem of Canada. That is important, but it can wait. Economic matters are far more important. We have an act on
historic sites and monuments. That is economically viable. We
have an act to amend the customs tariffs and also a few others
that are listed. But where are the legislative economic priorities of the government?
So, as I suggested earlier, Canada is faced with an alarming
inflation, with an unemployment rate which has nearly become
historic in the political annals of Canada. What should the
government do? First and immediately after the Speech from
the Throne it should urgently introduce top priority economic
legislation in the other place to give that problem the most
attention possible.

October 27, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

What is serious, very serious, is that the government is now
suffering from a credibility gap. Public polls show an increasing lack of confidence in the government among the people
because Canadians do not know where their government is
leading them.
Are we moving toward a more socialistic society? Is the
government going to interfere in private business, as the head
of the goveriment suggested last year at press conferences? Or
will they maintain the policy of free enterprise where I think
competition is still the best incentive for the economic development of this country?
Honourable senators, what are the objectives the government has in mind once the controls are lifted? That is an
important question. It is all very nice to accept controls over
salaries and prices for a period of one or two years, but what
are the objectives of the government after that? How are we
going to put the economy of this country back on the right
track? It is not enough to say that we have established price
and wage controls and that they are going to last for a year or
two. But what businessmen want to know-and they are
prepared to cooperate to help put the Canadian economy back
on its feet-what they want to know is what is going to happen
next.
The Speech from the Throne does not give any details on
that question. What are we going to do to settle the serious
problems of our balance of payments, when we know that the
competitive position which Canada reached in the past on the
international markets is still deteriorating? Because of the
high costs of housing, many Canadians cannot afford to buy
their own homes. In 1976, those on low salaries have to borrow
money to build their own houses. But, because of the high
interest rates, these people must borrow money to finance the
building of their houses but they can only pay the interest on
their loans because of the extravagant cost of money in our
country. And all this because Canadian currency is held at an
extremely high inflationary level.
I wonder what the government has done to help the so-called
grey areas. As you know, I come from a rural area where
investments are rare. Consequently, we need government programs to stimulate our economy and give jobs to our people.
We put a lot of hope in the regional development programs
that the government launched, or in the programs aimed at
reducing regional disparities. Unfortunately, we have been
deceived by the application of this program.
[English]
Speaking as a senator from the province of Quebec, I do not
deny that Quebec is getting its full share of federal government aid through DREE. However, that aid is not being
properly directed. It seems to be going into the urban areas,
for the most part, whereas it is our rural and semi-rural
districts that are suffering. Of the grant money going into the
province of Quebec through DREE, 80 per cent ends up in the
major urban areas of Quebec City, greater Montreal and Trois
Rivières. In other words, 80 per cent of the jobs being created

in the province of Quebec through financial aid from the
federal government are being created in the urban areas.
As a result, there is an exodus from the rural and semi-rural
regions to the urban areas. People are leaving the rural areas
of Quebec in search of jobs in the urban areas, which is the
very thing DREE was designed to prevent or counteract.
DREE funds were to be directed towards the development of
industry in the rural areas, and the creation of jobs in those
areas so that people would not have to move to the urban
centres and contribute further to the problem of overcrowding
there. That is not how it is working in practice. Officials of
DREE do not insist that firms receiving grants should set up
shop in rural areas. As a matter of fact, DREE does not seem
to pay close attention to who is soliciting funds under the
program.
It appears to me that too much of the available money is
going to large companies. To cite one example, IBM was
granted $6 million in 1971 to locate in Montreal. There are
two things wrong with that. First of al, Montreal is not as
badly in need of job creation as are some of the rural and
semi-rural areas. Secondly, this company would likely have set
up there in any event, without the government's help, if it were
practical for it to do so. Not enough of DREE's help is going
to small and medium-sized businesses; particularly, not enough
of it is going to helping companies involved in the production
of durable goods. That is the economic sector that is moving.
That is where the demand is.
*

(1450)

Another shortcoming is that DREE waits for people to
apply for grants. There is a lack of communication. The
government should be aware that a small or medium-sized
business in a rural or semi-rural district is not likely to have a
battery of super-sophisticated big-city lawyers fully conversant
with the various ways in which one goes about lobbying the
federal government and its departments for grants. The small
rural entrepreneur is often not aware of the help that is
available, and the government is not doing enough to make
him aware. Also, DREE has no way of verifying that the
claims made by a firm when it applies for a grant-claims,
that is, with regard to the number of jobs the firm will create
with the grant-ever become a reality.
I fear that at times, when jobs have been created at a new
plant opened up with federal aid, the same firm has closed
another plant and put the same number of people out of work,
so that there is no net increase in jobs.
Another crying shame, as far as DREE is concerned, is the
lack of coordination with Canada Manpower. I have heard the
excuse that there is, for example, an electronics plant wanting
to set up in the province. DREE tells the people that if they
want help they should set up perhaps in the Gaspé region.
They will counter by saying that there is no skilled labour
there, and so DREE will agree to let them set up in some
urban area. What they should do is to get Manpower to
institute a training program for the unemployed in the rural or
semi-rural region in question, and insist that the firm set up
there, even if it is not going to be for another year. At least,

SENATE DEBATES
the people will be interested in taking the training if they know
they will later be able to use it and earn a living in their own
area.
In short, DREE is wasting a lot of money in Quebec. It is
not going to the right places. Geographically, it keeps going to
the urban areas where it is not needed. In terms of business, it
is going to the large firms who could get along without it.
Economically, it is going to help industries that very often have
limited scope and a rather short future. We are not making
sound investments with our DREE moneys.
[Translation]
In short, this program was supposed to be extremely useful
for the people in rural and semi-rural areas and those who
need it to establish industries. As I said, if this program were
well managed and better coordinated, it would be quite effective. This is what rural areas need to create employment for
idle men and women who would still like to work.
Honourable senators, I have just stated briefly that economic conditions are bad in Canada.
I also regret to add that things are also bad in Canada as far
as national unity is concerned. Never in my opinion has
national unity been jeopardized to such an extent. We are now
witnessing a growing wave of fanaticism in English as well as
French Canada. The principle of the Official Languages Act is
being challenged, yet all political parties-I repeat, all political parties in the other place, in the House of Commonsapproved that principle and still support it. However, dogmatism, imbalance and fanaticism have dealt the worst blows to
bilingualism. Nevertheless, honourable senators, bilingualism
in the civil service is only the acknowledgment of a fair rule.
As I said, this is only recognizing a principle of fairness. If the
government erred in the implementation of that principle of
bilingualism in the public service, because that apparently is
the problem, they should correct the situation in order that
that principle of justice may be adhered to.
All kinds of problems were met across the country concerning the language policy. In western Canada and in other
English-speaking areas the suggestion will be that the language policy goal is to force every Canadian to speak both
French and English. It is nothing of the kind. We hear the
same remarks from certain extremist groups in Quebec.
The language principle is not aimed at forcing French down
the throats of Anglophones, or English down the throats of
Francophones. Bilingualism in the public service is to allow
any Canadian taxpayer to communicate in his mother tongue
with the representatives of his government, with the representatives of his Parliament.
In my view, the current language malaise is due to the fact
the government failed in giving a clear explanation of its
policies under the Official Languages Act when that legislation was passed, either in the House of Commons or in the
Senate. I believe we had the best example of that last summer
when the air-to-ground communications problems arose in
Quebec. That was a striking example. Can you imagine: even
the Minister of Transport, a member of cabinet, has failed to

October 27, 1976

grasp the principle of bilingualism and its repercussions in the
public service. He did not understand that issue of air-toground communications. He did not understand the official
languages principle.
As far as air-to-ground communications are concerned for
French-speaking pilots in Quebec, I submit that the most
stringent safety considerations alone-and this would have to
be proven-might warrant a withdrawal of the right to speak
French in air-to-ground communications in Quebec. I believe I
made myself sufficiently clear on this point. However a board
of inquiry was established. Air Canada was drawn before the
courts to examine whether its instructions to its pilots to use
only English were legal. The Quebec Court of Appeal found
this was not so. It ordered Air Canada to withdraw its
instructions to Quebec pilots, and to provide French translations of its manuals. That judgment was rendered more than a
month ago, but yesterday I read in the papers that injunctions
had to be taken to force a crown corporation to comply with a
court order. Such is the situation, honourable senators.
In addition to the bilingualism crisis, we are now facing a
constitutional crisis. Everything is fine in Canada, just fine!
We are facing a constitutional crisis. This time the provinces
want to frustrate the federal efforts to patriate the
Constitution.
How can unity exist in the country when there is a constitutional confrontation between the federal government and the
provinces on such a vital and crucial issue?
One will say that the Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, during
his trip to Quebec City, provoked the provinces about the
patriation of the Constitution and that he even said about Mr.
Bourassa, "Ti-Pit Bourassa does not know anything about it."
He even called him "Ti-Pit" when he was in Quebec City. It
was related that the Prime Minister provoked the provinces
when he added, "If you do not want to patriate the Constitution with an amending formula acceptable to all provinces, I
will do it unilaterally." It is obvious that if such was the
intention of the Prime Minister, it was a kind of challenge to
the provinces. We have also seen that there is no agreement in
the cabinet on that matter since the Minister of National
Defence has deemed necessary to resign as a result of that
disagreement. Everything is going fine, just fine, in Canada.
Mr. Richardson, the Minister of National Defence, has just
resigned on a question of principle in connection with the
constitutional issue. However, our situation in Quebec is a lot
worse just now. The election campaign is in full swing. Mr.
Bourassa, the leader of the Liberal Party in Quebec, has
introduced his platform by saying, "Listen, this election will be
of great significance to Canadian history, because very important constitutional issues must be settled," yet there has been
no federal-provincial conference to deal fully with this issue of
the patriation of the Constitution to Canada and the ways to
amend it.
Then there was the letter addressed by Premier Lougheed of
Alberta to the Right Hon. Mr. Trudeau, Prime Minister of
Canada, dictating to him certain terms to be discussed with
the provinces. However, there has been no firm negotiations

October 27, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

yet between the federal government and the provinces to
discuss and agree on a patriation formula and the ways to
amend the Constitution.

•

(1500)

We are still waiting for that. Just imagine, we are still
waiting and Mr. Bourassa says, "We are living historical
times. I must call an election on this issue because we shall
have to fight great battles with the federal government." So,
the provincial government and Mr. Bourassa want a confrontation with the federal government. As you can see, everything
is all right in Canada; everything is fine in Quebec as well.
As for us, we are caught. We do not know what Mr.
Bourassa is referring to. Last time, during the election campaign, they were talking about cultural sovereignty but he bas
never defined it. Now he is talking about the primacy of the
legislative assembly in cultural and communications areas. He
still does not define it. He claims he is pressing for cultural
and communications safeguards, but we do not know against
what. He does not mention how this will affect certain federal
agencies. We know a bit about constitutional matters but let
us think of the little guy who is going to vote and knows
nothing about the Constitution. The premier is saying to him:
This is a momentous decision, give me a mandate. Then he
talks about solving a problem that he has not even discussed.
And now, Mr. Bourassa, who has 100 seats in the assembly
says, "I am going to hold an election because I want a clear
and specific mandate."
You can now see the situation the Quebec voters are in. It-is
no surprise, with the bickering over the Constitution, the
bilingualism problem, the confrontation between Bourassa and
Trudeau and the premiers of other provinces, if separatism is
rising in Quebec. The people say: those politicians do not know
where they are going. There is a separatist option, so people
will go for it and vote accordingly. Then, you will see-I am
not a separatist, I believe in federalism, in Quebec nationalism
at least-but you will see at the next election that the Parti
Québécois could get 35 per cent of the votes. People will
wonder why? It is for this reason. It is because of the disagreement. People say, "We want a clear and precise option and the
Parti Québécois provides it. Let us try this government. Then
if it wants independence we will ask for a referendum and we
wilI refuse. Then we will have a government like the others." It
is tomorrow that the Quebec populationSenator Langlois: There will then be two referendums
instead of one.
Senator Asselin: In any event, I am certainly not here to
defend Lévesque's thesis.
Such is the situation in which Quebec voters find themselves. In spite of all this, it is funny because in the election
campaign now under way in Quebec we see things that were
never seen before. Some ministers, while with the federal
government, always supported Mr. Trudeau on those matters
which have always been essential and of prime importance.
They always maintained that the other provinces were wrong.
The same ministers-there are at least two now-are going to

Quebec to help Bourassa and tell him: you are right and
Trudeau is wrong. How can Quebec voters vote properly? Two
ministers of the Trudeau government, who always supported
the same Trudeau on the essential linguistic and constitutional
policies, leave Mr. Trudeau saying they will help Bourassa
defend his position against the federal government. That tops
it all.
I have spoken long enough now but there is something I
would like to add in conclusion. I read the speech of the
Leader of the Government. I found something very reasonable
in it. The leader stated that he had considered a 'kind of
formula-I do not know what formula but I hope he will say
more about it-to allow the Senate's participation in the
national unity debate. I hope I was not confused, that I read
correctly even though my sight is bad. I believe I did read that
in his speech. He has in mind a formula-as he said, of course
the vocation of the Senate is to protect the rights of minorities
and provinces-the government leader had in mind a formula
to be used by the Senate to clarify the situation about national
unity.
I do not know what kind of formula. Is it reasonable? I want
to tell the Leader of the Government that we on this side of the
bouse are going to examine it seriously and that we will always
be happy to cooperate with him to devise a formula which, we
hope, could restore the confidence of Canadians in their
institutions and put an end to the rising confrontation climate
which, in my opinion, is destroying our country.

MANPOWER AND IMMIGRATION
REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE ON MANPOWER
DIVISION-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Everett calling the attention of the Senate to the
Report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance, appointed in the last session of Parliament and
authorized in that session to examine in detail and report
upon the Estimates of the Manpower Division of the
Department of Manpower and Immigration for the fiscal
year ended the 31st March, 1975, tabled in the Senate on
Tuesday, 19th October, 1976.-(Honourable Senator
Petten).

Senator Petten: Honourable senators, I yield to the honourable Senator Sparrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow: Honourable senators, I am
pleased to be able to speak in this debate concerning the report
of the National Finance Committee on Canada Manpower, as
it affords me the opportunity to tell honourable senators how I
enjoyed being-and I hope I can continue to be-a member of

SENATE DEBATES
that committee. Working in close harmony with the intelligent
and talented members of that committee was an exhilarating
experience. I want to express to them my thanks for being
friendly and helpful, and generous in sharing their great
knowledge and expertise with me.
It affords me as well the opportunity to congratulate Senator Everett on his excellent speech of a few days ago, in which
he explained to this chamber some of the details of the
workings of the National Finance Committee, and particularly
on his explanation of this report.
As the committee's chairman, Senator Everett has brought a
wealth of experience, a broad knowledge, and an open and
innovative mind to our deliberations, and through his leadership the committee has broadened its scope to in-depth studies
that have been of great value to Canada.
The Canada Manpower report itself is receiving wide
acclaim as a constructive document. I consider this report as
being of great value to the Canadian public, particularly that
part of Canadian society seeking employment now and in the
future.
If the recommendations contained in the report are afforded
their proper place in the future deliberations of the government and the Department of Manpower and Immigration, the
efficiency in the administration of the department will be
measurably improved, the cost of matching people to jobs will
be reduced, and greater satisfaction to more job seekers will
result within a shorter time frame. The benefit of bringing
more people into the work force earlier than usual will, in
addition to the obvious monetary and social benefits to the
worker, bring relief to the unemployment insurance fund and
social welfare funds, and will result in a positive increase in the
gross national product.
The value of in-depth studies of the operation of government
departments has now been proved, and I hope the National
Finance Committee will continue with such studies in the
future.
These special studies should not, and I hope will not, restrict
nor appear to diminish the importance of the review of the
estimates that are laid before Parliament from time to time. I
consider the right of honourable senators to question any area
of government spending in committee, and their privilege of
debating the estimates in the chamber, important fundamental
rights. Indeed, they provide opportunities for members of the
Senate to better serve their country by informing Canadians of
the contents of the estimates.
I am pleased to know that the committee has challenged
itself to take an on-going look at its report, and to meet with
the minister of the department and his officials from time to
time, in order to determine whether, in fact, the department
has been dilatory in carrying out the recommendations contained therein. I suppose in this regard we can take a leaf from
Senator Croll's book. He has not let his reports wither and die,
but continually jogs the memories of this chamber, the government and the people of Canada as to the important recommendations made by committees he has chaired by outlining those

October 27, 1976

areas on which action has been taken as well as those on which
there has been no action. This approach adds immensely to the
value of the study. It is too easy for the government of the day,
for many reasons, to avoid implementing recommendations.
The approach of doggedly bringing to the attention of the
government recommendations that have not been carried out
has been proven by Senator Croll to be of value, because most
of the changes proposed by committees with which he has been
involved have eventually been accepted by government.
Senator Everett has outlined in detail three major recommendations in the report. Those three major recommendations
follow along the line that Canada Manpower should not
operate like a private employment agency but as an unemployment agency, and must assist job seekers who want help. It
cannot refuse to assist job seekers who want assistance. Training of the unemployed and the under-employed should be
related more to the job market as it exists today, and to the job
market which will exist in the future. The tendency in recent
time has been for Canada Manpower to move into the welfare
field, and it is the committee's recommendation that if people
require welfare assistance they should be referred to the existing agencies that can help them. Your committee believes that
the job of Canada Manpower should be confined to placement,
counselling and training.
In addition to the foregoing recommendations which were
explained in detail by Senator Everett, there are a number of
others, some of which I would like to comment on. There has
been much discussion over a number of years of the role of
private placement agencies. These are agencies that find suitable employees for employers on a fee-for-service basis.
Employers are obviously prepared to pay well for the services
of such agencies, as there has been a steady growth in their
number. Such agencies are specifically prohibited in a number
of European countries. Canada has not followed suit in this
regard, and has not ratified the relevant Convention of the
International Labour Organization (No. 96), passed in 1949,
which proposes the abolition of fee-charging employment
agencies conducted with a view to profit.
The former Minister of Manpower and Immigration, the
Honourable Robert Andras, told the committee that no federal
action is at present under consideration which would-and I
quote his words-"arbitrarily insist on the elimination of all
private agencies which operate under business licences from
the provinces," even though the government receives many
recommendations regarding this matter, the majority of which
recommend a restriction of private agencies in their
operations.
There is, in fact, a private member's bill which was placed
on the order paper of the other house a few days ago, which, if
passed, would require the federal government to negotiate with
the provinces with respect to legislating the provisions of the
International Labour Organization's convention, thus effectively destroying such private agencies. It is my opinion that
the private agencies are filling a need in the labour market,
and are doing it without the aid of tax dollars, and their
services should not be curtailed in any way. I further believe

October 27, 1976

October 27, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

Canada Manpower training programs each year. This part of
the division's responsibility uses in excess of 60 per cent of its
total budget. It is recognized that this function is important to
the job seeker and to the employer.
There is an unattractive statistic to face, however, and that
is that over one million people have only four years or less of
formal schooling. This is the portion of the adult population of
Canada which is considered to be functionally illiterate, and
their underemployment can be directly attributed to this fact.
It has been established that the unemployment rate among
those who have not completed primary school is six times
higher than that among high school graduates. The cost of
basic training for skill development accounts for about onethird of the cost of all institutional training, or well over $100
million per year.
These facts are disturbing indeed, when one considers that
basic education is a responsibility of provincial governments.
When we have one million functionally illiterate persons in our
nation, it appears to me that the provinces have been, if not
negligent, at least lax in their duties. These statistics are even
more alarming when we realize that Canadians spend more
per capita on education than any other developed country; and
that our educators are the best paid.
The report states that the committee is concerned when
basic educational training, an area which is essentially a
provincial responsibility, is costing the Manpower Division in
excess of $100 million annually, and recommends that this
situation be reassessed and remedial action taken as necessary.
There are a number of other concerns expressed in the
report and further recommendations are made. I hope that
honourable senators will find the time to read the complete
report. However, if that is not possible, a reading of the
summary of conclusions and recommendations would be most
helpful towards a better understanding of the problems
outlined.
I commend this report to honourable senators.

activities. An average of about 300,000 persons participate in

that the Department of Manpower and Immigration should
not embark on any new programs that would compete with the
private agencies in the area of finding employment on a
fee-for-service basis. This, I believe, is an area of service which
should be left to the private agencies.
The report itself states:
It would be difficult for the Division to take over a viable
part of the market from the entrenched private agencies
who have a high degree of acceptance by employers.
Unless the division were conspicuously successful the image of
the public employment service held by employers would be
further damaged. It is more important that the division concentrate on making its basic placement function more effective
without adding any new areas of activity requiring expensive
specialization.
The committee's recommendation, to which I subscribe, is
that expansion of the professional and executive placement
services would be a questionable use of public funds. It also
recommends that the division should not develop a distinctive
specialized service, even if a fee were to be charged for this
service.
Another proposal that concerns me, one that is made from
time to time, is that employers be required to list all their job
vacancies with Canada Manpower. If this were the case, the
statistics of the department in relation to the number of
placements would be high, but that is the only benefit I see of
such action. I believe that such a requirement would not
benefit either the employer or the job seeker. The employer
and the job seeker should always have the freedom of choice as
to whether they use the government agency or not. Any
compulsory measures in this regard would be a retrograde
step. The committee report states in its conclusions that
employers should not be required to list all vacancies with
Centres. I subscribe to this
Canada Manpower
recommendation.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
ADJOURNMENT

Senator Petten: Honourable senators, I move, with leave of
the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(g), that when the
Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Tuesday
next, November 2, at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Honourable senators, before the question is put I should like
to give you a brief summary of the work scheduled for the
coming week.

October 28, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

First, the committees. On Tuesday the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs will meet at 2.30 p.m. to
continue its study of the two preceding sessions of Canada's
relations with the United States. The Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications will hold its organization meeting when the Senate rises.
On Wednesday there will be an organization meeting of the
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture at 10 a.m.
On Thursday at 9.30 a.m. there will be another meeting of
the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs concerning
Canada-United States relations. Also on Thursday at 9.15
a.m. there will be an organization meeting of the Standing
Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science.
In the Senate it is expected that the debate on the motion of
Senator Lucier, seconded by Senator Barrow, for an Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne will be concluded on
Tuesday evening. Bill C-15, dealing with customs tariffs, now
before the other place, should reach us before we meet next
week.
Senator Flynn: That is the only bill that is expected for next
week?
Senator Petten: This is the only bill we know of at this time.
Senator Flynn: No bill will be initiated in the Senate?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, there will be a
number of bills originating in the Senate again this session. I
hope to have a more complete report at the beginning of the
week. However, I assure you that there are pieces of proposed
legislation that we will be handling very shortly.
Senator Flynn: No probability of being recalled urgently as
we were last week?
Senator Croll: Friday or Saturday?
Senator Flynn: I asked about this last week and I was told
there was no chance of our being recalled. I had scarcely
reached home when I received a phone call that the Senate
had been recalled.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, as much as possible
we shall attempt to avoid circumstances of the kind that
prevailed on Friday last. Again on behalf of the government I
want to apologize for the fact that the deepening gravity of the
crisis at Halifax and the government's final response had not
been totally determined before we adjourned last week. At the
same time, I want to thank so many senators, some of whom
came from great distances to make possible the passage of this
important legislation.
Senator Flynn: I think that, in all fairness to the Senate, the
Leader of the Government should acknowledge that there was
a lack of communication. In the other place it had been stated
that the bill would be introduced on Friday. And that was
done before we adjourned here on Thursday; indeed, before we
had even met at 2 o'clock.
Senator Perrault: I can only say that at that time no final
decision had been taken that the passage of the bill would be
required through all of its stages, through both chambers, by
80003-7

Friday evening. Together with you, I regret that a governmental decision could not have been made earlier.
Motion agreed to.
THE ESTIMATES
NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MAKE
STUDY

Senator Everett, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(e), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance be authorized to examine and report upon the

tabled in the Senate on 19th February, 1976.
Motion agreed to.
NATIONAL FINANCE
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE SERVICES

Senator Everett, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(i), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance be empowered to engage the services of such
counsel and technical, clerical and other personnel as may
be necessary for the purposes of its examination and
consideration of such legislation and other matters as may
be referred to it.
Motion agreed to.
PUBLIC WORKS
RENOVATION OF LANGEVIN BUILDING-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a reply to a
question asked on June 22 by Senator Molson with respect to
the redecoration, renovation and rehabilitation of the Langevin
Building. It will be recalled that the honourable senator asked
for information under the headings of structural, mechanical,
decoration and communication.
The answer is as follows:
Structural
Including Architectural and Miscellaneous
expenses.
$2,126,329.00
Mechanical
Including Electrical.
$1,373,362.00
Communications
$150,000.00
Decoration
(Furniture provided by Client)
$256,975.00
Sub-Total $3,906,666.00
Consultant and Miscellaneous $ 453,149.00
That makes a grand total of $4,359,815, for what is hoped to
be a very productive work centre.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES-QUESTION

Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government, of which I gave him very brief
notice, I am sorry to say. I should have given it to him sooner,
so I presume he will take the question as notice now. The
question is sixfold:
1. Who is now Director of Information Services in the
Department of Justice?
2. When was he or she appointed?
3. Is he or she a lawyer?
4. What was his or her previous position, if any, in the
public service?
5. If he or she came from outside the public service, from
what position in the private sector?
6. What is his or her salary?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, because of the
detailed nature of that question, it may be necessary for me to
consult with the Director of Information Services in the
Department of Justice and with other reliable sources. We will
attempt to obtain the information as soon as possible.
HEALTH
SWINE INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION

QUESTION

Senator Bonnell: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government, of which he has no notice. Is it
the intention of the Government of Canada to scrap the plan
for the large-scale immunization program for swine flu, as
announced by the CBC on Monday evening? If that is not the
plan and there are no changes in it, when can the people of
Canada expect to receive swine flu immunization?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I wish to thank
Senator Bonnell for his timely question. It seems to me that it
would be useful for honourable senators to have an official
statement from the government on this matter of the swine flu
vaccine, which is an important question for all Canadians. If I
am able to obtain information before we adjourn our proceedings this afternoon, that statement will be provided; otherwise
I would hope to make a full statement next week.
ENERGY
PROPOSED PETROLEUM AND NATURAI GAS ADMINISTRATION
ACT -- QUESTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I should like to ask
the Leader of the Government a question on the subject of the
proposed Petroleum and Natural Gas Administration Act. The
government leader may know that the government suspended
the old Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations and its operation to issue new permits back in the spring of 1971. The oil
industry has been awaiting a new land regime for some years,
and at this stage, with the potential of northern oil and gas
lands becoming more likely to be a reality, I would ask the

October 28, 1976

government leader whether he can assure this chamber that
the oil industry and the people of Canada will see this new
legislation in the near future? I would also ask whether it
would be possible for this chamber to have that piece of
legislation brought here first.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, of course all honourable senators would welcome as many bills as possible in
this chamber. However, it may be said that the new regulations will probably not be available before Christmas.
Senator Flynn: Which Christmas?
Senator Perrault: There will be an effort made, however, to
obtain a more exact date.
Senator Flynn: Before Christmas.
Senator Perrault: Hopefully that information can be provided next week.
Senator Grosart: Before next Christmas.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUELD

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His
Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Senator Lucier, seconded by
Senator Barrow, for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators, on rising I wish
to say how pleased we all were to see His Excellency the
Governor General able to be present at the opening of the
Second Session of the 30th Parliament of Canada and to note
that his health has greatly improved. It was a pleasure to see
and hear Her Excellency, Madam Léger, so ably assisting His
Excellency in his duties by reading part of the Throne Speech.
We are pleased to see our beloved Speaker again presiding
over our deliberations in her very gracious and efficient
manner. We are proud indeed to have her in the Speaker's
Chair.
Nous l'aimons tous.
Our two leaders are again with us and I wish them good
health and success in their difficult positions.
To each and every member of the Senate staff I offer my
best wishes, and commend them for the efficient manner in
which they carry out their duties.
My congratulations at this time to the mover and seconder
of the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. Their
speeches were interesting and informative. Senator Lucier
gave a most able and detailed description of the territory
which he represents in the Senate, of its problems and concerns. The Yukon is a beautiful, fascinating part of Canada. I
had the opportunity of a short visit to Whitehorse and vicinity
when the Poverty Committee, under the very able chairmanship of Senator Croll, held meetings there. I can fully understand the "pull of the north," an expression used by those who
know and love the Yukon. Senator Lucier will, I am sure, be a
valuable member of this chamber.

October 28, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Barrow, in his excellent speech, gave us an enlightening insight into the problems and troubles of his province of
Nova Scotia. Being a maritimer myself, I understand and
appreciate his concern for the welfare of his province.
At this point I wish to thank honourable senators who so
thoughtfully sent me letters and cards of good wishes when I
was hospitalized for so many months last winter and spring,
for the beautiful flowers from the Senate and for the interesting and delightful Valentine card containing signatures of
honourable senators. It was a real conversation piece in my
hospital room. I am happy to be back in my seat and I look
forward to taking part once again in the work of the Senate.
Turning to the Throne Speech, I was pleased to hear that
the government is very aware of the existing inflation, unemployment, and the high cost of living in Canada today, especially in the fields of energy and utilities, and that plans to
legislate measures to lower the percentage of inflation and
bring some relief to the unemployed are contained in the
Speech.
I also note that the policy with regard to bilingualism and
biculturalism is to be changed. I am very much in favour of
Canadians having the two founding languages preserved, but
there has been too much money and time spent on trying to
teach older people one language or another when they have no
discernible need for a second language. The place to begin is in
the classroom, with the young children.
I recall some years ago meeting a Malaysian who spoke
perfect English, which is the Malaysians' second language. I
asked him how he learned to speak English so well. He said
they started at the first grade in school and that on one day of
each week the classes were conducted in English. So by the
time they graduated they were perfectly bilingual. That might
be a good system to follow in Canada, and it is one that has
been advocated by many knowledgeable people.
Now a few words about my province of Prince Edward
Island, with its golden beaches, red soil and green grass, set in
the blue waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Being an island,
we have many problems, transportation being one of our
greatest concerns. Much of our food stuffs and almost all
manufactured goods have to be brought in, and our products
must be shipped out by water and/or by air.
Tourism has become one of our greatest income-producing
industries. Therefore it is necessary that our transportation
system be adequate to meet our needs. Last summer was not a
good tourist season on Prince Edward Island because of the
cool, wet summer and, no doubt, because the Olympics in
Montreal and the Bicentennial of the United States of America were attractions to many who might otherwise have visited
us. However, it was a good growing season. The crops were
heavy, and by harvest time the weather had improved and
farmers were able to harvest most of them in good condition.
Since agriculture is our main source of income, to some extent
this will offset our tourist losses.
Most Islanders would place fisheries as second only to
agriculture as our primary source of income. However, that
80003-7'

pattern has undergone changes in recent years. The situation
may improve in future, as our fishing industry will be better
controlled because of the fishing limits set down by the federal
and provincial governments with regard to foreign fishing
vessels.
Energy has become another problem of great concern to our
people. The high price of oil and gas to the Island, the highest
in Canada, presents a real hardship to many at the present
time. In fact, the cost of living in Prince Edward Island is the
second highest in Canada. Transportation is, of course, the
main reason for this, together with the cost of fuel. Unemployment is high in our province. This seems to be a chronic
situation in the maritimes this past decade or more. The
announcement this morning on the CBC that 500 personnel
from the Department of Veterans Affairs are to be moved to
Charlottetown very soon is encouraging news, since the addition of these people to our population should be a help to the
economy.

We are pleased to note that the rate of inflation is starting
to abate somewhat. I expect most shoppers are wondering in
what areas this is to be seen, but we should hope for a better
performance next year.
Canada is still a wonderful place to live and as citizens of a
young and growing country we should feel proud to be
Canadians.
Hon. George I. Smith: Honourable senators, this is the first
opportunity I have had as a member of this chamber to
participate in a debate on the Speech from the Throne. It is an
opportunity which I am very glad to have, but I should point
out, for reasons which may become apparent as I speak, that I
cannot support the motion now before us in its present form.
I wish to join very warmly indeed in the compliments and
good wishes which earlier speakers extended to His Excellency
the Governor General and his charming consort. Furthermore,
as is the case with all honourable senators, I am glad to know
that Madam Speaker will continue to preside over our deliberations with the dignity, grace and charm which we have come
to associate with ber. I wish to thank ber also for all ber many
kindnesses.
I should also like to offer my congratulations to Senator
Inman on her speech, and to express the delight of all honourable senators in seeing her restored to health and strength and
in her accustomed place in this chamber.
Honourable senators, I do not want to take up all your time
in complimenting people, but perhaps you might bear with me
while I say that we heard two excellent addresses yesterday,
one from Senator Quart and the second from Senator Asselin.
I also extend my congratulations to them.
The mover and seconder of the motion for an Address in
reply to His Excellency's gracious speech also deserve our
congratulations. I listened, as I am sure all of you did, with
great interest to the informative eloquence of Senator Lucier. I
look forward to hearing him speak frequently, and to learning
from him more of that historic part of our country which he
represents. My colleague from Nova Scotia, Senator Barrow,

SENATE DEBATES
in a clear and forceful way, placed before the chamber some of
the difficult problems of our ancient province. I propose to
speak on some of them too-not to criticize in any way what
he said so well, but to emphasize further some of the points he
made; and perhaps I shall mention one or two others.
However, honourable senators, I notice that both Senator
Lucier and Senator Barrow had the very good judgment to
perceive clearly the empty uselessness of the content inserted
by the government in the Speech from the Throne. Each one of
them made as little reference to it as was decently possible for
the mover and seconder to do, and then moved quickly to
discuss some questions of real importance.
They were followed by my distinguished leader in the
Senate whose eloquent remarks pointed out so well the emptiness of the Speech from the Throne, the unprecedented public
disrepute which the government has managed to achieve for
itself, and for its policies and interna] confusion and dissension
which are the harbingers of its disintegration.
Senator Barrow spoke of power rates in Nova Scotia, as did
Senator Inman a few moments ago in pointing out the situation with regard to power rates in Prince Edward Island. Those
of Nova Scotia are now the second highest in Canada, and
even now that province anticipates the probability of another
increase. It is likely that such an increase will put us in the
unenviable and difficult position of having the highest rates in
Canada. He pointed out that one of the reasons for this is our
very great dependence on the use of imported oil to create
electrical energy.
I wish to support Senator Barrow's view that the request of
Nova Scotia for a five-year subsidy to provide some interim
assistance is reasonable, and to agree with him about the
development of tidal power and the construction of an eastern
Canada power grid.
Senator Barrow spoke also of the steel industry in Nova
Scotia and its importance to our province and, indeed, to the
country. I do not intend to duplicate what he said, but only to
emphasize it. He mentioned the problem with the existing
plant, many parts of which are rather elderly and for that
reason are not as competitive as may be necessary to ensure
the viability of the plant. Here, however, I must pause to speak
of its rail mill, whose product is well known around the world
and has an excellent and competitive reputation.
Senator Barrow drew the attention of the Senate to the plan
to create a new steel mill in Cape Breton, which has become
known as Canstel. As he did, i urge upon the federal government the basic importance of this project and the importance,
too, of vigorous federal planning and financial support.
I could not help but be somewhat disappointed in the reply
made in the other place by the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce to a question asked of him by the member for Cape
Breton-The Sydneys on October 25. The minister replied that
he did not think that a decision on the matter would come
quickly. He also said that Ottawa was most interested in the
project, and is studying all proposals put forward. But to me
that does not appear to indicate the kind of positive, vigorous,

October 28, 1976

constructive federal interest that is needed, and I hope the
federal government's willingness to participate actively in this
project is greater than the minister's choice of words seems to
indicate.
I should like to turn now to the subject of regional disparity.
I do not have to quote statistics to establish that the Atlantic
region and parts of Quebec-and I know there are other parts
of Canada in the same category-are not so advanced in
economic prosperity as the central part and certain other parts
of the country. That has long since been established and is
recognized by all who are in any way informed about economic
affairs in Canada.
As you have perhaps heard me say before, over the years
since Confederation Canadian national policy in economic
matters has had the effect of promoting growth in the central
portion of the country, as a result of which that part of Canada
has outstripped most of the rest of the country. it has become
very strong economically, measured by any criterion. We in
Atlantic Canada do not object to that; we recognize that a
strong central part is good for Canada and that we are a better
country for it. But we do say that it is time now to make a
more determined effort to encourage the better development of
the Atlantic region.
The former Minister of Finance, the Honourable John
Turner, put it very well in a speech at a Canadian Club
luncheon in Toronto a day or two ago. He is reported in the
press as having said that Ontario has been a main beneficiary
of Confederation, and has enjoyed a common market from
coast to coast. He went on to say that perhaps the time has
come to contemplate some decentralization of the influence
which has been so beneficial to Ontario.
* (1430)

Of course, i have not lost sight of the fact that the Department of Regional Economic Expansion, utilizing the legislation
under which it operates and the resources allotted to it, has
done some very useful work, and i express appreciation for
that work. Nevertheless, 1 feel, and submit to the Senate, that
it has fallen far short of what is needed.
There are, of course, a number of reasons for this. It seems
to me, however, that the most significant one is the lack of will
to concentrate available resources on the development of outlying parts of the country. After all, the same development
assistance is provided to areas that lie close to the great
markets of Canada as is provided to those areas lying greater
distances from those markets. Thus, the relative competitive
position of the outlying areas is all too often little improved by
the assistance given, simply because the same assistance is
given to those competitive areas close to the centre of the
country. It is understandable, of course, that governments
prefer to operate under formulae which provide administrative
ease and which can be said to be applicable to all parts of the
country.
Honourable senators, this only perpetuates the relative competitive positions of the outlying regions. An improvement in
the relative position of the Atlantic region, for instance,
requires a national determination to concentrate development

October 28, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

resources in a massive effort designed and carried out specifically for that purpose, and nothing short of that will do the
job.
I would like to turn now to a fetish which has recently been
embraced by the Minister of Transport, that being "Let the
user pay," which is closely related to the subject of regional
disparity. "Let the user pay" seems to be a simple, straightforward idea until you begin to examine its effect were it applied
to our various means of transportation. The minister and his
department appear surprised at the resistance the idea has met
in many parts of the country. But there was no need for
surprise. To find out what the public thought of it, they only
had to make a few inquiries outside the department before
laying hold of it so warmly. But, as usual, that was too much
to expect of this government. Of course, they may have asked
Jack Pickersgill who, in a speech two years ago to the Air
Transport Association, said: "If only users would pay for
transportation, the Canadian public would get cheaper and
more efficient transport."
Perhaps the minister and his department picked up the idea
from there. But they should have remembered the sheltered
eminence which Mr. Pickersgill occupied when he gave utterance to that myth.
As is so often the case with this government, there is a
certain lack of precision in the way it has described or defined
this concept. However, it appears to mean to the minister that
ail modes of transport should be paid for in full by the very
people using them. The minister has already been told of the
concern of people in many parts of Canada as to what this
concept will do to their regions if it is fully applied.
Transportation, of course, is the very lifeline of every region
and of the country as a whole. It is of special concern to the
province of Nova Scotia and the Atlantic region generally.
Our distance from the larger markets of central Canada and
the central United States, and from the source of supply of
those goods which we must bring from distances for our own
use, makes transportation costs of absolutely vital importance
to our industrial and commerical activities.
We ail know Canada was built upon transportation links
from the central part of the country to the Atlantic and to the
Pacific. The provision of such links was a prerequisite to Nova
Scotia's and New Brunswick's joining with the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec to form this country in 1867. The story of
the CPR is so well known that one hardly needs to say that its
construction was a condition of British Columbia's joining
Confederation.
From our earliest beginning, transportation has been regarded as an instrument of national policy to promote economic
development, and, as we ail know, public funds of Canada
have been used in very large amounts for that purpose. Examples are ail around us. Look at the CPR and the CNR, the St.
Lawrence Seaway, our system of airports, the Trans-Canada
Highway, roads to resources, nationally provided aids to navigation, nationally run ferries and national harbours, to name
only a few.

Surely, a policy of "user pay" is not consistent with an
effective policy of using transportation to promote economic
development. How can you promote manufacturing in Nova
Scotia, for instance, by imposing on the manufacturer, or the
buyer of his products, say, in Toronto, the full cost of carrying
that product from the factory in Nova Scotia to the consumer
in Toronto? How can the Nova Scotian manufacturer compete
in central Canada with his competition in southern Ontario if
a national policy on transportation does not make his transportation costs competitive with those of his competitors who are
situated close by the marketplace?
It may be said that it is not the government's intention to
apply the policy of "user pay" so as to remove altogether the
element of using transportation as a tool of development. Let
us hope that it is so. But, undoubtedly, Nova Scotians today
fear that "user pay" will be the rule and development the
exception so far as they are concerned.
They fear even more that if the policy is applied to the
Atlantic region it will not necessarily be applied equally everywhere in the country. They ask, for instance, such questions as:
Will it be applied to the St. Lawrence Seaway so that the tolls
will be raised sufficiently to finance the cost of the seaway,
including the cost of extending its season by the use of
ice-breakers? Is it going to do away with the Crowsnest Pass
freight rates, thereby making the user pay? We will believe
that when we see it.
It has been pointed out by others, but must be repeated over
and over again until it is thoroughly understood by ail concerned, that no matter how good a policy of regional development may be, its effect is bound to be severely restricted, or
nullified even, by increased transportation costs. It is absolutely vital to the development of the Atlantic region that transportation rates to and from the region be kept at a level which
enables our people to be competitive. No one has shown us yet
that this can or will be done under a policy of "user pay." I
urge upon the government, and in particular upon the minister
and his department, that it is of the most basic importance to
the Atlantic region that "user pay" must not be applied in
such a way as to lessen our ability to compete in the markets of
central Canada.
And what of the philosophy of "user pay" itself? We must
not forget, I submit, that the user is not the only person who
benefits from transportation facilities. The whole public benefits economically, socially, and in the general quality of life.
What would Canada be like without railways, highways, airports and port facilities? Honourable senators, it does not take
much imagination to realize that it would be a feeble, backward, badly underdeveloped country. One has only to think
about it for a moment to realize the truth of that statement. I
repeat, it is not only the identifiable direct user who benefits.
In the sense that we ail benefit from transportation facilities,
we are aIl users. It is, therefore, fair and reasonable that we
should ail pay something towards the development, maintenance and improvement of our transportation facilities.
Honourable senators, as seems to be the case with others, I
cannot find a great deal of encouragement for Canadians in

SENATE DEBATES
the Speech from the Throne. It may be that most of it is
harmless, but there is one paragraph which, in the light of past
statements by members of the government, fills me with
foreboding. It is the paragraph dealing with medical insurance,
hospital insurance and post-secondary education, which reads
in part:
* (1440)

In the areas of medical insurance, hospital insurance
and post-secondary education, negotiations will continue
with the provinces concerning the gradual introduction of
new financial and administrative arrangements.
I fear this means the government is going to continue with the
intention expressed some time ago to back out of its commitment to share in the full cost of medical and hospital insurance
programs.
As is well known, the provinces were invited to enter those
fields on the basis that the Government of Canada would share
in the full costs. The programs have been financed on the basis
of this commitment since they began. Now it appears this
government is going to welsh on its promises. The sentence I
just read uses the word "negotiations," but unless the government changes its course, that is a complete misnomer. As I
understand the statement of intention as of a very short time
ago, which I believe continues to this day, the government
simply made a unilateral announcement that it was going to
limit its contribution to a certain rate of increase per year in
the cost of the programs. Honourable senators, does this sound
like negotiation? To me it is just the opposite.
I agree that it is highly desirable to slow down the rate of
increase in the cost of these programs. But surely the way to
work at bringing that about is to work with the provinces in a
strong, joint, cooperative effort; not to leave it to the provinces
to go it alone. If a joint effort will not do it, certainly an effort
by the provinces alone will not. The federal government obviously has come to the conclusion that a joint effort will not be
sufficiently successful. Its attitude seems to be simply to leave
the provinces alone to wrestle with the problem, and to pay the
piper if they cannot succeed. Is that what the Government of
Canada calls cooperative fedcralism? Of course, it is not
cooperation of any kind.
I suggest that the government, having used the word
"negotiations" in the Speech from the Throne, should now live
up to the meaning of that word in its truest sense, drop its
stubborn one-sided attitude, and keep the promise it made to
induce the provinces to enter the programs in the first place.
Honourable senators, I wish to turn now to the subject of
the Constitution, not to discuss the pros and cons of the
present debate about patriation, but to relate it to the question
of regional disparity.
A portion of the present formula proposed for consideration
recognizes this question in the following words-and I use the
word "recognizes" advisedly-in article 39 under the heading
"Part V, Regional Disparities":
Without altering the distribution of powers and with-

October 28, 1976

And note this.
-compelling the Parliament of Canada or the Legislatures of the Provinces to exercise their legislative powers,
the Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of the
Provinces, together with the Government of Canada and
the Governments of the Provinces, are committed to:
(a) the promotion of equality of opportunity and wellbeing for all individuals in Canada;
(b) the assurance, as nearly as possible, that essential
public services of reasonable quality are available to all
individuals in Canada; and
(c) the promotion of economic development to reduce
disparities in the social and economic opportunities for all
individuals in Canada wherever they may live.
It is with some satisfaction that I see in this recognition the
result of the arguments put forward on behalf of the province
of Nova Scotia at a time when I was privileged to take part in
constitutional conferences. Indeed, it was as a result of the
representations made by Nova Scotia that regional disparity
became a subject for discussion on such occasions. If my
recollection is correct, when Prime Minister Pearson was
preparing for the conference of 1968 he wrote to each province
suggesting an agenda for it, and inviting suggestions for further subjects for that agenda. Nova Scotia replied urging the
inclusion of regional disparities as being appropriate for discussion as a constitutional matter. It was included on the
agenda for that conference and, 1 believe, all later constitutional conferences.
It seems to me, however, that the provision I have just read
is less specific in its terms, and less binding, than it should be.
It is a recognition of the problem, which is helpful, of course,
but it imposes no obligation to do very much about it. I think it
could be included as an obligation, and I am sure appropriate
words could be found to do so. While I recognize the rigidity
which constitutional proposals tend to assume after they have
been the subject even of tentative acceptance, there is still time
to consider whether these words could be improved, and I urge
such further consideration.
Also in relation to the Constitution, I wish to make a
comment or two about the inclusion of equalization. Equalization payments have now for many years been an essential part
of federal-provincial relations. They are an absolute necessity
if all provinces are to be able to provide for Canadians living
within their borders a standard of public services at least
approaching the national average of services without imposing
an undue burden of taxation.
Essential though these payments may be, they are not
protected by any constitutional provisions. A portion of the
formula I read a moment ago, under the heading of "Regional
Disparities," seems to recognize that equalization payments
are desirable. I am glad to see this but, with all respect, I
submit that mere recognition is not enough.
Under such a formula, as is the case now, equalization can
be changed, or abolished, by a simple majority of Parliament.
It may be said that this would never happen, and I hope it

erally suddenly decide they are going to get out of it, just as is
now the case, I fear, to some extent, with the hospital and
medical insurance plans.
I have not overlooked the fact that the very able Leader of
the Government in the Senate took part in this debate with his
usual high standard of eloquence. I note, however, that he, too,
did not bother much with the Speech from the Throne. That, I
suppose, reflected his assessment of the value of its contents.
As he began his speech he issued a plaintive call to forget the
past. I don't blame him for that. If I belonged to the government for which he has to apologize, my most urgent daily
prayer would be that a benign providence would cause the
people of Canada to forget its incredible record of confrontation and convolution, of groping and blundering, of musings
and wonderings, of confusion and contrariness.

never will, but we have to recognize the stark fact that, except
in matters protected by the Constitution, Parliament can do
virtually anything it decides to do. It is not difficult to envisage
a situation in which a substantial majority of Parliament
might represent provinces who have no interest in equalization
payments, or might even be interested only in reducing or
abolishing them.
Other countries with a federal system have recognized the
need for affording equalization payments the security of their
constitutions. Australia and Germany are two. Is there any
reason why Canada should not do so? I submit there is not. I
believe those who are now concerned with our Constitution
should give this the most careful consideratjon, and should
work out and include an appropriate constitutional provision
while we are about the business of patriation. As I have said,
excellent models for such a provision already exist in other
countries.

Senator Croll: They could not afford it.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I am not saying it should be
any more than it is now. All I am saying is that it should be in

SENATE DEBATES
amongst us a very distinguished acquisition to this chamber. It
is becoming clearer every day that we have a very distinguished acquisition to this chamber, and that the official
opposition, particularly, has had a very distinguished and
powerful acquisition.
I turn from that to the customary congratulations to
Madam Speaker, and to the mover and seconder of the
Address. I unfortunately did not have the good fortune to hear
their speeches. I was elsewhere on what I think may be
legitimately described as public business. I was addressing the
Canadian Clubs of Medicine Hat, Vancouver and Victoria on,
of all subjects, the Quebec Bill 22. I trust that what I was
doing was a public service. i dare say, however, that there
might be differing opinions on that, possibly derogatory opinions directly contrary to each other.
I should like to say also how delighted I was to see our
Governor General back in such excellent health, in spite of his
slight difficulties in certain matters, and what a pleasure it was
to think of this distinguished public servant being restored to
the almost completely full use of his very great powers, which
he has already exercised so splendidly for the benefit of the
country.
Finally by way of congratulation-not finally in my
speech-i should like to echo what others have said about the
pleasure we all feel at Senator Inman's return. Not long ago
somebody said to me about Senator Inman, "I suppose she
practically never turns up, and I suppose when she is there she
is really hardly up to her duties any more." I said, "You never
made a bigger mistake. She is absolutely full of zip and life. At
the moment she is unwell and has some difficulties, but we
confidently look forward to her return, when she will take her
usual active part in the work of the Senate, and I can assure
you it is a very active part indeed. Her speeches are spritely
and full of wit and good sense and eloquence. There is no
gathering of the Parliamentary Associations at which she is
not an ornament and a participant."
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Forsey: I should have liked to have a better prepared speech this afternoon, but I find that various tasks
descend upon me, "Thick as autumnal leaves . . . in Vallom-

brosa." I do not quite know why it is, but so many people seem
to think that, whatever is troubling them, I am the chap to kiss
the place and make it well. An extraordinary number of people
do seem to think so on an extraordinary variety of subjects. i
am often asked to give opinions on matters of which I have no
knowledge whatever. That is fairly easy, because i simply say
that I have no knowledge. There are other subjects on which I
have some slight knowledge, and on which I have to temporize
a little, explain what little I know, how little it is. This takes a
certain amount of time, and when you get the whole lot of
them put together it keeps me busier than I should like to be.
There is a widespread opinion, I know, that all senators live
a life of gilded case; that they do not do any work; that they

October 28, 1976

get enormously overpaid for doing nothing. I can only say that
in my own case I think this opinion is somewhat exaggerated. I
have never been busier in my life-and I have had a not
inactive life-than I am now in the Senate. While not every bit
of that business is concerned with Senate affairs, most of it is,
and I am only thankful that providence has given me still the
strength to support some part of the work i have to do.
However, the fact remains that I did not have time to
prepare a very careful speech this afternoon. In the words of
Mr. Stanley Baldwin, the former Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom, on a celebrated occasion: I can, therefore, only
speak to you plainly, honestly, simply and sincerely. He
explained that he had had no time to prepare a speech, so he
would have to resort to this extreme measure. i am in something of the same position.
I propose to devote a certain amount of time to certain
matters in the Speech from the Throne which seem to me to
call for some comment. On some of them there has already
been an eloquent speech by some senator, and in some
instances several speeches by several senators. I hope I shall
not be repeating anything anyone else has said. If I do, it is
possible that the repetition may not be altogether wasted
because of the importance of the subjects concerned.
The first thing I want to draw attention to in the Speech
from the Throne is the statement that the government sets a
very high priority upon the achievement of formal constitutional independence. In a sense I suppose we all do. On the
other hand, i want to say, with all the emphasis I can
command, that it is possible, in my judgment, to pay too high a
price for patriation of the Constitution. If a proposition comes
to us in this chamber to patriate the Constitution with a clause
providing that nothing shall happen, that not even a formula of
amendment shall come into effect, without the unanimous
consent of the provinces, i shall vote against it. I am not in
favour of resurrecting on this continent in the twentieth century the medieval Polish Parliament, where any single member
of that parliament could veto any proposal that was brought
before it. I am not in favour of locking ourselves into a block of
cement; I am not in favour of putting this country into a straitjacket, putting it into the position where a small province like
my own native province of Newfoundland-and I pick that
deliberately, so that nobody can accuse me of being prejudiced
against a particular province-a small province like Newfoundland can say: "We don't care how much the rest of this
country wants it; 99 per cent of the population outside this
province may be in favour of it but you shall not have it,
because we don't want it." 1 do not think that is a fair position
to put this country in. i think we should be able to do better,
and we must do better than to have some unanimous consent
clause in the Constitution.

h hasten to add that I think it is absolutely inevitable and
inescapable that in this country, constituted as it is, there must
bc a constitutional veto for the province of Quebec and if there

is to be a constitutional veto for the province of Quebec, I
suppose there must be one for Ontario, too, although, frankly,
I don't think that matters very much. But I find it difficult to
accept the view expressed by some people that no province
should have a veto. I think it is necessary because of the
special situation of Quebec, the special circumstances of
Quebec, that Quebec should have a veto.
One of my friends said to me: "Can you tell me any other
federation in the world where a single unit of the federation
has a veto?" I said: "No, I can't. There may be one; but I
don't know of one. But I think you must remember that just as
Quebec is not a province like the others, so Canada is not a
federation like the others." I know of no federation, this side of
the Iron Curtain at all events, which has a constituent unit in
the special circumstances in which the province of Quebec
finds itself. I think there is simply no getting away from the
fact that the province of Quebec, if our French-Canadian
fellow citizens are to feel secure in this country, must have a
veto on constitutional change. This may turn out to be somewhat inconvenient for the rest of us, but I think it is the price
we have to pay for keeping this country together and that is an
object which is very dear to my heart, as I am sure it is to the
hearts of aIl senators here and, indeed, to every member of this
Parliament and to most Canadians, apart from certain people
who have given up on Canada. That includes not only the
Quebec separatists, but people who in my judgment, from
recent experience of them, are much worse, some of the
Western separatists. I encountered some of them in Alberta
and they made my hair stand on end. They are, apparently,
prepared to consign ail the rest of us to the lowest depths of
the infernal regions as long as they get what suits them
themselves. They would throw Quebec overboard and I said,
"Well, what would you do with the Atlantic provinces after
you have divided the country into a sort of east and west
Pakistan?" They replied cheerfully, "That's their problem." I
said, "Well, if you come from the Atlantic provinces, as I do,
you are not satisfied with that kind of answer. It is the problem
of a great many people besides those of the Atlantic
provinces."
But I think that, given the declining birth rate and the very
low birth rate in Quebec; given the fact that most of the
immigrants who have been coming to Quebec, or at least a
very large proportion of them, have chosen to turn toward the
English-speaking minority rather than the French-speaking
majority; given the fact that if Bill 22 survives in its present
form most immigrants henceforth, except French-speaking
ones, will probably give Quebec the go-by and go elsewhere in
this country; considering that the proportion of French
Canadians to the total population of Canada has in the last
census, for the first time since Confederation, shown a serious
drop, I think the people of Quebec are justified in feeling that
they must have a guarantee against the possibility of being
swamped at some future date, when they are an even smaller
proportion of the total population of Canada, swamped by
what may then be the overwhelming English-speaking majority in the country as a whole. I can say that, with a good

80003-8

conscience, because I am, as I am afraid I have stated with
wearisome iteration in this chamber and elsewhere, of almost
purely English origin, 200 years back, to be sure, but purely
English, very little even Scots and Irish. So that when I say
that 1 think Quebec has to have a constitutional veto I am
saying it not as one whose own particular interests or whose
own particular origin or mother tongue move him in that way,
but as one who is convinced that it is necessary for the good of
the whole country and essential to the continued existence of
the country.
I freely admit that I may be mistaken on this; I don't want
to sound dogmatic, I am simply stating my conviction on the
subject and I should require a very strong argument indeed to
convince me that I was mistaken. I am afraid that if we get a
proposition before us for patriation of the Constitution that
contains a unanimous consent clause the achieving of-what is
it?-"formal constitutional independence" may be a Dead Sea
fruit. I am not prepared to give up the substance for the
shadow. We can now get amendments to our Constitution,
conceivably, without the consent of ail provinces. It is not very
likely, but there is no legal impediment now. True, since 1930
every amendment which has directly affected the interests of
the provinces bas secured the unanimous consent, either of al
the provinces concerned or ahl the provinces put together, ail
the provinces that there are. But this does not establish an
absolutely iron-clad legal rule. If you put it into a formai text
of constitutional law, then you are locked in beyond escape. It
will be impossible, even if only one small province stands out,
to get any amendment whatsoever. It is unlikely now, perhaps,
with our present practice of the last half century, that we could
get amendment without the unanimous consent of the provinces, but it is not impossible and I prefer the possible, even if
it is very improbable, to the impossible.
So much for that, bar one postscript: Last session I made an
attempt to initiate a debate, a calm, a dispassionate, a nonpartisan debate on this subject. I had every hope that particularly the lawyers in the bouse would take part in it. And my
speech sank like a stone into a barrel of tar. Absolutely
nothing happened; not so much as a squeak from a single
senator on this subject, and I do not think it was entirely for
lack of time. I hope that before this session is out, even if we
do not get an actual proposal for patriation before us, there
may be some serious discussion of this in this chamber. We are
not very likely to get it in the other chamber, because of the
pressure of time upon them, and there is a frivolousness, a
levity in the way certain people approach this thing, arising, I
think, out of a failure to understand the enormously important
part that the Constitution plays, a frivolousness and levity
which frightens me.
I got a letter the other day from a member of the other
place, who said, "Let's get it home and work out the details
afterwards." But the details, as he calls them, may be of vast
importance and if you bring it home with a unanimous consent
of the provinces clause in it, then you can talk from now until
the heavens fall, talk until Judgment Day, and you won't get
any solution to the problem of the "details." You can't just

SENATE DEBATES
throw it aside in this way. Other people have said, "Oh, a
wonderful unifying cry, like the flag; get everybody enthused
about the independence of the country and all our troubles will
disappear." Well, this is a very poor comparison; you can
change a flag very easily by comparison with the way you can
change a constitution which has a unanimous consent clause
written into it. The effect of a flag upon the daily life of people
is relatively small, whereas the effect of being unable to pass a
desired constitutional amendment, desired by the great mass of
the country, can be quite devastating upon people's pockets
and upon their daily lives. Twenty-five years from now we
might want to change completely the jurisdiction over social
security. This would make a tremendous difference, and it
would be a desperate situation if you had nearly everybody in
the country intent upon this and one small province able to
prevent it, able to prevent other people from the rest of the
country from getting what they wanted. So I very much hope
that we may get some considered discussion of this in this
session. If it is any inducement to other honourable senators to
undertake such a discussion, I shall gladly give an assurance
that I shall not take any part in it whatsoever. I have said my
say already last session and I don't think there is any point in
repeating it. But there are people in this house who are
qualified to make very important and valuable contributions to
such a discussion and they haven't yet seen fit to make them. I
hope they will come forward and speak their piece.

e

(1510)

There are a number of other things on which I should like to
comment. I am going to pick out only a certain few of them. I
know there is a proposal that there will be:
-a further effort to reduce the size of government as well
as expand the range of opportunities for private enterprise, ail federal programs will be reviewed to identify
those government activities which could be transferred to
the private sector without reducing the quality of service
to the public.
Well, that is well enough in its way, but I hope there will be a
certain amount of caution exercised there. I hope we shall not
find that government activities which are bringing in a profit,
for example, will be turned over to private enterprise, while
certain government activities which are necessary, but which

do not bring in a profit, will be left to be supported by the
taxpayers.
This worship of private enterprise, this idea that everything
should be handed over to private enterprise except what is
inescapably the province of government, leaves me a trifle
cold. I think we want to be careful that we don't hand over to
private enterprise anything that pays, and leave the taxpayers
with all the dead ducks, or dying ducks.
Many of the things in the Speech from the Throne can be, I
think, summed up with the comment "the proof of the pudding
will be in the eating."
A great number of them, honourable senators, are admirable sentiments, but until we sec the legislation we shall not
know in fact how admirable the proposais will really be, and it

October 28, 1976

is necessary, I think, therefore, to utter a caveat at this point
and say, "Well, that sounds very nice, but it doesn't necessarily
follow that when the legislation comes before the Senate I for
one shall approve everything that's in it."
I noticed a discussion of the improvement of labour-management relations. I hope there that the government will proceed
with caution, not without enterprise, not without innovation,
not without a willingness to try something new, but being very
careful indeed not to stir up unnecessary opposition by ill-considered statements or ill-considered proposals.
This is a subject on which, I think, consultation with the
people concerned, both employers and employees, and their
organizations, is an absolutely essential condition. You don't
wish to plunk down before people something that will appear
to them as a fait accompli, on which they are asked to act as
"yesmen" or nodders.
I am a little disquieted by the statement that the solution to
the problem of collective bargaining:
-is not to be found in excessive restriction of collective
bargaining rights.
Well, a good deal depends on what you mean by "excessive." I
think that those of us who have a trade union background, in
either house, will want to look rather carefully at any proposais for restricting collective bargaining, to make sure that
they are not, in our judgment, as well as that of management,
excessive.
Measures will be proposedSays the Speech.
-to improve the collective bargaining system in the
public service, to reduce the adversarial nature of the
process and to ensure an equitable relationship between
compensation levels in the public and private sectors.
Well, that is very admirable. I can't help hoping that some of
the measures will take some of the powers in this matter away
from the Treasury Board, which appears to be obsessed with
its legal rights.
I said something about this at some length in the last
session, about the incredible behaviour of the Treasury Board
in negotiations with the Economists', Sociologists' and Statisticians' Association of the Public Service. Since then we have
had another manifestation of the same kind of obtuseness, to
use a mild term, in a most extraordinary context. If there is
one union in the public service which should be treated with
the greatest care, it is the Union of Postal Workers. I don't
hold any brief for that union. I think it has made a great many
mistakes. I think its leaders have been guilty of extremely
foolish statements from time to time, provocative statements.
But that is the more reason not to give these people anything
to hang their hats on.
What does the Treasury Board do? The government has
signed an agreement with this union that certain matters
connected with technological change will go to adjudication
committees whose verdict will be final and binding; and while
these matters are actually before the committees, the Treasury

October 28, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Board announces, again in a cavalier fashion, "Well, we are
not necessarily going to be bound by the decision."
I think they have probably got good legal ground for saying
this. They can do what they like about these matters. But,
good heavens, there are a thousand things I have a legal right
to do but which it would be extremely foolish for me to do and
which would land me in all kinds of trouble which no sensible
person would want to get into.
If you make a bargain, even if you undertake to do something which restricts your legal rights, then it seems to me that
you have to live up to it, and the more so if you are the
government, the more so if you are, by breaking the agreement, casting doubt upon the faith of the Crown.
To give these people in the Postal Workers' Union this kind
of thing to hang their hats on, this handle, this legitimate
grievance, when you already have enough difficulty with them,
seems to me an act of madness. I understand the Treasury
Board has now more or less backed down on this thing. But the
damage is done when you do this sort of silly, imbecile thing.
You set up a climate of resentment which envenoms future
negotiations.
As the Treasury Board doesn't seem to be able to get this
kind of common sense, plain ordinary horse sense, into its
head, I can't help thinking that one measure which could make
things very much better in the staff-management relations in
the public service would be to have the powers now vested in
the Treasury Board in this regard vested in somebody else,
preferably somebody who has some knowledge of industrial
relations and will not stir up a hornets' nest with a short stick
on every conceivable occasion.
Then I come to the matter of transportation. To add anything to what Senator Smith (Colchester) said a few moments
ago on transportation would be painting the lily, gilding
refined gold. I entirely support everything, I think, that he
said. I say "I think everything" because I was slightly interrupted by a conversation part way through and I may have
missed something which I should not be prepared to support.
But the general tenor of what he said, I think, is incontestably
true.
I am sorry that prorogation killed the motion which I made,
arising out of Senator Bonnell's inquiry, for consideration by a
Senate committee of the question of transportation in relation
to the British North America Act, a matter which, of course,
affects particularly the Atlantic provinces, but which has some
bearing also on the rest of the country, although not a great
deal.
I should like to see that inquiry pursued. I should like to see
the motion revived; and I would go beyond that. I think we
need a thorough investigation by a committee of this house of
the whole question of transportation policy.
Several sessions ago Senator Cameron brought forward a
proposal of this sort, and it ceased upon the midnight without
a sound, partly, I think, because of what I regarded as the
excessive nervousness of the then Leader of the Government
because there was a minority government situation in the other

80003-8/2

place and he appeared to think that this would upset the
government's apple cart. I don't think it would have. But, in
any case, I think there ought to be a thorough discussion of
this whole problem in some depth, a thorough investigation of
it. I don't feel at all satisfied with what I know of the
government's general policy on this. I am very much afraid
that in the Department of Transport there is a certain bias
among the officials toward air transport and a certain obliviousness of the longer term aspects of this whole problem.
I don't profess to have the knowledge of it which Senator
Cameron has. I very much hope that he will introduce the
subject again. But somebody ought to introduce it, and there
ought to be a thorough investigation of it.
This is one of the cases where governments and the elected
people can't look really very far ahead. We in this chamber are
in a position to look farther ahead and to look deeper. We
don't have to worry about what people will think at the next
by-election or the next general election. We can look at the
problem and its long-term ramifications, and I think this is one
case where we ought to do it.
The same thing applies to the question of energy. I think
there are very strong reasons for being worried about the
inadequacy of the government's energy policy. I dare say they
have done the best they can, but I think it's possible to suggest
improvements. It would be a strange policy indeed for any
government where it would not be possible to suggest improvements, and I should like, here again, to see a careful consideration of this subject by a Senate committee.
I noticed the other day that one of the government supporters in the other place said that the Americans were spending
100 times as much as we were proposing to spend on the
investigation of renewable sources of energy. That seems to me
to point to a certain gap, a certain weakness, a certain
omission in the government's energy policy, and I think there
are others which deserve to be very carefully considered. I do
not think we can simply play the part of "yesmen" in this
matter; I think we should, as a Senate, look carefully at the
whole subject, and perhaps especially at the subject of nuclear
energy.

•

(1520)

I am worried not only about the proliferation or the possible
proliferation of nuclear weapons, I am worried about the
whole business of nuclear energy, the disposal of nuclear
waste, the possibility of terrorists getting hold of the material
for nuclear bombs, pocket size, as it were, which could do
enormous damage and which could wreck the whole country,
in fact. I am disturbed about the financial side of this. I think
we have been making available CANDU reactors, notably, for
example, to Argentina, at a considerable loss or probable loss
to the taxpayers of this country and I think this ought to be
investigated. Here again is something where the Senate, which
is relatively non-partisan, and which has a great reservoir of
experience and knowledge, can perform, it seems to me, an
immense public service by investigating this subject in depth.

SENATE DEBATES
I am delighted to sec that the government is proposing to do
something about day care services; and I am delighted to see
that it proposes to do something about the Canada Pension
Plan, to recognize the value of the contribution made to the
family and to society by both marriage partners. But once
again, of course, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.
I am particularly pleased to sec that family allowance
payments are once again to be indexed to the consumer price
index. I was strongly against the cessation of that and the
rather high-handed manner in which it was done-without
actually getting direct authority from Parliament. So I am
delighted to sec that the government has had second thoughts
and is about to restore the former principle of indexation.
I share Senator Smith's views about the proposals that are
foreshadowed here on medical insurance and hospital insurance. We had an eloquent speech or two on that in the last
session which left me very gravely disturbed indeed, and I hope
we shall have a reasonable and sensible proposal from the
government and one that will not give rise to the same kind of
disquiet which the earlier proposals which appeared before the
public aroused in certain members of this chamber and well
beyond it.
I need hardly say that I am delighted to sec that the
government attaches continuing importance to meeting the
aspirations of Canada's native peoples, and particularly the
just settlement of their land claims. When the negotiated
settlement of claims in the James Bay region comes before us,
I hope we shall examine it with the greatest care to see that it
really carries out what I am sure are the laudable intentions of
the government, and that the native peoples of that area are
treated with the justice which they deserve. This, of course,
will only be the beginning of a much larger consideration of
native land claims, and claims for self-government for the
native peoples, which may be coming before us before too long.
I think I have nearly come to the end of the particular
things I wanted to comment on in the Speech from the Throne.
I want to make one other comment, however, on a very
important feature of the Speech from the Throne which comes
well on towards the end-the development of new consultative
machinery, that is machinery for consultation by the government with the various economic interests of this country such
as business, labour, farmers and so on. We have not had any
adequate machinery for this in the past. I think it is now
widely recognized that some adequate machinery is required; I
think it is now widely recognized that in a number of European countries they have gone a long distance in this matter
and with, on the whole, rather useful effects.
I am not for a moment suggesting that we can simply take
over holus-bolus from any European country the system which
they have there. Our situation is very different in a variety of
ways, not least that we have in this country no body which can
claim to be what in French I think is called "un interlocuteur
valable" for either business or labour. We have bodies, some
bodies which can speak for segments, at least, of business and
for large segments of labour, but they cannot act, really. They
have no power; having signed, perhaps, an agreement with the

October 28, 1976

government, they have really no power to carry it out. Neither
the Canadian Labour Congress nor the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce nor the Canadian Manufacturers' Association nor
the Canadian Construction Association can say to the government, "This we shall do. All the unions, all the firms belonging
to our federation will carry out these undertakings." So this
marks us off very decidedly from many of the European
countries where a single body representing each of the different interests is available. Nevertheless, I am not sure that we
cannot work out something here in the way of consultative
machinery which will considerably reduce the area of industrial disputes and considerably reduce the area of difference of
opinion about long-term goals of our society. I do not want to
be too optimistic; I do not want to say that this is a magie
formula which will settle everything, but I think it is one that
deserves consideration. And here again 1 think that a Senate
committee investigating this subject could be of extraordinary
value.
I am afraid I am suggesting so many investigations by
Senate committees that the Senate will groan at the thought of
all this. However, perhaps I may attain a batting average of
about one in six, let us say. I am sure the opposition will groan
particularly at the thought of any more investigations because
of its small available resources of I do not like to say "bodies",
but that is what I mean because it is a fact that numerically
there are so few. I am not speaking of the quality of the
opposition, which is very high.
Senator Deschatelets: Senator Forsey, you might suggest
that we reduce the membership of the special committees.
Senator Forsey: Perhaps so, yes. I think this emphasizes
again, however, the desirability of the government's taking a
very hard look at the necessity of increasing the number of
opposition senators in this house. I have said that over and over
again. I suppose people will say, "Well, there you are, he was
brought up a Tory, what do you expect from him? This is
just-not a déformation professionnelle, not a professional
deformation, but some hereditary inclination." But I think it is
an important point, whatever one's political opinions may be,
that we should have in this house an opposition of a size
sufficient to perform its inescapable and very important duties
without undue strain upon the members. And I am sure now
that a great many members of the opposition are put to
extraordinary strain, not to mention very considerable inconvenience, by the workload imposed upon them.
I want to conclude in what is, perhaps, a rather odd way.
Senator Laird the other night issued some warnings about
bureaucracy. Senator Buckwold and Senator Everett spoke
eloquently on the achievements of their respective committees,
and great achievements they undoubtedly are. We hope that
the achievements of Senator Buckwold's committee will be
translated into law, with whatever amendments may appear to
be necessary, in short order. Now I happen to be-or I was in
the last session and I may perhaps be again, but that lies not in
the lap of the gods but in the lap of the other members of the
committee-Senate chairman of the Joint Committee on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments; and from my

October 28, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

experience on that committee from its inception I can assure
honourable senators that what Senator Laird said about
bureaucracy is amply justified. It is necessary for all of us to
be on the watch against the encroachments of the bureaucracy,
against its tendency on occasion to act as if James Il had never
lost his throne but had left his powers to the officials in the
various departments, including the power to dispense with the
provisions of the law, which is actually being claimed, as will
be apparent to anybody who reads our proceedings, by certain
officials now.

the Globe and Mail together with the reply by the Registrar of
Citizenship.

And that is only part of it. About the same time I received a
letter from a gentleman in Moncton, New Brunswick, who
represents an organization of which I know virtually nothing
but which interests itself in these matters, enclosing two letters
which members of his organization had sent to the Department
of State on this subject of citizenship and the question of
whether a Canadian citizen was a British subject under the
present act, the one which will not go out of effect until the
new one is proclaimed, which will probably be, so far as I can
gather, some time in February, and the position of a Canadian
citizen under the new act-whether he or she would still be a
British subject. One letter from one official in the department
contained a series of statements, every one of which was
factually wrong: the dates were wrong, the statements of law
were wrong, the whole thing was wrong with a capital W from
start to finish. And that was not a matter of opinion at all; it
was a matter of the sheer facts of the law as attested by the
Registrar of Citizenship in his letter to the Globe and Mail.
The other letter was from the minister's executive assistant. It
was right from start to finish. Every statement in it was
correct. But here you have emanating, from the same department, to two different correspondents, two different statements
which were diametrically opposite, one of which was wholly
and completely and totally wrong.

(1530)

I think it is necessary for us to be on the watch against the
encroachments of the bureaucracy. I do not mean by this that
the officials have any malevolent intent, but in some cases,
even when they are lawyers, their name seems to be "Necessity." You will remember that somebody once remarked of an
incompetent judge, "His name is necessity. He knows no law."
Well, there are officials, even occasionally lawyers, in the
government service who appear to be singularly ignorant of
some of the basic principles of constitutional law.
I shall not say more at the moment about anything that
came before our committee because that would be to anticipate and possibly to be out of order. I merely say that you will
probably be having shortly, honourable senators, a voluminous
and detailed report from the Committee on Regulations and
other Statutory Instruments, and that I think it will probably
be well worth your serious consideration, especially if you take
seriously, as I do, the function of this chamber as a defender of
the ordinary citizen, the little man, who, without the defence
which we should be able to give him, to some degree at least, is
obliged to fall back upon the long, expensive and sometimes
very uncertain remedy of recourse to the courts. That, of
course, is an indispensable recourse, but in many instances it
ought not to be necessary.
I could cite cases there, but again I shall refrain. They will
come up more appropriately, presumably, when our report
appears before the Senate.
I want to suggest, however, that you sometimes get the most
extraordinary productions, pronunciamentos, manifestos, ex
cathedra pronouncements from officials, and I will give you
one illustration. When the late Lord Thomson of Fleet died
and his son succeeded, somebody in the Prime Minister's office
issued an announcement that the new Lord Thomson had lost
his Canadian citizenship. I was somewhat taken aback by that.
I wrote a letter to the Globe and Mail asking for chapter and
verse to prove this, and in due course what appeared but a
statement from the Registrar of Citizenship in the Department
of State, who presumably knows what he is talking about,
intimating that I was entirely correct in my belief that Lord
Thomson had not lost his citizenship and that the statement
emanating from the Prime Minister's office was completely
without foundation. He did not use that language, but he did
say perfectly plainly that Lord Thomson had not lost his
citizenship under the Citizenship Act. I took care to see that
the Prime Minister's secretary received a copy of my letter to

I think it is rather shocking that an official in any part of
the government should issue statements like this without knowing what he is talking about. In this particular case the
gentleman or lady-I don't know who it was-evidently did so,
and gave, entirely off the cuff, a pronouncement on law on
which he or she was completely wrong and by admission of the
official most directly concerned and with the widest and
deepest knowledge of this subject.

I sent a copy of the whole correspondence, I may add, to the
official who had written the wrong letter, the erroneous letter,
and I received an acknowledgement from him in which he
made no attempt to justify what he had said. It was just a
polite acknowledgement. I sent copies also to the new Secretary of State and I hope that they will be "read, marked,
learned and inwardly digested". This kind of thing illustrates
the kind of casual, off-hand, irresponsible attitude which you
can get in some officials, and it is only a minor illustration of
the kind of thing we have corne across in our Committee on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments over and over
again.
I might add that, if anybody thinks I am embroidering,
embellishing or exaggerating, what I have said about the
proceedings before the committee can all be verified by anybody who cares to read the proceedings, and what I have just
said about the two voices speaking from the Citizenship
Department-"one is of the deep; And one is of an old,
half-witted sheep Which bleats articulate monotony," as J. K.
Stephen said of Wordsworth-anybody who doubts that can
come and see the correspondence in my office. I would be

SENATE DEBATES
delighted to show it. He or she will sec that 1 was flot
exaggerating by one jot or one tittie.
So 1 end simply with that, that one of our duties in this
bouse, to my mind, is to protect the citizen against the
encroachments of the bureaucracy, which is often not as
learned in the law as it should be and which is apt to take unto
itseif powers which Parliament neyer conferred upon it or to
use powers in a way Parliament neyer contemplated. So I very
much hope that when the details of this kind of thing corne
before the Senate in the shape of a report from the Committee
on Regulations and other Statutory Instruments they will get
very careful consideration from ail members of this bouse,

That the Comrnittee have power to engage the services

Senator Petten: Stand until next Tuesday.
Senator Croil: Before the matter is stood, honourable senators, you will recaîlland this can seen in the record-that
yesterday 1 asked that this motion stand until Tuesday next,
and was informed that that could not be done. Irnmediately 1
rose to speak everyone knew what 1 was about to say, aithough
1 had not discussed the matter with anyone. The house becarne
terribly nervous about what was likely to be said as a result of
a great number of meetings. It was decided, therefore, that the
matter be put off until Tuesday. WeIl, there is nothing much
wrong with that, I suppose.
The cornmittee's chairman, Senator Hayden, is not here. He
was informed that this motion would stand until Tuesday, and
he left early. I usually like to go home in the early afternoon
on Thursdays. 1 arn here early every morning-very earlywhich makes for a long day, and 1 like to get home. Nevertheless, no one took the trouble to tell me about this, and I
consider it a discourtesy which is unacceptable. 1 do not like it
in the least. I was entitled to be inforrned that the matter
would not corne up today, but would be put over until Tuesday. Thinking the matter would corne up today, 1 cancelled rny
reservation, and now I will have to catch whatever flight 1 can
to get home. It is tiring enough to spend three days here
without having to suffer as a resuît of that sort of discourtesy,
and 1 protest it.

PACIFIC COAST SUBSIDIZED TRANSPORTATION SERVICESQUESTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government, of which notice was given to
him only a few moments ago. It relates to the situation on the
British Columbia coast and service to dependent communities
for both passengers and freight. I wonder whether the leader is
aware of the alarm caused in Pacific coastal communities by
the abrupt withdrawal by the Department of Transport of
long-relied-on subsidies paid to Northland Navigation Company for passenger and freight service?
I would also ask the leader whether a study was carried out
by the government on cost efficencies of intermodal transport
forms to British Columbia coastal communities north of Vancouver served by Northland and by Coastal Shipping? Were
alternatives to Northland and Coastal services developed and
discussed with those communities before the August
announcement of the Department of Transport that the subsidies were being withdrawn? If any studies were carried out,
will the government leader make them available to this
chamber?
Finally, I would ask the leader whether there is anything
remotely like a national shipping support policy being pursued
by the federal government in respect of either intraprovincial
or interprovincial services, and, if there is, will the leader
inform this chamber what that policy is?
Senator Perrault: Honourable Senators, because of the
detailed nature of that inquiry, it is impossible for me to
provide a comprehensive answer at this time. I understand the
gravity of the problem outlined by the Honourable Senator
Austin and I shall endeavour to make a statement of behalf of
the government later this week.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Flynn: May I just point out that the Leader of the
Government mentioned that it was an inquiry rather than a
question.
Senator Grosart: It was not an oral question.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
SUPERVISOR OF ENQUIRIES CENTRE--QUESTION

Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government or, rather, a series once again of
six questions:
1. Who is the supervisor of the enquiries centre in the
Department of Justice?
2. When was he or she appointed?
3. Is he or she a lawyer?
4. What was his or her previous position, if any, in the
public service?
5. If he or she came from outside the public service, from
what position in the private sector?
6. What is his or her salary?
Senator Perrault: I must take the question as notice, honourable senators, in order to make the appropriate inquiries.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, on a point of order, in
my opinion we should ask the chairman of the Rules Committee to look into the form of that type of question. 1 do not think
that this should be an oral question. Our rules are not sufficiently clear on that point. This type of question should not
be put as an oral question.
a (2010)

Senator Molson: The Rules Committee is in the hands of
the Senate. If it is the desire of the Senate that some changes
be made, the Rules Committee would always willingly receive
those suggestions.
Senator Flynn: Indeed; but as every problem is automatically referred to the committeeSenator Côté: Order.
Senator Flynn: Who is saying order?
Senator Côté: I am.
Senator Flynn: You don't know anything about the rules.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I do not reject the
observation made by the Leader of the Opposition. There is, of
course, generally a greater flexibility in the rules of this
chamber than there is in the other place, where questions of a
long and intricate nature usually are submitted in written
form. Perhaps this matter of the form of questions could be
placed before the Rules Committee for their consideration and
recommendations.
Senator Argue: Senator Forsey should ask more questions.
Senator Flynn: I have no objection. That is not what I am
suggesting.

November 2, 1976
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 28, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Lucier,
seconded by Senator Barrow, for an Address in reply thereto.
[Translation)
Hon. Bernard Alasdair Graham: Honourable senators, like
those of you who have spoken before me, at the outset I want
to say again to His Excellency the Governor General just how
happy we are to see him so far along to recovery and, with
respect, express to Madam Léger our admiration for the
impeccable way she carried out her duties upon the opening of
this session.
We are also more than satisfied to see that Madam Speaker
will continue to preside over our affairs in this chamber. As
Speaker of this house, she performs her duties with competence and charm-Senator Flynn: Fine.
Senator Graham: -thereby deserving the admiration and
respect of all honourable senators.
[English]
I am sure that we are all delighted to see the Leader of the
Government in the Senate occupying that very important
office. The determination and, indeed, the dedication with
which he carries out his responsibilities is an excellent example
for all of us.
I would be very negligent if I did not acknowledge also the
forceful presence of the Leader of the Opposition, whose
eloquence and charm have already been evident since our
return to Parliament.
Just recently one of our colleagues from Nova Scotia retired
from this chamber. The Honourable Senator Fred Blois was
indeed one of nature's gentlemen. Sensitive to the needs of all
people, he served the Senate, the business and public community of his native province with unusual devotion and distinction, and I join with other senators in wishing Senator Blois an
enjoyable and healthy retirement.
The outstanding contribution made to this debate by all
senators who participated is certainly worthy of mention. In
particular it would be appropriate to acknowledge the excellent speeches by the mover, Senator Lucier, and the seconder,
my colleague from Nova Scotia, Senator Barrow. It is in that
spirit that I should like to discuss not only the Throne Speech
itself, but also some of the problems that we have in Atlantic
Canada.
One of the greatest problems facing the people of Nova
Scotia, as well as the people of Prince Edward Island, is the
continuing escalation of electric power rates. As the domestic
price of oil, even under equalization, approaches the world
price of oil, tremendous hardship faces those people who have
become more and more dependent on electric power. This
hardship is the more pronounced when one considers that the
incomes of the people of the provinces mentioned are consider-

November 2, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

ably lower than the Canadian average, and significantly below
the average of the richer provinces.
It is most essential that temporary financial assistance be
provided to enable those provinces to have sufficient time to
harness alternative sources of energy that will bring some
long-term stability to this most pressing problem. It would not
be an exaggeration to say that the projected increases in
energy costs would spell almost certain economic disaster for
the provinces concerned, unless there was some interim relief.
In the medium term, part of this relief must almost necessarily come from the reserves of coal. Honourable senators are
well aware that eight years ago the federal government undertook control of the coal resources of Cape Breton Island
through the establishment of the Cape Breton Development
Corporation. At that time it was their intention to phase out
coal, as it had become uneconomic to continue mining. But
after a period of time, with excellent cooperation of management and the workers, plus a break in the marketplace, it
became evident that there was an economic viability to the
coal industry. But it demanded, on the part of the people of
Canada, a significant capital investment to exploit the coal
resources. The last report of Devco, which was presented to
Parliament recently, indicates that the corporation will be able
to turn the corner, and we can now look forward to a viable
coal industry on Cape Breton Island. I hasten to add that the
industry is not only showing improvement in productivity, but
as well there are and will continue to be improvements in the
wages and working conditions of the miners. In my judgment
this has been a very worthwhile investment by the taxpayers of
our country.
It is very important to ensure that the full economic import
of this valuable resource is realized to the advantage of the
people of Cape Breton and the Atlantic provinces and, indeed,
to the advantage of the country as a whole. It would seem that
at least in the medium term the coal deposits represent an
acceptable alternative to the ever-increasing price of fossil
fuels. However, these benefits cannot be expected overnight,
and in the meantime there is need for special consideration on
the part of the Government of Canada with respect to the
crisis now being faced because of much higher electrical costs.
There is much concern, too, in the Cape Breton region about
the other twin of its cornerstone industries, steel. At the
present time the Province of Nova Scotia is seeking a longterm solution to the problems of this particular industry. In
essence, efforts are being made to put together a consortium of
steel companies to build a new .world-scale steel industry and
at the same time to provide a market for their own product.
There is no doubt that if Canstel, the name given to this
consortium, is realized, it will mean long-term stability for the
steel industry. Unfortunately, however, the need is greatest
during a period when the steel industry itself is having great
difficulty making an economic recovery from the recession of
the past few years. At the same time the cost of money is
prohibitively expensive, and these factors prejudice an immediate start to this complex. In any event, if Canstel is to be
realized, it will require a considerable investment on the part

of the federal government to provide the necessary infrastructure. I am confident that the people of Canada, knowing full
well that the health of the country is dependent upon the
health of all its parts, will be prepared to support this major
development which is of national importance.
But let me emphasize and underline the magnitude of our
most immediate problem. The people of the region are living in
uncertainty because of the needs of the existing steel industry
in Sydney. The present operation is such that its very existence
is being compromised by a lack of markets and by a lack of
capital. Its survival may very well depend upon the Government of Canada developing an export policy that will enable
Sysco to compete favourably on the international market.
The Speech from the Throne makes reference to this possibility where it states:
To support private industry in meeting greater international competition, the government will modify substantially its industrial assistance programs.
I urge the government to move with all haste in this
direction because I am aware of individual cases where Sydney
Steel's competitive position is threatened on the international
market by foreign companies which are receiving special support directly or indirectly from their own governments. I am
thinking in particular of such programs as the DISC program
in the United States.

•

(2020)

I am also acutely aware of the problems faced by the
Hawker-Siddeley Steel Works in Trenton, Nova Scotia.
Reports indicate that severe cutbacks in orders for rail cars
from Canadian National and Canadian Pacific will force this
Pictou County plant to lay off upwards of 1,000 workers.
Here, also, survival may well lie in foreign markets, and every
effort must be made by the appropriate federal officials to
assist in whatever manner possible to ensure not only that we
identify potential markets but that we are also in a competitive
position.
In the meantime, Canadian railways must be pressed again
to examine their needs and their priorities in order to determine if it is, indeed, feasible to place new orders, without
which the communities involved will be forced to endure severe
economic difficulties.
I have already made direct representations on this subject to
the Minister of Transport, who is also responsible for the
Wheat Board. He has given me every assurance that the
matter will be given urgent consideration.
Crucial to the economic prospects of not only steel and coal
in Nova Scotia but of industry generally across Atlantic
Canada is the transportation policy that is designed to promote
development. There has been developing within Canada in
recent times a "user-pay" concept. One has to be sufficiently
realistic to understand that we cannot live in a country as big
and as wide and as far-reaching as Canada with zero transportation rates. However, Canada, as honourable senators well
know, was developed as a country, not because it was a natural
economic market but rather because the Fathers of Confedera-

SENATE DEBATES
tion saw a political potential that could be realized. But if this
reality is to be maintained and improved upon, it will demand
a transportation policy which will unite rather than disrupt the
political fabric of our country. Such a policy must outline not
only the degree of assistance which is possible but the degree
which is necessary for regional growth.
There are those who say that past attempts have failed and
that the "user-pay" concept is the only alternative. But all
honourable senators are also aware of other economic policies
which were put together to assist the development of other
regions, whether we are talking, for example, about the tariff
policies that promoted the growth of secondary manufacturing
in central Canada or the Ottawa Valley oil policy that assisted
the development of the Alberta oil industry.
Under present conditions it becomes al] the more necessary
for the Government of Canada to develop transportation policies that will assist the growth of regions and enable all
Canadians to share in the abundance of this nation.
I was pleased to note in the Throne Speech that, in concert
with other levels of government and the private sector, the
federal government will work to increase the efficiency and the
impact of Canada's total housing effort. In this regard I have
some suggestions to offer. Over the past year there has been
much debate about the housing policies formulated by Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which have proven to be
very successful in the larger metropolitan areas of the country.
At the same time, these policies have not realized their potential and in some cases may have worked to the disadvantage of
people in the more remote arcas and for those on lower
incomes. The great fear held by some Canadians today is that
these centrally developed policies are imposed on regions, and,
while these policies have great validity in metropolitan areas,
they do not necessarily relate to the world of reality out in
Canada's hinterlands.
Here is an example of the bigness of bureaucracy that may
frustrate the modest expectations of people in areas remote
from the central core of Canada's development. A minimum
requirement is that the planning function be assumed to a
much larger degree at regional and even at sub-regional levels
in order to ensure that government investment in housing will
be harmonious with the legitimate aspirations of the local
populace.
It is very important to point out that it is not something
which would require legislation, but rather a strong commitment on the part of the government to further decentralize the
decision-making process. There is solid evidence over the past
year that indicates the desire on the part of the government to
in fact decentralize many of its operations. In the housing
field, such decentralization would certainly bring the policymakers and the decision-makers closer to the needs of all our
people.
The past year has been a very difficult one in that there
seems to be a new cynicism pervading the Canadian political
and economic world. Never has there been such distrust in the
future of Canada as a political entity; seldom in our history

November 2, 1976

have we seen such disenchantment than that expressed by
Anglophones versus Francophones, labour versus government,
business versus government, or labour versus business.
It is a time, everybody agrees, when inflation must be
fought, but each group sees its solution as the only one. It is
also a time when bilingualism is seen as a threat rather than a
cohesive force in the development of our nation.
In this respect I am pleased to note that, according to the
Speech from the Throne, the government intends to discuss
with the provinces arrangements to increase the effectiveness
of training in both official languages in the school systems
across Canada. This is definitely a step in the right direction.
It is a time when 7 to 8 per cent of our potential work force
is unemployed. The Speech from the Throne indicates that the
government will introduce a comprehensive year-round job
creation program, directed particularly towards areas of
chronic high unemployment, and that other programs will
provide more job opportunities and improve employment counselling for young people.
It is also a time when provinces and regions feel it is
essential to increase their autonomy, and it is a time when the
more disadvantaged regions of the country are more and more
in need of a strong fiscal presence to preserve a minimum
standard of services.
The greatest problem with which we have been presented is
how we are to maintain an open, honest debate on the issues
and at the same time prevent a confrontation which, by
definition, is destructive. Certainly, we have to understand that
the divisions are deep, that more and more distrust pervades
our country.
It is crucial to our survival that we return to the bargaining
table, as it were, to what the Prime Minister recently referred
to as the cooperative pursuit of national objectives, with less
government intervention, and more sharing in the responsibility for bringing about the type of society we want for ourselves
and for our children. We must together take a long-range view
of our problems and our objectives. We must together promote
better mutual understanding.
To my mind, the function of government is to protect
economic liberty and, at the same time, protect the liberty of
those who cannot protect themselves. We must recognize that
government is a process, not an end in itself. As circumstances
change, policies and ideas must change also.
In discussing the role of government in Canada today, the
Speech from the Throne stated that a major series of consultations will be launched throughout the country to secure a
greater sharing of economic and social responsibility among all
Canadians. This process should prove welcome and worthwhile, and I hope it will begin as quickly as possible.
All of us must understand that communications is a process
of listening as well as talking. If we have new demands, or if
we take new directions, in the light of new information, we all
must be prepared to negotiate, to compromise, and to make an
earnest effort to understand.

SENATE DEBATES

(2030)

It is time for us all, honourable senators, to recall and to
re-emphasize some of the old values. A survey taken not too
long ago in the United States with respect to the attributes
that Americans consider most vital to leadership, is very
interesting. It showed that by a large margin, across almost
the entire spectrum of occupation, of race and of gender,
people were placing heaviest emphasis and reliance on such
homely but enduring virtues as moral integrity, courage, compassion and common sense. These are attributes that our
people have a right to expect of all of us today. Our citizens
too are looking for a new assertion of those traditional values.
Honourable senators, if Canada is worth saving, it will
require a new commitment on the part of groups, on the part
of regions, on the part of provinces. The alternative is not only
economic disruption, but the destruction of the dream of the
Fathers of Confederation.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, before addressing myself to the Speech from the Throne, I should like to
join all those who have paid tribute to Madam Speaker, not
only for the gracious and efficient manner in which she
presides over our deliberations but also on her television
appearances. For many of us she is fast becoming a favourite
television star. I had the pleasure of seeing her recent appearance with Senator Walker and Senator Forsey, and I agree
that this was the most favourable and most honest publicity
that the Senate has received in a very long time.
I should like, also, to associate myself with those who have
expressed appreciation of the leadership which we have
received from the Leader of the Government in the Senate,
together with that of the Leader of the Opposition, which
contributed so largely to the achievements of the Senate
during the last session.
I begin my comments on the Speech from the Throne by
congratulating the mover and seconder, and all others who
have preceded me in this debate, on the excellence of their
presentations. It has been stated on more than one occasion,
over the air, in the other place and, I think, even in this
chamber, that the Speech from the Throne is more notable for
what it leaves out than what it contains. This trite comment
can be applied to every Throne Speech, for the simple reason
that it cannot be otherwise, since to give details of every piece
of legislation would make the Throne Speech too long and
would not achieve any useful purpose. The sensible and practical thing is to outline the purpose and intent of the legislative
program and leave the details until the legislation is introduced
into Parliament. However, to show that the Throne Speech is
not as barren as some people would have us believe, I should
like to quote from a press release of the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce on October 13, 1976. It starts out as follows:
We at the Canadian Chamber are pleased with the thrust
of yesterday's Throne Speech, which suggests that substantial changes will be made in some major policies and
programs. Several of the proposals announced yesterday
are in keeping with the suggestions which have been made
to Ottawa by this chamber.

Then it goes on to say:
We agree that the country's top priorities are reduction
of inflation and creation of jobs.
I skip over a few paragraphs to where it states:
The chamber is in full agreement with the Throne Speech
proposal that the growth of the federal public service
should be curbed and we welcome any moves to improve
labour-management relations. The Speech contains many
positive suggestions in this regard . . . The new initiative

to assist and encourage small businesses will be of special
benefit to the majority of our members, as well as the
stated intention to reduce the excessive paperwork
involved in filing reports to the government.
We applaud the proposed trade development initiatives
and are encouraged by the importance accorded to freedom of access to government information and by the
proposals regarding affirmation of human rights.
Finally, in the penultimate paragraph it says that the
Throne Speech contains much to encourage Canadians.
t had not planned to participate in this debate, but I am
doing so now for three reasons. The first is the positive
response of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce to which I
have just referred. The second is because the timing of this
debate-it is taking place between Thanksgiving Day, which
has just passed, and Remembrance Day, which is a few days in
the future-gives it a special significance in relation to these
two commemorations. The third is that Senator Forsey and
others have made some proposals to which I feel t should lend
my support.
We are living in a very troubled and dangerous timeperhaps the most troubled time in the history of mankind. But
we Canadians have more to be thankful for than any other
nation on this earth. Most Canadians are fairly well off, and
even the poorest are provided with the necessities of life. As a
nation we can provide ourselves with the essential proteins,
while three-quarters of the earth's population go to bed hungry
every night. It has been estimated that between 350 and 400
million people in the world today are on the brink of
starvation.
It is true that we have our problems of inflation, unemployment, balance of trade, regional disparity and lack of unity,
but we have much to be thankful for in comparison with some
other peoples and nations. However, the fact that our day of
thanksgiving was followed almost immediately by a day of
protest, a protest based largely on human selfishness and
greed, should cause us to pause and ask ourselves where we are
and whither tending.
Our pioneering forefathers, the people who made this country great, took the position that all of the blessings we enjoy
are gifts from a Divine Providence which we have not earned
by our own efforts or merits. This was a sensible view based on
the practical experience of people who knew that as individuals
they could not add one cubit to their stature, nor make one
blade of grass grow in the fields. They were not ashamed, as
we seem to be, to acknowledge their dependence on their

SENATE DEBATES
Creator for the sunshine and rain, and for their good health
which supplied the energy to till the fields and reap the harvest
which gave them their livelihood.
But today, things are different. As a nation we go through
the motions of thanksgiving, but there is reason to doubt our
sincerity. Our actions speak louder than words. They indicate
that we are motivated by the idea that as individuals we are
entitled to whatever we can get, no matter who has to pay the
price; that we can take out of the economy more than we put
in, regardless of who suffers as a result. In short, we are saying
by our actions that might is right, and we owe thanks to no one
but ourselves. That, honourable senators, seems to be the
direction towards which we are tending, and it is the road to
disaster and destruction.
A few minutes ago, I mentioned some of the blessings we as
Canadians enjoy. I purposefully omitted one which is the
greatest blessing of all, the blessing of freedom. I refer to it
now because in a few days, on November 11, we will be
commemorating the sacrifice that Canadians and people of
other nations of the free world paid to secure that freedom.
Remembrance Day takes our thoughts, particularly those of
my comrades in arms, back to the days of World War I and
World War Il.
* (2040)

How different our world is today from the brave new world
for which 280,000 young Canadians and some 15 million of
our allies sacrificed their lives. Those of us who can think back
to World War I will recall that it was supposed to be a war to
end wars, to reject once and for all the idea that might is right.
When the outbreak of World War Il proved this hope was in
vain, freedom-loving nations sacrificed another 102 million
lives, including 86,000 Canadians. This time it was to save the
world from tyranny and to preserve what we refer to as our
free democratic way of life.
Nevertheless, there has been a steady erosion of freedom
around the world ever since. The torch of freedom was thrown
to us, but we have not held it high. Instead we have allowed it
to grow dimmer every year. Last year it went out in India, a
nation of 500 million people, and there are several countries at
this moment where it is not burning very brightly, and could
easily be extinguished altogether. There are only about 25
nations in the world today that can be said to have a completely free press.
Honourable senators, it is time that we paused and asked
ourselves why this has happened. There are several reasons,
but I think the first and most important is that we have not
recognized the fact that democracy is based on moral and
spiritual values, and for that reason it can function only within
a moral framework. The prerequisites for freedom are truth,
justice and righteousness, and unless we establish and maintain these prerequisites in our land we are not going to have a
true functioning democracy.
It is in this context that I hope the patriation of the
Constitution will be considered. The Constitution embodies a
number of commitments that bind the federal government to

November 2, 1976

do certain things for the provinces, particularly in the field of
transportation. My greatest concern at the moment is, not that
the Constitution be patriated, but that it be lived up to.
In the last session, on Thursday, April 8, 1976, as reported
in Hansard at page 2049, Senator Bonnell listed a number of
instances in which the federal government had violated the
Constitution by disregarding its commitments to Prince
Edward Island. Other provinces can make similar lists. A
recent -example occurred in Newfoundland a short while ago.
For that reason I heartily endorse Senator Forsey's comments
regarding the Constitution and support his suggestion that a
Senate committee inquire into our transportation policy.
There is no doubt the provincial premiers are playing politics with the patriation question, each trying to score some
political advantage for himself, but if the provisions of the
Constitution can be disregarded completely by the government
as a whole, or by the whim of an individual minister who may
regard certain provisions in it as stupid, and if this can be done
while the Constitution remains in the custody of another
country, the premiers' reluctance to bring it under more direct
control of the federal government can be easily understood.
There is no substitute for integrity in governments or anywhere else.
A second reason for the erosion of freedom around the world
is the failure of democratic countries to realize that freedom
and responsibility are two sides of the same coin. In a democratic society, governments cannot govern unless the people
themselves are prepared to cooperate, and each individual is
ready and willing to accept his or her own responsibility for
the nation as a whole. This involves discipline, and we have the
choice of disciplining ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the moral law, or of generating forces which in time
will require discipline to be imposed upon us. That is why we
now have to suffer the disadvantages and inconveniences of
income and price controls. For years, the government pleaded
with and begged Canadians, particularly in industry and
labour, to exercise voluntary controls, but they refused. In time
the resulting forces built up and became so threatening to our
economy that there was no other choice but to impose compulsory controls. Incidentally, it is notable that some of those who
are now decrying these controls are the very ones who, a year
ago, were crying out for the government to do something.
Senator Flynn: You should remember that those who are
now applying them were at that time decrying them.
Senator Carter: One of the freedoms we enjoy is freedom of
enterprise, and here too the keyword is responsibility. Free
enterprise and free democracy have a symbiotic relationship
with each other. One cannot exist without the other. When
democracy goes, free enterprise disappears along with it. Anything that threatens the survival of democracy threatens also
the survival of our free enterprise system. Free enterprise,
then, has a responsibility to make democracy work. To survive,
free enterprise must operate within the moral framework.
Our free enterprise system is in many ways a good system. It
is the only system that gives the greatest opportunity to the

November 2, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

individual to develop himself and his talents, and to make his
own contribution to society. It is the only system that maximizes the incentive for production, work, innovation, efficiency, saving and investment. It is the only system that graduates
both its penalties and rewards with sufficient accuracy to bring
about the production of wanted goods and services in the
proportion in which they are most demanded by customers.
Socialists advocate changing the system, but that solution is
too simplistic. The free enterprise system is not perfect. What
is wrong with it is not so much the fault of the system itself as
the way we use the system. Our greed and selfishness get in
the way and we operate the system to exploit people, to waste
resources and to produce harmful effects on the environment.
Free enterprise cries out vigorously against any interference
with what it calls the free market system, but it often interferes with the system by withholding supply and manipulating
both supply and demand to force up prices and maximize
profits.
Free competition is supposed to be the dynamic of the
enterprise system, but la.rge corporations often use their power
to restrain competition, to eliminate it wherever possible, and
to prey on weaker ones to put them out of business, without
any regard for the effect on the nation or on the people whose
livelihood is destroyed. Free enterprise complains bitterly
about any government interference in the free market, but it
does not hesitate to ask the government to interfere by way of
subsidies and protective tariffs against outside competition.
One of the worst effects of the way in which we operate the
free enterprise system is the unequal distribution of wealth. In
Canada, the bottom 20 per cent of the population receives only
about 4 per cent of the wealth produced. The top 20 per cent
receives 44 per cent. The result is that the poor get poorer and
the rich get richer.

e

(2050)

It is the same on the world scale. Rich nations get richer
while poor nations get poorer. In 1950 a farmer in South
America could buy a jeep for 17 sacks of coffee, but in 1965
he needed 67 sacks of coffee. Today he needs 100 sacks of
coffee to buy the same vehicle. Honourable senators, this
cannot go on forever. These problems are just as much the
responsibility of the free enterprise system as they are of
government. The thing that disturbs me is that our top business people, our industrialists and our labour leaders, do not
seem to realize this. The impression one gets from their
statements and briefs is that if only the government will do
what they consider to be the right things we will get back to
the good old days where we will have full employment, good
profits and plenty of prosperity. But the good old days are
gone and are not likely to return. Therefore, they cannot
continue concentrating on making money, without any concern
for the problems of poverty and more equitable distribution of
wealth or the fate of freedom and democracy throughout the
world.
They do not seem to realize that our present society cannot
continue to exist as it is today or as it was in the past. Our
present society has been built on three assumptions: (1) cheap

and unlimited energy; (2) cheap and unlimited resources; and
(3) an indestructible environment. All three of these assumptions are now known to be false. Therefore, our society cannot
continue to exist as it is today. Change is inevitable and all
mankind, particularly we who live in the affluent west, are
faced with a period of significant far-reaching and agonizing
adjustments, particularly in our life styles.
A few minutes ago Senator Graham, in his excellent speech,
referred to the kind of society we want for our children and
grandchildren. We reap what we sow. If we honestly want to
see ourselves as we are, we should look at the picture which
Statistics Canada gives of Canadian society. In the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1974, Canadians spent $2.6 billion on
alcohol; $2.5 billion on cigarettes, despite the warnings about
lung cancer; $912 million on racetracks, which is almost the
same as the total of our foreign aid; $310 million on candy;
and $127 million on pet food. This adds up to $6.45 billion for
only five items. A 50 per cent reduction would finance a
guaranteed annual income above the poverty level for all our
poor. The figures for 1975 are not available but the total is
probably well over $7 billion, and yet we scream if a few extra
dollars are given to the poor, the unemployed and aged, and if
milk goes up by 5 cents a quart, or eggs by 5 cents a dozen.
Is this the picture of a healthy society-or of one that is soft
and self-indulgent? How must we appear to the 2 billion
people trying to exist on a per capita income of less than $200
per year?
What we must do now is to begin building a completely new
society, a society based on the facts of life concerning our
environment and our available energy and resources; and a
society that will preserve human rights, fundamental freedoms
and the dignity of man. A well-structured society represents a
woven fabric. In a good fabric each thread has its place, and
supports the other threads as it is supported by them. This is
the role of the various segments of our society and particularly
the role of government, industry and labour. This is the only
society that can survive in the future and at the same time
preserve our democratic institutions, our human rights and
freedoms.
We have the blueprint for that society in the Ten Commandments, in the Law and the Prophets, and in the Sermon
on the Mount. But to build that society requires heart power
rather than brain power; it requires inner change, a change of
heart, a change of mind, a change of attitude and a new spirit
in our land. We can and must build this new society. If we
don't, the chances are that we shall have one built for us, one
shaped by the ruthless forces of materialism and forced upon
us by the might of a totalitarian regime. The problems to be
overcome are man-made problems, but there are no man-made
solutions. To find the solutions we must get back to the
example of our forefathers and seek Divine help and give the
Creator His rightful place in our personal and national affairs.
Nature teaches us that the secret of survival is to change, to
adapt and to adjust. If we accept this challenge of personal
change we can give this nation of Canada, under God, a new

SENATE DEBATES
birth of freedom, and it will be an example of inspired
democracy which other nations will follow.
Hon. Jack Austin: Honourable senators, may I begin by
congratulating Senator Carter on a wide-ranging and thoughtful address to this chamber. I would also like to congratulate
those senators who have preceded me in this debate. In my
opinion, the tone of the debate has been extremely high and
the application of the Senate to the issues of the day cogent.
I would like to express my own appreciation to Her Honour
the Speaker for her service to the Senate and, in addition, say
how grateful I am to her for the assistance she has given meand it was real assistance-over the past year. As honourable
senators know, I have been in this chamber only a little over
one year and I have relied very much on Her Honour's
guidance.
To the mover and the seconder of the Address I offer my
congratulations. Both honourable gentlemen presented to this
chamber apposite and excellent presentations on behalf of
their respective regions.
Senator Lucier is the first senator from the Yukon. I have
known him for a number of years, having had the great
privilege of being called to the Yukon bar in 1966 and of
acquainting myself with the Yukon as a result of being executive assistant to the Honourable Arthur Laing, who was then
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. The
Yukon is a beautiful part of this country. It has an exciting
history and a great potential. The Yukon is possessed of
substantial mineral resources, which this country will need in
its domestic manufactures and external trade. I urge upon the
government and my colleagues here in the Senate policies that
will give sponsorship to the development of the resources of the
Yukon, and of the Northwest Territories, in the context of
adequate environmental protection and protection for the
societies that live north of 60.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the Throne made
appropriate note of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the accession of Her Majesty to the Throne of Canada, which will take
place during the Second Session of the Thirtieth Parliament.
We are the only monarchy among the continental nations of
the Western hemisphere, and in this respect our national
evolution has been different in form from that of other peoples
who have occupied and settled the new world. In substance we
have not been deterred in our national development by the
monarchy and, in my view, something of the tranquillity and
progressiveness of our society to this time has its basis in the
monarchical system.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Austin: We remain a Canadian monarchy-not a
British or any other kind of monarchy-because it suits and
serves our interests as a nation, and not because of any
obligation of any kind to anyone beyond our borders. I believe
the majority of Canadians will continue in their support and
affection for both the antiquity and the modernity of our
democratic monarchical institutions. We are fortunate, indeed,
to be served as our monarch by lier Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

November 2, 1976

She is an astute person, knowledgeable in the affairs of the
world community and deeply understanding of the nature of
Canadian society. Nothing could demonstrate this better than
the message she had for Canadians when she spoke in Montreal at the time of the Twenty-first Olympiad. In a speech at a
state dinner given by the Government of Canada on Saturday,
July 24 last, she said these words:
How Canada resolves her political and constitutional
differences is her own affair, but how she resolves her
linguistic and cultural problems matters to thoughtful
people everywhere.
The world, all too familiar with the tragic price of
conflict between peoples of different race, language, religion and culture, can look to Canada for a better example
and for a renewal of the human spirit. It can look to her
for a practical demonstration of how two strong communities can live together in peace, drawing from each
other's strengths, respecting each other's differences.
* (2100)

Honourable senators, the sincere hope of Her Majesty's words
are and will remain an accurate state of matters in the
Canadian family.
I am greatly troubled by the dissension and differences
which have arisen in this country in the past two years.
Senator Graham spoke about that this evening, and I wish to
continue on that theme.
In a speech to the Canadian Club of Montreal in the last
week of October, René Lévesque said to a capacity audience:
Canada is no longer two solitudes, it is becoming two
hostilities. It is like two scorpions in one bottle.
Well, René Lévesque is not entirely wrong with respect to the
minority of Canadians. There is a group in western Canada, a
region whence I come, which is like one of those scorpions.
That group in western Canada is hostile to the concept of
national unity, which was the basis of the work of the Fathers
of Confederation. There is a group in western Canada, distributed throughout the four western provinces, who feel
strongly that their appetites and aspirations for their region
would be served by the victory of René Lévesque in the
forthcoming Quebec election. There is talk in western Canada
about contributing financially through the Parti Quebecois,
and I sincerely hope that René Lévesque will disclose the
names of any from western Canada who contribute to his
campaign.
Senator Flynn: That is wishful thinking.
Senator Buckwold: Whether they will contribute or whether
they will disclose?
Senator Flynn: Whether they will disclose.
Senator Austin: I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is
right, but he is a man who has told others that he believes they
should disclose their affairs, and I have no doubt he will be
consistent.
Honourable senators, there appeared in yesterday's issue of
the Vancouver Province a story which to my mind is frighten-

November 2, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

ing. It appears under the headline "It's no lunatic fringe," and
is by Barbara McLintock. She reports on a meeting, which
took place in Victoria, of a group known as the Committee for
Western Independence. She says:
Nobody really believes in setting up a new nation of
Western Canada, do they?
The answer is: yes, they do, and they are not the lunatic
fringe. They are still a minority certainly, even a tiny
minority, but they are steadily growing in numbers and in
respectability.
More than 150 of them turned up in a basement
meeting room of the Empress Hotel last Tuesday
evening ... with no special speaker except their president.
That is surely a larger turnout than either the Liberals or
Conservatives would have had in similar circumstances ...
They looked like the crowd that would turn up at any
ordinary political meeting-about half of them middleaged men in blue business suits; about a quarter older
people, pensioners; about a quarter young people, the
under-30s. Interestingly, most of the young people
appeared to be working-class, skilled tradesmen, rather
than the students and young professionals who are more
often seen at political gatherings.
The brochure distributed by this committee outlined its aims.
It contained two resolutions:
We resolve to seek firstly within Confederation to
demand our fair share of political power with one united
voice.
If our rights and place within Confederation are not to
be recognized and political power given to us to control
our land, its resources, our future, our language and
culture, then we are resolved to unite in seeking the
formation of a new and independent national state to ...
achieve the best for future generations with the land
entrusted to us by Providence.
The columnist goes on to say how well received that resolution
was, and to say that this is a growing group, a group with an
attractive political program for western Canada.
Honourable senators, there are those of us who are well
acquainted with the fact that there are real grievances within
Confederation. There are those of us from provincesSenator Rowe: Would the honourable senator permit a
question before he leaves this matter which he is now
discussing?
Senator Austin: Yes.
Senator Rowe: Do they spell out anywhere what they would
consider to be a fair share of political power and trust?
Senator Austin: The newspaper report gives no specifics of
the nature of their complaint, but it does show a very powerful
attraction these days in my part of the country to the idea of
British Columbia or western Canada going it alone. There are
funds available for research in both British Columbia and
Alberta on the question of whether western Canada is getting

a good deal in Confederation; whether certain provinces east of
the Manitoba-Ontario border are not taking too much out of
Confederation. There are peopje-and they are people in
important places in business and the academic community of
my province-who argue with me that British Columbia transfers, and will continue to transfer, far more money out of that
province than it will ever get back in benefits from the rest of
Canada.
I adopt none of those arguments. I am hostile to every one of
them. I feel that this chamber has a particularly appropriate
role in addressing itself to the question of regional aspirations
and regional alienation in this country, and I urge upon the
government leader and all senators the consideration of a
means by which we may address ourselves to these questionsand, Senator Rowe, a means by which we may call these
people to account in public and submit them to cross examination on the reality and viability of their views.
There is another aspect of the attacks on our national unity
which has to be mentioned in this chamber. That is a rise of a
contorted image of federal-provincial relations. It is the rise of
the aspirations of provinces for economic personality, a kind of
economic personality which the British North America Act
did not conceive of. It is the demand for leverage in economic
terms by certain provincial leaders which would give us not a
Confederation in which our national issues are debated and
solved in the crucible of Parliament, but in which our national
issues are debated and solved, if at all, in federal-provincial
agreements; and if there are no such agreements, there will be
no solutions.
It is a concept in which Canada is a kind of loosely knit
common market of provinces, with a weak federal government
serving only those interests which do not involve themselves in
inherent conflict of our peoples and regions. That is a concept
which is being promoted by journalists such as Charles Lynch,
Peter Thomson and other journalists who write to this particular effect.
Honourable senators, in my view our concept of the reconciliation of our national problems in Parliament is in danger of
being lost sight of, and it is my view that this chamber bears a
special responsibility to point this out. I hope that the Senate
can be made to reflect more accurately a place in which the
aspirations of our regions can be realized; a place which could
assist in the resolution of those legitimate, real and even
desirable differences in a process that helps bind us together.
We need institutions in this country, consensus institutions,
that will help bind us together. We have enough of the other
kind.
Honourable senators, we will be discussing Senate reform
during the second session of this Parliament. I hope that you
will give some attention to the possibility of this chamber's
reflecting in a way different from that in which it now does the
parts of the country which are not represented by Quebec and
Ontario. In the west-and I am sure this is true of the Atlantic
provinces-there is a deeply-held view that its opinions do not
count. The majority of the population of this country is in
Ontario and Quebec, and the view of people in British

SENATE DEBATES
Columbia, Alberta and other provinces is that it does not
matter what they think or what they say; that Ontario and
Quebec will decide, and that is the end of the dialogue.
I believe it would be to the advantage of federalism in this
country, and to the advantage of the role of this chamber, to
give the western provinces a larger number of senators to
represent them here. I believe it would be of use also to pursue
the notion of the Victoria Charter that>some senators should
be appointed by the Prime Minister and the Governor in
Council in consultation with provincial governments.
In addition, in order to enhance the ability of this chamber
to reflect the regional interests of this country, I hope it will be
possible to adopt a rule that would allow membership in this
chamber to any person who has served as a provincial premier
for, say, five full years. I say this because I believe that any
man or woman who has served in such a capacity over such a
period of time has something to say to us that is of relevance to
Canada and to their own particular area of Canada.

BANKING LEGISLATION
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE TO MAKE STUDY-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved:

November 2, 1976

That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce be authorized to examine and
report upon the document entitled: "White Paper on the
Revision of Canadian Banking Legislation, August,
1976," tabled in the Senate on Thursday, October 21,
1976, and the subject matter of any bill arising therefrom,
in advance of such bill coming before the Senate, or any
other matter relating thereto; and
That the committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, staff and technical advisers as may be
necessary for the purpose of the said examination.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by
the Honourable Senator Hayden, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Bourget, P.C., that the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and CommerceHon. Senators: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Carried.
Senator Croll: No, no, no.
Senator Flynn: But the question has to be put.
Senator Croll: I know that, but the Speaker said "Carried".
Senator Hayden is going to speak to the motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, I should like to say a
few words in support of the substance of this motion.
The form of the motion, I am sure, is well known to senators
by this time. We have been using this form for various
important purposes in the public interest in order to give early
consideration to the subject matter of what will inevitably lead
to important legislation. In my recollection this practice goes
back to at least 1970 when we were dealing with taxation
legislation. I should point out that there is usually involved in
such a reference for study of subject matter the second phase
which will lead to legislation. Here I am referring to legislation
that is necessary in the public interest. This is usually the
subject matter of what will eventually turn out to be legislation
which has some time limit. For instance, the deadline is June
30, 1977, for dealing with the revision of banking legislation.
The chartered banks in Canada, whose charter is the Bank
Act, will have to stop operating unless one of two things
happens: unless the new Bank Act is passed extending the life
of the banks and whatever other financial institutions are to be
included in the legislation for another 10 years, or Parliament
provides some interim way of extending the 10-year life for a
further period within which it would hope that the new Bank
Act might be settled and passed. It has been necessary on at
least one occasion to provide such legislation for the reason
that Parliament was not able to conclude dealing with a new
Bank Act within the time limit, that is the statutory time limit.
I should point out that the subject matter of this motion, the
white paper, is a preliminary to the introduction of a new bank

November 2, 1976

Novemer 2,1976SENATE
DEBATES

bill which wiii undoubtedly incorporate some or ai of the
proposais contained in the said white paper.
The white paper sets out reasonabiy extensiveiy the pros and
cons of the approach to many of the proposais invoived in a
revision of our banking legisiation. You can see, then, that we
are up against a deadline which inevitabiy means that a
motion of this kind shouid be presented in order to permit the
Senate to become weii informed at as eariy a date as possible
so as to be able to give the utmost consideration to the
subsequent legisiation arising out of these proposais within the
scope of the time limit, usualiy a statutory time limit, invoived
in taxation iegislation. As honourable senators are aware,
normally there are time limits on provisions bringing certain
measures into force, and we have had instances here where
there have been justifiable complaints. 1 refer particularly to
what was calied the "Christmas ciosure."

e

(2120)

1 think to somte extent we may have overcome that sort of
thing by having an eariier consideration of either the proposed
legisiation or, where there is a white paper with the proposais,
a study of the white paper. In that way we would be in as good
shape as possible to be able to consider inteliigently what is
proposed in the way of changes in the existing legisiation; and,
certainly, in this white paper there are many proposais which

invoive substantial and important changes in the banking
system and in the power and scope of banks and other institutions that are permitted to operate, or wili be permitted by the
legisiation, if it is proposed to implement the proposais in the
white paper.
I stress this to indicate the urgency that exists to put this
white paper before a committee where there can be a thorough
review and consideration so that we wiIl be better informed
and better able to deal with any new legisiation that may
incorporate any or ail of these proposais.
My purpose in rising tonight, then, is simply to stress how
important it is that we should move ahead with our consideration of the white paper, recognizing that, in an educational
way, it is a preliminary to preparing ourselves for a consideration of the new bank act when it cornes forward.
Senator Flynn: I should like to move the adjourniment of the
debate.
Senator Croil: You won't let me talk, eh?
Senator Flynn: Not tonight. 1 want to give you time to
reflect.
Senator Croll: 1 will wait until tomorrow, then.
On motion of Senator Flynn, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

BANKING LEGISLATION
TEMPORARY RESIGNATION OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF
BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, in view of the intention of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce to study and report on the white paper on banking
and related matters including suggested amendments to the
Bank Act, certain members of the committee who are directors
of banks, trust companies and other financial institutions
which may be affected by the proposed measures have advised
me that they are resigning their membership on the committee
for the period during which the committee will study these
matters. Therefore, these honourable members will be replaced
by other senators. Of course, there will be no meetings of the
committee on the white paper on banking and matters related
thereto until such replacements have been made.
Honourable senators, may I say a few brief words about the
statement I have just made. I should like to thank the members who are resigning, for their determination to allay any
suggestion that conflict of interest would have been involved
had they remained as members of this committee.
Indeed, those honourable senators indicated some days ago
that they had no intention of sitting on the committee during
consideration of the White Paper on the Revision of Canadian
Banking Legislation or the Bank Act, although they would be
prepared to serve on the committee during consideration of the
many other items unrelated to the Bank Act and banking
which wilI come before the committee this session.
Their attitude has been, "We want to do whatever is best for
Canada and for Parliament," and as Leader of the Government in this place I commend them for their attitude.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senatorsSenator Macnaughton: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege.
The Hon. the Speaker: May the honourable senator speak
on a question of privilege?
Senator Flynn: If it is a question of privilege it has precedence over what I have to say, so long as it is not a comment
on what the Leader of the Government has said. If it is a
question of privilege, I yield.
Senator Macnaughton: I thank the Leader of the Opposition. In this morning's Globe and Mail this heading appears in
the centre of page 1:

Six senators with financial directorships won't sit on
committee on Bank Act.
Paragraph 6 of this article, written by Mary Trueman, lists
the names of six senators who apparently will not sit on the
Banking Committee. My name is included among the six. John
King, head of the Globe and Mail's Ottawa bureau, wrote me
on August 25 in Ottawa asking for full details about any
directorships held by me. I replied from Montreal on September 7 and invited him to call in person if he required any
further details or information.
Again for the record, I wish to say that I am not a director
of any bank, trust company, mortgage or loan company, caisse
populaire or credit union.
Last Wednesday, October 27, at its organization meeting,
the members of the Senate Banking, Trade and Commerce
Committee unanimously elected me their deputy chairman.
I intend to make the best contribution I can to the consideration of those matters coming before the committee, including
the white paper proposals on the revision of the Bank Act.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
*

(1410)

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, although I had some
discussions about this matter with the Leader of the Government, I was not expecting a statement of the type he has made
today. In my view the matter which he has raised is one of
great importance, and I would not want it to be treated as
anything less than a matter of significant import.
The motion that Senator Hayden put before the Senate last
night has one purpose only, and that is to refer the white paper
on the Canadian banking legislation to the standing Senate
committee of which he is chairman. The motion, as it stands,
does not lend itself to the discussion of whether some members
of that committee have or have not a conflict of interest.
I commend those members who have decided to resign from
this committee during the study of the white paper. But I think
that here we are faced with a very difficult problem. It is not
only a question of solving the present problem; there is more to
it than that; and there is more to it than what is raised in this
morning's article in the Globe and Mail today.
I hold a directorship in a trust company incorporated under
the laws of Quebec, and this white paper and any subsequent
legislation may affect this company in one way or another. But
I suggest to you, honourable senators, that this legislation may
also affect many other organizations which are not in the loan
or banking business. You have all received letters from car
dealers, for instance, and I am sure that you will receive
representations from many other groups, corporations and
individuals who will find that they would be affected.

November 3, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

For this reason, I think at this time we should apply the rule
that we proposed in the report of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Conflict of
Interest, tabled on June 29, 1976. From that report I quote the
following which is to be found at page 2303 of the Debates of
the Senate for that day.
A Senator shall not
(a) advocate, support or promote any matter, thing, cause
or course of action in the Senate or among Senators or
Members of the House of Commons, or
(b) intercede with public servants or government bodies in
respect of any matter, thing, cause or course of action,
if,
(c) in return for so advocating, supporting, promoting or
interceding, the Senator is paid or accepts a sum of
money, fee or other reward, or
(d) the Senator acts as an adviser or consultant to, or is
employed in any other capacity by, any individual, firm or
corporation that has a direct pecuniary interest in such
matter, thing, cause or course of action or is a director,
officer or manager of the corporation.
Honourable senators will have noted that the important
parts of what I have quoted are to be found in paragraphs (a)
and (d); that is, support or promote any matter in the Senate
or among senators or members of the House of Commons, and
(d) in any matter where the firm or corporation with which he
is connected one way or the other has a direct pecuniary
interest in such matter.
I suggest to you, honourable senators, that it may be the
safe thing to do. So far as I am concerned I am willing to
resign from the committee, because I am a director of a trust
company incorporated under the laws of Quebec. But even so
there is a technical problem involved because of the fact that I
am only an ex officio member. Therefore, I do not know if I
can resign without changing the rules. But that is another
problem, and, be that as it may, I can easily dispense with
attending the committee. But I do suggest to you that we are,
quite possibly, creating here a dangerous precedent. It may be
that aIl those members of the committee who have directorships of banks, trust companies or loan companies will decide
to resign or at least to abstain from participating in the
committee's work. But, I should certainly not like that to be
construed as an admission on their part of a conflict of
interest, an admission that they come under the proposed rule.
I remind you again that it is only a proposed rule. Under
existing legislation there is no conflict of interest. Conflict of
interest would only occur if a certain very restrictive interpretation were placed on the proposed rule which is not yet in
effect. And I would further suggest to you that a "direct
pecuniary interest" is not proven by the mere fact that a
member of the committee is a director of a firm which would
be affected by the legislation. Not in the least. It is a dangerous precedent, in my opinion, to acknowledge that we must
resign, if we are in that position. However, I am willing to do
so.

We have ail heard the phrase-it has been used often-that
Caesar's wife must not only be above reproach, but must
appear to be above reproach. I say to those people who see
conflicts of interest everywhere that they should remember
that Caesar's motive was not entirely honest: after ail, he
wanted to get rid of his wife!
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: For those reasons, therefore, I suggest that
this matter should be considered by either the Banking, Trade
and Commerce Committee or the Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs. Certainly, we wish to be and appear to
be above reproach. But how far must we carry appearances?
Are we to ask the members of the committee not only not to
serve on the committee but not to advocate anything involving
financial matters in the Senate? That would mean, according
to this rule, if it is interpreted in the way it is apparently
suggested we should interpret it, that none of these members
could even speak on banking legislation. They could not even
express a view in committee, even if they did attend, because
the words "advocate, support or promote any matter" go quite
far. Indeed, the suggested interpretation of these words could
have the effect of paralyzing the Senate and possibly the
House of Commons in respect of these matters. For that
reason I suggest we should be careful.
Personally, I am willing not to-indeed, not only am I
willing but I have decided not to attend the committee. But I
believe we are depriving both the Senate and Parliament as a
whole of expert advice in these matters by interpreting the rule
in this fashion.
Senator Perrault: By that you mean the fashion suggested in
that report?
Senator Flynn: Yes, but which is the interpretation put on
the words by those members who have decided to resign-and
I am one of them. I include myself in their number and I say
that such an interpretation is a dangerous precedent. It should
be made clear that it is only to appear pure that we are doing
it, but I am not at ail sure that we are rendering great service
to the Senate or to the committee in doing so.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, perhaps I
might appropriately say a word or two at this juncture. I
should begin by saying that I am not a bank director or a
director of any trust or other financial company; but I am a
member of the local advisory board of a trust company which
does business in many places in Canada, and I am not sure
whether that puts me into the category we are discussing.
I do not intend to make any pronouncement about it today,
but I do wish to say that this whole matter was discussed in the
committee at its first meeting. The seriousness of it, I thought,
was appreciated and understood by ail members of the committee. In this respect I am not just referring to my position,
but the whole question. I was amazed when I saw this morning
that instead of continuing the discussion in the committee
where ail points of view could be put forth, those senators
involved decided to take the irrevocable course of resigning.

I should have thought that a matter of such importance,
which had already been discussed in the committee and, so far
as I understood, left for further discussion before the committee began to undertake any hearings with reference to the
proposed banking legislation, would have been dealt with by
the committee. From the point of view of those of us who were
not privy to that meeting of the group which we heard about in
the paper and which Senator Macnaughton just read about, I
am surprised that they have chosen the stated course rather
than allowing all members of the committee to be privy to the
discussion and to decide as a committee what would be the
appropriate course.
Senator Croll: Honourable senators, the result of the government leader's announcement is that I shall have to cut my
speech in half.
Senator Flynn: That was the intention.
Senator Croll: It won't hurt. As the Leader of the Government has announced, some members of the committee have
chosen to resign. That does not help the situation a great deal,
of course, because I do not know which senators have resigned,
or are planning to resign. It does not make any difference to
me who resigned. The main question, to my mind, is the
definition that was used in defining "directors."
It is my intention during the course of the debate to say a
few words about the right to set up the committee and the cost
of the committee, followed by some matters of a more or less
personal nature about which a senator has spoken to me.
Let me begin my remarks by saying that the committee was
named on October 26, which was a Tuesday, and on Wednesday, October 27, the motion in question was presented and
leave was requested by the Deputy Leader of the Government
to deal with it immediately. There was some urgency about it.
Senator Langlois: That is not so.
Senator Croli: Someone asked for leave.
Senator Langlois: The mover requested leave.
Senator Croll: I apologize. The two of you sit so close, I
thought it was you. In any event, i objected to the motion
being proceeded with at that time. When I arrived originally
that day, I had intended to speak to the cost of the committee
and with respect toSenator Molson: Which committee?
Senator Croil: The Banking, Trade and Commerce
Committee.
Senator Flynn: May I ask a question of the honourable
senator? You say that you intended to speak to the cost. Are
you now speaking on Senator Hayden's motion or on the
announcement made by the Leader of the Government? They
are two separate items.
Senator Croil: t am speaking on Senator Hayden's motion.
Senator Flynn: We have not yet reached the Orders of the
Day.

Senator Perrault: I just made a statement to the house.

SENATE DEBATES

PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA
EQUALIZATION GRANTS-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a reply to a
question posed by the Honourable Senator Smith (Colchester)
on October 13. His question was:
What arrangement did the Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources have in mind when he said, as reported in
the press, that there was an arrangement whereby Nova
Scotia would receive an additional $10 million in equalization grants this year related to assistance because of the
higher cost of fuel oil?
The honourable senator also asked:
What is that arrangement? By what amount will assistance be granted under this arrangement, and when will it
be received?
The answer to this question is that the Minister of Energy,
Mines and Resources was referring to the increase in federalprovincial equalization payments which resulted from the price
increases in respect to crude oil and natural gas produced in
Canada, as agreed to by the first ministers, effective July 1,
1976.
Because of such increases the resource income of Alberta
will be substantially enhanced and under the formula governing the calculation of equalization payments it was estimated
in mid-1976 that the resulting increase in equalization transfer
payments to Nova Scotia would be of the order of $10 million.
Thus, the minister was suggesting that such could be deemed
to offset in part the higher cost of oil used in electric power
generation. These increased costs resulted from the agreed
increase in well head price of domestically produced oil and
natural gas and the consequent reduction in the oil compensation payments made by the federal government to the oil
importing companies.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I thank
the leader for his answer. As I listened to it, it seemed to be
very complete except for one thing. Part of my question was:
When will this money be received? As I listened to the answer
I did not catch any reply to that particular point. I may have
missed it.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, in the reply provided me I do not have a notation of a date. I shall undertake
to give the date to the honourable senator personally or, if he
wishes, publicly in the chamber.

If that is not the plan and there are no changes in it, when
can the people of Canada expect to receive swine flu
immunization?
The Minister of National Health and Welfare has
announced that he has accepted in their entirety the most
recent recommendations of the National Advisory Committee
on Immunizing Agents relating to the 1976-1977 influenza
immunization program. Mr. Lalonde also made public a report
of the committee's meeting held during the week of October
24 in Ottawa.
The minister said he hopes the provincial health ministers,
to whom the recommendations have been transmitted, will
receive these favourably in order to establish a uniform national program.
* (1430)

The new recommendations are substantially the same as
those made earlier this year by the committee, with one
addition. This is a recommendation to extend the use of
bivalent A/New Jersey-A/Victoria vaccine for children suffering from chronic neuromuscular disorders, cancer and conditions reducing biological defence mechanisms. While routine
vaccination of school children is not recommended by the
committee, special formulations of the vaccine are being prepared for those under 20 years of age with specific chronic
illnesses.
The committee recommended that the vaccine be used as
supplies become available. In considering alternatives to the
recommended program, the members of the committee gave
special consideration to the question of stockpiling monovalent
A/New Jersey vaccine until further cases of swine influenza
are detected, as recommended by provincial health ministers at
their September meeting in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The
committee rejected this option on the basis that it could
preclude an effective preventative program. Delivery of the
vaccine to the provinces is expected to start within the next few
days. Indeed, it might be under way at the present time.
Senator Bell: I wonder if I could ask the Leader of the
Government a supplementary question. Could he let us know if
there have been any confirmed diagnoses of swine flu in either
Canada or the United States?
Senator Perrault: I must take that question as notice. I shall
endeavour to provide a reply as quickly as possible.
GRAIN

HEALTH
SWINE INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, Senator Bonnell
asked a question on October 28, 1976, about the intention of
the Government of Canada to scrap the large-scale swine flu
immunization program, as he alleged was reported by the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation recently. Senator Bonnell
said:

PROVISION OF RAIL CARS TO PEACE RIVER DISTRICTQUESTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I would like to ask the
government leader if he knows that there is a great amount of
grain piled up in the Peace River area of British Columbia.
The department in charge has still not provided any government-owned grain hopper cars to that area. I would ask
whether he can give this chamber a report on this urgent
matter.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Perrault: I really do not have that information on
my desk. I shall make appropriate inquiries, Senator Austin,
and provide a reply.
BANKING LEGISLATION
BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED
TO MAKE STUDY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Hayden to authorize the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce to examine and
report upon the document entitled "White Paper on the Revision of Canadian Banking Legislation, August, 1976," tabled
in the Senate on Thursday, October 21, 1976.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I shall not delay
Senator Croll's speech very long. To do so would be unfair
after what I did to him last night and today.
Senator Croll: That's right.
Senator Flynn: The only question put by Senator Hayden's
motion is whether we should refer the White Paper on the
Revision of Canadian Banking Legislation, dated August
1976, and any legislation consequent upon this white paper in
advance its reaching us in the Senate, to the Banking, Trade
and Commerce Committee. To me it is quite obvious that this
motion is a good one, and one which will serve the public.
This formula of having a Senate committec consider highly
technical problems in advance, based either on a white paper
or intended or proposed legislation, has proven its worth over
the years. You will recall, as Senator Hayden did last night,
the tax reform legislation of some years ago. At that time we
indicated to the government, in our initial report, that its
proposals were perhaps not the very best way to deal with the
problem. I think events have proven that the committee's first
report was right. Now we are stuck with this problem. When
the government has time to look into it again, it may go back
to some of the recommendations made by the committee
before the legislation reached us.
I can recall also the combines legislation, on which excellent
work was done. The department-not likely the minister,
because the minister has changed two or thrce times since
then-may have reconsidered the proposed legislation, and I
am quite sure that when the second phase comes before
Parliament consideration will have been given to the suggestions made by our committee. The same thing can be said
about the Bankruptcy Act, on which I think the committee
also did excellent work.
This is not always donc necessarily out of urgency. I agree,
however, that there is some urgency in this instance because
we have to deal with the problem before the end of June 1977
even though, as Senator Hayden indicated, if we are not ready
at that time some interim legislation could be passed. But the
problem of urgency is there, though it is not the only problem.
With the expertise we have in the Senate or that we can
gather, with the time and facilities we have for obtaining the
views of a large variety of interested parties-and I would

November 3, 1976

suggest that in respect of the Bank Act everyone has an
interest-we are in a better position than the House of Commons, or any committee of that house, to deal with this matter.
My second point is that if the Senate makes recommendations before the legislation passes the other place, it is much
casier on the pride of the House of Commons and the pride of
the Senate to have them accepted or rejected before the
legislation reaches us. That is, I think, the main reason why we
should refer this white paper, or any bill that would follow
from it, to our committee.
We have the time, the facilities and the expertise. 1 hope
that no member of this house with such expertise will be
denied the opportunity to work with the committee and express
his or her views on this legislation, which is of paramount
importance, because the proposals in the white paper may have
very serious implications.
I suggest that there would be some resistance to many of the
proposals in the white paper, and we should try to find out
whether or not this resistance is valid. We can do a good job
for the public of Canada, and we should not be afraid to do it.
Again, I hope that those who have some knowledge of this
matter will be able and willing to participate.
Hon. David A. Croli: It is all right, honourable senators; I
have finally got the floor. Before I first went to the House of
Commons I had been in the provincial legislature. I had had
some party affiliation. lan Mackenzie was the leader of the
house and Jim Sinclair was my seatmate, having got in the
house about the same time. I asked lan when I could speak,
and he said, "I will call you." I sat there for six months and
wore out two pairs of pants waiting for him to call me.
One day, at about 10 o'clock at night, somebody was
making an attack upon Mackenzie King for failing to do
something about the flag. All of a sudden a statement was
handed to me, sent over by Ian, with the message, "The Prime
Minister wants you to put this statement on the record and
make an appropriate speech." I read the statement so that at
least I would know what was in it. I then got up and made the
appropriate speech about the boys we had left overseas and the
boys we had served with. It took about five minutes. It was
actually the best speech I had ever made, as I realized when I
read it afterwards.
a (1440)

I realize that I have been almost filibustered out of my
position. However, I will tell you that there are not too many
who get a second chance, and I do much better on my second
putt than I do on my first.
I want to cover a few aspects. It is important that we
understand each other because the committee has very important work to do. The question is as to who has the right to sit
on the committee, and the cost of the committee. Then, as I
said in the earlier part, comes a matter of a more or less
personal nature, of which a senator has spoken to me and
which I will cover during the course of the debate when the
occasion arises.

November 3, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

At the moment I do not know what definition the Leader of
the Government used for the purpose of defining a director. As
I understood him, he said a director is a member of an
advisory board, a bank director, an honorary bank director, a
trust company director, an insurance company director and
anyone who in any way is connected with a financial institution in that capacity.
On Tuesday, October 26, this matter came up, and the
chairman moved that we deal with it immediately, as though
there were an urgency. I objected to that, and actually I had
come here that day for the purpose of dealing with the cost of
committees before the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, which I will deal with a little later on. I had no
intention of getting into anything more than that, because I
thought that the Leader of the Government, knowing what was
required to be done, would do it. It had been brought to his
attention that directors should not be permitted to sit on this
committee. It is his responsibility to nominate members to the
committee and decide who should and who should not be
seated on it. I said no, and when I said no I looked around and
it seemed as though I had awakened something. For a moment
all hell seemed to break loose. There are a lot of nervous
Nellies here on the front bench, chickens with their heads cut
off and palpitating politicians. I wondered what it was all
about.
Senator Flynn: You were the only one.
Senator Croll: Then I decided I should look into this matter
a little further and realized that what might have happened,
and could easily have happened, was that we would have
endorsed the resolution and mouse-trapped the Senate into
making an endorsement and saying the Senate approved of
this. Well, it did not happen that way. The resolution, of
courseSenator Flynn: Let us not deal with that.
Senator Croli: The resolution is set forth and speaks for
itself.
Senator Flynn: Do you want me to read it for you?
Senator Croll: However, rule 75(1) of the Rules of the
Senate provides as follows:
A senator who has any pecuniary interest whatsoever,
not held in common with the rest of the Canadian subjects
of the Crown, in the matter referred to any select committee, shall not sit on such committee and any question
relating thereto arising in the committee may be determined by the committee, subject to an appeal to the
Senate.
Now, it seemed to me that it was very plain as to what that
meant and what I had always intended, though it must be said
that when the Bank Act was dealt with in 1954, which I had
something to do with and shall mention a little later, there
then existed rule 84, which was the same as the presently
existing rule 75. The same rule 84 existed when we dealt with
the Bank Act in 1964 and in 1967. During those days nothing
was done to deal with the matter of representation of directors.

Well, it is ten years later today; it is a new world, a participating world, and people are involving themselves in government.
It is very much later than many senators appear to appreciate.
I have no quarrel with any of the members of the committee,
and I do not know who is withdrawing from it. The leader did
not mention that; it is a deep secret, but sooner or later it will
be out and I do not know why it is not out now.
Senator Walker: It is on the front page of the Globe and
Mail.
Senator Croll: No, I do not think so.
Senator Molson: Did you read your quotation in the newspaper this morning?
Senator Croll: Certainly I read my quotation.
Senator Molson: Well, it is there.
Senator Croll: But someone said it is not, but certainly I
said it and some names may have been left out.
Senator Flynn: Because you did not know them.
Senator Croil: Oh, I knew them. I have no quarrel with
them. They are honourable men, upright men, but the public
will not accept their sitting on a committee dealing with the
Bank Act while they are directors of these financial institutions and we, least of all, should make it possible for them to
do so. You know, less than a month ago one million people
walked the streets in protest. They said they are never consulted, but are told about things. Despite the fact that the
government consults them as often as it possibly can, they said
they never are spoken to, and they want to be part of this
business and part of the show. For heaven's sake, are only the
bank directors entitled to sit on the Banking, Trade and
Commerce Committee when it is considering such legislation
as the Bank Act, which deals with interest, mortgages, loans
and all the matters that are necessarily important to every
person in his everyday life? What about the consumer? What
about the farmer? What about all these other people?
Senator Flynn: You are there.
Senator Croll: Why is it specifically people who have all this
expertise of which my friend the Leader of the Opposition
speaks, and with which I shall also deal in a minute?
Senator Flynn: But you represent everyone on the committee, with a lot of expertise.
Senator Croll: Yes, I can well appreciate that. I was chairman of one of these committees, along with three others now
present, and I know something of what is required of that
committee, having dealt with it in difficult days. However, let
us quit fooling and leading ourselves on. If not one director has
anything to do with the Bank Act, this country will survive. It
does not make the slightest bit of difference, and it will be a lot
more credible in the sight and minds of the Canadian people if
we make sure that the interests are of a more general nature.
There is no question in my mind that every member of this
chamber is his own lawyer. It does not make any difference
whether a committee member is a director in fact, or not.

SENATE DEBATES
Under our rules he is prohibited from sitting. Moreover, his
sitting is morally unacceptable.

e

I appreciate very much the Leader of the Government's
telling us about the secret group of people who are no longer
members of the committee. I do not know why their names
were not presented to us. He said they had resigned and would
be replaced. That is up to him.
Senator Flynn: That is not up to him.

There were no experts hired. The expertise came from the
members of the committee. You hired expertise, but we did
not. Not a man was bired wbo was not already connected with
the Committee.
Senator Flynn: You do not suggest that you hired incompetent people?
Senator Croil: No. 1 am suggesting that we hired people to
do a job, and they did it. We did not go out and hire people at
$300 and $400 a day to give us an opinion.
Senator Flynn: How much did you pay them?
Senator Croit: You bad the accounts before you, and you
received better value than ever before in all the years you have
been in the Senate.
Senator Watker: Tell us what it was.
Senator Croi: 1 do flot remember wbat it was. You had the
accounts before you. You approved the expenditure, and
tbougbt it was very moderate.
Senator Côté: How many years did it take you to spend the
$350,000?
Senator Croit: From 1970 to 1975 or 1976. I think it was a
five-year period.
Senator Watker: That makes a difference.
Senator Croît: The point 1 was makingSenator Watker: What point were you making? 1 would like
you to make one point today.
Senator Croît: 1 am really not trying to make the point for
you; 1 am trying to make it for the public. The point 1 am
making is that the committee at that time relied upon the

members of the committee to do the work themselves. They
did not go out hiring people at a cost of $350,000.
It is alI very easy for people to talk. I have here the House of
Commons committee's report of 1954. Senator Benidickson
was a member of the committee, as was Senator McIlraitb and
Senator Macnaugbton. 1 was chairman of the committee. 1
had been chairman of the committee on war expendîtures, and
had just finished wben the Bank Act came up. The 1944 Bank
Act had been a bit of a shemozzle because we were in tbe
midst of Social Credit dreams, and Gerry McGeer, Tucker
and somebody else from tbe Social Credit Party-I cannet
remember his name-pretty well imposed themselves on the
committee. Tbey were anxious to have as good a committee as
possible for the next session. They asked me if I would chair it.
I did not want to, but 1 finally agreed. The condition was a
very simple one; it was that if we were able to bring in a
resolution to have the baniks go into consumer boans and
mortgages the goverfiment would adopt it. We did that. But
we did not spend one nickel on expertise during the entire
length of that hearing, and 1 would add that it took a long
time. If we needed some hetp, we went over to the department
and got it.

The remarkable part about it, bonourabte senators, is that
we hire people at $300 or $400 a day to work on these
committees and to give us opinions-and tbey are competent
enough people-but the people who sit in judgment on what
they do are sitting in our departments and are available to us
for nothing; we can bave them simply for the asking. And that
bas been done time and again by committees which are trying
to save some money and, at the same time, trying to provîde a
service to tbeir members. Tbe only way by whicb a committee
can accomplish anything, and produce a report that is worth
something, is to bave its members do tbeir own work on it; not
by using surrogates, because anybody can do it that way. AlI
you need is some money-and the goverfiment sometimes
appears to bave a lot of it.
And so, honourable senators, as I bave indicated, it is my
view that no one who is a member of any of these boards-and
I defy tbem to do so-can sit on this committee. They should
not try to sit on the committee directly or indirectly, because
to do so would be to pervert the intention of the committee.
Moreover, the expenditure of $350,000 is unforgivable in tbe
circumstances, and wben the necessary belp is availabte bere
and sbould be taken advantage of.
Senator Watker: Wbat help is available here? And wben
you are dealing witb bundreds of millions of dollars, do you
tbink tbat the expenditure of $350,000 over a period of five
years is excessive?
Senator Croi: Tbe expenditure of one dollar is excessive if
we can get what we need for nothing.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Quite frequently wbat you get
for notbing is worth just that-notbing.
Senator Croit: Tbat is not always so. The goverfiment
departments are available to us, and their top men are the best

SENATE DEBATES
in the country. I have seen the top men in this government, and
they are extremely competent, particularly in the financial
field. They are able to hold their own with anyone, and they
are there and they are available to us.
Senator Smith (Colchester): They were not able to hold
their own during the study of the bankruptcy legislation.
Senator Croll: Well, I was not there for the study of
bankruptcy, so I cannot tell you about that. But I was present
at a great number of meetings of other committees, and I saw
them in action. I have known them over a great number of
years.
Senator Walker: And you had no objection at that time
until you were thrown off the committee.
Senator Croli: I am sorry; I did not hear what you said.
Senator Walker: And you had no objection until you were
removed-perhaps that is a little more polite-from the
committee.
Senator Croli: I was off the committee long before 1970,
and before 1970 the committee never spent a dime on these
experts. It only got these ideas afterwards. I don't know
whether you gave them to the committee or not, but it
certainly used not to have them.
Senator Walker: I was on the committee in 1963, and I have
watched you operating for a long time.
Senator Croil: Well, then, you should have learned something from watching. It would have done you a world of good.
Senator Walker: When are you going to tell us something?
Senator Croll: I am not going to waste time by trying to tell
you anything. I can tell you that now. But I have made it plain
to the Senate that the matter of senators holding directorships
sitting on a committee as important as the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce when it is
dealing with revisions to the Bank Act is of national importance, and to deny that, even in a small way, would be a
dreadful mistake.
We have the expertise, honourable senators, and we ought to
use it. We ought not to have other people provide the expertise,
and what expertise we do not have in our own committee we
can find in the government departments. That is what we are
here for. While I think that we ought to do the study being
suggested at the present time, if we do not live up to the full
letter of the law and if we incur any more of these expenses we
will be doing something that will not soon be forgotten by the
people of Canada, who are commencing to watch our costs.
My purpose in rising was to say just that, and that is all I have
to say for the moment.
Hon. Hartland de M. Molson: Honourable senators, I feel,
since my name is one of those mentioned in connection with
the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, that I should
say a few words.
In the first place may I say that I welcome the statement
made by the Leader of the Government. I think that the
statement he made here today and the statement quoted in the

November 3, 1976

newspapers as having been made yesterday are very fair and
present the picture clearly. Yesterday, as it happens, I was
telephoned by the reporter writing on this matter and asked if
I was going to resign from the committee. I replied that I did
not yet know. The young lady asked, "Well, what options have
you?" "Well," I said, "not many, but I think I have two-one
is to resign and the other is not to resign." She asked me,
"When are you going to make up your mind?" And I said,
"Well, quite honestly, I don't know, but it might be within a
very short time; it might be this evening but I can't set a time
on when I might make up my mind." I added, "As a matter of
fact, in common with the others involved-and I am not alone
in this-we have talked about the problem and there are a
certain number of points of view attached to it."
I was thinking, when I was speaking, that our rule is quite
clear in that it states that any senator "who has any pecuniary
interest whatsoever, not held in common .. . shall not sit on

such committee." But when I think of the Bank Act and
banking in Canada and the size of the banks, and when I think
of the trust companies in Canada and the size of the many
trust companies, and when I think of the caisses populaires and
the size of the caisses populaires and credit unions, and when I
think of the pecuniary interest that I or one of my colleagues
here might have in something done to change the Bank Act, I
find that this is carrying it just a little bit far. It occurs to me
that the possibility of either pecuniary benefit or pecuniary
damage is fairly remote.
* (1510)

However, in looking at that article I notice that it says,
"Senator Croll hinted that the decision had been slow in
coming and had been prompted more by pressure from him
and Senator Charles McElman." I spoke to Senator McElman
this morning, and he agreed that he had not exerted any
pressure on me at all. That was certainly my view of the
matter. Senator Croll did not say anything to me. He did not
mention the subject to me. But I hope that this article is not
accurate.
Senator Croll: I did not say that I had exerted any pressure
on you. The article is there. It speaks for itself. I didn't say I
had exerted any pressure on you. You have the article. Read it.
Senator Molson: Are you asking me a question orSenator Croll: No, I am telling you. I have read the article.
Senator Molson: Then sit down until I am finished.
Senator Croli: Well, I think you ought to be correct.
Senator Molson: Just have some manners.
Senator Walker: That is too much to expect.
Senator Croll: You ought to be correct.
Senator Molson: Thank you. I will be, and you can ask me a
question, if you wish. But the rules are made for you as well as
for the rest of us.
Senator Croll: You ought to know that.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Molson: Well, 1 do know it, and 1 arn pointing it out
to you.
I find it very bard to believe that Senator Croîl would really
have made that sort of staternent-that my decision had been
prornpted by pressure frorn hlm and Senator McElman. Senator Croll and 1 took the Oath in this chamber on tbe saine day
many years ago, and I have known bim ever since. I do flot
always agree with birn, but I have neyer accused bim of bad
taste and 1 do flot tbink hie would like to suggest, as is written
in this article, that rny decision was slow in coming and that it
was prompted by pressure from him or frorn anybody else.
Senator Walker: Hear, bear.
Senator Molson: This is a matter of my own pride, my own
self-respect, and I ar n ot prepared to corne in bere and have
anybody, any more in this chamber than outside, cast any sort
of aspersion on my integrity.
Having said ail that, I should just like to add that 1 admit
very freely that public opinion bas cbanged enormously since
Senator Croîl sat on the Banking and Commerce Committee
in 1967, when hie was a rnernber of a trust cornpany board and
when I was a director of a bank. 1 tbink today tbe question of
who sits on this comrnittee is a simple one, namely: Wbat is
best for the public, tbe people of Canada, and wbat is best for
the Senate, the good name of the Senate and the work of the
Senate? Under today's circumstances there is little doubt that,
as a result of tbe enorrnous disappointrnents wbich people all
over the world have suffered from some in public life wbo bave
shown that tbeir integrity was questionable and, in some cases,
that tbey were downright crirninal, it bebooves us tu do
whatever we can do to rnake tbe work of tbe Senate and tbat
of any of its committees as clear as possible.
If I rnay say so, I arn a littie concerned at tbe trend of tbe
popular view of conflict of interest, because I tbink it is going a
little too far. In looking at our various committees 1 arn really
concerned about wbo should sit on any of them. I have a
valued colleague, whorn 1 respect, wbo is the cbairman of tbe
Standing Senate Comrnittee on Agriculture. He is a fariner.
There is no doubt in rny mmnd that, in some way at least, bie
has a conflict of interest on occasion, but I do not say that hie
should not serve on the Agriculture Committee. I wonder
whether medical people sbould sit on rnatters of bealtb. 1
wonder if lawyers sbould take part in debates on capital
punishrnent. Do tbey want to bave their clients alive or do they
want tbern dead? It is a fact that tbere is a conflict of interest.
An Hon. Senator: It depends on wbetber tbey can pay.
Senator Molson: Well, I tbink that is true, but we sbould
consider it after the debt is paid.
This is a problern, and it worries rne a bit. One of our
colleagues said to me today, "I bave 200 shares of CPR and 1
arn sitting on the Transport and Communications Committee." Well, you could say be bas an interest that is not beld by
everybody, but 1 do not tbink bie will gain control of the CPR
or affect its policy witb respect to the number of rail lines it
will abandon on the prairies, nor do 1 tbink he will deal witb
the Crowsnest Pass grain rates. Again we corne to this ques-

80003-9/2

tion: Wbat is a conflict of interest? In fact, so far as transportation and communications are concernied, any one who is
interested in a railway, an air line, a stearnsbip line, a trucking
company, a telephone company, a radio station, a cable
system, an oil cornpany or a pipeline cornpany sbould really
cons ider tbat be bas some conflict of interest-and perbaps hie
does.
All I arn really saying is tbat I think we are dealing properly
with the matter wbich is most immediate, wbicb is tbe Banking, Trade and Commerce Cornrittee's study of the white
paper. In rny opinion wbat is being donc is the right tbing, and
it is being donc for the rigbt reasons. But I suggest that we
sbould consider all matters rnost carefully, and make sure tbat
there is a real conflict of interest and not just a superficial one
before we suggest that a senator sbould -resign from any
committee.
Hon. J. J. Greene: Honourable senators, 1 risc to support
the motion and to commend those senators wbo, in the best
interests of tbe Senate and tbe country, bave seen it to resign
from the cornrittee for the tirne being. 1 arn sure their
motivation was that the Senate sbould appear in the eyes of
tbe public to do wbat is rigbt and best for the country.
1 bave sornewbat tbe saine concern as that voiced by Senator
Molson. I wondered for a wbile whetber I bad tarried bere too
long, or wbetber the bardening of my arteries bad gone to my
bead, when I found myseîf having some doubts about Senator
Croll's views, witb whicb I arn normally in hardy and wholesorne accord, and wben 1 found rnyself beeding for once the
tocsin sounded by the Leader of the Opposition who so seldom
sounds views witb wbicb I can find accord. If I understood bim
correctly-and I tbink hie was followed by Senator Molsontbe wbole strength of this place, as we have heard time and
again, is the expertise of the very people we find to accept
appointrnents to the Senate. Sorne corne from the professions,
some frorn the labour ranks, and some from agriculture. But in
those very fields in wbicb tbey bave special expertise I would
find it ratber ironic if, in the interests of rnaking Caesar's wife
appear dlean-to use the figure of speech of my honourable
friend the Leader of the Opposition-we made it sucb that
only a political, econornic, and social eunucb could be Caesar's
wife. 1 do not tbink that eitber Caesar or the country would be
well served if that were the result of tbe precedent we have set
here today.
( 1520)

Let us be sure, wbile we concur in the correct gesture on the
part of those senators who bave disqualified tbernselves for
purposes of this particular study-tbe Bank Act being sucb a
sensitive subject, and there being so little understanding
arnong the public as to integrity-that we have not opened up
a Pandora's box which will make it impossible in the future to
use the very expertise wbicb so many bonourable senators bave
to contribute to our deliberations in the sacred name of
conflict of interest, a subject so little understood.
To my mmnd, disclosure is the important thing. Once there is
disclosure, then our peers in the Senate or on its committees,
and, tbrough tbemn, the public, if you like, can judge whetber

SENATE DEBATES
we have abused our positions or not. But to disenfranchise the
very talents that so many have to contribute to our deliberations in the narne of conflict of interest, I suggest, would be a
great disservice to the country and to the Senate.
Hon. Frederick William Rowe: Honourable senators, I had
not intended to speak during the debate on this particular
motion, but I am prompted to by the remarks made by Senator
Molson and now substantiated by Senator Greene. If I am
permitted to say it, Senator Greene seems to have his metaphors somewhat mixed up in referring to Caesar's wife on the
one hand, and to some other specimen on the other.
The question that was in my mind as I listened to Senator
Molson and Senator Greene, as well as Senator Croll, is how
far we should extend the principle of conflict of interest. I have
the utmost belief in the sincerity of Senator Croll's position. In
fact, I subscribe to the general principle he has enunciated.
Speaking personally, I am not a businessman, I am not a
director of a company, and I am not a member of the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee. This question, however, it
seems to me, could affect every senator, or certainly a large
number. If we were to extend the principle of conflict of
interest to its logical absurdity, as Senator Molson has pointed
out, we could find ourselves in a very serious situation. If, for
example, an honourable senator has an investment, big or
small, in a trust company-and the average professional man
in Canada does have an investment in a trust company-he
stands to benefit by anything that is done to favour trust
companies generally, and stands to lose if some measure is
enacted whereby the trust company, instead of paying him
10½ per cent on his investment, will in the future pay him only
9 per cent-and such measures are taken from time to time. In
that instance, the senator is neither a director nor an officer of
the company; he merely has an investment in it. Does he at
that point find himself in a conflict of interest situation or, to
put it more simply, could he sit as a member of the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee and consider measures and
make recommendations which might very well change, for
example, the rate of interest which that particular trust company is paying to its investors? If so, is the senator in question
faced with a conflict of interest situation? It seems to me that,
as other honourable senators have pointed out, we are in
danger of making our rules completely absurd.
I do not know what the answer is. If an honourable senator
has an investment, whatever be its magnitude, in a trust
company, how should he approach his position vis-à-vis sitting,
for example, on the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee when that committee is considering legislation which might
affect that investment? I do not know the answer. I am not
putting the question as a rhetorical one. I wish someone would
provide me with the answer.
Hon. George van Roggen: Honourable senators, like Senator
Rowe I did not come prepared to speak on this motion today.
However, I feel I must rise to support the excellent points
made, in the first instance, by the Leader of the Opposition
and subsequently by several other senators.

November 3, 1976

One of the unfortunate things, it seems to me, is the rather
dismal mystique which, fostered by the press, has developed
relative to directorships. People seize on a man who is a
director of some entity as being quite different from a man
who owns something or who acts in a legal capacity for some
entity. There could very well be much less of a conflict of
interest in being a director of a company than in being a large
shareholder of that company. A director may have a nominal
shareholding only and be asked to serve on the board of
directors simply for the expertise he can bring to the corporation in question-the same expertise that he might bring to
this chamber. We must be very careful not to come to the
ridiculous position that we must ail resign from the human
race in order to serve in this chamber.
As an example, just imagine the theoretical conflicts of
interest one could dream up in respect of any member of this
chamber who is a partner in a law firm employing 20 or 30
lawyers. Being a partner, he is considered to share in any
benefit which accrues to the law firm. There is no question
that one could extend this type of thinking to the point of
absurdity, thereby destroying the effectiveness of this chamber
entirely.
In this particular case, I know that the directorships are of a
higher profile than are other examples that could be cited, but
in reality are they, or is this a figment of the imagination of
the press? I think we should be very careful to take the time
and the pains, through the media, to point out to the public
what is the real situation insofar as conflict of interest relative
to directors, shareholders and people in other walks of life is
concerned. Senator Molson gave the example of a farmer
serving on the Agriculture Committee, and so on. We have to
make sure the public understands that you simply cannot
resign from the human race just because you accept an
appointment to the Senate. In doing so, you would destroy
your worth to the Senate and to the country.
There is one further matter I should like to touch on while I
am on my feet, that being the criticism of Senator Croll to a
committee's retaining outside expert advice, his suggestion
being that you should simply go to the department concerned
for the necessary expertise. Speaking as the chairman of a
Senate committee, it is the departmental officiais who draft
the proposed legislation which our committees are asked to
critically examine. They do not come before our committees to
examine the legislation; they come to defend it. There is no
question that there is a need for a certain amount of expert
advice from outside if we are to do an adequate job of
critically analysing proposed legislation. Because the legislation is proposed and drafted by the departments concerned,
those sane departments, by definition, cannot be critical of the
legislation.
Senator Molson: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Is he suggesting that a lawyer who is retained as counsel
by any type of financial institution should be disqualified from
any study on the revision of the Bank Act?

(t530)

Senator van Roggen: I was not suggesting that he should be
disqualified. I was suggesting that the type of example that we
are having set before us here could lead to such an absurdity.

Senator Molson: Thank you.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I have had
some difficulty this afternoon in relating the subject matters
that have been discussed to the subject matter of the motion
which I moved last night. However, I suppose in some strange,
devious way one might come to a conclusion that would justify
what has been said. I am therefore going to devote myself at
this time to dealing with the things that were said, whether or
-notthey are entirely, closely, or distantly related to the subject
matter of my motion.
First, may I deal with the question of disbursements by the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, and by the Special Senate Committee on Poverty in
Canada? I obtained these figures from Mr. Dean's office. I
was supplied with a breakdown of the $350,000 that Senator
Croll spoke about. I find that in that breakdown, for professional and special services, we spent $207,000. A great part of
what we spent-namely, $350,000 in all-amounting to over
$100,000, was charged to our committee by the Printing
Bureau, on the theory that they do the work and, although it is
another so-called branch of government, we should take money
out of one pocket and put it into another. In other words, we
should take it out of government funds that are allocated to
the Senate for its own purposes, and put them into the funds
and earnings of the Printing Bureau. I am not quarrelling with
or objecting to that. What we have done as a result of this type
of expense, which ran to over $100,000, as I said, in this case,
is that we do not now make a practice of printing many of the
briefs that are filed. In the beginning, when we were not aware
of what we were being charged for this service, we printed the
briefs because it was suggested that we should, and because it
is a convenient way of dealing with and having in one place all
the representations that are made. But we do not print them
all now; in fact, we print very few, and in some cases we may
only print excerpts from them. The $350,000 is divided among
these items: transportation and communications, information
and printing, professional services and other expenditures.
When I look at the statement of expenditures which has
been furnished to me for the Special Senate Committee on
Poverty in Canada, I have difficulty in adjusting it to the
statement made by Senator Croll that no expertise was
employed by that committee, because these are the items:
transportation and communications; information and printing,
which for him was a very substantial item, $336,000; professional and special services, $324,000; and other expenditures,
$15,000 or $16,000, for a grand total of $769,766.
I did not arrange for or dig out these figures myself. I asked
Mr. Dean's office to provide them for me, and they have done
so. I am not in position to question them or otherwise, but I do
find a considerable gap between the figures for professional
and special services in the detail furnished me by Mr. Dean's
office, and the statement that Senator Croll made here today,

that they employed no expertise, unless "professional and
special services" includes things other than what people would
supply and that would normally be called expertise. I am
assuming that "expertise" means that it is professional in its
nature.
The next thing, which does perhaps tend to be a little in the
direction of being some distance away from the subject matter
of my motion, is that in 1967 the Bank Act was referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce after second reading. The Bank Act passed in that year
became effective in 1968. We had a meeting of the committee
on March 22, 1967, and this was at a time when Senator Croll
was a member of the committee. He was present during the
meeting, which went on for part of the morning and the
afternoon. No objection was made in relation to bank directors
or directors of trust companies who were then members of the
committee-and there were some in those days, including even
the chairman of the committee, who for some time now has
been a statutory casualty.

Senator Walker: That is not Senator Croll; that is you.
Senator Hayden: The chairman had reached an age where
he was no longer eligible to be nominated as a director,
although from the way I feel I am glad to say I have, myself,
no noticeable physical reaction that would suggest to me that
there has been any deterioration-but then, your friends are
the last people to tell you.
From this report, however, it is plain that Senator Croll took
an active part in the discussion that went on, and I can say this
because I have read all through it. There were quite a number
of amendments proposed, some of them by people who were
then bank directors. The amendments were voted on, and I
know that the first amendment ended in a vote of eight to
eight. I therefore declared the motion lost. One of the senators
asked me if I had voted, and I said I had not. I had given
warning of this in an announcement I had made at the
beginning of the meeting, and before we began to hear evidence, which was to the effect that in view of the discussions
going on in the newspapers at that time, and due to the fact
that I was a bank director, I was not going to vote. I therefore
did not vote, and the motion was lost.
Senator Croll tried three or four times, before he was finally
successful, to move that the bill be reported without amendment. Finally, when the committee had got rid of all the
amendments by voting them down, Senator Croll again put his
motion to report the bill without amendment. This was carried,
and we so reported the bill. There was no question raised at
that time about rule 75 or the earlier rule 84, as I believe it to
be.
We, of course, have to concede that as people mature some
of them acquire more wisdom, and some do not, but this was
an excellent opportunity for Senator Croll, in view of the
familiarity that he had with the provisions of the Bank Act,
since he had not only presided over the deliberations of a
committee of the House of Commons in or about 1954, when
the Bank Act was being studied in that place, but was a

SENATE DEBATES

November 3, 1976

member of the committee also. He certainly attended this
meeting, and put questions, and Senator Roebuck was there
and put questions; but there was never any suggestion that
bank directors who were members of the committee should not
participate in the discussion and should not vote.
We therefore come down to the present moment. We are
now told that the modern world has moved along, that there
has come about a great maturity in thinking, and that now you
must not only not offend, but you must not even give the
appearance of offending.

Such privileges, immunities and powers are part of the
general and public law of Canada, and it is not necessary
to plead the same, but the same shall, in all courts in
Canada, and by and before, all judges, be taken notice of
judicially.
Now that is your base. Then you look for a statement by
Erskine May. This is what May has to say in his Eighteenth
Practice, dealing with the practice in
Edition of Parliamentary
the British House of Commons:

e

In the Commons it is a rule that no Member who has a
direct pecuniary interest in a question shall be allowed to
vote upon it: but, in order to operate as a disqualification,
this interest must be immediate and personal, and not
merely of a general or remote character. On 17th July
1811, the rule was thus explained by Mr. Speaker Abbott:
"This interest must be a direct pecuniary interest, and
separately belonging to the persons whose votes were
questioned, and not in common with the rest of His
Majesty's subjects, or on a matter of state policy." This
opinion was given upon a motion for disallowing the votes
of the bank directors upon the Gold Coin Bill, which was
afterwards negatived without division.
We also have this statement by May, that if a member of
the Commons in England has, or could be said to have, a
pecuniary interest it does not inhibit or prevent him from
voting on a matter of public policy or on a public bill.
There are many such references and I am not going to
weary you with them all, but I should tell you that where such
rulings have been given it has been in the consideration of such
cases as this one. For instance, with respect to the owners of
land in Ireland, there was a ruling negativing an attempt to
disqualify a vote on a clause providing for payment out of
public money of the landlord's share of rates in the Local
Government (Ireland) Bill.
There was another instance concerning members who were
landowners or farmers voting on the Corn Production Bill, and
another concerning members having an interest in advertising
and the manufacturing of wireless apparatus, on a motion to
approve the government's policy on television advertisements,
and that motion to disqualify failed. Bourinot has this to say
on the matter:
The Canadian Commons have among their rules the
following:
22. "No member is entitled to vote upon any question
in which he has a direct pecuniary interest, and the vote
of any member so interested will be disallowed." Senate
rule 53As it was at that time.
-is to the same effect.
The interest must be of a direct character, as it was
well explained on one occasion, in a decision by Mr.
Speaker Wallbridge, in the legislative assembly of
Canada.

(1540)

I am out of that category, and have been for five, six or
seven years. I do not have to speak on behalf of myself, but
when Senator Croll said that he knew the meaning of rule 75,
I accepted that statement as being a statement based on his
legal understanding and interpretation of rule 75. But I do
claim to have some legal knowledge, acquired over a long
period of time, and some experience in legal matters and in
matters of interpretation. I disagree completely with his view.
Fortunately, on this issue I have on my side three authors who
are recognized experts in this field-so much so that the
British House of Commons relies on one of them, and the
Canadian Senate and House of Commons rely on the other
two. Those three are May's ParliamentaryPractice, the Eighteenth Edition, where in Chapter XVIII the author deals with
the subject matter of personal pecuniary interest; Bourinotand all I have to do is mention the name and you identify it
right away with a thorough knowledge and understanding of
parliamentary practice-the publication of 1916 on public
policy and on Speaker's rules; and the real bible of the House
of Commons, Beauchesne's ParliamentaryRules and Forms,
Fourth Edition, 1958, and particularly page 54. Having given
those references, I say it is like producing decided cases in
support of an argument you are making in court. These are my
decided cases that support my thinking on the interpretation of
rule 75.
May I take you back for one minute to the Senate and the
House of Commons Act, Section 4 of which provides:
The Senate and the House of Commons respectively,
and the members thereof respectively, hold, enjoy and
exercise,
(a) such and the like privileges, immunities and powers
as, at the time of the passing of the British North
America Act, 1867, were held, enjoyed and exercised
by the Commons House of Parliament of the United
Kingdom, and by the members thereof, so far as the
same are consistent with and not repugnant to that Act;
and
(b) such privileges, immunities and powers as are from
time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of
Canada, not exceeding those at the time of the passing
of such Act held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and
by the members thereof respectively.
Section 5 goes on to say:

SENATE DEBA TES

SENATE DEBATES

That was in 1865.
A division having taken place upon a bill respecting
permanent building societies in Upper Canada (which had
been introduced by Mr. Street), Mr. Scatcherd raised the
point of order, that, under the rule of the house, the
former had a direct pecuniary interest in the bill, and
could not consequently vote for the same. The Speaker
said-"The interest which disqualifies must be a direct
pecuniary interest, separately belonging to the person
whose vote is questioned, and not in common with the rest
of Her Majesty's subjects, and that, in his opinion, as the
bill relates to building societies in general, the member for
Welland is not precluded from voting.
There are many other references. Again the material is
available to any person who wants to read it. I do not want to
weary you with all the quotations, except this one from
Bourinot:
It was not until 1894, when the rules were revised, that
the Senate adopted the Canadian and English resolution
governing such matters, but previously the practice was
the same in both houses. When the bill is of a public
nature, a member of the Senate may properly vote if he
wishes to do so.
In the Fourth Edition of Beauchesne's ParliamentaryRules
and Forms, which is really the House of Commons bible, there
is this:
The interest which disqualifies a member from voting
in the House must be immediate and personal, separately
belonging to the person whose vote is questioned ... The
votes of members on questions of public policy are
allowed to pass unchallenged. Public bills are frequently
passed relative to railways, building societies, insurance
companies and salaries to ministers.
I can say as well that in the British House of Commons, in the
case of interests in breweries, banks and so on, the decisions
have all been to the same effect, that the motion to disqualify a
member from voting has been negatived.
You will notice the language I use, because while the rule
applying to the house would also apply to the operation of a
committee, the form of the motion is to disqualify a member
from voting, or if he has voted to disqualify him and withdraw
or cancel the vote. There is, therefore, a well-defined procedure for interpretation of this rule. The language of our rule
75 is very unfortunate, as I have suggested to the master of our
rules, Senator Molson. It says:
A senator who has any pecuniary interest whatsoever,
not held in common with the rest of the Canadian subjects
of the CrownThat, of course, is antiquated language.
-in the matter referred to any select committeeA select committee includes a standing committee.
-shall not sit on such committee.
The effect of not sitting on such committee is not voting.

135

135

However, if you read rule 72, any senator may attend any
committee meeting of any committee of the Senate and may
take part and participate in the proceedings; the only thing he
cannot do is vote.
When the conclusion is drawn that if a bank director, a trust
company director, and so on, sits on the Senate Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee he is doing something illegal, I say it is just utter nonsense to make a statement of that
kind. It is perfectly legal and valid, and is supported by all the
references, even basically by the Senate and House of Commons Act itself, which gives to senators and members of the
House of Commons in Canada privileges and immunities
enjoyed by the members of the House of Commons in England
at the time of the passage of the B.N.A. Act. The only way in
which it is cut down is if there has been any subsequent
legislation in Canada which abrogates or shades, a little or a
lot, the function of senators and members of the House of
Commons and their ability to vote.
I think that pecuniary interest, in view of the rulings I have
referred to, should be related to, or is almost synonymous with,
conflict of interest. That is, the nature of the conflict of
interest would have to be of a pecuniary nature.
*

(1600)

Now, what else could there be? The Banking, Trade and
Commerce Committee consists of 20 members, and it would
appear that there may be four or five who are at this time
bank directors, and there may be one or two who are trust
company directors. To suggest that they by virtue of that have
the ability and the power to influence the direction and the
consideration of any matter relating to the Bank Act, or
legislation of that nature, is, I say again, just utter nonsense.
Business does not go along that way, nor do people of that
standing and character. Then it must be attributed to the other
members of the committee, who do not have that expertise,
that they have no intelligence and cannot appreciate that a job
is being done on them to influence their thinking in the
direction others desire it to go.
In my opinion these are completely irrational assumptions,
the same as it is a completely irrational assumption to propose
that rule 75 precludes, as a matter of law, directors of banks,
trust companies or other financial institutions from being
entitled to attend meetings of a committee of which they are
members and take part in those meetings. My thought on it
when we were discussing this matter in committee was that the
senators who were in that position might declare that they
would not sit as members of the committee. That would mean
immediately that they would not and could not vote, but there
is nothing to prevent them, even if they had reasoned or taken
this course of action, from attending the committee meetings.
Our rules provide that they can attend the meetings and
participate in all the discussions, but cannot vote. The crucial
point is, as you will notice from the references I have made to
May, Bourinot and Beauchesne, the matter of their vote. That
is the way in which they express their support for one side or
the other of an issue. If they attend as senators, and do not sit
as members of the committee, they cannot vote. They have

SENA TE DEBA TES
been stultified to that extent and the purpose that they cannot
exercise that very important right of voting has been
accomplished.
Therefore, I say that it is unfortunate that the tendency
today in the mind of the public, which has been fostered to a
great extent by the press and such statements as, for instance,
Senator Croll has made here today, is to cast some doubt on
the integrity and credibility of members of the Senate.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Hayden: I can tell you from personal experience
that when I was a bank director the views of the individual
directors were expressed strongly and firmly. They were
sought by the management and were given very strongly and
firmly, with great independence, I would say, with regard to
the requirements of the public interest, and what those particular directors felt should be done in the public interest. So I
refuse to accept the statement that bank directors are a special
class of people, and one so much lower in the category of
human beings that they are not fit to be members of a
committee that may be dealing with a bank act. Suddenly they
have been transformed, from being professional or financial
men, and therefore very acceptable as members of the committee to take part in the discussions, by the fact of becoming
directors, and the committee is deprived of much of the
contribution that they might otherwise have made to the
problems that will come before it. I know that in my case, at
least, when I was appointed to the Senate I was not asked-the
answer would have been no, anyway-whether I was a director
of a bank. The answer would have been no, and it was not until
many years later that I became a director and, as I say, for
some years now I have not been a director.
I like to feel that throughout the whole period that I have
been chairman of this committee I have proceeded at all times
in the public interest. Certainly during the period when Senator Croll was a member of the committee I could rest assured
that if he felt we were not doing that he would be raising
issues. I have skimmed through Hansard-nota deeply-scaled
reading of every word, but I have skimmed through it-of
those days and I do not find any objections to the course of
action of the chairman until 1971, and that is another story
which we need not go into today. However, these are reasons
which impel me to regret that we have had to thrash this issue
out in public, and I am sorry to see these members who are
bank directors or trust company directors take this step of
resigning from the committee. Their membership in the committee was of great value, and it extended over a long period of
time for most of them and they had acquired an expertise, a
facility for dealing with legislation, that will certainly be
missed. I only hope that they will find themselves able to
proceed under rule 72 and attend the meetings, giving the
benefit of their experience, knowledge and expertise-call it
that, if you like-to the committee, even though they will not
have the right to vote.

November 3, 1976

Therefore, in my opinion, the important thing now is to get
this matter before the committee, because we have a great deal
of work to do.
Motion agreed to.
MANPOWER AND IMMIGRATION
REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE ON MANPOWER
DIVISION-DEBATE CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, October 27, the
debate on the inquiry of Senator Everett calling the attention
of the Senate to the Report of the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance, appointed in the last session of Parliament and authorized in that session to examine in detail and
report upon the Estimates of the Manpower Division of the
Department of Manpower and Immigration for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1975, and tabled in the Senate on Tuesday,
October 19, 1976.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, the subject
under debate is the report of the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance on its inquiry into the operations of the
Manpower Division, and before continuing further I should
like to congratulate Senator Everett on the lucid and masterful
presentation he gave when he opened this debate as recorded
on pages 44 to 48 of Hansardof October 20.
I should like also to compliment Senator Everett on the very
efficient manner in which he conducted the work of the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance, and presided over its sittings during this inquiry. It has been a great
pleasure, as well as an honour, to serve on this committee
under his chairmanship.
a (1610)

The report was covered so thoroughly by Senator Everett in
his opening speech, to which I have already referred, and again
by Senator Sparrow in his excellent presentation last Wednesday, that, bearing in mind the tradition which exists in this
chamber to avoid repetition, there is little that can usefully be
added to what has already been said. I propose, therefore, to
elaborate a little more fully on some of the points to which
those honourable senators have already referred.
In considering a report of this nature, it is wise to distinguish between the formulation of policy, which is the responsibility of the cabinet as a whole, and the implementation of
policy, which is the responsibility of a single minister and the
department which he heads.
In a country like Canada, with its vast areas and diversity of
regions and resources, it is inevitable that ad hoc responses be
made to situations as they arise. As experience proves some
responses to be good and others bad, that some methods and
practices will work and others will not, in time decisions by the
government based on successful pragmatic solutions become
integrated into policy and assigned to a particular department
for implementation.
In 1966, when the Department of Manpower was created,
the main emphasis was on the need to help unemployed

November 3, 1976

November 3, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

workers find jobs, and the whole departmental apparatus of
registration, counselling, placement and training was geared to
this end in accordance with the concept of a national employment service. The success of the department was judged
largely by the number and quality of the placements made.
However, when we come to inquire into the validity of the
placement yardstick, we immediately encounter a problem
because of the definition of placement used by the department,
and the difficulty of distinguishing between permanent and
casual placements.
Under the definition used by the department, a placement is
one person placed in one job for a period of one week. Thus the
same person placed in three successive jobs of a week's duration would count as three placements, while three different
people placed in the same job successively one after the other
for three weeks would also count as three placements. On the
other hand, a person placed in a job, and who stays there
longer than one week, can be considered as a permanent
placement. While these periods are too short to be meaningful,
so far as statistical data is concerned, there is really no
consensus as to what constitutes a permanent placement.
It was explained to the committee that the definition used
by the department follows the common usage in other countries. The United States employment service uses a three-day
criterion for casual placements; the United Kingdom and
France make no distinction between casual and permanent
placements, and Sweden keeps no placement statistics at all.
Evidence before the committee indicated that prior to 1972
the placement function was regarded as the main reason for
the department's existence, and this was shared not only by
employers and job seekers but also by officials of the department. The main confusion arose as to whether the department
existed to serve employers who had job vacancies, or unemployed workers looking for jobs. Obviously, departmental officials tried to do both as best they could, but there was
considerable disagreement as to where the emphasis was being
placed, and most of the complaints that were received by the
committee related to this period and to this particular situation. Since, as Senator Everett pointed out in his opening
speech, placement is still a major function of the department,
it will be necessary to work out more precise and more realistic
definitions of placement before the efficiency of the placement
service can be evaluated in meaningful terms.
In 1972 the philosophy of manpower as a national resource,
which had been promoted by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, was adopted by Canada as a
member country, and the department then proceeded to gear
its pragmatic operations to this philosophic concept, which
included both the management and development of manpower
resources. This, in turn, involved the forecasting of manpower
needs and skills, the training required to meet those needs, the
training of handicapped to their full potential, along with job
creation and the placement service, which, as Senator Everett
has pointed out, still remains the core function of the
department.

80003-10

Prior to 1972, the main objective of the Department of
Manpower was to ensure that the supply of manpower
matched the demand qualitatively, quantitatively and geographically. In 1971, the report of the Senate Special Committee on Poverty recommended as follows:
Manpower development is an economic concept limited
to direct labour market activities. Human resource development is a broader social concept which includes all
aspects of education, training, retraining, and intervention
with respect to social, psychological and physical problems as they relate to people. As one step towards a
meaningful anti-poverty program the Government of
Canada should shift its emphasis from manpower to
human resource development.
As stated earlier, this shift in emphasis was advocated also
by the OECD, and in 1972, following a policy review, the
concept of long-term economic growth was broadened to
include the social roles of stability and equity. Stability, of
course, refers to stability of the labour force, which includes
job creation and the reduction of unemployment, and equity
includes the goals of reducing poverty and disparities in the
distribution of income.
As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Poverty, I
supported and still support the recommendation with respect
to human resource development.
However, policies aimed at growth, stability and equity cost
money and they all involve training, and immediately we start
to apply those policies we come face to face with the question
of how much should be spent in pursuit of each goal. The total
expenditure of the Manpower Division amounts to about $655
million annually. Of that amount, $418 million is spent on
various forms of training-academic, vocational, technological, and trades training and industrial training. Included in
that amount of $418 million is $100 million spent on upgrading the elementary education of workers in various subjects to
qualify them for admission to industrial and trades training
courses.
There is a general complaint abroad today in all provinces of
Canada that our schools are not placing sufficient emphasis on
teaching the three Rs, that students are coming out of our high
schools unable to express themselves clearly and grammatically, unable to spell correctly, unable to read with comprehension and incapable of performing the basic mathematical
calculations that are a part of everyday life. The committee's
finding, and the magnitude of the annual expenditures of the
Manpower Division to correct these defects, tend to support
that view.
Since education, particularly elementary education, is a
provincial responsibility, there is some question as to whether
this is a legitimate expenditure for the federal government. On
the other hand, to the extent that workers are able to develop
their skills and make a greater contribution to the economic
life of the nation, as well as improving themselves educationally and financially, this $100 million represents an investment
in our human resources which repays itself many times over.

SENATE DEBATES
The British North America Act places education under the
jurisdiction of the provinces, and, as a result, the only way in
which the federal government can participate in academic and
skills training programs is by means of agreements with the
provinces. While no two agreements are exactly alike, they all
specify a fixed amount of money available for course purchases, and the provinces are obligated to provide complete
financial reports of their disbursements annually. All provinces
but Ontario agree to provide as many training days as they can
for the fixed amount. In the case of Ontario, a fixed total price
for a set number of training days is specified, according to an
agreed scale of fees relating to the kind of course provided.
Thus the volume and mix of courses is established, but the
location and occupational skills to be taught are left open. The
federal government does not pay for training days not utilized.
Under the arrangements the federal government has little or
no control over the type, quantity or quality of the courses
being purchased, and no method of determining whether it is
getting full value for the money spent.
0

(1620)

This situation is offset to some extent by the federal-provincial manpower needs committees which have been set up in
every province and are required (1) to co-ordinate federal and
provincial programs relating to manpower training, and (2) to
assess manpower needs, recommend training plans and priorities, assess training results, and recommend improvements.
Each manpower needs committee functions in its own province, and there is no co-ordinating mechanism to assess or
compare the efficiency of the needs committee in one province
with that of the other provinces, and no method of comparing
the quality of the training provided by the various provinces in
any particular course.
There was some evidence placed before the committee to
indicate that while adhering to the letter of the agreement,
provinces do not always carry out its spirit, and the money
provided by the federal government is not always used to the
best advantage. For example, there was evidence that some
provinces used the money to bolster classes where they would
otherwise have to lay off teachers, with the result that workers
were trained in courses for which there was little demand and
in which few vacancies existed.
Another feature of this arrangement is that the provincial
government determines which institution will provide the
courses being purchased. In some cases, for provincial reasons,
the course is not always given in the institution best qualified
to provide it, and the worker has no freedom of choice as to
which institution he attends.
Provincial regulations also sometimes militate against getting the best value for the training dollar. I remember visiting
a classroom where a number of students were taking up-grading academic courses under the Canada Manpower training
program. As I went from one desk to the other taking a look at
what the students were doing, I came across two young girls
struggling with algebra. I asked them why they were taking
algebra, and they both said that the provincial regulations
required them to take the subject in order to qualify for the

November 3, 1976

Grade X certificate which was necessary for them to enter the
course they wished to take. I inquired about the courses they
were interested in, and one said she wanted to become a typist
dnd the other a beautician. Another young man who wanted to
be a barber was struggling with geometry in order to be
admitted to the course. In order to comply with provincial
regulations these workers were required to use up time, which
could be more usefully spent in other ways, while at the same
time taking a course at federal expense which was not related
to the skills they were seeking and of no use to them after they
had completed it.
In 1971, when the Senate Special Committee on Poverty
was travelling around the country holding hearings, we came
across a number of action-research programs sponsored by the
Department of Manpower under the name of Canada NewStart Programs. Their purpose was to develop and test new
approaches to education and training, particularly among the
disadvantaged. I particularly remember the NewStart Program at Prince Albert because, as far as I know, it was the
only piece of educational research that has been carried out in
Canada. The purpose of the research was to determine why
some people fail and others succeed, and they discovered that
to be successful in a job the person must have a balance
between two different types of skills. One type they called
marketable skills, such as a trade, vocation or profession, and
the other they called problem-solving skills which included the
ability to adjust, adapt and get along with others. They found
that neither set of skills in the absence of the other could
insure success. Based on these discoveries they were able to
develop methods of teaching various subjects which enabled
the student to complete a particular course in about one-third
of the time required by conventional classroom methods.
The provision of marketable skills is, of course, the purpose
and responsibility of the manpower training program, but the
development of problem-solving skills and time-saving methods
is the responsibility of the educational systems of the various
provinces. Although this defect in our educational system was
discovered five years ago, as far as I know no province has
done anything about it. Since the research which resulted in
this discovery was financed by federal funds through a Canada
Manpower program, the Manpower Division could effect considerable savings by including clauses in its agreements which
would require the provinces to modify the entry qualifications
for certain courses, and to use the most time-saving methods
available.
There was some evidence to indicate that industrial on-thejob training provided better value for the dollars spent than
institutional training, and at the same time provided more job
stability. However, in 1974-1975 only 17.1 per cent of the
trainees were in this category. It is my hope that this industrial
training will increase as time goes on, and I would urge the
department to explore the possibility of having industry provide academic courses as well.
This report has been well received by the minister, the
departmental officials, the press and the public at large, and I
strongly commend it to honourable senators.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

November 3, 1976

The Hon. the Speaker: As no other honourable senator
wishes to participate in this debate, this inquiry is considered
as having been debated.
ADJOURNMENT
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions:
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I move, with leave
of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(g), that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Tuesday,
November 16, 1976, at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Before the question is put, I think the Senate is entitled to a
word of explanation. The reason for my moving this motion at
this time is two-fold. First, since the debate on the Throne
Speech was concluded last evening, and since our expectations
of receiving legislation either directly or through the House of
Commons have not materialized so far, the Senate is left with
no work to do. This applies not only to tomorrow, but also to
the week immediately ahead.
Secondly, next week we commemorate Armistice Day
which, as we all know, is an official holiday on which Parliament does not sit. On this occasion honourable senators, and
particularly those who are veterans-and there are many in
this house-have to absent themselves from Ottawa to participate in very important functions in their respective provinces
and senatorial districts.
For these reasons I think an adjournment of the Senate until
November 16 is justified.
I also wish to inform the house that this proposed adjournment will not interfere with or affect the meetings of committees already scheduled and advertised. However, I wish to
remind honourable senators who are committee chairmen of
the wording of rule 76, which provides that when the adjournment is for more than one week permission must be obtained
from the Senate to sit during the time the Senate is adjourned.
I understand that the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has a
meeting scheduled for tomorrow, already has power to sit
when the Senate is not sitting. On the other hand, I am told
that the National Finance Committee and the Standing Joint
Committee on Regulations and other Statutory Instruments do
not possess that power at present. It is my intention, therefore,
if the present motion is adopted, to seek leave to move that
those two committees be given power to meet.
Senator Laird: And the Internal Economy Committee as
weil, please.

•

(1630)

Senator Langlois: Yes, that committee will be added to the
list.
Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, may I say in relation
to what the deputy leader has said that there is a little more
involved in the case of the Joint Committee on Regulations
and other Statutory Instruments than simply the power to sit
while the Senate is adjourned or during the sittings of the
Senate. There is also the fact that we often have great

80003-10/2

difficulty getting a quorum on that committee. I am advised
by the clerk of the committee that we must have at least four
senators there, unless we get permission from the Senate to
adopt the motion we had last year reducing the total quorum
both for senators and members of the House of Commons to
seven for the transaction of business, votes and that sort of
thing, and to five for the hearing of evidence, in each case
provided both houses are represented.
Ordinarily there would have been a first report on this
tomorrow-and I have the text of the one from last sessionbut when I heard we were to have an adjournment for this
length of time and knew that we had already scheduled a
meeting for next Tuesday on the assumption, of course, that
both houses would be sitting, and that a report analogous to
this would be going to the House of Commons tomorrow, I
immediately consulted the Leader of the Government on the
subject, and he very kindly consulted the Leader of the Opposition while I was trying to find the proper text of the motion.
If we are going to have that meeting at all and be able to
transact any business, it will be necessary for us to have not
only permission to sit while the Senate is adjourned but also
permission to reduce the quorum in the way that I have
described. So if the deputy leader would be kind enough to
include that in his motion, it would greatly facilitate the
transaction of very urgent business in our committee.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I have no objection
to moving such a motion, but it was my understanding that the
honourable senator would do just that when, a while ago, he
intimated he wished leave to speak. If he wishes to do so, he
can move the motion himself, but I am prepared to do it if he
prefers.
Senator Forsey: I understood you would prefer to do so
yourself. I am prepared to present the first report, although I
have not got the typewritten text at this time.
Senator Flynn: We will give you a signal.
Senator Forsey: I beg your pardon?
Senator Flynn: We will tell you when you can do it.
Senator Forsey: Thank you.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have no objection to
the motion. I think it is the normal thing to do under the
circumstances, but would the Leader of the Government tell us
if there is any likelihood of legislation reaching us, or being
initiated here, when we return on November 16?
Senator Perrault: There is every hope and expectation that
there will be measures for consideration by this chamber on
November 16. Indeed, a substantial legislative schedule has
been established by the government for the period prior to
Christmas, and the time of senators will be fully occupied.
Motion agreed to.

THE HONOURABLE J. E. LEFRANÇOIS
TRIBUTE ON RESIGNATION FROM THE SENATE

Hon. Léopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I wish to
advise the Senate that our colleague, Senator J. Eugène
Lefrançois has resigned from his seat as representative of
Repentigny.
Senator Lefrançois has been in failing health for some time
but lie continued his faithful attendance in the chamber and at
the sittings of parliamentary committees even though it may at
times have been very difficult for him.
It was an attack be suffered here after the sitting on
Thursday, October 28 that necessitated his confinement to
hospital and hastened his decision to resign from the Senate.
Senator Lefrançois was born, educated and has lived all his
life in Montreal, a city be loves.
An industrialist, be has been administrator of "La société
des artisans" and President of La Caisse Populaire of St.
Stanislas. He has always been deeply interested in politics,
devoting himself with overflowing enthusiasm. In 1936, be ran
but was unfortunately defeated as a candidate for the provincial legislature.
He was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election
held on October 24, 1949 and re-elected in 1953.
On April 25, 1957, be was summoned as a representative of
Repentigny to the Senate, where he devoted himself until lie
was struck by illness a few weeks ago. His departure is a
considerable loss indeed to all of us in the Senate where lie
always assumed his responsibilities with readiness and dignity.
Both in this chamber and in the committees of which he was
a member, Senator Lefrançois has been an industrious and
sincere public servant. He has served his country and his
province well.
I feel that I speak for all the members of this house when I
say that we hope most sincerely that his health will improve
and that he will be able to enjoy fully his well-earned retirement from an active and productive public life.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, it is with great
pleasure that I join the government deputy leader to pay
tribute to Senator J.-Eugène Lefrançois, who decided to resign
from the Senate for health reasons.
Senator Lefrançois was a most pleasant colleague, very
conciliating, with a very objective outlook, I would say, of the
business of the country and of his province. Personally, and I

think all honourable members of this house will agree with me,
I can only commend the relationships I have had with him.
As Senator Langlois pointed out, lie has had a very interesting and very fruitful political career, having been in the other
place and here since 1949, that is for 27 years. He also enjoyed
an excellent and rewarding career in the business world.
Like Senator Langlois, I hope his health will improve and I
also share the view that lie well deserves many years of happy
retirement. I hope that it will be so.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON KENT COUNTY, NEW BRUNSWICK,
TABLED

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I have the honour to
table a report entitled, "Kent County Can Be Saved," a study
into the agricultural potential of eastern New Brunswick of the
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, which was
appointed in the last session of Parliament and authorized in
that session, without special reference by the Senate, to examine from time to time any aspect of the agricultural industry in
Canada.
It has taken the committee a long time to bring this report
forward. We think it is an excellent report, and we hope to
follow it up by further visits to Kent County. It is my pleasure
to table it at this time.

2. What is the size of the force in each case?
3. On whose invitation, at what cost per annum and for
how long have Canadian Armed Forces been participating
in each case?

4. What amounts, if any, with respect to these forces
are unpaid or overdue and for what years?

INCOME TAX
BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED
TO STUDY LEGISLATION

Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(e), I move:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce be authorized to examine and
report upon the subject matter of the Bill C-22, intituled:
"An Act to amend the statute law relating to income
tax," in advance of the said bill coming before the Senate,
or any matter relating thereto; and
That the committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, staff and technical advisers as may be
necessary for the purposes of the said examination.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is there unanimous consent, honourable senators?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I think this motion
requires some explanation, at least for the record.
Senator Hayden: Yes. Honourable senators, I should tell
you that the amendments to the Income Tax Act consist of 87
clauses covering 112 pages. Some of them are clarification
which may be beneficial; some of them are clarification which
may not be beneficial; some of them really represent the
enactment of some substantive law. We know from previous
experience that the intention of the government, as I think we
can fairly conclude in this case, is that before the end of the
year this bill should pass into law, either in the form in which
it stands at present or as it may be amended. Therefore, in
view of the complications that exist in any examination of
income tax amendments, we should begin this study as quickly
as possible so that we will not run into that horrible thing
called "Christmas closure."
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, the last words of Senator Hayden may be wishful thinking, but I agree that generally
speaking his committee is doing a good job in matters of
income tax, and that it is a good thing for this committee to
look into the several amendments which are proposed to the
Income Tax Act by this bill, since, as I have said before, it is
easier for the House of Commons, and the government especially, to accept amendments before the legislation reaches us,
in view of the fact that there is some pride involved. Very often
we have to do our job by the back door, which is one way of
doing it, and as we are not as proud as all that we are willing
to do our job in this way if we cannot do it in any other.
I was wondering if there was any problem of conflict of
interest with regard to these amendments to the Income Tax
Act.

November 16, 1976

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, I assume that the
Leader of the Opposition asked a serious question, and I would
like to answer it in the same vein. Income tax is a common
infliction visited on every resident of Canada to a greater or
lesser degree, and how you can have a possible conflict of
interest in those circumstances is difficult for me to conceive.
However, I would expect that if the question is raised in
committee it will be seriously considered.
Senator Flynn: I was just wondering if any member of the
committee would have a direct pecuniary interest.
Senator Argue: Or an ex officio member, for that matter.
Motion agreed to.

PROTECTION OF BORROWERS AND DEPOSITORS
BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED
TO STUDY LEGISLATION

Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(e), I move:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce be authorized to examine and
report upon the subject matter of the Bill C-16, intituled:
"An Act to provide for the protection of borrowers and
depositors, to regulate interest on judgment debts, to
repeal the Interest Act, the Pawnbrokers Act and the
Small Loans Act and to amend certain other statutes in
consequence thereof", in advance of the said Bill coming
before the Senate, or any matter relating thereto; and
That the Committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, staff and technical advisers as may be
necessary for the purposes of the said examination.
Senator Flynn: Explain.
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, it has appeared in
discussions in what might be called official places that it is
desired that this bill should be brought forward as quickly as
possible, and it is a complicated bill. To date our committee,
that is the Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, has received quite a number of submissions in anticipation of the bill's coming to our committee. In these circum-

stances it is the feeling of the committee that we should start a
study of the bill as quickly as possible. I am sure the Leader of
the Opposition will understand this reference. The advantage
in making an advance study of the bill is that if, in the view of
the committee, and subsequently in the view of the Senate by
reason of a report from the committee, there are some changes
which may improve the bill they can be brought to the
attention of the committee of the Commons at as early a date
as possible. It has been indicated that this bill is to be referred
to the Health and Welfare Committee of the Commons.
Senator Flynn: Did you say Health and Welfare?
Senator Hayden: Yes, the Health and Welfare Committee.
This subject matter is properly referable to the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce under
rule 67(l)(k). Therefore, in the interests of dispatch, and at
the same time allowing full consideration of the subject matter
of the bill, I have moved this motion tonight.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I think the remarks I
made previously would apply to this motion. Of course, if we
had the same outlook as the House of Commons with respect
to health and welfare, then this is a committee on which
Senator Croll should sit.
Senator Croil: Hear, hear. It would improve it some.
Senator Flynn: On the other hand, while I agree that this
legislation is very important, the question of conflict of interest
arises again. It concerns borrowers and lenders, and I think we
are all in that category. I wonder if any one of us is qualified
to sit on a committee which would deal with it.
Senator Langlois: Mostly borrowers.
Motion agreed to.

Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, last Friday, November 12, at the O'Keefe Centre in Toronto, to a packed and
enthusiastic audience, the National Ballet of Canada opened
its fall season in Toronto with a magnificent performance of
Romeo and Juliet with that great prima ballerina, long a
mainstay of the company, Veronica Tennant, dancing the role
of Juliet in a superb performance which I venture to say could
not have been bettered by any other ballerina in the world.
Frank Augustyn, one of the younger dancers, gave a magnificent performance as Romeo, as did that other long-standing
mainstay of the company, Hazaros Surmeyan as Tybalt.
The evening, however, belonged to that grande dame of
ballet in Canada, Celia Franca, who came out of retirement to
dance and, when she was on, to dominate the stage as Lady
Capulet. That performance and all the memories it evoked

NATIONAL BALLET OF CANADA
TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is leave

granted?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

SENATE DEBATES
inspired me to make these remarks tonight to honour the
company and its founder.
By coincidence the opening of the season was the exact
twenty-fifth anniversary of the first performance of the company at the Eaton Auditorium on November 12, 1951, when
they performed the Dance of Salome, with Celia Franca
dancing the lead and George Crum conducting, as he did last
Friday. As everyone knows, the National Ballet was Celia
Franca. Without her artistic standards, ability, energy, guts
and sheer unmitigated gall the company would never have
survived, nor would it have reached its present stature as one
of the great international ballet companies.
Celia was also a teacher of the dance, and her interest in
this led her to found, with Betty Oliphant, that great teacher
and visionary, the National Ballet School. Betty Oliphant
believed that dancers should be properly educated as well as
know how to dance, so that the school lays great emphasis on
the academic side and has produced many well-educated dancers for the company including, as well as Veronica Tennant
and Frank Augustyn, those other great stars, Karen Kain,
Vanessa Harwood and Nadia Potts. While I am mentioning
names, I recall two other stars of yesteryear who will always
be remembered affectionately by ballet fans-the enchanting
Lois Smith, the company's first great prima ballerina, and
Earl Kraul, the leading male dancer for so many years.
At the gala twenty-fifth anniversary performance, Celia was
suitably honoured, and the press in the last week has been
filled with tributes to her. I do not wish to be repetitive. She
has been heaped with many honours over the years, such as
LL.D.s, the Order of Canada and a Molson Award. I think it
should suffice if I say that I agree one hundred per cent with
all the good and nice things that have been said about her.
I got quite a chuckle out of a story on her by Mordecai
Richler in last week's Canadian where, speaking of the company's twenty-fifth anniversary, Celia is quoted as saying to
Richler, "Why should I go out and dance there in front of all
my enemies?" Celia has certainly not lost any of her fire or
combativeness over the years. Eddie Goodman is quoted in the
same article as saying, when he was president, "I took my
orders from Celia," and essentially so did everyone else who
was president because we all had confidence in Celia.
When Celia talked about her enemies to Richler there was
no doubt that for some time she included me amongst that by
no means select group. I have got the impression in the last
several years that Celia's attitude to me is mellowing, but that
may only be the conceit of advancing years. I might say also
that an enemy to Celia was someone who might happen to
disagree with her about any detail of how the ballet should be
run. I am sure that, like me, they never considered themselves
as her enemy.
If I may be forgiven a personal reminiscence, I recall my
first meeting with Celia after I became president in 1967. The
ballet was $200,000 in debt, which had been accumulated over
the first 16 years of its existence, despite yearly fund-raising
drives, a highly profitable shop "Paper Things" run by volun-

November 16, 1976

teers from the women's committee, and the generosity of R. A.
Laidlaw, that "prima" benefactor of so many good causes,
including the Sick Children's Hospital, and known affectionately to everyone connected with the ballet as Bobby, who,
between the company and the school, was always good for at
least $40,000 each year. To digress for a minute, I can
remember when Bobby Laidlaw was so incensed at an unfavourable review appearing in the papers that he sent the
company a cheque for $10,000 the next day as a tangible
expression of how much he disagreed with the critic.
In that first meeting with Celia, attended also by the
president of the Women's Committee, I told her that, although
I had been a ballet fan since first seeing the Sadler's Wells
Ballet with Margot Fonteyn perform in Toronto several years
after the war, I was not knowledgeable about ballet and
certainly knew nothing about running a company and would
leave everything entirely up to her. The only thing I would do
would be to tell her at the beginning of each year how much
money she had to play with, and she had to determine what
she would do with it. In view of the precarious financial
position of the company, as evidenced by the $200,000 debt, I
also told her that I would have to insist that she stick to the
budget.
I remember how startled I was when Celia, in a voice that
can only be described as emphatic, said that I was being very
unfair. It was explained to me after the meeting by one of the
good ladies present that that was not how the ballet operated
under Celia. She decided how much money was to be spent,
and then told the president and directors to go out and get it.
If they were not able to and the company plunged further into
debt, they were the object of her scorn and the resulting
financial difficulties were their fault, not hers.
To show how innocent I was, I was not deterred and boldly
pursued my plan to keep Celia in check. I can only report that
I was out-manoeuvred at every turn and soundly trounced by
Celia. To teach me a lesson, Celia dramatically resigned at the
annual meeting after my first year of office because I had the
audacity to say in public at the meeting what I had said
privately to her, namely, that the artistic director had to stick
to her budget. The press and artistic community rose unanimously to Celia's support, and I was depicted as a hard-nosed
Philistine who was trying to wreck gentle Celia's company by
not permitting them to spend the money they needed.
Senator Flynn: Not the first time!
Senator Godfrey: As a matter of fact, the adverse reaction
in the media was about the equivalent of what one would
expect if one had the temerity to call some hockey star a
hooligan. Aided by some understanding and wise intermediaries, a truce was soon negotiated between Celia and me and she
returned to her post.
As a result of all my earnest efforts and my absolute
insistence that the ballet be run on a business-like basis, I was
able to report at the end of my two-year term of office that the
ballet, instead of being $200,000 in debt, was then $400,000 in
the red. In other words, in the two years of my presidency the

debt had increased by an amount equal to the debt that had
been accumulated over the 16 years under the presidencies of
Tony Griffin, Arthur Gelber, Guy Simmons, Tony Cassels and
other presidents who preceded me.

It was with a guilty conscience that I handed over the reins
of office to my successor, because I was certain in my own
mind that the days of the ballet company as we knew it were
numbered and because it did seem unfair that the drastic
retrenchment which would so affect its high standards would
have to come under my successor as president, that sympathetic and dedicated man Lyman Henderson.
Now, there were various people and organizations over the
years who saved the ballet at times of financial crisis. I have
mentioned Bobby Laidlaw who died just a few months ago.
The Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council arrived on
the scene in the nick of time. The City of Toronto provided the
magnificently restored St. Lawrence Hall at a nominal rental
as well as giving an annual subsidy. And the Bank of Montreal
also helped. I don't think our chartered banks get the recognition that is their due as being most generous financial supporters of all worthy causes. The Bank of Montreal saved the
company on many an occasion by loans that were never
justified on any prudent credit-rating basis.
The person who really saved the ballet several months after
I retired from the presidency was John Robarts, then Premier
of Ontario. The Toronto Symphony, the Canadian Opera
Company and the Stratford Shakesperian Festival were likewise all in deep financial trouble with unmanageable debts.
John Robarts was understanding and decided they should be
saved, with the result that the Government of Ontario agreed
to pay off approximately 55 per cent of their debts. The
Canada Council had previously agreed that they would match
dollar for dollar any money raised by these companies to pay
off their debt. The result was that, presto, the ballet and those
other major companies were debt-free, so that they were then
able to start all over again to accumulate more debt.
It is easy now to see with 20-20 hindsight that Celia was
right in plunging ahead to maintain and improve the high
standards of the company, in the complete faith that somehow
the financial difficulties would be taken care of. It is the Celia
Francas of this world who accomplish great things, not the
cautious, pragmatic, timid types like myself.
Now, having admitted that, as things turned out, Celia was
absolutely right and I was wrong, I think I am entitled to say a
few words in my defence. While the Celias are the ones who
will go down in history and will be remembered and honoured,
I should remind honourable senators that they don't always get
away with it. On the best evidence available at the time, I was
right in trying to keep expenditures under more control. The
fact that I was like a babe in the woods, and no match for
Celia in trying to keep the debt down, turned out for the best
in the end. There was a little bit of luck involved on Celia's
part-she did not have a pipeline into John Robarts' mind and
she did not know the Government of Ontario would come to
the rescue; she just had faith that something like that must

happen. However, there are many cases where companies in
the performing arts have gone belly up, or have had to
drastically curtail their activities, because they accumulated
an unmanageable debt. An example of the first is the Feux
Follets, and the second is the Canadian Opera Company which
ran up another debt of $700,000 with the result that they had
to cut their Toronto season this fall. Officers and boards of
directors of artistic companies must keep some kind of rein on
their artistic directors because they just cannot expect miracles
to happen all the time.
So, while I cheerfully admit Celia deserves full credit for
winning ber battle against me, I have no apologies to make.
I might also say in closing that when I became chairman of
the Finance Committee of the Liberal Party of Canada and
was doing battle with campaign managers over their budgets
and insisting that they stick to them, my secretary asked me if
I had not noticed a similarity between campaign managers of
political parties at election time, and a certain artistic director
of a ballet company. I replied that of course I had. My
previous experience helped me greatly so that it was like
child's play controlling them compared to trying to control the
indomitable Celia, with the result that I can take a bit of the
credit for the fact that the federal Liberal Party is today not
only debt-free but actually has a surplus. Possibly it should be
made mandatory that before anyone is considered for the
position of chairman of the finance committee of a political
party he, or she, I hasten to add, should receive an initial
training and baptism of fire as president of a performing arts
company.
Senator Greene: Will the honourable senator permit a question, and may I preface it by commending him on his very fine
report? It has moved me to the extent that I think we might
expand the order of business of the Senate, if the committee in
charge of these things sees fit to do so, to include an item
called "ballet-hoo."
Might I ask the honourable senator whether, in the light of
these great accomplishments, he would not deem it beneficial
to move these great artists from the National Ballet into the
backfield of the Toronto Argonauts to take the place of
Anthony Davis and company who, in a lesser but perhaps more
popular form of culture, have not been so successful?
Senator Godfrey: In reply to the question, honourable senators, I think that statistics will show that there are more people
who follow the performing arts such as the ballet than attend
football games in Canada.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, on a point of order, I
wonder if the speech made by Senator Godfrey was an inquiry
without previous notice. In any event, if no other senator
wishes to speak on this topic I would suggest that Madam
Speaker declare that the matter has been debated.
Senator Godfrey: I was advised that there was no other item
on the order paper tonight, and that it would be an appropriate
time to make these comments.
The Hon. the Speaker: Since no other honourable senator
wishes to take part in this debate, I declare the inquiry
debated.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

NATIONAL UNITY
PROPOSED COMMITTEE ON REGIONAL INTERESTS-QUESTION

Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I should like to put a
question to the Leader of the Government. On October 14,
1976, on page 25 of the Debates of the Senate, the Leader of
the Government, in a statement, said this, and I quote:
I think the Senate should remind itself of one of its
great historical functions, which is to represent regional
interests of Canadians here at the heart of government.
Consideration should be given to a Senate committee on
regional aspirations to meet Canadians in many of the
small towns and villages and other population centres in
the regions of Canada, and to prepare a report for the
Canadian people and for our colleagues in Parliament-a
report relating to the hopes, aspirations and problems of
the Canadian people. I believe that would be a contribution to solidifying national unity, reconciliation and
understanding. As I say, I hope we can have some useful
discussions on this point in the next few days.
In view of the results of the Quebec provincial election of
which we were informed on November 15, does the Leader of
the Government still intend to set up that committee? If so,

could he tell the Senate what its functions and responsibilities
would be, and does he intend as well to bring forward a motion
for its creation?
[English]
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I appreciate the
inquiry of the distinguished senator. It is the intention to move
ahead with this proposal, in consultation with the opposition in
this chamber. To be frank, however, our ranks are reduced by
some 19 members at this time. It is hoped that there will be
some appointments to this chamber in the near future. A
recommendation has gone forward from myself, as Leader of
the Government in the Senate, to the effect that we need some
additional Senate appointments, including a strengthened
oppositionSenator Greene: In quality.
Senator Perrault: -in the Senate. The Senate needs to be
strengthened by increasing the ranks of both the official
opposition in the Senate as well other sectors. A recommendation to that effect has gone forward, and I am hopeful that we
will have some appointments shortly.
The question of adding to the ranks in the Senate is a matter
of some critical importance. We are having a great deal of
difficulty in staffing the various committees of the Senate. The
fact that our numbers are reduced so severely has become a
serious problem.
I cannot think of a more important assignment for the
Senate to undertake, whatever the form of a committee inquiry, than to have our members actively concerned with efforts
to preserve the unity of this country and to work for better
understanding in and among the provinces. I think it is of
critical importance, and I welcome all proposals and suggestions from the opposition in the Senate relating to the manner
in which such a committee could be structured and brought
into being.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I feel I should comment on the reply given by the Leader of the Government. I
am quite sure he did not mean to leave the impression that his
side of the house was having the same difficulty staffing
committees as we are on this side. That would be surprising,
indeed, in view of the fact that Senator Greene is always
willing to inject his two cents' worth into every discussion that
takes place. I am willing to discuss with the Leader of the
Government, of course, the structure of the proposed special
committee.
Before resuming my seat, I should like to ask the leader
whether his absence from the house last night was due to the
fact that he had been campaigning in the province of Quebec,
or had gone there following the election results to review what
had happened.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, my absence from
the house last night was due to an official commitment which I
had in western Canada. I am very pleased to report to the
chamber that the general attitude of western Canadians to the
Quebec election is one of understanding. The attitude amongst
western Canadians generally is one of "wait and see."

November 17, 1976

SENATE DEBATES
A view is held in the west that the election result principally
reflected dissatisfaction with the previous provincial government and that the vote was not an indicator of public attitudes
toward separatism. However, I do not wish to become involved
in a discussion of provincial affairs. I simply want to transmit
to honourable senators some idea of the attitude which I found
in the west. I am encouraged. There is no belief that Confederation is finished or doomed and that we have no future as a
united country. There is no philosophy of despair.
e (1410)
This proposed Senate dialogue with the Canadian people
may not require a special committee. Perhaps a standing
committee of the Senate as presently structured could take on
this responsibility. In any event, we on this side would very
much welcome the thinking of the opposition on the subject.
All of us are concerned about the need to keep this country
united. This belief and concern goes far beyond any partisan
differences which we may have in this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
THE HONOURABLE JOHN J. CONNOLLY, P.C.
CONDITION OF HEALTH

Senator Rowe: Honourable senators, my flight was delayed
last night, and as a consequence I did not get into the Senate
for the first part of the sitting. A perusal of yesterday's
Hansard indicates that the matter I have in mind was not
mentioned. I am wondering if the Leader of the Government
has received a report recently on the condition of Senator John
J. Connolly.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I made an inquiry
about the condition of our colleague as soon as I arrived today,
and was informed that he is making sure and steady progress.
He had one minor setback last week, but is now well on the
way to recovery. I think we are all encouraged by this report.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
SUPERVISOR OF ENQUIRIES CENTRE-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: On November 2 the Honourable Senator
Forsey inquired as to the supervisor of the Department of
Justice enquiries centre. The question was in six parts, as
follows:
1. Who is the supervisor of the enquiries centre in the
Department of Justice?
2. When was he or she appointed?
3. Is he or she a lawyer?
4. What was his or her previous position, if any, in the
public service?
5. If he or she came from outside the public service,
from what position in the private sector?
6. What is his or her salary?
The answer is that the supervisor of the enquiries centre in
the Department of Justice is one Jean J. Bélisle. He was
appointed on April 1, 1976. He is not a lawyer.

Senator Flynn: Why do you say that?
Senator Perrault: Because that is an accurate reply.
An Hon. Senator: That is very reassuring.
Senator Perrault: The previous position held by Mr. Bélisle
in the public service was that of information services officer 3
with Information Canada.
The question as to the position held by this gentleman
outside the public service, if he came from the private sector, is
not applicable. His salary range is from $17,696 to $20,108.
ENERGY
PROPOSED PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS ADMINISTRATION
ACT-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, Senator Austin
asked a question on October 28 with regard to the proposed
new oil and gas legislation. The honourable senator wanted to
know whether such legislation would be introduced in the near
future, and whether it would be possible to have it introduced
first in this chamber.
On behalf of the government, I wish to assure honourable
senators that we are keenly aware of the importance of the
legislation referred to by Senator Austin, and that every effort
will be made to have it introduced and dealt with during the
current session of Parliament. Indeed, I am given to understand that drafting is going ahead on an urgent basis, and a
bill respecting petroleum and natural gas should be ready for
introduction early in the new year. Since this bill will be in the
nature of a money bill, it will, of necessity, be introduced in
the other place.
TRANSPORT
CAR RENTAL BOOTHS AT AIRPORTS-QUESTION

Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I wonder
if I might ask the Leader of the Government whether the
Department of Transport has recently called for tenders for
the rental of certain space in Canadian air terminals in which
car rental companies might put their booths, or carry on their
business in the terminals, and if so, what tenders have been
received, in respect of what airports, and what are the amounts
of those tenders?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the Minister of
Transport has taken action with respect to car rental space in
air terminals across the country. However, because of the
detailed nature of the inquiry I must take it as notice. That
information will be obtained as quickly as possible.

SWINE INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION-SUPPLEMENTARY

I wonder if I could ask the Leader of the Government a
supplementary question. Could he let us know if there
have been any confirmed diagnoses of swine flu in either
Canada or the United States?
A New Jersey 76 influenza (swine flu) was first isolated in
mid-February 1976 in Fort Dix, New Jersey. Since that time,
no further isolations of this virus have been reported in
Canada or the United States.
THE HONOURABLE JOHN YAREMKO
FELICITATIONS ON HONORARY DEGREE

Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, before the Orders
of the Day are called I should like to draw your attention to
the fact that on November 30, 1976, the Ukrainian Free
University of Munich, West Germany, will be conferring an
Honorary Doctorate in Political Science upon the Honourable
John Yaremko, a prominent long-time member of the Legislature of Ontario. This will be the first time that someone of
Ukrainian origin not born in the Ukraine will be so honoured
by the university. The citation is for public service.
I think that all of us in this chamber are aware of the
dedication and, indeed, the passion which John Yaremko has
brought to his duties in the public service throughout the
years. I am sure we all share in the pride that the Ukrainian
community in Canada has with respect to this honour that is
being conferred upon him.

believes it would be desirable for the Parliament of
Canada to seek to establish some form of regular parliamentary link with the European Parliament.
Following that report, informal meetings were held with
representatives of this Parliament and the European Parliament. In due course, under the auspices of the Speaker of the
Senate and the Speaker of the House of Commons, a formal
interparliamentary link was established, and this year I was
privileged to be a co-chairman of the parliamentary group
which visited the European Parliament between September 13
and September 16 last. I thought it would be appropriate for
me to report to the Senate on that visit by that parliamentary
group.
Let me first mention the makeup of the Canadian delegation. From the Senate, in addition to myself as co-chairman,
there were Senators Lafond and Smith (Colchester); and from
the House of Commons, there were Mr. John Roberts,
co-chairman, and Messrs. Bussières, Caron, Fleming, Hnatyshyn, Macquarrie, Paproski and Prud'homme.
* (1420)

I might say that on the first day of our visit to Luxembourg,
where the meetings took place this year, Mr. Roberts received
a summons from the Prime Minister to return home to join the
cabinet. Mr. Jim Fleming assumed the role of co-chairman
which, on very short notice, he discharged with distinction.
I should like to acknowledge the excellent briefings we
received before leaving for Europe, the arrangements made by
the Inter-Parliamentary Relations Branch, and the assistance

regulations, export subsidies and concessional financing.
Additional items in the discussions have been consumer
protection, copyright laws, protection of the environment,
standards and quality control and the industrial application of science and technology.
Given the movement toward economic integration
among the Nine, it is appropriate to seek to establish a
framework for cooperation on a Community-wide basis.
Many of these subjects are outside the jurisdiction of the
GATT, but could become important ways of furthering
mutual interests. Such an agreement would complement
the GATT, not substitute for it.
The committee goes on to say:
The Committee endorses the Government's conception
of a comprehensive economic non-discriminatory cooperation agreement. Such an "umbrella" agreement, if concluded, would provide broad scope for cooperation on
economic issues of mutual interest beyond the possibilities
of a regular trade agreement.
Without reading the rather dry releases which were made at
the time of the signing of the agreement, I might move ahead
to some excerpts from the speech made at the time by our then
Minister of External Affairs, Mr. MacEachen. I am taking
this time to place these thoughts on the record because it is
important for Canadians generally, and, I would submit, particularly for members of this chamber, to understand the
distinction between a preferential trade agreement, which this
is not, and a cooperation agreement, which it is. From Mr.
MacEachen's speech I quote the following:

e

(1430)

The Agreement will be no more than it claims to be. It
will not be a preferential arrangement. Rather, it will
establish a framework for cooperation designed to leave
optimum room for the expansion of Canada's economic
links with the European Community. It is so designed
because the Community is evolving, as is Canada's
capacity to develop a comprehensive relationship. It
should, therefore, enable us to move pragmatically from
modest beginnings to more ambitious forms of
cooperation.
Today, trade is only one element in a complex network
of economic interaction that embraces investment, technology, licensing, joint ventures, and cooperation in third
markets. What we shall be doing under the agreement in
essence is identifying individual sectors that look to be
most promising in terms of industrial cooperation. This
will, of course, be a continuing process which will have
among its objectives the further development of Canadian
and European industry, the encouragement of technological and scientific progress and the opening up of new
sources of supply and new markets.
We recognize, as I am sure our European partners do,
that there are limits on what governments by themselves
can accomplish. It is clear that a great deal will depend
upon the private sector and its readiness to seize and

develop the opportunities which are identified. Similarly
we appreciate that there will be an important role to be
played by our provincial governments if full advantage is
to be taken of the opportunities presented.
Now that the Agreement is signed the work of the Joint
Co-operation CommitteeAnd I will come to that in a moment.
-set up by the Agreement, can begin. There is, of course,
much to be done before we will see returns on our
investment. The Agreement, however, represents a starting point-we must now work together to make it the
success it can be.
The agreement, which I shall not read because it was tabled
in this chamber at the time of its signing, does admittedly lead
one on first reading to conclude that it is not an agreement of
specific substance in itself as would be a preferential trade
agreement. You cannot point to a specific paragraph and say,
"There is a specific agreement we have arrived at that will do
such and such for our trading relationship." It does, however,
contain one, in my view, extremely significant article, and that
is Article IV. It is very short and reads as follows:
A Joint Co-operation Committee shall be set up to
promote and keep under review the various commercial
and economic co-operation activities envisaged between
Canada and the Communities. Consultations shall be held
in the Committee at an appropriate level in order to
facilitate the implementation and to further the general
aims of the present Agreement. The Committee will
normally meet at least once a year. Special meetings of
the Committee shall be held at the request of either party.
Sub-committees shall be constituted where appropriate in
order to assist the Committee in the performance of its
tasks.
So that an instrument is created by this agreement, an
instrument which either side can insist be called into being,
and by which either side can ask the committee to convene
from time to time, in addition to which subcommittees can
carry out continuing or ongoing work. This means that if the
Canadian government, through any one of its departments,
feels it can identify areas where Canadian trading or other
interests would be advanced by some cooperative investigation
as between ourselves and the European Community, an instrument exists whereby we can say, "Please, look at this with us."
We do not have to go and ask them to please do so; they must
do so under the agreement. And, of course, it will mean that
officials on both sides of the ocean are going to have to spend a
number of years in what will be little less than a "fine-tooth
comb" operation, going through various areas to find and
identify those that might have potential for cooperative work
between ourselves and the Community.
I think the other thing that it is important for Canadians to
keep in mind-particularly the business Community, in availing itself of this new window that has been opened on
Europe-is that the Community as an entity will in comparatively few cases be itself entering into meaningful agreements

SENATE DEBATES
and arrangements. In most cases it will be the individual
countries making up the Community which will enter into
these agreements on a bilateral basis, and this focus is important, because the agreement is in place and the committee
which will be structured under Article IV can be used not only
to identify areas of cooperation with the Community as a
whole, but areas of cooperation between Canada and individual states within the Nine.
I might say that just before these meetings commenced I
took the opportunity, while being in Europe, to visit Paris for
one day, and I spent two most informative hours with our
ambassador there, Mr. Gérard Pelletier, who had focussed
extremely clearly on this agreement. He was at pains to make
that particular point to me, and I appreciated his doing so
because I think it is most important for us to keep in mind.
I would like at this point to mention an example of the
thoughtfulness of our hosts while we were in Europe. They had
arranged the scheduling of work in the European Parliament
in such a fashion that the contractual link-which requires
ratification by both Parliaments, incidentally-would come
before the European Parliament while the Canadian delegation was there. We had the privilege of sitting in the gallery
where our party was graciously recognized by the President,
and we listened to the debate on the agreement and the
explanations given, under the mechanism in that Parliament,
by the senior civil servant responsible for the agreement, Sir
Christopher Soames, and it was indeed adopted that very
afternoon we were there. We all thought this was a most
generous and thoughtful gesture on the part of our hosts.
One of the other areas of great interest to the Canadian
delegation was the whole question of direct election. I think it
is difficult at first blush to fully appreciate what a monumental step this is for the Europeans to take. We are here talking
about nine nations in Europe, with a history of hundreds of
years of strife and warfare, not only coming together economically but deliberately moving toward a higher degree of political integration. Surely, it will be one of the most momentous
decisions of history if this takes place.
The heads of state of the Nine have stipulated that direct
elections are to take place by 1978, which is less than two
years away, and we were keen to inquire of our colleagues
there whether or not this target would indeed be met, because
the problems are immense. We found with very few exceptions
that they were convinced that the target date would be met.
They were enthusiastic to see that it was met.

e

(1440)

One of the stumbling blocks in its way is the problem of
proportional representation. It must be kept in mind, I think,
that without exception every country on the continent which is
a member of the Community has one form or another of
proportional representation in its parliament, so that the
makeup of the parliament represents, within reasonable limits,
the percentage vote of the electorate. This, of course, is foreign
to our system and the British system, and it has been agreed,
therefore, because it is impossible for the British to make such
a departure from their traditional system in time for the 1978

November 17, 1976

elections, that the first elections will be under the form of
electoral procedure existing at the moment in each one of the
member states. They have left the question of proportional
representation for solution at a later date.
I would say that the only representatives in the Parliament
that we found negative to direct elections by 1978 were the
British Labour Party members. One wag in Europe made the
remark that, really, the Labour Party members in Britain are
now the new Tories-inward-looking and restrictive. But even
the Labour Party acknowledges that the government is committed to the elections, and they only argue that they cannot
do it by 1978; it may take another year. So that we should see
before the end of this decade, on a universal franchise, a
directly elected Parliament representing the 250 to 260 million
Europeans of those nine countries. That is a most remarkable
forward step in the history of democratic government.
This will bring with it some obvious other changes. There
has not been too much progress in the European Community
in the last four or five years on the economic side for a number
of reasons, the principal one being, I think, the advent of the
oil crisis and the general downturn of the economy. This has
been a time of retrenchment and great economic difficulty in
Europe, and it has not been an auspicious period in which to
move the Common Market forward. Its movement forward in
the area of direct elections is really the only visible movement
at this particular time. That is why this is particularly
important.
There is a feeling in Europe, although the parliamentarians
do not spell it out too loudly lest they frighten off their
respective governments, that once this Parliament is elected by
universal franchise it will inevitably start taking unto itself
more power; not directly, not immediately, but by a process of
osmosis over a number of years. Rather than the Council of
Ministers being the political instrument of the European Community, the Parliament will start becoming the political instrument. It will start to achieve some power over the purse
strings, and, indeed, this will be the first really major step to
the European Community's advancing on the political side as
it has advanced in the past, with such marvelous success, on
the economic side.
While we were in Luxembourg to meet with the European
Parliament, we had at the same time opportunity to have
individual meetings with the principal party groupings, during
which we discussed such things as these direct elections with
the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats, the Liberals and
the Socialists.
Following our three days in Luxembourg we proceeded to
Brussels. Brussels, as you understand, is the administrative
headquarters of the Community, the capital of the
Community.
I might digress here just to point out that the Parliament sits
in Strasbourg, France, and in Luxembourg, and the various
Community operations, such as the aeronautical ministry, and
things of that sort, which are the equivalent of Community
ministries, are divided among different members of the Com-

munity in different parts of Europe. So there is a great deal of
movement back and forth by their parliamentarians and their
civil servants.
Apart from briefings by civil servants of the Community in
Brussels on questions such as energy, uranium and other
matters of mutual interest, we were again-and I say "again",
because this is the third time I have been privileged to attend
such a luncheon-we were again graciously entertained at
lunch by Sir Christopher Soames, one of the senior commissioners of the Community and the commissioner responsible
for external arrangements. Sir Christopher will be leaving that
post at the end of this year when the British commissioner,
Mr. Roy Jenkins, will be taking over the presidency of the
Community, and it is rumoured that Sir Christopher is interested in returning to domestic politics in Britain. I was sorry
the other day, therefore, to read in the papers that he had been
taken seriously ill. I know you all join with me in wishing him
a speedy recovery.
It is a fact that Sir Christopher does not treat the contractual link with Canada lightly. Indeed, he has been working
strenuously to develop a similar link with China, and I am sure
I am not disclosing a confidence if I say that he was
encouraged by the progress he had been making, and had even
hoped that he might be at the point of settling some agreement
with China prior to his leaving office at the end of this year. It
was only the death first of Chou En Lai, and later of Mao Tse
Tung, that put that out of the question.
So while this was a Canadian initiative, it is not confined to
Canada, and the European Community is looking actively to
using this format elsewhere.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I quote from the gracious speech given on the occasion of the farewell banquet for
our delegation by the Chairman of the European delegation,
Mr. Bersani:
In July 1973, the Canadian Senate Committee on
Foreign Affairs, of which our eminent colleagues Senators
van Roggen and Lafond were members, published a particularly important report entitled "The Relations of
Canada with the European Community".
This is the report to which I referred a few moments ago.
This excellent document constituted such a powerful
searchlight on the pathway to our recent cooperation that,
in fact, almost all the recommendations which it contained have been followed and transformed into concrete
measures either by specific actions or by actual
institutions.
You recommended, Senators, an overall agreement of
economic cooperation. You have obtained the Framework
Agreement of commercial and economic cooperation. You
asked for appropriate methods of consultation and you
have the joint cooperation committee. You have expressed
the wish that the European Community establish a delegation and an information service in Ottawa. That too has
become an accomplished fact since last autumn thanks

mainly to the budgetary support of the European
Parliament.
I might digress to say that that is quite true. That office
would not be open in Ottawa today were it not for the
strenuous support that we received from the parliamentary
wing in Europe, as opposed to the Commission.
Finally you have argued in favour of a regular parliamentary link with the European Parliament. Is it necessary to
underline that this liaison now exists, that it was approved
by a unanimous resolution of the European Parliament in
April 1974 and that it occupies in the parliamentary
relations of our Parliament a particularly privileged place.
My dear Canadian friends, rarely have parliamentary
initiatives had such excellent and rapid success.

Honourable senators, I congratulate the members of the
Canadian delegation, all of whom effectively, knowledgeably
and fluently represented the Canadian Parliament in all of the
discussions that took place. I should also like to add that this
parliamentary relationship, being a relationship with what
may well become the largest democratically elected parliament
in the history of the world, is one that we should cherish and
foster in the years to come.
Senator Burchill: I wonder if I might ask the honourable
senator a question? How will the representatives at the European Parliament be chosen?
Senator van Roggen: As I tried to explain during the course
of my remarks, the Community has agreed that for the first
election, which is to take place in 1978, the individual member
countries will be able to establish their own rules as to how
they will arrive at the election of their allocated number of
members of the Parliament.
One of the difficult things that had to be negotiated, of
course, prior to agreement on direct election, was the number
of representatives to which each country would be entitled. In
that respect, two or three years ago we were able to give some
examples of the situation in a federated state such as Canada,
where we do not have fully proportional representation to the
nth degree, as proportional representation, of course, could
result in some of the smaller provinces being represented by
only one member of Parliament and, therefore, a minimum
number must be agreed upon. This was particularly important
to the European Parliament. Agreement has now been reached
on representation, and each country will elect its share of
representatives in its own way for the first election.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, as one of
those privileged to represent this chamber on this very important visit to the European Parliament, I should like to make a
few comments, but I shall not do so until I have had an
opportunity to contemplate what Senator van Roggen has said.
I therefore move the adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Senator Smith (Colchester), debate
adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, on October 28 last
Senator Forsey asked a question concerning the position of
Director of Information Services, Department of Justice. He
asked:
Who is now Director of Information Services in the
Department of Justice?
I am able to inform members of this chamber that the position
is vacant.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, since there is no mention of the adjournment, does this mean we are going to sit
tomorrow?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the reply may be
available shortly. The intention is to revert to motions later
this day. There is a possibility that an important piece of
proposed legislation will be referred to this chamber for consideration next week. We will know in a short time.
Senator Flynn: Is that the same piece of legislation that the
Leader of the Government was expecting three weeks ago?
Senator Perrault: There is a continuing and abiding concern
on the part of this government for exactitude in wording and
draftsmanship of proposed legislation. The concern is not
haste, but care.
Senator Flynn: I can understand the need for care, but I
doubt that that is what is causing the delay. I find it easier to
believe that the government is in complete disarray. After all,
the Speech from the Throne was presented quite some time
ago, and we were told then that some very important legislation would be forthcoming. Not one of these new pieces of
legislation has yet been introduced, either here or in the other
place.

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Perrault: The Leader of the Opposition is aware of
the constitutional and procedural rules. All matters which
relate to expenditure of taxation moneys and revenues must
originate in the other place. Because of a sequence of events
which have occurred since the opening of this second session of
Parliament, almost all measures scheduled thus far relate to
the expenditure of moneys and therefore must originate in the
other chamber. I want to assure honourable senators, however,
that we expect to be extremely busy very shortly.
Senator Flynn: As usual, just before Christmas, I suppose.

financial assistance to water transportation which will involve
respective provincial governments also in supporting these
services. The recent action taken in British Columbia is in line
with the new policy and it should be noted that the Government of British Columbia has assumed responsibility for the
movement of passengers previously catered to by Northland on
a cost-sharing basis with the federal government.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
VISIT OF CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS-DEBATE

CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday debate on the inquiry of
Senator van Roggen, calling the attention of the Senate to the
visit of Canadian Parliamentarians to the European Parliament from 13th to 16th September, 1976.
Hon. George I. Smith: Honourable senators, as I mentioned
on adjourning this debate yesterday, I found it a very interesting and instructive privilege to be part of this important
delegation. I want to congratulate Senator van Roggen on his
co-leadership, along with that of, first, John Roberts, now the
Honourable John Roberts, and then Mr. Fleming. It was a
pleasure to work with him, and he was certainly an excellent
representative of Canada in leading that delegation.
I agree that the arrangements, in general, were very good
indeed, with the exception of a period of 30 or 40 minutes,
which I think Senator van Roggen escaped because he took
some other route, when some of us were left at the railway
station at Luxembourg for non-existent taxis or, at least, taxis
that did not arrive. All in all, the arrangements made by the
staff were excellent, and Mr. Marleau and Mrs. Seaborn, who
travelled with us, deserve our thanks which I am glad to
express to them.
The speech of Senator van Roggen, as is always the case,
was a clear exposition of the thoughts that he wished to put
before us. However, he was guilty of what I thought was one
serious oversight. You may remember that in his speech
yesterday he made reference to the remark of a person, whom
he referred to as a wag from the European delegation, who
was criticizing the Labour Party members from England and
saying that they were now the new Tories of Europe, that they
were inward-looking and restrictive. I thought it would have
instantly sprung to Senator van Roggen's mind to point out to
that wag that there must really be a misconception, because

November 18, 1976

the Tories in this country, as Senator van Roggen knows, are
certainly the most forward-looking, most progressive and most
internationally minded of all.
Senator Perrault: Don't be political.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I am not; I am completely
factual.
Senator Greene: Did you write that speech?
Senator Smith (Colchester): This was a most congenial
group of parliamentarians. Unfortunately, while it would
otherwise have consisted of members of every party represented in our Parliament, the two selected to represent the New
Democratic Party and the Social Credit Party were at the last
moment unable to go.
There was, at least from my point of view, one very unusual
occurrence. Both Senator van Roggen and I have referred to
the fact that Mr. Roberts is now the Honourable Mr. Roberts,
a member of the cabinet. It is the first time I can recall ever
having been in the presence of a Liberal when he was informed
that he was appointed to the cabinet. It was, indeed, not only
an unusual but a very enjoyable situation. Some of us were in
the hotel with him when the message came, and I hope he
considered our response to be of an appropriate congratulatory
nature, accompanied by those things designed to emphasize
the geniality of congratulation.
While we were there we had the pleasure of meeting-some
of us for the first time, while others renewed their acquaintance-our two splendid ambassadors, if I may refer to them in
that way, Mr. Cadieux, our ambassador to the European
Economic Community, and Mr. Lamoureux, our ambassador
to Brussels and Luxembourg, both of them distinguished and
congenial gentlemen. It was a delight to be with them. We
noted from some of our conversations with the European
people who took part in the negotiation of the contractual link,
which we were there in part to discuss, that Mr. Cadieux, in
particular, took a prominent part in the negotiations leading
up to the signing of the document.
Senator van Roggen bas told you of the format of the
meetings. As he said, at Luxembourg we met the delegation
from the European Economic Community Parliament, under
the chairmanship of Mr. Bersani of Italy, a delightful and able
gentleman. The delegations exchanged questions and discussed
them. We discussed a variety of items on a prepared agenda,
and we visited various political party representatives in their
own quarters-by which I do not mean Tories visiting only
Tories and Liberals visiting only Liberals, because each of us
was afforded an opportunity to meet the representatives of a
very wide spectrum of political opinion in Europe.
After some days at Luxembourg we went on to Brussels,
where we had some most interesting and useful discussions
with those who might be called the senior public servants of
the Community. One of the many pleasant recollections and
events of our visit there was a lunch hosted by Sir Christopher
Soames, the Commissioner responsible for external affairs and
who later, as I shall mention, delivered a most interesting and
useful speech. I was sorry to learn from Senator van Roggen

November 18, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

yesterday that Sir Christopher Soames is now not in good
health, and I join with the honourable senator in wishing him
very warmly a quick return to health and strength.
*

(1420)

Senator van Roggen read the questions that were posed by
our delegation, but he refrained from mentioning the nature of
the discussions which took place regarding those questions. I
suspect he did that out of kindness to me, so that I would be
left to deal with them. Be that as it may, with your permission
I would like to give a summary of the discussions that took
place regarding some of those questions.
The first question dealt with the hopes of the Community
based on the forthcoming direct election of members of their
Parliament by the people of the countries to which they
belong. As you know, they are now not elected directly, but are
elected, or selected, from their respective parliaments by their
governments, or by those parliaments. The Canadian delegation was certainly very interested in ascertaining their views as
to whether this would be a helpful change in their system of
representation. The response of the Community delegation was
that they feel confident that these elections will go forward
and meet the target date of election of 1978. They took some
trouble, I thought, to point out to us that while the elections
are important in themselves, they really are a step toward what
many of them hope, at least, would be a broader type of
integration.
With respect to what some thought might be the increased
powers of the Parliament once it derived its mandate directly
from the people in the various countries which the Parliament
represented, they were not very clear on how or to what extent
this might be changed, or what powers might be increased.
However, they did say that it seemed to them that it was
almost inevitable that people who drew their mandate directly
from the people in elections would not be satisfied without
some increased power to deal with the many and very difficult
important problems which come before the Community. They
pointed out, however, that it is hard to make any prediction,
because nearly all-I believe they said at least four-fifths-of
the directly elected members would be different from those
who now compose the Parliament and, moreover, the Parliament would be twice the size of the present one.
One expression of thought was that the Parliament, once
elected, would be able to influence a good deal more the
acceptance or rejection of the budgets put forward by the
Commission itself and, indeed, I believe one or two expressed
the thought that directly elected people would insist that they
have the power to approve or reject the budget.
There was a question asked by the Canadians about the
Common Market agricultural policy. The reply from the Europeans was just about, I suppose, as we have noted in reading
about it over the years. They stated that the purpose of their
common agricultural policy is to ensure that the European
consumer gets produce at a reasonable price, and that there
will be a guaranteed supply. They readily acknowledged that a
very difficult situation existed within the Market concerning
agricultural matters, and, somewhat to my surprise, it was

pointed out that at that time they were suffering substantial
and difficult surpluses in some products. They mentioned
particularly a surplus of milk. I noticed, however, that there
was no agreement among all members of the delegation on
that point.
A vigorous parliamentarian expressed, as strongly as he
could, the thought that the policy was not working and would
not work unless the principles underlying it were substantially
changed, and that it was time the Community realized that.
However, it would be safe to say that he appeared to be part of
a minority of two.
There was some response to the injurious effect of this year's
prolonged drought in Europe and the British Isles, which it
was felt certain would result in a drop in dairy herd production
and, indeed, in overall agriculture production, far below the
average of the past few years. It was felt that this might have
implications for North America, because it would mean
increased imports of soya and animal foodstuffs.
Another question posed by the Canadians had to do with the
liberalization of trade-I hate to use such a word, but I assure
the Leader of the Government that I do so non-politicallyparticularly where there is a considerable number of what
might be called non-tariff barriers to extension of trade between the Community and Canada.
An example pointed out by Canada of what might be a very
effective and difficult non-tariff barrier for Canada to meet
would be a proposed requirement changing the standard of
newsprint exported by Canada to the Community-a change
which I understand is referred to in the trade as waterlining,
which requires papermaking machines to produce more slowly
and this has a noticeable effect upon costs.
Some of our delegation who were knowledgeable on this
point took the view that although it was not intended as a
non-tariff barrier, it would be a very effective one indeed if it
were insisted upon.
A very interesting question, and one of substantial importance to Canada, was asked relating to the Canadian delegation's views concerning possible incompatibilities between the
aim of strengthening economic cooperation and the demand in
Canada for greater economic sovereignty. Reference was made
particularly to the question of potash and the Government of
Saskatchewan.
The reply from the Canadian delegation was to the effect
that provincial jurisdiction in the field of natural resources,
according to our Constitution, was predominant, that it might
be reasonable to assume that part of the motive for Saskatchewan's action was related to the question of sufficient yield to
the public treasury of Saskatchewan, or to the people of
Saskatchewan, for use of their resources, and that this was
probably involved in the question of taxation to be derived
from the natural resource by both the province and the Government of Canada.
It was also emphasized with suitable strength, I think, that
the first purchase by the Government of Saskatchewan had
been made. It seemed to have been done by successful negotia-

SENATE DEBA TES
tion. Evidence available to the Canadian delegation indicated
a substantial measure of fair play and that a fair price was
offered. From all the evidence that was then available to the
Canadian delegation it appeared that there was substantial
evidence of fair play and of a fair price being offered, and we
thought this ought to be some reassurance.

The Europeans pointed out more than once during this
discussion that there was a substantial European investment in
potash in Saskatchewan and that, therefore, this was of more
than average concern to their financial side.
So much for the questions. There were others, such as that
relating to.the Helsinki agreement, the cooperation between
industrialized countries and the less developed countries, but
as time is moving on I had also better move on.
I come now to one of the topics on the agenda for discussion
by the plenary session of the two delegations. One such topic
dealt with the European Economic Community-Canada
framework agreement. Mr. Bersani, who was the leader of the
European delegation, led off the discussion. He expressed a
very warm welcome to the signing of the agreement, and, as I
think Senator van Roggen said yesterday, expressed his belief
that this would open substantial new horizons for both parties.
However, both he and other members of his delegation soon
made it clear to us, both at that meeting and later on that
afternoon as we listened to the debate in the European Parliament itself, that they were disappointed about the difficulty, as
they called it, with reference to the principle of equal access to
Canadian raw materials, and that this was certainly not dealt
with to everybody's satisfaction in the Community. They then
went on to express concern about our legislation dealing with
foreign investment, such as the Foreign Investment Review
Act.
Mr. Bersani, I think it was, but in any event one of his
delegation, expressed some puzzlement as to how the present
legislation could avoid causing difficulties for European investors in Canada. The Canadian side attempted to allay the
European apprehensions on both these points of concern. They
pointed out in respect of the foreign investment legislation that
Canadian industry was already subject to a high percentage of
foreign control simply because of foreign investment, and that
this was one of the underlying reasons for such legislation. It
was said that the intent was not to exclude foreign investment
but to ensure that, when made, it worked for the benefit of
Canada. The point was made, too, that the number of disallowments under this legislation was not great. However, I
think it would be only fair to say that some members of the
Canadian delegation made it pretty clear that the conception,
the implementation and existence of this legislation was not
universally admired in Canada and that perhaps the Europeans would find a more welcoming response from some other
sources.
One subject which the European delegation chairman raised
at least twice and pursued with some care concerned the
strengthening of the parliamentary links between the Parliaments of Canada and of the Community. He suggested that

November 18. 1976
November

18

1976

there might well be a more formal structure to achieve this,
perhaps considered as a joint political level committee within
the purview of the framework arrangement. He went so far as
to suggest an on-going system with its own secretariat which,
between annual meetings, could discuss relationships as they
carried on and as new ones occurred under the framework
agreement, and could prepare an agenda for regular meetings.
Indeed, it would not only prepare an agenda but would prepare
the necessary information for useful discussion at such
meetings.
The Canadian side responded positively to those ideas and
undertook to consider their possibility on return to Canada.
When we came to listen to the debate as to whether or not
the agreement should be approved-I think that was the word
they used-approved by the Economic Parliament, we heard
much the same type of discussions there as I have already
mentioned. The question of access to raw materials and the
question of non-discriminatory treatment of foreign investment
were particularly emphasized. Several speakers mentioned the
particular European interest in Canada's raw materials and
the possibility of high technology exchanges and joint ventures.
The debaters also stressed the view that Senator van Roggen
put before us yesterday, and with which I certainly agree, that
the success of the agreement would ultimately depend on the
use made of it by businessmen on both sides. It was of
considerable interest after what seemed to me to be a lively
debate to note that in the final analysis the agreement was
approved unanimously.
Another item on the agenda, which I have already referred
to because it was part of a question, relates to the common
agricultural policy. The discussion was much the same as I
mentioned in relation to the question, but there were one or
two specific points made by the Europeans. One complained
about Canadian and American import quotas on European
cheese, for instance, and urged that there be consultation with
all people concerned before restrictions were placed on
imports. In that discussion the question was put to us as to
whether or not Canada agreed with what was alleged to be
talked of favourably in the United States, namely, the use of
food as a political weapon. I think without the slightest
reservation all the delegates from the Canadian side agreed
that that could not be or ought not to be accepted as an
instrument of national policy, and did not believe that Canada
would ever be likely to consider such a policy.
One of the most interesting and, from the point of view of
some of us at least, one of the more inconclusive discussions
turned on the question of the influence of communist parties in
western European governments and the possibility of their
succeeding in getting into office by the ballot, either alone or
in cooperation with other parties. In fact, as I recall it, one of
the Canadian members put the straight question to a communist member of the European delegation, "If you got power by
the ballot, would you relinquish power by the ballot?" I think
he believes that the question was never answered, but there
was a lengthy discussion and I think probably it was intended
to be answered, and answered in an affirmative way.

Some members of the delegation were not thoroughiy convinced, even after the discussion had been compieted. it was,
however, extremeiy interesting to hear a leading member of
that party in France, which is one of the strongest Communist
Parties in Europe, discuss at sorne iength what he said was his
phiiosophy of government.
In Brusseis we had an opportunity to meet with ieading
public servants of the European Economic Commission and to
discuss with them a number of subjects of common interest. 1
have already referred to the hospitality of the Commission
members at a luncheon presided over by Sir Christopher
Soarnes, at which he made a very interesting speech. He
aiiuded with great earnestness to the fact that we shouid flot
take back to Canada any impression that we might have
gained frorn iistening to the discussion in Luxembourg, to
which I referred, that the Community was oniy interested in
Canada's raw materiais, and in particular its uranium. He
made the point that that was not so, that there were many
areas in which he feit there couid and shouid be cooperation
between the Community and Canada. Once more hie said, as
was said so often to us, that the businessmen on both sides
were reaiiy the key to the success of the agreement.
Among the subjects we discussed with the experts at the
Commission in Brusseis were three or four which I shouid like
to make brief mention of. We discussed with a senior officiai
of the Commission the prescrnt state of affairs in the Community and the functioning and struggies withîn the varîous
Community institutions, such as the Parliament, the Commission, the Councii of Ministers, and so forth. We aiso discussed
the prospects for widening the activities of the Community and
the further integration of the various member nations into it.
He said that advances beyond the ordinary Common Market
ideas had certainiy been gained in external affairs in that the
Community had evoived common poiicies in dealing with some
of the Eastern European countries and the deveiopîng counttries, and certain common policies. in relation to the generai
agreernent on tariffs and trade.
We had a fairly iengthy discussion with the senior experts in
relation to energy. They said that aithough oniy about 10 per
cent of the eiectricai power in the Comrnunity was boday
produced from nucicar sources, this was expected to increase
to 50 per cent over the next 10 years. They said that, based on
presenit prospects, it looked as though by the year 2000 nuclear
sources wouid generate sornething in the order of 80 per cent
of the Community's eiectricai power. That, of course, is one
expianation as to why the Community is so interested in
having access to our raw materiais, particuiarly our uranium.
Another interesting statement was that if that in fact did take
place by the year 2000, the Cornrunity wouid be consuming
about one-third of aul the uranium consumed in the Western
Worid. This seemed to them, and I suppose rightiy so, to pose
a very serious probiem for the future.
We aiso discussed tîdai power, of which they know somnething about because for some years now there bas been a tidai
power project operating on the River Rance near Saint Maio
80003-11

in Brittany. The British have also been carrying out serious
investigations into the use of tidal power in various places in
Britain, the most favoured one being, 1 believe, on the River
Severn.
We aiso discussed with these officiais the Joint Cooperation
Committee under the framework agreement. That cornrittee
is to meet twice a year. There wîil be subcommittees, but their
areas of competence are flot fuliy worked out as yet. The first
meeting of the committee is to be heid thîs montb.
At first it was thought that the committees would be entireiy
at the bureaucratic level. It is hoped-and hoped rather keenly-that in a very short time representatives of the private
sector will be sittîng on the committees. It is also the hope that
these committees wiii eventualiy succeed in encouraging the
formation of consortia, which would conceivably go beyond
long-term contracts and involve industriai cooperation.
Another subject of discussion was that of nuclear safeguards. In this connection a number of points were rnentioned,
one being that there was scope for Canadian cooperation in the
joint deveiopment of Canadian coal resources and the gasîfication of coal, a subject with which they are just as much
concerned in their countries as we are in ours.
Some of us were a bit disappointed to hear them maintain,
in spite of our arguments to the contrary, that whiie the
CANDU system. of generating eiectricity from nuclear power
is, in theory, recognized as one of the best methods, it bas so
far not turned out to be the cheapest. I arn not sure even now
that they are correct in that assertion. They saîd, however, that
the door is stîli open to discuss the possibilities of CANDU.
They certainiy did not discourage us from. believing that as
time goes on there will be useful discussions carried on witb
respect to the CANDU systern.
They feit that people in the European Economic Cornmunity
wouid look favourably at a joint venture with respect to the
Alberta tar sands, but almost immediately added the comment
that this would be most unlikely to corne about unless there
was compiete security of investment.
1 sbould like to conclude my remarks by pointing out, as did
Senator van Roggen, that this frarnework agreement, or contractual iink, is not so much an agreement about specifics, the
specifics of trade, as a mutuai recognition between tbe two
parties that opportunities exist to deveiop an increased and
increasing volume of trade between the Community and
Canada. 1 agree with Senator van Roggen that a great deai of
work wili be needed on both sides, not only by goverrnents
but particulariy by the private sectors. I want to emphasize,
however, that such information as I was able to gain about it
during this visit has convinced me that this is a reai opportunity, and I agree with Senator van Roggen that continuing
pariiarnentary contact is important and should be continued
and strengthened.
Senator Greene: Wouid the bonourabie senator permit a
question? You referred to the Community's agricuiturai policy
and one of its fundamentai piliars being security of supply.
Does that connote security of domestic suppiy or does it leave

SENATE DEBATES
roorn for imnports of such Canadian agricultural commodities
as grain and beef?
Senator Smith (Colchester): My impression was that insofar
as tbey can produce cornrodities tbemselves, they are talking
about security of dornestic supply. This is one of the things
which is a pillar, as I understand it, at least, of their agricultural policies. 0f course, tbey welcorne imports if they need
thern, because they cannot produce thern themselves.
e

(1450)

I gained the impression-and Senator Greene, of course,
will be far more familiar witb this subject than I, due to bis
experience in the agricultural field wbile Minister of Agriculture-that alI member countries regard their agricultural policies, and their agricultural industries, witb a very jealous eye
and are prepared to go to substantial lengtbs as individual
counitries to insist upon whatever financial support is necessary
to make those agricultural industries produce as mucb as tbey
require, if that is possible, of the various products wbich tbey
are fitted to produce.
Senator Greene: Their concern is more with productivity
and producers than it is with the price to the consumer, is it?
It certainly appears to be the case in our country.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I do not feel I arn qualified to
answer that. 1 tbink they want to convey to us tbat tbeir terrns
witb regard to prices take adequate note of their endeavours to
treat the consumer fairly; but I would not attempt to say bow
welI that worked.
On motion of Senator Stanbury, debate adjourned.
NORTHERN IRELAND
EFFORTS TO PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING AND RECONCILIATION

Hon. Andrew Thoinpson rose pursuant to notice of November 16, 1976:
That be will caîl the attention of the Senate to voluntary projects being undertaken to work towards understanding and reconciliation in Nortbern Island.
He said: Honourable senators, I risc witb some trepidation
to talk about certain projects which are being developed
towards understandîng and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
I amn fully aware that the problems of Northern Ireland wilI be
settled by the people of Nortbern Ireland, and when I made
my visit there I did so purely as an observer, and on a personal
basis. But I tbink the visit bas aroused considerable interest on
the part of Canadians.
I would like to empbasize that I went there, as 1 have said,
on a personal basis; that I had no solutions to offer, and neyer
intended to have any solutions to offer. It would be presumptuous of anyone to move into an area whicb bas such a complex
historical background and suggest that bie migbt have some
sirnplistic solution to the tragic situation that exists in Ireland.
I sbould perhaps clarify how I came to go on this trip. The
Honourable Barney Danson, wbile in another portfolio, had
asked me on a personal basis if I would assist two friends of

November 18 1976

his, women who were deeply committed to the cause of
Ulster's children-one beîng Lady Patricia Fisher, and the
other Mrs. Joan Robins-and who had started a trust fund
supported by botb Catbolics and Protestants in England and
Ireland. These ladies had travelled across the United States
and rnanaged to set up a separate trust fund there from whicb
they are receiving money, and tbey'are hoping that the saine
sort of tbing might be developed in Canada. Their object is to
raise funds to assist community projects whicb belp to break
down prejudice and distrust between different groups of
cbildren.
I arn really reporting, as I said before, because of the
compassionate interest on the part of many Canadians in the
tragic events taking place in Ireland, and particularly in tbe
effect tbat these are having on the children of Ireland.
1 sbould say that before 1 visited the ladies of this trust in
London I managed to persuade Clare Westcott-an executive
assistant to Premier Davis-who was in London at the time, to
corne witb me. 1 was very glad that hie agreed to do so because
hie is a person of great entbusiasm and drive, and be will be
assisting these ladies wben they corne to Canada.
The interest of Canadians in Ireland is, 1 tbink, understandable. The number of Canadians of Irish background amounts
to sornething like 1.7 million, according to the 1971 census,
and 1 suggest tbat about 1 million settled in Ontario. As 1
consider the Iength of time that the Irish have been in this
country-and 1 realize that there are probably many in this
chamber who have Irish backgrounds-I tbink of the book
wbicb was written by one of the Fathers of Confederation,
Thomas D'Arcy McGee, in wbich hie suggested that the first
Irish to find permanent bornes in Canada- were those who had
been banisbed frorn Barbados by Oliver Cromwell in 1649.
Immigrants from Nortbern Ireland, of which 1 arn one, were
arriving in substantial numbers as early as 1817, settling along
the shores of Lake Ontario in towns like Prescott, Kingston,
Cobourg, York and London. In fact, in the mid-nineteenth
century the Irish in Canada outnumbered botb the Englisb and
Scots. Those wbo have visited cemeteries in small communities
througbout Ontario will bave seen evidence of the hardsbip
experienced by tbe Irish immigrants who carne by sbip in tbose
early years. A Canadian Press report publisbed in tbe Ottawa
Journal in 1966 noted:
Tbe remains of 1,400 Irish immigrants were buried in a
common grave at the rear of Kingston General Hospital.
Tbey were moved and reinterred at St. Mary's Cemetery
yesterday. They bad ahl died of a typhus epidemic sbortly
after their arrival in the early 1800s. Workmen bad
uneartbed their remains to make roorn for a hospital
extension.
I think ahl of us will recognize that the Nortbern Irisbman
bas made bis contribution to life in the New World. I do not
know if bonourable senators are aware that of the 39 presidents of the United States 11 definitely came from Ulster but,
witb tbe perrnitted exaggeration of the Irish, it is claimed that
15 came from Ulster, and that, considering the srnall popula-

November 18. 1976

SNT

tion of tbat northeastern corner of Ireland, is a rather astonishing figure.
Two weeks ago, when I was in Ireland, 1 stayed for the
weekend near Enniskillen with the Brookeboroughs, the family
of the son of the former premier, and I went on the Sunday to
tbe family chapel. There the inscriptions on the walls record
the dedicated service which generations of that family had
given to the preservation of western civilization, namnes which I
arn sure ail of us recognize. For example, Alanbroke is there.
In that small country area other generals such as Montgomery
and Alexander had lived.
1 had better explain at the outset that my birthplace is
Belfast, but my rnother was born in Dublin. She spoke some
Gaelîc and went to Trinity College, I know, quite a littie ahead
of Senator Grosart-if 1 amn allowed to say that. My father
was from the north, and I understand that his ancestors had
come to Ulster in the time of King James I. That is a littie
before the Mayflower reached America. Yet there are sorne
wbo might suggest that an Ulsterman does not really belong to
Ireland, which is a bit like sayîng the Cabots or the Lodges do
not belong to Boston.
0 (1500)
There is a pluralistic society in the island of Ireland. There
are Ulster Scots, Anglo-Irish, non-Gaelic-urban and Gaelicurban. I want to say frankly that my enthusiasrn about going
back to the land of my birth was not very great. My family
had left Ireland wben I was littie more than an infant. I have
been confused, revulsed and ashamed of the reports of violence
between nominally religious groups in my motberland. It
seems sucb a ludicrous and tragic strife in tbe 20th century. I
was also ashamed of some of the strident and violent fanaticism of some northern Ireland spokesmen who have corne to
Canada to prornote their particular causes. But then, prior to
my going, I had read of the popular protests for peace
througbout Northern and Southern Ireland-women who were
uniting in peace parades through the ghetto areas, disgusted
and fed up with the brutality that was taking place in their
land. I became sure that what I had been reading about were
mostly the voices of extremists, and that there must be a
majority witb the wilI to win over the thuggery of the
extremists.
I do not intend to go through-and 1 would not be able toall of the historical background of the problemns in Northern
Ireland, but I would say that when I left Ireland almost 45
years ago most of the Catholic minority in Nortbern Ireland
had traditionally felt that they were discriminated against in
employment in both the public and private sector, in housing,
by gerrymandering of constituencies, and a restricted property
vote which they considered was slanted favourably towards the
betterment of the Protestant community. They saw no opportunity to participate in the government of Nortbern Ireland. A
very small minority of the Catholics in the north and in the
republic believed that guerrilla action against property and the
British Army would lead to an all-Ireland federal state witb
the consent of the Protestants in the north.
80003-11'/

EAE

On the other hand, the Protestants in Northern Ireland saw
themaselves as a beleaguered minority on the island of Ireland.
They felt threatened by the Catholic minority, which they
closely identified with tbe Republic of Ireland. They wanted to
protect their "Britisb" way of life against the danger from the
minority, and from the republic.
Today, after seven years of guerrilla warfare in Northern
Ireland, over 1,600 people have been killed. A recent report to
the churches, entitied Violence in Ireland, suggests that between 5 and 10 per cent of the population were forced to
evaduate their homes and move into ghettos 'of their own
religious denomînation. Inside these ghettos the streets were
blocked off, and the people cut themselves off from the normal
protection of law and order. Para-military power groups took
over with kangaroo courts and provided the discipline in each
area. People were tarred, feathered. and tied to lamp-posts by
the steps of churches so that the congregations could view the
victims as they left. The particular IRA punishment, in order
to maintain discipline in the ghetto, bas been to shoot those
whomn they consider to be wrong-doers, whetber women or
rnen, through the kneecaps. Extreme Protestants take their
victimi to some abandoned home to be beaten. This report to
the churches of Ireland describes one horrifying incident in
which a woman was beaten to death while lier child screamed
outside the door.
The total number of personal injury dlaims represents one
person in 60 of the wbole population of Nortbern Ireland.
There is clearly a much higher proportion for Derry or Belfast.
At least one encouraging aspect to me is the fact that the
report from which 1 bave taken these grim statistics came from
a joint working group of Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian and
Metbodist cburcbes and the Society of Friends.
I should say that after 1 bad arrived in England and had
seen botb Lady Fisher and Mrs. Robins witb Clare Westcott, I
decided I would like to go to Dublin to sec where my mother
had lived, and also to hear the point of view of the people of
the republic.
1 met Mr. Ritchie and bis first secretary, Mr. David Smith,
in Dublin, and they arranged for the superintendent to show
me througb the Daîl and Leinster House. He kindly introduced me to a number of tbe deputies of the Dail, and I found
the people there warmi and generous, and helpful in expressing
their points of view concerning the troubles in the north. My
talks were very informal, and it would be unfair and wrong for
me to quote statements made by any of the deputies or
members of Parliament, but certainly ahl expressed deep concern about the violence in the north.
Perhaps 1 could comment on the view of the Irish government with respect to the north, as explained to me by Mr.
Hughi Swift, who is assistant to Mr. Garret FitzGerald. Incidentally, if any honourable senator would like to read a
dispassionate and cool analysis of the problerns of Ireland, and
a sensitive presentation of possible solutions towards bringing
about greater understanding, I would strongly recornmend the
book by Garret FitzGerald, Towards a New Ireland, or Conor
Cruise O'Brien's States of Ireland.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE

* (1510)

I do not want to go at length into the historical background
of the problem, which was outlined to me by Mr. Hugh Swift,
but it was certainly refreshing, after my absence of 40 years, to
hear his explanation of several points. The first was one that I
had heard previously, as one does when listening to just one
side, that the republic in a sense gave token sponsorship to the
extremists going into the north. I am completely convinced
that that is wrong, and has no basis of fact today.
Some of you may have noted the circumstances under which
the President of Eire resigned. One of the reasons he resigned
was because he had the emergency bill tested in the Supreme
Court. This bill was harsher and more severe concerning the
apprehension of IRA members than anything in the north of
Ireland. I talked to Sir David House, the general in charge of
the army in Northern Ireland, who confirmed to me the
cooperation he is getting from the republic with respect to
security. Indeed, he said the security he has at this time can
and will be maintained, that they could operate within the
existing process of law, provided the situation does not deteriorate. Therefore, I do not think the assertion that the IRA
extremists get any kind of sympathy from the Irish government bas any foundation whatsoever, and should not be
considered.
Both the Republic of Ireland and Britain have indicated that
the unification of Ireland, which the Irish Constitution, in
Article 11, includes as a long-term aim, can come about only if
a majority in Northern Ireland desire it and show their desire
by a ballot. The Prime Minister of Ireland, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and other representatives who have come to America,
in many of their speeches here, in Britain and in other
countries, have stressed this fact. Let me quote Dr. Garret
FitzGerald. He said in Chicago in 1975:
The British presence in Ireland is no longer the basic
issue. Britain declared formally two years ago (in 1973)
that it would support Irish unity if a majority of the
people of Northern Ireland accepted it. That makes it
clear that in our day the problem of Ireland is one of the
relations between Irishmen in Ireland . . . There are some

who see things more simplistically and advocate reunification by force over the corpses of our fellow-Irishmen. At
election after election they fail to win the support of more
than a tiny fraction-six to seven per cent-of the Irish
people. They claim to be working to "free" Ireland, but
their chief victims have been other Irishmen.
In that same speech, speaking to the Americans, he said:
You, as Americans, committed to democracy, will not
easily accept a theory that is based on the nonsensical
assumption that 95 per cent of the Irish people in Ireland
in electing successive governments have all turned traitor
to their country, and that only a small minority who are
prepared to gun down fellow Irishmen in Northern Ireland are faithful to the high ideals of patriotism.
And yet, despite such manifestation of concern, I ran into
deep-rooted suspicion among those in Northern Ireland. There

are still those who consider that the Catholic minority is
plotting the violent overthrow of any northern government in
order to unify Ireland. From such suspicions arise major
obstacles to the easing of tension in that section of the country.
There are many obstacles to overcome. One of the controversies has been about power sharing-in other words, the
suggestion that if there is an administration or a government
for Northern Ireland it is important that the Catholic minority
should not only feel that they can participate but can actually
be appointed so that they in fact do have some participation in
their government. Some representatives of the Northern Ireland people suggested to me that they could never permit-as
they put it-Catholics who would want to abolish the government of Northern Ireland to positions of authority. Why on
earth, they argue, would they put them into positions of
authority to destroy that government? Mr. Maudling of Britain, in trying to resolve the polarization of the extremist
Catholic and Protestant sides-and the latter based on apprehensions they have about the Catholic minority in Northern
Ireland-has suggested that when there is a Catholic minority
representative appointed, then the individual appointed would
have to affirm to two things: first, that he rejects the use of
violence, and, secondly, that he accepts that the reunification
of Ireland would come only with the consent of the majority.
I had the opportunity to meet a great number of politicians
from every spectrum of Northern Irish society and, in general,
I had a great respect for them. I think we should be aware that
the situation there is one in which they risk not only their jobs
when they try to overcome the obstacles of prejudice, but also
their lives. Three senators have been killed during these
troubles because of the moderate stands they have taken.
Many others have suffered attacks on themselves, their families and their homes. I have great admiration for their work
toward reconciliation, and the flexibility that many are showing in trying to solve this terrible problem.
In Stormont I had the privilege of meeting with Mr. Concannon, one of the junior ministers of the British Government.
He impressed me with the drive and dedication he is bringing
to his difficult job in Northern Ireland. I met with dedicated,
courageous churchmen-bishops and clergymen. I met with
Mr. Napier of the Alliance, which is a political group made up
of Protestants and Catholics. It takes extraordinary courage to
represent such a body. Mr. Fitt, who was the leader of the
SDLP group, had faced personal danger; his family and his
home had been assaulted. I met with former Unionist members
who have shown moderation and a deep desire to understand
the other person's viewpoint. I met with many ordinary
citizens.
a

(1520)

I met with, as I said earlier, Lord Brookeborough, who bas
represented the interests of Northern Ireland in the House of
Lords, particularly with respect to investment for industries.
He has also very clear ideas about what should be done in the
way of security, and a concise understanding of the philosophy
and role of terrorists in urban societies. He has studied the
terrorist philosophy of Carlos Maragehlla. I should say that

when I talked to the government in Dublin they emphasized
very strongly that a political solution could be arrived at hand
in hand with the need for security.
I do not want to paint a completely black picture of a
chaotic country, but I do want to speak of the immense efforts
which are being made to engender a favourable climate for
investment, to create new employment, and to attract more
non-British firms to the area. The manpower training programs in the north of Ireland, with its labour force which is
skilled and enthusiastic to work, are claimed to be the best in
Europe. One aspect, for example, is the integrated work force
they train. They will take a group of 12 or less for a small
industry, and train them to work as a group before and after
the factory is opened. I saw one of these at Tyrone Crystal.
Incidentally, I should say that this is a crystal factory which
has been started in the north of Ireland by Father Eustace.
Father Eustace is a believer in cooperative methods, and he
felt that there should be an integrated work force composed of
Protestant and Catholic young people in Northern Ireland. He
certainly must be an amazing person, because of the ability he
has shown in getting concrete projects under way. He has
started this and other industries in which the composition of
employees is both Catholic and Protestant.
There are brand new factories to be provided which are
rent-free for the first three years. I went to see some of these.
After the first three years there is a very easy lease term of 21
years. There are generous tax concesssions. Indeed, a survey of
nine EEC countries showed that Northern Ireland's concessions to medium-capital-intensive projects are the best. There
are nearly 300 manufacturing firms which have located in
Ulster during the past 20 years. These include such companies
as Dupont, the Ford Motor Company which, when I was
leaving, was making an expansion, Goodyear, Hughes Tool
and Old Bushmills Distillery, which I should not forget. That
is owned by Canadian interests, Seagrams, and no part of
Ireland's industry and history should ever exclude a mention of
Bushmills!
Everyone, I think, would agree that employment is one of
the most important means by which to stabilize this problem
area. I visited Shortt Brothers, again through the good services
of Mr. Concannon, and saw the SD3-30, which is an aircraft
for short distances-a commuter aircraft which will carry 30
passengers. I had some interest in that because for a short
period I was the chairman of a regional airline. In my opinion,
this is a first-class airplane, and three of them have been
bought by Time Air Company in Lethbridge. The engine is
made in Montreal, and I think we should all watch with
interest to see just how effective will be its use in Canada.
When I went to Belfast it was a very sad experience for me
initially. I went by train from Dublin, and there were very few
passengers on it. I had been told I would be staying with a
Quaker just on the outskirts of Belfast, and that when I got
into a taxi I was not to speak at all to the driver, but just give
the address and keep quiet until I got to my destination. I went
through a scarred city, with bombed areas and empty boardedup houses. It was an extraordinarily depressing sight for me.

The person with whom I stayed was Mr. Sydney Stewart, who
is the director of the Belfast volunteers. He directs a number
of volunteers who work on projects in the ghetto areas.
I believe, honourable senators, you would find it hard to
imagine just exactly how these areas have been taken over by
what I would refer to as a Mafia-type criminal. The people
have to use "black" taxis, for example, to go through these
ghetto areas. Many regular buses have been bombed and the
only way to get into these areas, unless you wish to walk, is to
use one of these taxis. It will be driven either by a person who
is acceptable to the Catholic area, or one who is acceptable to
the Protestant area. The fares, I understand, are cheap, being
about 10 pence for the trip. Mr. Stewart arranged for me to
see some of the projects which the trust is financing. Lady
Patricia Fisher had come with me, but was advised that she
would not be allowed to go to some of these places because of
the danger to her life.
I was taken, for example, into one ghetto area, down a
small, dank corridor with small tenement houses on each side.
The reason I could go down to the bottom of this street was
that the volunteer who accompanied me was acceptable to
them and was helping with their recreational program. No
policeman, postman or taxi driver could venture down there
without approval. When we got to the end we talked with a
woman who was trying to start a recreation project in an
abandoned warehouse for the children on this street. The
reason that something is needed so badly in these areas is that
the children will not leave the ghetto street area. The movie
houses have been bombed and there is really no form of
entertainment to which they dare go. So the trust has been
attempting to start a number of these projects in ghetto areas.
They have also got play buses, which will drive into these
areas. I should say that none of these has been bombed as yet.
They pick up some children and move into another area to pick
up more, and try to get some type of recreational program
going between the children. There are many other ways in
which this trust is helping. These include community centres
where people can get together on weekends and children, in
particular, both Catholic and Protestant, can have a holiday
and then return to their communities.
One of the things which certainly has raised hope for the
north of Ireland has been the courage of the two peace women,
Mrs. Betty Williams and Mrs. Mairead Corrigan, who have
started marches there. These were started by one of the women
who had, as I understand it, a nephew and two young nieces
killed by a runaway army car, which smashed into the family
as they were out for a walk. She was appalled at these
senseless deaths, and at the funeral met a Catholic woman.
The two of them decided that this murdering was going to
stop, that they were going to stop this insane brutality by these
savage criminals. So they decided to have a march through the
ghetto areas.

•

(1530)

Honourable senators really have to be in some of those areas
to understand the courage it took for those women to lead such
a march. The areas are such that a person of one particular

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
denomination cannot walk freely into them. If he does so his
life is endangered. There are barricades erected between the
areas to isolate and protect them.
Together with Lady Patricia, I went on a march with those
peace women. I am very happy to say there was no incident on
that particular occasion. We were going through an integrated
area, yet it was probably one of the most emotional experiences of my life.
Different people come together from the various ghetto
areas carrying signs printed with the names of their areas.
Other people would readily recognize that an area was either
Protestant or Catholic, but to me it all seemed quite strange.
Others would cheer as the different groups were coming
together. For many it was the first time that they had met
others of a different religion in a common cause. As we
marched together, I asked one person who was walking beside
me, "Why are you on this march?" She replied that she had
four young children, and that her husband had been shot about
two years previously. I asked a man on the march the same
question. He told me he had a 17-year old daughter who would
never walk again because she had been shot in the back.
Those women, with the courage they have shown, are indeed
creating a new climate, and certainly demonstrating to the
world that there is a will to win, to bring back a civilized
approach to Northern Ireland. I do not know for how long the
marches will continue. Certainly there will be a need for many
other approaches, but at least the march has struck a flame
throughout the world. There is now hope that there can be a
change of climate in Northern Ireland.
I had arranged to meet with the two women and Lady
Patricia for lunch. On the day that we were to meet there was
a tragic incident. I have here a newspaper with the headline
"Drumm Funeral 'Car Bomb' Hoax." A Mrs. Drumm, who
had been active in the IRA, had been in the hospital for
treatment. Some criminals had entered the hospital disguised
as doctors, and shot her through the head. On the day that I
was to meet with the women from the peace movement, I
learned that in retaliation a bomb had been placed in a
children's hostel. Fortunately, it had been discovered.
The point I should like to emphasize is that I was made
aware that there are well-meaning people across Canada and
in the United States who feel that by making indiscriminate
financial donations to any cause in Ireland they are helping to
alleviate the situation. Unfortunately, in many instances their
money is being used to finance this type of violence, this
debased kind of criminality. Certainly there is no patriotism or
idealism connected with it. The type of thugs who are perpetuating this vicious violence have been denounced not only
by people on both sides in Northern Ireland, but by every
civilized government throughout the world.
I make this plea because I know that even in Toronto, my
own city, there are people who have suggested that the mythology of the fight against either the British or the IRA is
something that is going to work to the glory of Ireland. Such
people are staining and soiling the good name not only of Irish

November 18, 1976
November 18, 1976

people in Ulster but of the whole of Ireland with that depraved
kind of approach.
To meet with the two ladies I mentioned, I had gone to their
organization's headquarters. If honourable senators saw the
way their operation works, they would shake their heads in
admiration. In order to get into their headquarters, one knocks
on the door and rings the bell twice. Someone looks out from
the third floor, and a small boy runs down to open the door. I
went upstairs to the third floor-someone had donated the
office-and sat with a Norwegian representative. The women
had been recommended too late for the Nobel Peace Prize.
However, the.Norwegian government is giving them a generous sum to help them in their work.
Telephone calls were coming in from around the world, and
volunteers take time off from work to answer the telephone. I
said to one "What kind of things do you say?" She said "I
enjoy doing this. It is so interesting hearing from all the
people. I give them a little touch of the warmth of my heart
when I speak to them."
Another lady was hammering away at a pile of correspondence in the "in" basket. I asked her whether she was one of the
paid officials or secretaries, and she said "No, we are all
volunteers. I do a bit of typing. I love answering some of the
mail that comes in." I asked her if anyone supervised or
checked her work, and she said, "No, but I can put some
feeling and emotion in the replies I give."
After I met Lady Fisher with the peace women, we went to
a modern pub, where I bought them a drink before lunch. We
had just ordered our meal and were discussing how Canadians
might be able to provide some help or support from across the
water, when the bartender yelled at us to get out of the place,
that a bomb had been planted. We dashed out-I dashed out
as fast as my legs would carry me, and they were similarly
quick-and I did not have an opportunity to conclude my
discussion with them.
I am heartened by the fact that on this side of the ocean
there are people who are trying to provide moral support and
encouragement. I do not think that those brave women are the
only answer. I do not think that the women feel that they alone
are the answer to this terrible problem. But I do know that
they represent one answer, in that they represent a clear
clarion call. There is a sense of decency and courage now
displayed by the people of Northern Ireland, and a new hope
and feeling that the murder and brutality of criminal extremists will soon come to an end.
I would say, Madam Speaker, that it will be my privilege to
help Lady Fisher and Mrs. Robins when they come to Canada.
The Ontario government bas arranged a luncheon for them in
Toronto next Tuesday, which will be hosted by the Honourable
Margaret Scrivener. I had hoped there would be an opportunity for a luncheon for them here, which would enable honourable senators to meet them. However, with the adjournment of
the Senate next week, that might not be possible. The Honourable Jeanne Sauvé has shown great interest, and she is plan-

THE LATE HONOURABLE MICHAEL G. BASHA
TRIBUTES

Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senators, we were
all saddened to hear of the death last Friday of our colleague,
Senator Michael Basha. He was our fourth longest serving
senator. For over 25 years he served the Senate with distinction and devotion.
Senator Basha was a successful businessman in his beloved
Newfoundland before being summoned to the Senate in 1951.
He brought with him a shrewd business sense and a compassionate nature, which was a combination which worked well
for Newfoundland, Canada, and certainly for the Senate.
He was not a man to thrust himself into the limelight.
Instead, he was a person who went about his senatorial duties
with quiet diligence. He rarely missed a sitting of the Senate
and could be relied upon to answer any request. But the
measure of Senator Basha can be taken from the fact that he
leaves behind many friends on Parliament Hill. He was a
kindly human being, generous in deed and, more important,
generous in spirit. I am sure that all honourable senators will
wish to join me in expressing our sympathy to his wife,
Winifred Mary, and his three children.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, Senator Mike
Basha was a businessman, a man of action and achievement, a
man of ideas-put-to-work. His highly successful business
career bears eloquent testimony to the fact that he was an
imaginative and resourceful entrepreneur.
He served his fellow countrymen by providing them with the
goods and services they needed. And like many other businessmen, he was laconic. How frustrated and impatient he must
have been with us at times. I wonder now how often he must
have felt like saying, "Will you all please shut up and get on
with it."
He valued an exchange of ideas, but he had little patience
with those who tried to cover up their lack of imagination and
analytical ability with a torrent of words. Senator Basha
respected the power of words and the gift of fluency; he
respected them enough not to misuse them. Nothing annoyed
him more than waste. And waste in government annoyed him
most, because the sin was compounded by the fact that those
guilty of waste were also guilty of a breach of trust.
He was a hard-nosed businessman with a great capacity for
work. He set very high standards for himself but this did not

prevent him from being kind, considerate and mild-mannered
with others.
Mike Basha was a perfect gentleman. He spoke ill of no one
and sought always to help those who were in need.
On behalf of the opposition, I extend to his wife and
children our most heartfelt condolences.
Hon. Eric Cook: Honourable senators, I am sure we are ail
sad to hear of the death of our colleague, Senator Mike Basha.
Mike, as he was affectionately known to everyone, was a
gentleman and a kind and generous friend to the members of
the Senate and to the staff from the senior to our youngest
page.
a

(2010)

The Basha name is an honoured one and highly regarded
everywhere in Newfoundland, but particularly so on the west
coast where he was for so long a deeply respected business and
community leader.
I join with all other senators in expressing my sincere
sympathy to his widow and family on the loss of a dear
husband and father.
Hon. William J. Petten: Honourable senators, I should like
to associate myself with the remarks of the previous speakers.
I first heard of Senator Michael Basha through the children
of friends of mine in Corner Brook, Newfoundland. This was
in the years before Newfoundland joined Canada, and at that
time Senator Basha was one of the foremost businessmen on
the west coast. Among his enterprises was a movie theatre, and
it was not uncommon for Uncle Mike, as the children called
him, to be near the entrance on a Saturday afternoon, and
children who did not have the price of admission were quietly
ushered in by this kind and generous man. He was, and always
had been, very thoughtful of everyone he came in contact with.
Never one to seek the limelight, Senator Basha preferred to
remain in the background. He was active in all community
affairs in his native city, and on his arrival in Ottawa and over
the past 25 years he made a wide circle of friends who will
miss him greatly.
I am sure that all his friends in this chamber and outside
join me in expressing sincere sympathy to his dear wife,
Winifred, and his family.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I also want
to associate myself with the tributes that have been paid to our
late colleague, Senator Basha, and to join in the expressions of
sympathy to his bereaved wife, family and relatives.
Senator Basha was the senior senator from Newfoundland.
He served for nearly 26 years as a senator and was a most
faithful attendant in this chamber. A survey taken last year

November 30. 1976

SENATE DEBATES
EAE
SNT

covering the last session showed that be had the best attendance of ail, having missed only two out of 211 sittings.
At the time Senator Basha was appointed to tbe Senate 1
was a sitting member of the House of Commons, and over the
years we became very close friends. His experience of the
fisheries and of Newfoundland generally was of great help to
members like myseif, and to other members of Parliament,
especially the member who represented bis own area.
As other senators have said, Senator Basha had many
sterling qualities. I think the three most outstanding were bis
modesty, his generosity and bis kindness. If 1 were to add a
fourth 1 would mention bis ready wit and great sense of
humour. He was a man of considerable talents but, as other
senators have pointed out, he always shunned the limelight and
constantly hid bis light under a bushel. No one will ever know
the good that Mike Basha bas done, because wherever possible
it was done in sucb a way as flot to attract any attention.
He was a very kind and compassionate man, and no one
needing help ever went away from him empty-handed. He was
generous to the extreme. He was a leader in bis own community of Curling, and was always the pace-setter in supporting
good causes. He gave as generously to other churches as to bis
own.
Senator Mike Basha was a very successful businessman. He
was one of a vanishing breed that we can iIl afford to lose. He
put as much thougbt and energy into furthering the interests
and welfare of others as of his own. He was constantly
employing his ingenuity to create jobs and put the extra dollar
in the hands of the fishermen who depended on bim for
supplies and the marketing of their products. His reputation
for bonesty and fair dealing was such that bis namne was a
household word ail along the northern haîf of the west coast of
Newfoundland, from Curling to the Strait of Belle Isle.
As a result, in bis own quiet way be exerted a tremendous
influence on the fishermen in this area, who trusted him and
looked to him for advice. When the question of Newfoundland's joining Canada came up hie quietly let it be known that
he strongly supported Confederation because bie thought it
would be better for the ordinary Newfoundlander, even tbough
it might flot be in bis own best interest as a businessman.
Honourable senators will recaîl that the margin of votes in
favour of Confederation was very small. Bearing in mind that
the small fishing communities along the west coast of Newfoundland voted solidly for Confederation, I think it is reasonable to infer that, apart from former Premier Smallwood, no
single individual exerted more influence in favour of Confederation than did Senator Basha.
Now he is gone and we have ail lost a very dear friend, and
botb Newfoundland and Canada are the poorer for bis passing.
[Later:]
Hon. Frederick W. Rowe: Honourable senators, may 1 bave
leave to say a few words of tribute to my late friend, Senator
Basha?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is leave
granted?

80003-12

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Rowe: For the second time in the past two weeks
my plane was two bours late in reaching Ottawa. The result
was that 1 was not present for the earlier part of this sitting. I
understand that the Leader of the Government, the Leader of
the Opposition, and some of my Newfoundland colleagues paid
tribute to Senator Michael Basha. 1 shaîl not delay the Senate
unduly, but 1 should like to take this opportunity of saying that
I knew Mike Basba as a great Newfoundlander and a great
Canadian.
Honourable senators may already know that Senator Basha
came to Newfoundland from Lebanon as a small cbild. His
family settled in Newfoundland and at that time it was not an
easy matter to eke out a living there. However, tbey prospered,
and Mîke Basha became part of a small but very influential
Lebanese community in Newfoundland that bas made a tremendous contribution to that province and to Canada.
1 did not know Senator Basha intimately until I came to the
Senate. He lived on the west coast and I live on the east coast.
Also, hie was a generation ahead of me. It so happens that my
wife's family belong to the west coast and were in business
there for well over 100 years. Tbey had intimate business
associations with Michael Basha, particularly in the export of
codfish and berring.
I often recaîl hearing my father-in-law say that the only
agreement he ever had with Mike Basha was by means of a
bandshake. Senator Basha was noted for bis modesty, bis
loyalty, and, above all, bis integrity. He once said to me that
Newfoundland was good to him. May I say that Mike Basha
was good for Newfoundland and for Canada.
THE LATE E. RUSSELL HOPKINS
TRIBUTES TO FORMER LAW CLERK AND PARLIAMENTARY

COUNSEL

Hon. David A. Croîl: Honourable senators, Russell Hopkins
passed away on Tuesday, November 23. For 20 years he was Law

Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate, and hie
resigned in January of this year due to ill health. He bad a
very interesting career. He was born in Moose Jaw and lived
rnost of bis adult life in tbe east, yet hie remained a westerner
in spirit and outlook. To him, Moose Jaw was always the
greatest. And who would deny him? His father had been the
member of Parliament for Moose Jaw.
Russell Hopkins graduated in law from the University of
Saskatchewan and continued bis studies at the University of
Toronto. He proceeded to study at Harvard, and then at
Oxford as a Rhodes Scbolar. After graduation in the early
thirties bie lectured at the University of Toronto, then at the
University of Saskatchewan. For five years following that hie
served in the Air Force, being discbarged with the rank of
wing commander. After the war he joined the Department of
External Affairs, having special dealings witb United Nations
problems, wbicb is wbere I met him. We were then excited by
the prospects of the United Nations, which was one of the

170

SENATE DEBATES

interests that I had at the time. We discovered that we had
mutual wartime friends.
In 1949 he became Deputy Clerk of the House of Commons,
of which I was then a member. The work was heavy, the
responsibility great and the pressure constant. He discharged
his duties with credit.

e

(2020)

In 1956 he became Parliamentary Counsel to the Senate.
That position was considered in legal circles then, as it is
considered now, to be a plum, a very prestigious position, and
he held it for 20 years.
He believed in the Senate; he believed in the institution, and
he appreciated the members of the Senate. He respected the
high position of senators. He wrote about the Senate in a book
entitled Confederation at the Crossroads:The Canadian Constitution. He began it in the following way, which gives us
some idea of the character of the man:
The writing of this book was undertaken as a sort of
personal Centennial project. As it turned out, the Centennial Commission agreed that the undertaking was timely:
I am duly grateful for the encouragement and financial
assistance provided by the Commission.
Chapter 14 of the book is a gem, and when from time to
time inquiries are received about the Senate, those who know
about the book immediately have it copied and sent out with
the explanation that it is the latest authority on the Senate.
Russell Hopkins not only wrote about the Senate, but also
provided material for other people to write. He wrote not only
a book, but also magazine articles.
He rose high in his profession. There is in the city of Ottawa
a legal brotherhood of constitutional experts. In the Department of Justice, the Department of External Affairs, the
House of Commons and the Senate there are men who are
experts in their field, and they carry on their work morning,
noon and night. They live with it. Russell Hopkins was not the
least among them. They discuss questions among themselves,
and Russell Hopkins was often consulted and his opinions were
seldom disregarded.
He had also another attainment. He was a superb draftsman
of laws and documents. That is a rare attainment. He had an
excellent knowledge of language. He knew how to use words,
and he had a prodigious memory. From time to time he
expressed the view that if one wrote in a slovenly fashion, one
must be thinking in a slovenly way. He had the ability to
substitute a phrase for a sentence and a sentence for a
paragraph, and make the whole more meaningful and
expressive.
He was very helpful to honourable senators who from time
to time took the opportunity to call for his services. At times
he was unable to provide help in the way we wanted, but
somehow he was always able to do it in such a way as to
satisfy us.
He was a kind, considerate man, who made friends of
acquaintances and never lost a friend. He served his country in
peace and in war with distinction. He was dedicated to his

November 30, 1976

country, and was a credit to it. His objective in life was to
preserve justice. That was his sense of duty. In many ways he
was a dreamer. His was a proud, constructive career, and an
example to those who follow.
He leaves behind his wife, four sons and a daughter, and
eight grandchildren. To them we extend our deepest sympathy.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I should like to
add my small postscript to the eloquent tribute which Senator
Croll has just paid to Russell Hopkins. I should like to do so,
first of ail, as a friend to whom he showed many kindnesses.
Not the least of them was that when he wrote a pamphlet, so
far unpublished, on the Senate-a most admirable piece of
work in every way-he was kind enough to say he hoped I
would write an introduction to it. I have seldom received a more
notable compliment than I considered that.
I should also like to pay tribute to the great services which
he rendered to the Standing Joint Committee on Regulations
and other Statutory Instruments, far beyond the call of duty.
He was really responsible for drawing up the criteria by which
that committee undertakes to judge the documents which are
submitted to it. He spent an immense amount of time on that.
He also volunteered to come over to England at the time when
I, as chairman, and two of our staff went over to observe the
proceedings of the corresponding committee in the United
Kingdom. He did that simply on his own and not at the
expense of the committee at ail, and he was most valuable to
us. I grew to have a very special admiration and affection for
him during that trip that we made together to the United
Kingdom.
I could not begin to add anything more than that to the
splendid tribute which Senator Croll has paid to Russell
Hopkins, but because of the very special friendship which he
extended to me and the great services he rendered to our
committee, I wanted to add that small postscript.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I knew Russell Hopkins many years before I entered this chamber,
because his cottage was situated some six miles away from
mine, and my children and his children were brought up
together. They learned together how to water ski and to swim,
and when I entered this chamber we were already good
friends.
He raised four boys and a girl, and he lived for his family.
He gave them ail a good education, and he lived to see them
ail well established in life and aIl well married.
Beyond the talent, beyond the wide learning and ready wit,
beyond the Rhodes Scholar and the outstanding constitutional
expert, yes, beyond and behind the cloak of accomplishments
and erudition he wore so lightly, was the real Russ, the Russ I
knew and the Russ I loved, a man of deep compassion, a
compassion that nourished itself on the bread of the spirit in
order to serve every person he met.
Russ was a deeply religious man. His religion was not the
conventional type that needed to belong to a particular
denomination, but the prophetic type that needed to belong to
the truth. Yes, Russ loved the true and the good and the

Novemher 30 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SNT

beautiful, and because of this abiding love, he possessed a
profound inner authenticity.
His daughter Carol-who is the youngest of the familywhom he loved with special affection, caught ber beloved
father's authenticity when she once said with the simplicity of
a child, "Daddy, you should have been a judge. You'd acquit
everyone". Yes, indeed. Russ did acquit everyone. He pleaded
everyone's cause; he saw through the sham of self-importance
and the shoddiness of self-righteous judgment. He often
repeated that "we see through a glass, darkly," and he always
gave every person the benefit of the doubt. He knew in bis
inner being, "There but for the grace of God, go I."
a

(2030)

His mind was not troubled about whether there were three
persons in one God or three Gods in one person, because he
sensed in bis authentîc inner spirit that what mattered was
love. We must love one another as the Divine Master loved us.
He did not talk about God; he lived God.
He lived God with a mind always open to truth in its
ever-ambivalent kaleidoscopic patternis, with a loving heart
always in search of the good, with his whole gentle beîng
always attentive to the deep beauty that lies at the heart of our
scarred humant existence.
Many wilI remember him as a scholar, a renaissance
humanist amidst a massive dehumanizing twentieth century, a
Thomas More or an Erasmus or a Vives, the author of a legal
classic on the Canadian Constitution, a great Canadian, the
historic pride of Moose Jaw.
As Senator Croîl bas already mentioned, besides writing
several essays on constitutional matters published in law journais, fie wrote two books, one entitied Hou, Parlianient Works,
which has been a textbook in every Canadian secondary and
primary school since its publication, and another entitled Confeéderation ai the Crossroads. which can be found in every university library in Canada today.
I will remember him as a dear friend, a loving father, a
gentie human being, the good Samaritan of the spirit, always
ready to bind wounds, always ready to heal with a witty word
and a serene smile, aiways ready to point to the good and the
true and the beautiful in ail circumstances and in ail persons.
In Newman's words, he bas passed from shadows to reality.
And though I will miss him dearly, I will miss him with a
happy memory and a deep hope-a happy mnemory of God's
most gentie creature of this century; a deep hope that one day
we will ail join Russ in the absolute future he now enjoys,
where he no longer needs to chide us to make us kind, where
he no longer secs through a glass darkly, where he now secs
face to face our Master, who is the absolute truth and'goodness and beauty Russ served so generously while he walked the
earth.
Dear senators, God bless our friend Russ Hopkins, schoiar,
good Samaritan, a great educator who could easily have been
dean of any law school in thîs country, a man born for
friendship.

REPLY FROM PREMIER OF QUEBEC-QUESTION

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, may I ask the Leader

of the Government, in view of the fact that he has just tabled
the telex to the premiers of the provinces in connection with
the federal-provincial conference to be held in December, if a
reply has been received from the Premier of Quebec?
Senator Perrault: I am pleased to report that there is every
indication that all premiers will attend that conference, and

hopefully the meeting will proceed in a spirit of cooperative
federalism.
Senator Flynn: I am not asking for the wishes of the Leader
of the Government. My question is as to whether a reply has
been received from the Premier of Quebec.
Senator Perrault: It is my understanding, Senator Flynn,
while I have not seen the communication personally, that a
positive reply has been received from the new Premier of that
great province, la belle Province de Québec.
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
VISIT OF CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 18, the
debate on the inquiry of Senator van Roggen, calling the
attention of the Senate to the visit of Canadian Parliamentarians to the European Parliament from 13th to 16th September,
1976.
Hon. Richard J. Stanbury: Honourable senators, I appreci-

ate the opportunity of participating in this debate. This is the
sort of report which comes from a parliamentary delegation,
and sometimes is left just as "the report", without further
comment.
I should like to begin by congratulating the Honourable
George van Roggen, the Chairman of the Standing Senate

Committee on Foreign Affairs, who was also the co-chairman
of the delegation of Canadian parliamentarians to the Euro-

pean Parliament in September of this year. He and the Honourable John Roberts-and I notice that Mr. Roberts, after he
was elevated to the cabinet, was ably succeeded by Mr. Jim
Fleming, M.P.-did a remarkable job of leading the Canadian
delegation, of asking the right questions, and developing the
best possible answers to the European questions concerning
our closer relationship with the European Community.
I thought I should participate in this debate because of some
special opportunities I have had for involvement with people of
the European Community and the European Parliament,
through both trade and political associations. Those opportunities have come about because of the affiliation of the Liberal
Party of Canada with an organization called Liberal International and because of the fact that I am a vice-president of
that organization.
I appreciate that almost nothing is known about internation-

al political organizations in Canada. Generally speaking, we
have been quite isolationist in our partisanship. However, over
the past few years, both the Liberal Party and the New
Democratic Party in Canada have developed close associations
particularly with European parties of the same political
philosophy and persuasion. I am uncertain whether the Con-

servative Party of Canada has developed a similar association.
I notice that Mr. Broadbent, the Leader of the New Demo-

cratic Party, has just been appointed Vice-President of Socialist International. I also noted with interest that our parliamentary delegation to the European Parliament met separately

174

SENATE DEBATES

with the Conservative, Liberal, Christian Democrat and
Socialist groups in the European Parliament. I think it is fair
to say that those groups have been spawned by the various
party international organizations, and that it has been the
international organizations which have done the homework
and the preparatory work toward the development of the
European Parliament and indeed the whole thrust toward European economic, and eventually political, integration.
I think it is also fair to say that the personal relationships
which have been developed through our interest in international political organizations have facilitated the negotiations
toward the contractual link of which Senator van Roggen and
Senator Smith have already spoken in such favourable terms.
Socialist International is headed by Willy Brandt, and Liberal International is headed by Gaston Thorn, the Prime
Minister of Luxembourg, who has just completed a term as the
Chairman of the General Assembly of the United Nations,
and who was prior to that the Chairman of the European
Economic Council. The personal friendships which have been
developed with such key figures can only be helpful to Canada.
I first met Gaston Thorn in 1969 at a Liberal International
Congress. At that time the President of Liberal International
was Walter Scheel, who is now the President of West Germany. Mr. Thorn was a parliamentary delegate from the
Liberal Party of Luxembourg. Each time we have met since
then he has occupied a higher and more prestigious post, and
there is probably no politician more central to, or more highly
respected by, the European parliamentary community than the
Right Honourable Gaston Thorn. Through the Liberal International association he has become a close friend of our Prime
Minister and of Canada.
He was kind enough to speak directly to the Canadian
delegation at the Liberal International Congress in Brussels in
September. He persuaded them of the absolute necessity of
Canada's playing a greater role in international politics and
assuming a leadership role in the encouragement of the people
of the world to maintain democracy, or to restore it where that
is a practical possibility. To give substance to that challenge,
the Honourable Martin O'Connell of Canada has been
appointed to represent Liberal International on a joint committee of Christian Democrat International, Socialist International and an ad hoc committee of American Congressmen to
organize an international conference on human rights during
the spring of 1977.
I appreciate that this is somewhat tangential to the subject
of the debate, but I felt that you should know that the various
party groupings in the European Parliament are backed up by
federations of the political parties at the national level which
give the parliamentary group the necessary organizational and
policy support, and those federations in turn are affiliated with
international organizations which provide to other countries,
including Canada, an opportunity for a first-hand insight into
the problems and the techniques of progress of the European
Parliament and the European Community.

November 30, 1976

While Europeans have looked to Canada for their model in
building a federation of states, it may be we who should now
be looking to them to find the models which will permit us to
continue to build a nation. We have many of the same
problems that the Europeans are facing in building their
federation-.differences of language, differences of economic
strength, wide differences of political philosophy, and differences in culture. The European Parliament must represent the
nine members of the European Community-Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. To do so it has five different
political groupings-the Christian Democrats, the Socialists,
the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Gaullists. In addition,
there are communists from Italy and France. Debates are
carried on in not only French and English, but in Danish,
Dutch, German and Italian.
There are grave economic disparities as well, much more
vivid than the disparities between Newfoundland and British
Columbia. Italy bas had to have huge loans-$15 billionfrom the international community, and particularly from its
European partners. But now similar claims are being made by
Britain, Holland and Belgium, and even by France. Germany
has had to become the "paymaster" of Europe, and I think we
in Canada well understand the strains which that can cause.
There are many national problems which spill over into the
considerations of the Parliament of Europe. While there is a
great thrust in Europe generally toward a greater economic
and political union, there are nationalist forces in each of the
countries fighting hard against that thrust. There are problems
of political instability in various countries. The situation in
Italy finds a government maintained in power simply by all the
opposition forces refusing to vote non-confidence. There is an
ever-present threat that Italy or France, or both, will, by
electing Communist governments, effectively "separate" from
Europe before they are truly joined. And yet the Europeans
press on towards political integration by intending to create by
1978 an elected parliament. How are they able to maintain
their purpose and optimism in the face of all of these problems,
while we quake and squirm and whine at our relatively simple
need to accommodate to each other and to reconfirm our
brotherhood of 109 years?
e

(2050)

If a Frenchman and a German can feel at home in a Europe
which includes both their countries, after wars and military
occupations, murders, tortures and rapes, and all manner of
injustices inflicted one upon the other over hundreds of years,
surely we have not the slightest excuse for refusing to make
the relatively insignificant adjustments we have to make in our
attitudes to live together in harmony and equality. If Europe
can succeed, honourable senators, we have no excuse for
failure.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: As no other senator wishes to
participate, this inquiry is considered as having been debated.

SCIENCE POLICY
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Maurice Lamontagne moved, pursuant to notice of
November 30, 1976:
That a Special Committee of the Senate, to be known
as the Special Committee of the Senate on Science Policy,
be appointed to consider and report on Canadian government and other expenditures on scientific activities and
matters related thereto;
That the committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel and clerical personnel as may be necessary for the purpose of the inquiry;
That the committee have power to send for persons,
papers and records, to examine witnesses, to sit during
adjournments of the Senate and to report from time to
time; and
That the committee be authorized to print such papers
and evidence from day to day as may be ordered by the
committee.
[Translation]
He said: Honourable senators, as many senators already
know, the Senate has approved the amended terms of reference of the committee, as described in the present motion.
Although this motion will only have the effect of prolonging
and terminating the terms of reference already set for the
committee, I want to take this opportunity to make a brief
report on the work made by the committee in the last months.
[Englishj
While the new mandate which was authorized last year by
the Senate for the committee is very broad, it was understood
when it was first approved that the new inquiry would concentrate on changes which have occurred in the area of science
policy since the committee held its first series of hearings in
1968 and 1969, on what had happened to the more than 80
specific recommendations contained in the committee's previous report, and finally on the development and coordination of
this new field of research which is now described generally as
future studies within the federal government.
In the light of this more specific mandate, I wrote in
September of 1975 to all government departments and agencies, to universities and to those professional and trade associations which had appeared before the committee in 1969,
inviting them to submit briefs and suggesting the topics to be
covered. In October I sent a detailed questionnaire regarding
future studies to government agencies and to private firms
most likely to be involved in this kind of research. Because of
the time required to prepare briefs, the committee was not able
to begin its public hearings before December 4 last year.
Moreover, it was practically impossible to schedule more than
one hearing a week. As some honourable senators will recall, it
was even impossible on several occasions to respect that
schedule. Fortunately, members of the committee realized that
this process was much too slow and decided that they should
sit during the adjournment. The committee met during six
days in August and September, for as much as seven hours a

day, thus accomplishing an amount of work which otherwise
would have required three months or more according to our
normal schedule.
The attendance at those summer meetings was very good,
and I want to express my gratitude, as chairman, to the
members of the committee who were present during those two
weeks, but who also had taken the additional time to read the
briefs in advance and to prepare questions. We will need six or
seven more meetings to complete our hearings. Up to now we
have heard 31 organizations, and we have accumulated about
1,300 pages of evidence.
I am convinced that this new series of hearings bas already
proven to be most useful. We have been able to see that many
recommendations made by the committee in 1972 and 1973
had been accepted by the government, and how they had been
implemented. For instance, the substance of the new budgetary procedure that we had recommended for the review assessment and approval of proposed science expenditures is now
being followed by the government. The substance of our
proposals regarding the reorganization of the granting councils
will be presented, at last, by the government to Parliament
during the current session.
Moreover, we have been able to observe that the mere
decision on our part to revisit the field of science policy has
induced government departments and agencies to implement a
number of our other recommendations which otherwise might
have been forgotten. Renewed external threats are often the
best way to get action from entrenched bureaucracies. This is
where, more particularly, Senate committees can have a much
greater and lasting impact than royal commissions.
Finally, we have been able to realize also that the failure of
the government to implement some of the recommendations
made in 1972 is now producing what has been described to us
during our last series of hearings as an acute crisis, endangering Canada's future capability in the whole field of scientific
research, technological development and economic and social
innovation.
I should like to give two illustrations of this emerging crisis.
In 1972 the committee had observed the great immobility of
Canadian scientific manpower, especially in government establishments, and had underlined the urgent necessity of launching a program designed to transfer older researchers to other
jobs in the private and public sectors where they could be
happier and be more productive. This recommendation was not
implemented.
a

(2100)

We had also recommended that national expenditures related to research and development be substantially increased on a
gradual basis in order to enable Canada to maintain its
contribution to the international pool of free knowledge, to
improve its position in the international technological race, and
to get a better performance from its social systems in such
areas as health and education. This other recommendation also
was not implemented. As a matter of fact, federal expenditures
on research and development in current dollars have increased

176
176

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

mainly to take care of increases in salaries, and have declined
in real terms in many areas, such as the support of university
and health research.
The fact that these two recommendations have not been
implemented may soon have very adverse consequences. Scientific manpower immobility, together with budgetary restraints,
means that there are few opportunities for young Canadians to
engage in research careers. If this situation continues to prevail even for a few years, Canada may lose a whole new
generation of researchers, which would create in the not too
distant future a tragic gap in our national research capability.
In the immediate future, such a situation causes an unhealthy
rise in the average age of our researchers. This phenomenon of
aging exists in most government laboratories and universities.
If it persists it will mean that the Canadian people will get
much lower returns than they should from public expenditures
on research and development.
My second illustration is related to industry. In 1972 the
committee deplored the weak research and development performed by secondary manufacturing industries in Canada,
which led to a poor innovative performance and a serious
inability to gain access to export markets. We made a series of
representations to the Department of Industry, Trade and
Commerce which would certainly have helped to correct the
basic weakness of this important sector of our Canadian
economy.
[Translation]
Senator Deschatelets: Would Senator Lamontagne allow a
question? Could you recommend, for instance, that private

enterprise be encouraged to hire personnel for scientific research? You say that recommendations have been presented to
the government. Could you expose one or two of these recommendations to us?
Senator Lamontagne: With your permission, I shall revert to
this in a moment. One of those recommendations precisely
proposes a complete review of the tax incentive system set up
by the government to stimulate research in the private sector.
[English|
I was saying that we had made some very specific recommendations to the government in this area and some of our
proposals, unfortunately the least important of them, were
almost immediately implemented by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce. Others, such as the creation of
industrial task forces by sectors and the reshaping of government incentive programs to encourage industrial research, are
just beginning to be implemented, or are at last under active
consideration. However, nothing has been done about the
major re-organization of the Department of Industry, Trade
and Commerce that we recommended, including the appointment of a full-time Deputy Minister of Industry. Without this
major re-organization at the centre, which we felt necessary to
provide leadership and inspiration, the new national policy that
we advocated was not formulated and proclaimed.
Those delays and this inaction have had serious adverse
effects which are reflected now to a large extent in our

November 30, 1976
November 30, 1976

external trade balance. In 1970, when we were preparing our
first report, our trade deficit for higher technology products
amounted to about $2 billion a year. It has risen consistently
ever since, to reach the fantastic figure of approximately $10
billion in 1975. This most unhealthy situation is bound to
become worse as Canada becomes a greater net importer of
oil, unless the government declares a state of emergency and
launches, as a matter of top priority, a new national policy
based on the promotion of new technology and innovation in
the secondary manufacturing sector, as we advocated in 1972.
As honourable senators can see, the Senate Special Committee on Science Policy has had over the years what I feel has
been a significant impact on government policies, but some
basic issues in this broad area remain to be solved, and I hope
that they will be clearly underlined in our next report.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, Senator
Lamontagne has placed a formal motion before the Senate, the
effect of which will be, if the Senate agrees, to carry on the
work of this committee for another six or seven hearings, at
which stage I take it that the work of the committee will be
completed. i say "completed" with some reluctance because,
as Senator Lamontagne has pointed out, of the committee's
recommendations many were implemented by the government,
but the non-implementation of the others has caused a crisis in
Canada today.
Senator Lamontagne has used the phrase "an emerging
crisis," but I believe he would be the first to agree that the
evideace before the committee is that the crisis is here. We
were told that if the present policies with respect to funding
and support of research and development in Canada are
carried on for another two years, Canada's science and technological capability will not merely be eroded, it will be
destroyed. Those are the words of an eminent witness before
the committee. Therefore, it is somewhat disappointing for me,
as a member of the committee, to have to say that we must
complete our hearings without the kind of success for which
we had hoped.
Part of the problem here, of course, is that Canada is the
only OECD country that does not have a science and technology committee in the elected house. For that reason the Senate
committee has had to carry on this work. The Lamontagne
reports are known around the worid and are textbooks in
universities. Yet when most of the world was listening, I regret
to say that apparently, for its own reasons, the Canadian
government was not listening, and the result is crisis. The
evidence in the proceedings of the committee is full of statements to that effect. The press has been full of statements
from leading scientists, the heads of groups of scientists and
individual disciplines, that this has been the effect of the
failure of the government to carry out some of the more
important recommendations, particularly of the first report of
the committee. That is the situation in which we find
ourselves.
The committee worked hard over many years, and its work
has not gone to waste. I am convinced that the reports of the
Lamontagne committee will remain a monument, as other

committee reports have, to the work, dedication and expertise
of the Senate.
We only have to read the headlines in the newspapers to see
the kind of situation that has developed. 1 need only mention
Atomic Energy to indicate the kind of crises that can develop
when the government will not listen to the recommendations of
those who have taken the time and trouble to study the
problems which face the government. I am being emphatic in
this statement because 1 share Senator Lamontagne's disappointment, which he made clear tonight, that the government
has not on this occasion Iistened, as they might have dlone,' to
the alarm signais which this committee sent up over the years.

It is true, of course, that the government has implemented
some major recommendations, but 1 have to say that the
government has completely fallen down in cstirnating the
danger of the policies which have been carried on over the past
few years, certainly since this committee began its
deliberations.
As 1 understand it, from what the chairman has said
tonight, the committee will shortly wind up its hearings.
Perhaps it is weII that it should do so. There are some monuments remaining to the work, particularly that of Senator
Lamontagne. Recently there has been arranged for the first
time in Canada a series of meetings of members of the science

community and members of Parliament. The first meeting was
held under the presidency of Senator Lamontagne, and was
organized by SCITEC, Senator Lamontagne and others on the
committee.
SCITEC itself is certainly a monument to the work of the
committee. When it began its work, Canada was almost the
onty advanced industrialized country in the world which did
not have the equivalent of the American Academy for the
Advancement of Science. We were the only country which did
not have an overaîl society of scientists. The government was
unable to obtain the advice of the science community until
Senator Lamontagne's committee provided the inspiration and
the occasion for the formation of SCITEC, which today speaks
for Canada's science community.
There are other achievements which no doubt will be
referred to when the final report of the committee is made. I
have to say, of course, as I arn sure every member of the
committee would wish me to say, that ail of us who serve on
that committee are proud to have served with Senator Lamontagne. That committee is now well known, and will always be
known, as the Lamontagne committee. In my view, its reports
will take their place among the great documentary achieveand parliamentary

PRIVATE BILL
BELL CANADA-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Jean-Paul Descbatelets moved the second reading of
Bill S-2, respecting Bell Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill S-2 bas four main purposes, as follaws: First, ta enable tbe company to increase its
capital from $1.750 billion ta a new limit of $5 billion;
secondly, to improve the company's financing flexibility; thirdly, ta update the corporate powers of the company; fourthly, ta
authorize tbe company ta alter its objccts, powers, and share
capital by letters patent.
Bell Canada is tbe largest supplier of telecommunication
services in Canada. It bas more shareholders than any other
Canadian corporation, numbering approximately 250,000 and
owning more tban 50 million shares. Nearly two-tbirds of tbe
sharebolders own less tban 100 shares each. Over 97 per cent
of tbe sharebolders of Bell Canada are resident in Canada,
wbicb makes Bell Canada a truly Canadian-owned company.
Lt is important ta keep in mind at this point that tbis bill bas
notbing wbatsoever to do with the company's rate structure.
As bonourable senators are aware, it is the responsibility of tbe
CRTC to approve the rates cbarged by the company and to
ensure tbat tbey are just and reasonable.
In addition ta asking for an increase in the capital of the
company, Bell Canada, tbrougb this bill, seeks ta modernize its
charter in several respects. Many of the requested changes are
similar, if not identical, to charter amendments granted ta
British Columbia Telephone Company tbrough Bill S-il,
assented ta in December, 1974. A number of changes are also
substantially similar ta provisions of the Canada Corporations
Act or of tbe Canada Business Corporations Act.

SENATE DEBATES

(1420)

I do not have to emphasize the importance of Bell Canada in
the Canadian economy. May I just mention the following
aspects: First, the increasing possibility of meaningful jobs for
Canadians. The company has approximately 48,000
employees, and most of 23,000 employees of Northern Telecom Limited, one of the subsidiaries, are employed in the
company's territory. Secondly, Bell Canada and Northern
Telecom Limited jointly own Bell-Northern Research Ltd.,
which is Canada's largest industrial research and development
organization with a staff of over 1,700 employees, including
more than 750 engineers and scientists. Thirdly, there are few
domains where the Canadian know-how is more marketable
than in the field of telecommunications, where Bell Canada's
technology and expertise are second to none. Bell Canada was
incorporated in 1880. It provides telecommunication facilities
and services in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, as well as
in the Northwest Territories. Bell Canada's associated companies provide telecommunications services in New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and certain parts of Ontario and Quebec. Bell Canada's act has been
amended 12 times since 1880 in order to keep the capital and
powers of the company up to date. The pressing need for
advanced planning of construction programs and financing for
the coming decade prompts the company's bill at this time.
The company's business is highly capital-intensive and it
requires the investment of immense amounts of both equity
and debt money in order to satisfy the needs of the Canadian
public it serves, which continues to expect better and broader
services.
Honourable senators, it is not my intention, as you could
expect, to go into the details of the various amendments sought
in this bill, which is in essence a financial bill and obviously
rather technical. On second reading I intend to go over these
amendments briefly, leaving to a standing committee, if you
accept second reading, a close scrutiny of each amendment
with the officers of Bell Canada.
When the company was incorporated in 1880 its original
capital was only $500,000. Increases in capital have been
granted from time to time by Parliament as the demand for
services increased. In 1968 authorization was received from
Parliament to increase the capital to its present limit of $1.75
billion, of which about $1.47 billion has now been issued or
committed, leaving a balance of about $280 million, which the
company expects to be exhausted in the near future. According
to present forecasts, the requested increase of $3.25 billion will
be sufficient for at least another decade.
In financing its necessary construction expenditures, the
company must compete with a multitude of other firms and
governments or their agencies. As the amounts needed grow
larger, the difficulties of raising the required sums of money in
Canada have become progressively greater, and it is now
necessary for the company, not only to expand its participation
in the highly competitive United States markets but also to
compete for funds in Europe. To compete in both the domestic
and international financial markets, Bell Canada must enjoy

December 2, 1976

the same range of financing options and arrangements as are
available to its competitors in the financial marketplace.
Therefore, a certain number of proposed amendments in this
bill would update the financial provisions of the company's act
of incorporation.
Included in the proposed amendments designed to modernize the company's financial powers are provisions enabling the
company to pay dividends other than in cash, and to charge
more realistic interest rates on overdue calls, as well as eliminating the need to obtain the CRTC's approval of the amount,
terms and conditions of each equity issue.
The company further requests that section 16 of the Canada
Corporations Act be made applicable to it in order to clarify
and broaden its ancillary and incidental powers. This would
specifically enable it to acquire shares of any other company
having objects altogether or in part similar to those of the
company, or carrying on any business capable of being conducted so as, directly or indirectly, to benefit the company.
Enlargement of the company's powers would normalize the
company's status by putting it in the same position as companies incorporated or continued under the Canada Corporations
Act which are empowered to carry out their purpose in the
most appropriate manner.
The company also seeks authority to further alter its objects,
powers and share capital by applying to the Minister of
Consumer and Corporate Affairs for letters patent, which
would be subject to cancellation by either house of Parliament
during a period of 30 sitting days following their tabling before
Parliament. This procedure, commonly known as the negative
resolution procedure, is provided for in the Telesat Canada
Act, and was most recently made part of the Income Tax
Conventions Act, 1976.
Honourable senators, I do not want to go further at this
time. We are on second reading and we have to decide whether
or not we agree to the nature of this bill. This is the type of
bill, of course, that must receive close scrutiny before a
standing committee of this house. However, before concluding
my remarks I should like to recall a personal experience which
happened in 1964, when I had the responsibility of the Department of Public Works. In order to acquaint parliamentarians
with the complexity of the administration of that department
we invited a group of members of Parliament and senators to
visit our headquarters to be briefed on the internal organization. At the end of the day a spokesman for the group told us
how efficient the administration seemed to be. He added that
he had the impression that the department was functioning at
the time like Bell Canada. I thought that was quite a compliment. I still believe that we as Canadians have every reason to
be proud of the efficiency, importance and high quality of
service provided by Bell Canada.

e

(1430)

If honourable senators decide to give the bill second reading,
I intead to move that, being a financial bill, it be referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce.

December 2, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Choquette: Honourable senators, I am not adjourning this debate because I am already in possession of facts
regarding the spoilt child of the federal government known as
Bell Canada. I intend to make a few remarks which would
probably force the government to scrutinize and investigate all
transactions of Bell Canada during the last three years.
Three years ago there was the company known as Microsystems, which was an affiliate of Bell Canada. It was listed on
the stock market and its stock went up to $15 and then, within
a few months, down to $7. People were purchasing it under the
impression that it was almost guaranteed by Bell Canada, it
being probably the most important subsidiary.
Now and then Bell Canada officiais appear before the
Canadian Transport Commission, and last year they had the
nerve to ask for an increase in their rates in order to pay
dividends to their shareholders. Three years ago people bought
Microsystems stock, not knowing that the company was about
to fold up and close its doors. A person who bought, for
example, $10,000 worth of Microsystems shares finds today
that those shares are worth $6,000. If that purchaser of the
shares borrowed money for the purpose of buying them, he has
been paying interest on the $10,000 that he borrowed.
It was suggested that the House of Commons carry out an
investigation to ascertain what was happening to Microsystems, with all its machinery, tools, and so on. No investigation
was carried out and we continued spoiling Bell Canada by
granting everything it requested from the government. Again
today we are asked to help the company out. You know, when
one of our committees carries out an investigation, it is not
sufficiently strict in dealing with big companies such as this.
Today Northern Telecom have taken over the shares of
Microsystems and, the nerve of them, they gave one share of
Telecom for seven shares of Microsystems. That was quite an
encouragement for those who believed that they had invested
money in something solid. This was Bell Canada's doing. And
nothing was done about it; no investigation was carried out,
and today we are ready to tell Bell Canada to ask us for
anything they wish and it will be granted to them.
I am placing these objections on the record without any
preparation. I do not intend to adjourn the debate, but I hope
this will come to the ears of those who can stop all this
nonsense and put an end to spoiling Bell Canada and a few
other companies like it.
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, Senator Hicks
would like to say a few words, but first let me say that I
appreciate the remarks of Senator ChoquetteSenator Grosart: Honourable senators, on a point of order, I
wonder if the sponsor of the bill and the proposer of the motion
is now closing the debate?
Senator Deschatelets: No, I simply took Senator Choquette's remarks to be a question and I should like to inform
him that if this bill is referred to a standing committee that
will be the time for such questions.
Senator Grosart: Again on a point of order, I suggest that
Senator Choquette did not address a question to the sponsor.

He made a speech, and if the sponsor speaks now in reply to
Senator Choquette, under our rules it will have the effect of
closing the debate.
Senator Hicks: Honourable senators, I am not going to
speak in reply to Senator Choquette's remarks. I think his
observations, though in another context they may have some
validity, have very little bearing on the thrust of the bill before
us this afternoon. If they do have any bearing on it, I think
there will be ample opportunity to analyze this when the bill is
before committee.
I wish to say that I am glad to be associated with Senator
Deschatelets as the seconder of this motion for the second
reading of this bill. It is not inappropriate that a senator from
Nova Scotia should find himself in this position. While Alexander Graham Bell, whose name, of course, is that of this
company, did not invent the telephone in Nova Scotia, he
spent a great deal of his lifetime there and invented a great
many other useful devices in Nova Scotia, such as the
hydrofoil, the iron lung, and so on and so forth. He, of course,
chose to be buried in Nova Scotia, and the Government of
Canada bas established in Baddeck in Nova Scotia the Alexander Graham Bell Museum to commemorate the many
activities of this most remarkably inventive man, who about
100 years or a little more ago, in Brantford, Ontario, invented
the telephone. He then took his great invention to the United
States, went through a series of the most protracted and
complicated lawsuits that have bedevilled the corporate beginnings of any enterprise in the history of modern developed
society and, finally, won out, retaining his patents and, of
course, was directly or indirectly responsible for the foundation
of companies in many parts of the world which bear his name.
The Bell Telephone Company of Canada, as Senator Deschatelets has pointed out, was incorporated in 1880, almost
100 years ago, with a share capital of $500,000.
e

(1440)

It is indicative of the kind of progress-and indeed it is
progress-that our country has made that we are dealing
today with a bill to increase that share capital of $500,000 to
$5,000 million. It amounts almost to a trebling of the authorized capital which was approved by this Parliament in 1968.
In any event, I think that this company, while it may require
our scrutiny, and our control, in some instances-as I say, I do
not rise to quarrel with Senator Choquette-is symbolic of the
great development that has taken place in Canada during this
past century.
There are two things that I should like to say. First, it is
quite remarkable that the mover of this motion said that the
company contemplates that this trebling, or nearly trebling, of
its capital stock will meet its needs only for the next decade.
That seems to me most remarkable. Whether the company will
find it necessary, and can, in fact, treble its capital investment
in a decade, I do not know; but if it can, again it is indicative
of the kind of growth and development in communications,
and in other services in this country, for which Canadians
should indeed truly be proud.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Choquette: Does the honourable senator want the
government to give them an additional $100 million?
Senator Hicks: No, I do not expect the federal government
to give them anything, and I do not think the federal government has to do that. As I say, I do not think that is relevant to
the subject under discussion in this bill.
There is one other aspect of Bell Canada which deserves
favourable comment, at least from my point of view. In the
United States the Bell Telephone Company has for many
years operated the most sophisticated electronics research
laboratories perhaps in the world, certainly on this continent.
During my time as a technical staff officer in the Royal
Canadian Artillery, being concerned with the development of
radar in Canada and the United States, I visited the Bell
Telephone laboratories on Long Island and spent some time
working with scientists there, acting as a liaison officer with
the Canadian Artillery in the development at that lime of a
certain radar which was concerned with locating enemy
mortar positions.
I am glad that Bell Canada has, despite its great research
laboratories in the United States, put itself in a position where
it does more research in Canada than any other corporation in
this country.
We are bedevilled in Canada, among all the developed
countries in the world, in having a lower proportion of industrial research performed in this country than any other developed nation. This is largely because so many of our corporations are branch plants of American corporations. They rely on
research done in the laboratories of their American parent
companies and they spend little time, effort and money on
industrial research and development in Canada. In this
respect, it is encouraging for me to hear-I did not know the
exact figures before-that Bell Canada actually employs 1,700
people, nearly half of whom are engineers and scientists, in its
research laboratories in Canada. This is an example which
should be followed by many other Canadian corporations.
As I say, I did not rise to quarrel with Senator Choquette. It
may well be that he has raised points that need to be looked
into by the committee. But, by and large, taking the large view
of this corporation, I think we have to say that here is a
corporation which is symbolic of the growth and development
of Canada. Here is a step being taken, a step which we are
asked to approve, which will nearly treble Bell's corporate
investment in this country, its telecommunications and its
future, and I hope that the committee to which this bill is
referred will give the most careful, yes, and I say sympathetic,
consideration to the request that Bell Canada is making of the
Parliament of Canada this year.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I wonder if I may
direct a question to the sponsor of the bill? Am I correct in
saying that yesterday he asked for a suspension of the rules so
that the bill could receive second reading today?
Senator Deschatelets: Yes.
Senator Grosart: Might I ask if the honourable senator is
aware of the provisions of rule 88, which says:

December 2, 1976

A motion for the suspension of the rules upon any
petition for a private bill shall not be in order, unless such
suspension has been recommended by the Committee on
Standing Rules and Orders.
I ask him: Was that permission obtained from the Committee
on Standing Rules and Orders?
Senator Hicks: By unanimous consent.
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, if I remember
correctly, yesterday when Madam Speaker asked when this
bill should be read a second time, I asked, by leave and
notwithstanding rule 44(1)(f), that the bill be dealt with on
second reading at the next sitting. I understood that two days
were normally required, but I thought that with leave I could
do that.
Senator Grosart: With respect, I would point out that the
rules clearly state that that leave cannot be given, that the
rules cannot be suspended on a private bill. The rule requires,
as the honourable senator has pointed out under 44(l)(f), that
two days' notice be given unless the rule is suspended.
The motion was that the rule be suspended but I suggest to
the house that the Senate does not have the authority in this
instance, under its own rules, to suspend its rules. Rule 88
makes it quite clear. There is an important reason why these
rules should be observed and adhered to in the Senate, particularly on a private bill in which, as Senator Choquette has
indicated, a large segment of the public is interested.
The purpose of these time lags in our rules is to alert the
public to the fact, to give them sufficient notice that a private
bill is before the Senate asking for a very wide extension of the
powers of Bell Canada, to which at this moment I am making
no objection. But I do suggest that a company such as Bell
Canada, if I am correct in my reading of the rules, should at
least come before the Senate knowing that we have rules, and
that we would expect the company to adhere to those rules and
not to seek a suspension when they clearly state, if I am
reading them correctly, that such suspension is not permitted.
I shall not go back and suggest that we are out of order at
this time. I think we are. If that motion were not in order, if it
could not have been properly be accepted, then the action of
the Senate becomes null and void. I will not argue that point.
The reason I raise it at this time is that on other occasions
with respect to private bills perhaps a more important rule for
the protection of the public has not been observed. There has
been a practice on a few occasions to suspend another rule
which requires a week's delay before the committee sits. I give
this warning at this time that if there is any attempt to
suspend that rule, I shall certainly call the attention of the
Senate to the rule and the importance of our adhering to it.
There is the question, of course, whether in spite of these
prohibitions the Senate can still overrule its own constitution. I
am not sure. It was discussed by the Rules Committee, but we
did not reach any conclusion. However, where the public
interest is so great, usually in a private bill, and particularly in
a private bill of this kind, I would hope that the sponsor of the
bill will not ask that the bill be considered immediately in

ecmer 2 197SN6T

1976

SENATE DEBA TES

December

committee. The purpose of that time lag is to give the public
the fullest possible notice that these important new powers are
requested by Bell Canada.
I make it clear that I take no stand on whether the bill is one
that should receive the consent of the Senate. I am not
discussing that point, and I may say that I have no particular
views on it at this moment, but I do think it is important when
we are dealing with a bill respecting Bell Canada that Bell
Canada should at least take the trouble to find out what are
the rules of the Senate and to keep to them.
Senator Deschatelets: On the point raised, may I be permitted to answer the remarks of Senator Grosart? His point
concerns the rules. He will agree that yesterday, when Her
Honour the Speaker asked "When shall this bill be read the
second time?" I asked leave to have the bill placed on the
order paper for second reading today. I think the honourable
senator will agree that that was the time at which to raise an
objection.
Senator Grosart: I fully agree. Unfortunately I was out of
the chamber for a short time, or I most certainly would have
raised it. I raise it now-I want to make this clear-not to
upset the proceedings. The Senate has given leave. We are on
second reading. It is not my suggestion that we should say that
second reading proceedings so far are null and void. I simply
give warning that I will object if there is any intention of
asking the Senate to suspend the other rule which our rules
clearly say cannot be suspended by the Senate on this kind of
bill.
*

(1450)

Senator Deschatelets: May I say in response to Senator
Grosart that his remarks are generally well taken, and I quite
appreciate the point that this is the kind of bill which might
interest the general public. There is no doubt about that.
However, I would remind honourable senators that, as we all
know, if this bill is given second reading it cannot go before the
appropriate standing Senate committee until at least one week
has expired, and this delay will permit representatives of the
public to attend such a meeting and to express their views.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, my point was simply
this: In view of the fact that the first rule was not observed, the
second must be.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, in my humble
opinion, rule 88 deals with a petition and not with a bill, but I
shall be glad to receive advice upon this matter.
Senator Greene: Honourable senators, on the point of order
raised by Senator Grosart, he referred to the Rules of the
Senate as the "constitution of the Senate." It might be useful
to point out that the Rules of the Senate are not the constitution of the Senate, and it might be for his benefit and for the
benefit of his party to realize that this is not a republic where
such rules do constitute a constitution. We are dealing with the
rules of a parliamentary body which can be changed at any
time. The Senate is the master of its own rules, and can
change any rule from day to day if it so wishes. The procedure
here was a quite proper one in that the rules can be changed

with the leave and consent of the Senate. There is no rule of
the Senate which cannot be changed, and this is quite proper
in a parliamentary body where the rules are the child of the
chamber itself. The rules may be changed at any time. This
Senate is the master of its own rules, and it can change any
rule at any time. The Rules of the Senate, as contained within
those imposing red covers, are not the constitution of the
Senate but merely rules which may be changed at any time.
So, honourable senators, the procedure here is a quite proper
one, although I have some sympathy with the thought underlying Senator Grosart's concern. I would urge that the committee to which this bill is sent, in keeping with the point raised by
an earlier speaker, take a very careful look at the degree of
control exercised over the Canadian company by its foreign
parent. I am not sure whether AT&T controls Bell Canada,
but I would urge the committee to call witnesses, and to insist
on the appearance of witnesses, from the parent company so
that we may get from them, the officers of AT&T, the whole
story about real control and the degree of autonomy which
Bell Canada bas before the ultimate passage of this bill.
There is great concern in Canada as to foreign control and
domination, some of it, in my view, largely overblown rhetoric,
but this being one of the great Canadian corporations I think it
would be very useful for the Senate, in its inquiry in committee, to determine exactly the degree of shareholding and the
degree of effective control and the degree of day-to-day practical control over the Canadian entity by its parent AT&T. I
sincerely urge that the committee to which it is sent insist on
the appearance of the American executive officers of AT&T
before the passage of this bill. If the officers of Bell Canada
are anxious to have this bill passed, then I am sure they can
readily arrange for officers of their American parent to appear
and tell their story before a committee of the Senate.
I think the Senate would be doing very useful work in
demonstrating the whole story of Bell Canada and the effect of
its American control to the Canadian public. If that is done we
shall have the facts on this, and not some of the horror stories
thrown into the air to panic the Canadian public by Peter
Newman and some of his supporters.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I do not want to
prolong the discussion on this point of order, but two important points have been raised, and because this is a matter
which no doubt will be considered by the Rules Committee, I
think I should answer those two points.
One is raised by Senator Greene when he quite properly
says that the Senate is master of its own rules, but its own
rules say that there are two specific exceptions; there are two
occasions when a motion to suspend the rules, a motion to
become master of its rules, is not permitted. In two instances
only do the rules say that such a motion shall not be in order.
Now Her Honour bas quite properly drawn attention to the
wording of rule 88, which says:
A motion for the suspension of the rules upon any
petition for a private bill-

SENATE DEBATES
This matter bas been discussed at length. What does "a
petition" mean? My interpretation is that the petition is still
before us. The rule does not say "for the introduction of a
petition." We are now dealing with a petition for the passing
of a private bill.
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Senator Grosart: Of course we are. It is a petition that a bill
be passed. I merely say for the record that that is my interpretation of it, and I think it would stand up.
Senator Hicks: Honourable senators, I wish to speak to the
point of order that Senator Grosart has raised. I think that
Senator Greene is correct when he says that we are the
masters of our own rules, and whether the fine point as to
whether a motion for the second reading of a private bill
should be distinguished from a petition for a private bill is a
matter that I am not going to address myself to at the present
time. Had Senator Grosart objected yesterday when Senator
Deschatelets asked for leave to move second reading today,
there is no question but that that would have frustrated the
moving ahead of the second reading of the bill. That was not
done, and I think it is too late to raise the point now.
However, there is another even more serious allegation-in
my view, it is more serious-that Senator Grosart has made in
saying that we should not grant Bell Canada any suspension of
our rules. Of course, Bell Canada had absolutely nothing to do
with the suspension of our rules. This was a request on the part
of a member of this chamber, without consultation as to any
procedure of this chamber with Bell Canada or anyone else,
and in granting this suspension of our rules and accelerating
the motion for second reading of this bill we were not doing
anything for Bell Canada. We were merely expediting the
dealing with this matter in our own chamber. I think it would
be quite wrong to infer that this is a concession to Bell
Canada. It could only, at most, be a concession to our own
procedures in this house.
I suggest, therefore, that Senator Grosart's point of order
was not taken in time, and that the Senate is quite capable of
dispensing with a time interval, if it wants to, in relation to any
of the rules of the house.
S(1500)

I concede that had one person-Senator Grosart or anyone
else-raised an objection at the time, we would then have had
to fall back on the rules. As it is, we are at the second reading
stage of this bill. I do not think anyone wants to rush it
through. Should Senator Grosart wish to move the adjournment of this debate in order to give more time for the general
public to pay heed to our deliberations in this chamber, I for
one would agree with his motion. But unless be wants to do
that, I think we are quite competent to deal with the issue now
before us.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.

December 2, 1976

WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION ASSEMBLY
TWENTY-SECOND SESSION, PARIS, FRANCE

Hon. Rhéal Bélisle rose pursuant to notice of November 30,
1976:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the first
part of the Twenty-second Session of the Western European Union Assembly held in Paris, France, from 14th to
17th June, 1976, and in particular to the discussions and
proceedings of the Session and the participation therein of
the delegation from Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, in June of this year I had the
privilege of being invited to the first part of the Twenty-second
Ordinary Session of the Western European Union Assembly
held at Palais d'Iéna in Paris, France. I accompanied Mr. John
Roberts, M.P., who, in September of this year, was appointed
Secretary of State of Canada by the Prime Minister. He led
the Canadian delegation of two, who were part of a group of
11 parliamentary observers from Canada, Denmark, Greece,
Norway and Portugal. This was the first time in the history of
the Western European Union Assembly that parliamentary
observers from outside the Union were invited, and I was
extremely pleased and honoured to represent the Senate of
Canada.
If I may be permitted, I should like to give you my impression of the visit and some of the highlights of the Twentysecond Ordinary Session of the Western European Union
Assembly. Before doing so, however, I should like to say a few
words about the Assembly itself.
The institution of the Western European Union Assembly in
1954, under the modified Brussels Treaty, was a new expression of the overall trend which had earlier led to the formation
of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe and the
European Community Security Council Assembly. It was
linked with the wishes of the advocates of the European idea to
have the same type of democratic representative institutions as
in the national framework, and, in accordance with the principles of parliamentary democracy, the European organizations
with political responsibilities should have a representative parliamentary body to balance the governmental representatives.
Consequently, the authors of the treaty, after defining the
Council's competence in Article VIII, made it binding on the
Council to submit an annual report on its activities to "an
assembly composed of representatives of the Brussels Treaty
powers to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of
Europe."
The Western European Union Assembly which was thus
created meets in principle twice a year in plenary session in the
chamber of the French Economic and Social Council, Place
d'Iéna, in Paris, France. It may, however, meet elsewhere, and
has held sessions in London, Rome and Brussels. The
Assembly's permanent seat is in Paris.
As I mentioned, the Western European Union Assembly is
composed of representatives of the Brussels Treaty powers to
the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, which
are Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,

December 2, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The
Western European Union Assembly is composed of 89 representatives from each of the seven countries, the number from
each being in accordance with Article 26 of the Statute of the
Council of Europe.
I do not wish to burden honourable senators with a long
history of the Western European Union. However, I do think it
is important to note the circumstances surrounding the birth of
this organization so as to understand its current purpose and
place in modern European society.
The Western European Union took over from the Brussels
Treaty Organization after amendment of the Brussels Treaty,
which had originally been signed in March, 1948. Thus, the
Western European Union was born in a tense international
situation, at a time when it was still impossible to settle the
problems arising out of World War Il by means of a peace
treaty with Germany.
The aim of the London and Paris Agreements was to
improve Western European security by allowing West Germany to take part in its own defence and to weave a complex
system of undertakings and reciprocal guarantees between the
member countries. The Western European Union Assembly,
therefore, worked out an original armaments control procedure. One of the main tasks of the Assembly was, consequently, to exercise parliamentary supervision of the controls
applied by the governments.
In addition, in December, 1950, the Council of the Brussels
Treaty Organization transferred all of its collective defence
activities to NATO. That decision was confirmed by the
Western European Union Council in July, 1956, and it
informed the Western European Union Assembly that the
representative governments within it should consider certain
defence questions.
In the political field, the Assembly started a dialogue with
the Council on European Political Cooperation and, parallel
with the dialogue, has always resolutely transmitted recommendations to the Council on means of ensuring European
security, feeling its action in this area to be particularly
important since it is the only official international parliamentary assembly with competence in defence matters. It should
be noted also that it is in fact the only exclusively European
assembly discussing defence questions. NATO, on the other
hand, represents nations both inside and outside of Europe.
The Western European Union Council has always replied to
the Assembly's recommendations, which are transmitted to the
North Atlantic Council whenever appropriate.
In recent years the Assembly has extended its discussions to
the field of civil and military technological and scientific
cooperation, and through its Council has often produced very
substantive replies to recommendations on these matters. At
the same time it should be noted that the Western European
Union Assembly no longer deals with social and cultural
matters, these having been transferred to the Council of
Europe.

The subjects discussed at the Twenty-second Ordinary Session reflected the current emphasis and concerns of the
Assembly, and included détente and security in Europe, European aeronautical policy, security in the Mediterranean,
reserve forces, strategic mobility, and the role of the Atlantic
Alliance in the world today.
Some of the members, prior to the First Part of the Twentysecond Ordinary Session of the Assembly, felt that it would be
marked by disillusionment and concern for two reasons: first,
in view of the slow progress being made towards European
union, the Assembly felt entitled to neglect the favourite
subject of the political committee, which is the place of
defence in a future European union; secondly, the June Session
of the Assembly, being held shortly after the spring meeting of
the North Atlantic Council and just before the Italian elections, seemed to be at the crossroads of a two-fold threat to the
west-an external threat because of the accumulation of
Soviet weapons and forces in Europe and the Mediterranean,
and an external threat stemming from the possible accension
of Communist parties to power through coalitions in certain
Western European Union member countries such as Italy and
Portugal. This prospect could lead to harrowing changes in
United States defence policy.
e

(1510)

However, by the time the First Session had got under way,
the feelings of disillusionment and concern had somewhat
subsided and there were signs of renewed life for the Western
European Union and its Standing Armaments Committee,
although the President of the Assembly was unduly disheartened by the lack of progress in the building of a strong Europe.
There was still much division among the members of the
Western European Union over the aims of the Europe which
they are intending to build. Some see it as a fairly flexible
association for defending trade interests; others as a union to
be steadily strengthened until it becomes a federation with
responsibilities in the monetary, diplomatic and military fields.
Unfortunately, many of the member countries are so absorbed
by their respective domestic problems and economic difficulties that they have postponed major decisions in this area, and
instead have adopted a purely pragmatic view of the defence of
Europe. There is a noticeable lack of co-ordinated action
within Europe, and particularly in the salvation of the armaments industries' capability. Indeed, as the President of the
Assembly stated, there is a great need for strengthening the
Alliance's security by ensuring that the European governments
pay greater attention to safeguarding their industrial potential,
which is to produce their own military aircraft and armaments
instead of importing them from outside of Europe.
I found the debate on the subject of détente and security in
Europe particularly interesting. Sir Frederic Bennett of the
United Kingdom and rapporteur of the General Affairs Committee introduced the subject and, along with several others,
made some thought-provoking statements.
He warned the Assembly that the Western World faces a
potential threat at least as great as, if not greater than, we
faced in the late 1930s, and that at present we are not in a

SENATE DEBATES
position militarily to guarantee our own security. He went on
to say:
I can state that, whether or not we are in a position to
guarantee our own security today, the rate of development
of the Warsaw Pact forces and of the Soviet Union in
particular means that, unless we reconsider our defences
next year and the year after, no rapporteur will be able to
stand here and say that we are in a position to defend
ourselves with a complete guarantee of security. Although
there may be arguments today, therefore, unless we act
differently in the future and give defence matters a
greater degree of attention, including standardization and
so on, we shall increasingly fall behind.
All our governments accept this. Indeed the German
Federal Government is itself taking steps to stabilize its
own defence. The French, to their credit, have announced
a very considerable increase in the effort they are devoting to their conventional forces, and the United States is
doing likewise.
Another United Kingdom representative, Mr. Julian Critchley, spoke on the theme of Europe's dependence on the United
States for protection and economic prosperity which in due
course will make it increasingly difficult and uncomfortable
for Europe to cast aside. He said:
There are three roads which might conceivably lead
towards the unity of Europe. The first is unity through
conquest, which has been tried comparatively recently and
which, fortunately, failed. Secondly, there may be unity
through economics which is, at present, the whole thrust
of the Common Market experiment and idea. Thirdly,
there is the possibility of unity through the threat of a
common enemy.
The enemy exists: The enemy is Russia. Yet the American alliance and our protection by America have succeeded in reducing our perception of the threat in Europe.
Europe has preferred its security to its independence
because, for the past quarter of a century, Europe has
been an American military protectorate. European
defence has been the gift of the United States, just as
Europe's prosperity has come to depend upon free access
to raw materials-a system long sustained by United
States power.
Three new features have contributed to European
unease. First the United States has moved towards an
understanding with the USSR and a mutual acceptance
of the status quo established in Europe-the division of
Europe itself. Secondly, there is the slow collapse of the
western monetary system. In response Europe has tried to
build a European monetary union which would reflect the
commercial flavour and strength of Europe. Thirdly, the
United States Middle East policies resulted in the oil
embargo, which seriously threatened both Europe's prosperity and her politics.
We are experiencing the end of the post-war system. As
the United States military strength and power and her

December 2, 1976

failing commitment is seen to weaken, Europe must
sooner or later be faced with alternatives.
The first is that Europe will decline into a less comfortable dependence on or subordination to one side or other
of the super powers. It could become Finlandised as a
Soviet dependency or become another Canada or Mexico.
The second is that Europe, its vital interests no longer the
exclusive concern of the United States, may begin to
rebuild and strengthen her unity and independence. So
robust a reaction would be rational and logical for a
European bloc and would be the natural response of
middle-ranking European states faced with a fragmenting
world order.
Which of these courses appears more likely? There is
evidence in favour of both. First, if we are gloomy about
the prospects for Europe, there is little leadership in the
West and virtually none in Europe. There is a comfortable
reliance upon the theory of convergence. The only trouble
is that we are converging more rapidly than they are.

•

(1520)

There are also in Europe itself the consequences of the
social revolution which has taken place since the end of
the war. The old elites have largely vanished; the newlyrich have become Americanized Europeans, but with none
of that wish for involvement in politics which is so characteristic of the Americans themselves. In short, the two
world wars and the events following on them have sapped
the political will of Europe.
Honourable senators, developments in defence are occurring
with such rapidity that it is not possible for statistics to carry
any lasting significance, but the figures on the balance of
military forces between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries show a disturbing trend. Undoubtedly, these armaments
are the product of policies made ten, or even twenty, years ago,
and therefore we cannot expect immediate or dramatic
changes in Soviet policy. What disturbs me is the amount of
money which the Soviet Union is spending on defence matters,
not only at home but overseas. As Sir John Rogers of the
United Kingdom observed:
-superiority of roughly three to one in all arms-be they
soldiers, tanks, guns, aircraft, ships or submarinesshould give us food for thought. Why should Russia
pursue a policy designed to achieve strategic weapon
superiority and develop diverse offensive capability and
increase these in such numbers that it is possible for
Russia to support political objectives in distant areas like
Angola and the Middle East, to say nothing of the Cape
route or the Indian Ocean? Soviet military strength is
being progressively transformed into an ever more capable, ever more flexible and ever more responsive means of
supporting globally expanding Soviet political objectives.
Missile-carrying submarines are being launched at a
rate of two every month. A new type, with more than 16
missiles with multiple warheads, is expected to appear.
The Soviet submarine fleet is the largest in the world,

SENATE DEBATES

December 2, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

December 2, 1976

with over 300 vessels. Whatever the advantages accruing
from our presence at the CSCE talks, it is undoubtedly
true that these have not in any way led to a slackening in
Russia's military build-up.
We must not exaggerate Russian strength but we
should be complete idiots to underestimate it. Nations
fear not so much that Russia is likely to embark on a
belligerent course in Europe but that countries such as
Yugoslavia, Italy, Greece, Turkey and others may be
subjected to pressures from Russia, backed by military
superiority, to bring about Communist states in Europe,
perhaps initially through the device of the popular front,
with the Communists hiding behind the respectability of
the Socialists.
For Canada's part, our presence did not go unnoticed. We
were welcomed observers. Mr. John Roberts, M.P., who led
the Canadian delegation, was invited to address the Assembly
on the first day. I believe this was the first occasion that a
parliamentary observer from outside the Western European
Union had been asked to speak to the Assembly, and Mr.
Roberts did an admirable job in presenting Canada's foreign
policy.
Honourable senators, if I may be permitted, I would like to
share with you a thought that I brought home from the
Twenty-second Ordinary Session of the Western European
Union Assembly. It is simply this: Everyone desires peaceful
co-existence. No one seeks confrontation. Everyone wishes to
see a lowering of the tension which now, unfortunately, exists
between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. Everyone wishes to.
build a safer and more secure world, free from the threat of
war, and to encourage and facilitate more productive relations
between governments and people. But we must not take for
granted that the world is safe for democracy. We must be
perpetually on our guard.
The Hon. the Speaker: As no other honourable senator
wishes to participate, this inquiry is considered as having been
debated.

DISTINGUISHED VISITOR IN GALLERY

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I should like at
this time to welcome Mr. Christian Valentin, member of the

is the bearer of greetings from the President of the Senegalese
Parliament to the Canadian Parliament.

LUMBER INDUSTRY
EFFECT OF TARIFF ON IMPORTATION OF SOFTWOOD
PLYWOOD-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. G. Percival Burchili rose pursuant to notice of

November 30, 1976:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the tariff
on the importation of softwood plywood and the serious
effect it is having on the Canadian plywood industry.

He said: Honourable senators, my inquiry concerns a
Canadian domestic matter. The Canadian softwood plywood
market is in deep trouble, and one of the contributing causes is
the large quantity of softwood plywood which is being imported from the United States. The Canadian tariff on softwood
plywood is 15 per cent, while the American duty on Canadian
plywood entering the United States is 20 per cent. Representations have been made to the government over the years to
equalize the duty, but so far they have been unsuccessful.
The statistics tell the story. In 1975, last year, 513 million
square feet of softwood plywood were imported into Canada
from the United States, representating a value of over $63
million, while 302,000 square feet were exported from Canada
to the United States with a value of $56,000. The up-to-date
figures available for this year indicate that so far there has
been an imported quantity of 250 million square feet, valued at
$30 million, while Canadian exports to the United States are
102,000 square feet, with a value of $13,000.
In an article published in the Globe and Mail on November
20 last, under the heading: "Dropping Behind Against World
Competition," Mr. J. V. Clyne, former chairman of MacMillan Bloedel, Vancouver, is reported as saying:
Canada's competitive position in the forest industry has
been so eroded that American imports now are claiming
23 per cent of the Canadian market for softwood plywoods. As late as 1971 the percentage was 1 per cent.
Between 1961 and 1972 Canada's share of world exports
in forest products dropped from 22.6 per cent to 19.3 per
cent.
As a result of all this, several plywood manufacturing plants
have been obliged to suspend their operations and lay off their
employees. An announcement in the Globe and Mail yesterday, December 1, and also, I believe, reported on the television
news, stated that 4,000 employees, including those in logging
as well as employees in the manufacturing plant, of MacMillan Bloedel will lose their jobs tomorrow, December 3. This
will be followed by the year-end closing of some of their mills
due to poor markets. Normally the woods operations are shut
down late in December by weather, but this is much earlier
than usual and is caused by poor markets. The woods closing
will last until early January.
(1530)
(

Among the plants obliged to close down their operations is a
plant in New Brunswick, the only softwood plywood plant in
the Atlantic provinces. This plant, a subsidiary of a company
which has been an employer of labour since 1857, was obliged
to suspend operations and lay off its employees, about 300,
who are now walking the streets and drawing unemployment
insurance.
I need not remind honourable senators of the distressing
effect on the people who live in the small community in which
this plant is located, whose living depends on earnings from
this industry. The forest industry of New Brunswick bas been
hit hard, first by the ravages of the budworm, then by the
diminished buying power of the United Kingdom market, and

SENATE DEBATES
then the insidious effects of inflation. Under these circumstances, and with the problem of unemployment the first
priority in government policies, it would seem only a fair
proposition that in the matter of tariffs the Canadian industry
and its workers be given an equal break in competition with
the United States.
On motion of Senator Petten for Senator Robichaud, debate
adjourned.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO STUDY CAUSES OF
PERSONALITY DISORDERS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOURDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Fred A. McGrand moved, pursuant to notice of
November 30:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon such experiences in prenatal life and early childhood
as may cause personality disorders or criminal behaviour
in later life and to consider and recommend such remedial
and preventative measures relating thereto as may be
reasonably expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of crime and violence in society;
That the committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical and clerical personnel as may
be required for the purpose of the inquiry; and
That the committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate.
He said: Honourable senators, on May 14, 1975, I moved
that the Senate of Canada appoint a committee to study
certain aspects of crime and violence in Canada. That motion
was misunderstood by most senators. The question I asked
was: Why does a boy of six with a psychological trauma
become a dangerous psychopath at the age of 26? Today I ask
the same question. The real question is: What was the nature
of that trauma, and when did he suffer it? Another question is:
Why have we in Canada done so little to answer that question?
A further question that many Canadians are asking is: Why
did the Senate of Canada permit this important question to
remain in limbo for one and a half years?
Three times in ten years the question of the death penalty
has been debated in this chamber, and usually with more heat
than light. Those debates were intense and always well attended. That question will be debated again, and again with more
heat than light until Canadian public opinion is better
informed on the making of a murderer than it is today. Once
the debate in Parliament is over, Parliament ignores this
serious question until it is debated again.
What is the alternative to capital punishment? I can understand why those who believe in the death penalty are not
interested in an alternative. They believe the death penalty to
be the only just treatment for a murderer and the best
protection for the public against murder. The responsibility of
seeking an alternative does not rest with them but with those

December 2, 1976

who oppose the death penalty, and they include both the
Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition in
this chamber, who both supported the bill to abolish the death
penalty. The abolitionists in Parliament are inconsistent,
because they are indifferent and have no alternative to put
forward. Yet the question is there and is this: What goes into
the making of a murderer? When and how are these traumas
received? They can come at any time, at birth, immediately
after birth usually in the first three years of life and, believe it
or not, they can come before birth. This is so difficult for
people to understand, and it is an aspect of crime that is not
described in the law books, not recorded in the Criminal Code,
nor can it be isolated and examined as a statistic by Statistics
Canada. For this reason my previous motion was not taken
seriously, or understood. However, there are those who have no
difficulty in understanding it, and who wish to support this
study.
I contacted those best qualified to judge and advise, and
received replies from many of them. I will read the names of
some of those who support this study. I have a synopsis of a
four-page letter signed by three leading psychiatrists at the
University of Toronto and the Sick Children's Hospital. The
names are: Dr. Gordon E. Warme, Chief, Child & Adolescent
Service, Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Assistant Professor of
Psychiatry, University of Toronto; Dr. Granville A. daCosta,
Staff Psychiatrist, Child & Adolescent Service, Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto;
and Dr. J. D. Atcheson, Senior Psychiatrist, Forensic Outpatient Department, Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Associate
Professor of Psychiatry, University of Toronto. I have a letter
from Dr. B. A. Boyd, Medical Director of the Institution for
the Criminally Insane at Penetanguishene; a letter from Dr. R.
E. Stokes, M. D., Psych., F.R.C.P., Director of Bracebridge
Mental Health Services; a letter from Dr. C. K. McKnight,
Chief of Forensic Services, Clarke Institute of Psychiatry; a
letter from Professor John T. Omanique, Associate Professor
of Philosophy and member of the third research team for the
Club of Rome; and a letter from the Director of the Department of Humane Education, University of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Dr. C. K. McKnight wrote me a lengthy letter of three
pages, and gave me seven reasons why this study should be
undertaken. I will not trouble you by reading that letter and
reasons, but I will quote one paragraph:
Although it would be hard to document all the reasons
for this, it is my belief, and I think it is shared by many,
that there is a real sense of urgency that we must at least
attempt to do concrete things about these problems in a
way that we have not tried before. In brief, one senses
that time may be running out for us. Perhaps we have
only some five to ten years to work with.
I wonder what Dr. McKnight is referring to when he says we
have perhaps only five or ten years.
One of the leading psychiatrists in this field is Dr. Elliott
Barker, Consultant at the Mental Health Centre, Penetanguishene. He was a witness at the meeting of the Health, Welfare

December 2, 1976

December 2, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

and Science Committee on June 17. He is the founder of the
Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
Dr. Barker believes that the Senate is the best agency to carry
out this investigation, and he gives six reasons why.
These men to whom I have referred are leaders in the field
of psychiatry. They have studied crime and criminals for many
years. They are anxious that Canada take its place among
other countries in conducting an in-depth study of the many
factors that go into the making of a criminal.
What is the alternative to the death penalty? The answer is
obvious, but not an easy one. The remedy is to get the child as
soon as minimal brain disfunction is recognized or, better still,
to prevent minimal brain disfunction from taking place. It has
many causes. It can take place before birth, at birth and after
birth.
A survey in Denmark shows that 15 of Denmark's 16 most
vicious criminals suffered brain damage ai birth. A survey in
Denmark of 1,682 children, who were breach births, shows
that 25 per cent of them failed in one or two grades before
they reached grade 9. Many of them were dropouts. A survey
done by the Salvation Army in Canada shows that 80 per cent
of the first offenders to come before our courts had learning
problems. The matter of learning problems has been known as
specific learning disability and perception handicap, and is
now known as minimal brain disfunction.
The Quebec Association for Children with Learning Problems received a LIP grant in 1976. After seven months of work
they published a report entitled "Delinquent or Disabled." Anyone who reads that report will be aware that they
were more disabled than delinquent. The disability came first,
and the delinquency second.
An article in the Ottawa Citizen, in April 1975, reads as
follows:
"The Canadian Government could reduce juvenile delinquency and cut its criminal rehabilitation spending if it
recognized and treated learning disabilities in children,"
says the president of the Ontario Association for Children
with Learning Disabilities. Seventy per cent of the
inmates of Canada's penal system have learning disabilities in their backgrounds. By school age, three or four
children in every class fail to get a proper education
because of undiagnosed learning disabilities. Many of the
children who are made to sit in corners or stand in the
hall as punishment are frustrated by learning disabilities.
A ten-year study made in Montreal, which began in 1963,
on the nutrition of 2,000 public maternity patients, showed
that many of them had a lack of protein in their diet, sufficient
to cause minimal brain damage in the child. It is well known
that children born of mothers addicted to heroin show the
symptoms of heroin withdrawal a few days after birth. What is
the future of these children?
It is well known that lack of oxygen in the blood supply of a
child's brain before or during birth can cause brain damage.
Dr. Leboyer, the Paris obstetrician, who for the past 12 years
has delivered babies without offence to their senses of sight

and sound, writes in his book Birth Without Violence, "Lack

of oxygen, even for a few seconds, will damage the brain to the
extent that the child will become a cripple."
Most of the boys with criminal records who go for treatment
to the Father Flanagan Home in Omaha have minimal brain
disfunction. The research carried out at Johns Hopkins Hospital should be of interest to our committee. Dr. Hardy, Professor of Pediatrics, carried out an intense physical, neurological
and psychological evaluation of 6,000 children. This group has
now reached the age of 10. The research shows that children
who suffered damage during prenatal, perinatal and postnatal
periods are the ones who, when raised in a home with stress
factors such as alcoholism, or an absent parent, demonstrated
less ability to develop socially acceptable behaviour patterns.
Here the story unfolds of the psychological trauma in the
home imposed on the physical trauma received before, during,
or immediately after birth.
The Globe and Mail published during 1976 the life stories
of several vicious criminals. Two of these, John Graham and
Danny Robinson, were abused at home, in foster homes and in
school. What is lacking in their life story is the prenatal,
perinatal and postnatal periods of their lives. Did their mothers
have a healthy diet when they were in utero? Did they have
sufficient oxygen at birth? And what trauma did they receive
in the first, second or third year of life? These are the lost
chapters in the lives of most criminals.
*

(1550)

Now, what would it cost to rescue children with symptoms
of minimal brain disfunction very early in life by providing
special teaching methods for them? What does it cost now to
look after them? A study in Rhode Island shows that it costs
$26,000 a year to maintain a boy in a reformatory, and it costs
on an average $100,000 to keep that boy for a period of two to
four years in the reformatory. What does it cost to maintain
him when he becomes an adult criminal?
Honourable senators, don't worry about the cost of this
proposed investigation. It will not be very much. We will not
need a staff of researchers; the committee will not travel from
place to place. The Auditor General will never find fault with
or question expenses incurred by this committee. But through
its work Canada can take its place, its proper place, alongside
Denmark, Great Britain, France, the United States and Japan.
I understand that in this field of research the Russians are now
ahead of the western world.
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, may I be permitted to say a few words on this subject? My remarks will
have nothing to do with the nature of the motion proposed by
Senator McGrand. I must congratulate him for the initiative
he showed last year and in coming back again this year, and I
hope that a committee will be organized to find the facts about
violence in our society.
My remarks are addressed to the government leader and
also to the deputy government leader, and have to do with the
kind of committee we should have to deal with the subject
matter of Senator McGrand's motion. This would be, in my

SENATE DEBATES
view, a fact-finding committee, and I hope that the criticisms I
shall express will be well taken. When Senator Lamontagne
the day before yesterday made his motion regarding the
membership of his committee it was stated, I think, that there
would be 20 or 22 members of that committee. I do not believe
that with a committee of this size we can do good work, so I
think it is about time for us to try an experiment. With respect
to the kind of committee that Senator McGrand has in mind, I
hope that the government leader and his deputy and the
Senate will examine the possibility-and why not?-of
appointing five senators who show an interest in the matters
that have been raised. We could give those five senators the
responsibility of getting the facts and reporting within, say, a
year. I do not believe that these committees should extend
their work beyond a period of one year. I think it is possible for
five senators interested in this matter to come forward with
valuable recommendations within a year.
It might be said that a committee of five senators is too
small. One might be sick and another might not be able to
attend for any one of a number of reasons, but it could be well
understood that all members of the Senate are eligible to
attend meetings of the committee so that there could always be
five senators present to examine witnesses.
I am just throwing this suggestion out for what it is worth.
Having regard to the number of standing and joint committees
we have and the number of special committees-and possibly
there will be others-I would further suggest that if we give

December 2, 1976

this job to five senators we could relieve them of the duties
they might have on other committees. We could then tell them
that we are giving them this responsibility. We could say to
them, "You get the facts and report within a year."
As I say, I am just throwing out that suggestion for what it
is worth, but I think this is an experiment worth trying and
this is an appropriate situation in which to try it.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I should like to say
just a word in reply to the suggestion made by Senator
Deschatelets. If I understand him correctly, he is suggesting
that a special fact-finding committee composed of five members be set up. I am informed that this way of proceeding in
committee has been considered in the past, but in view of the
fact that at times the Senate is short-handed, as it is at the
present time due to the number of vacancies, such a suggestion
could not be entertained.
However, this is not the purpose of the motion before us at
the moment. What Senator McGrand is proposing is that this
matter be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science, to which I have no objection.
While we are prepared to give some further consideration to
the suggestion made by Senator Deschatelets this afternoon, I
do not think we are prepared to make up our minds definitely
on the matter at the present time, and, as I have said, this is
not called for by the motion at present before the house.
On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, December 7, at 8 p.m.

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, on December 2 of
this year the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Senator
Flynn, asked the question:

80003-13

REPLY FROM PREMIER 0F QUEBEC-QUESTION ANSWERED

SENATE DEBATES
I wonder if the Leader of the Government would care to
inform the Senate as to whether or not the government
has drawn any conclusions from or is apprehensive about
the reply of the Premier of the Province of Quebec to the
Prime Minister's invitation to the upcoming Federal-Provincial Conference in which he stated that he was prepared to deal with the fiscal problems between Ottawa
and the provinces, but not constitutional matters.
I wish to table a copy of the reply of the Premier of Quebec
in which he noted that the discussion of federal-provincial
fiscal relations would be the principal object of the meeting,
and that he did not think there would be enough time to give
the discussion of the Constitution its due. Federal-provincial
relations have never been easy but the governments of Canada,
whether federal or provincial, ail seek to secure the welfare of
Canadian citizens and to improve their standard of living.
Sharing this common purpose with ail provincial governments,
the federal government sees no cause for apprehension with
respect to the reply of the Prime Minister of Quebec.
In reply to a question in the House of Commons today, the
Prime Minister stated that the provinces had agreed that there
would be only two items on the agenda, the first being fiscal
arrangements and the second the state of the economy; but the
third item on the Constitution, at the request of at least some
of the provinces, bas now been placed on the agenda.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, if I heard the Leader
of the Government correctly, there seems to be a contradiction.
I understood him to say that the Constitution would not be on
the agenda, and yet towards the end of his remarks he
indicated that at the request of some of the provinces the
matter of the Constitution would be on the agenda. Is there a
contradiction here between that and what appeared to be the
statement of the Prime Minister that there would not be time
to discuss the Constitution at this particular Federal-Provincial Conference?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the original thought
of the Quebec provincial government was apparently that time
would not permit adequate discussion of the Constitution, but
I understand that a recent development at the conference has
led to the inscription of this item on the agenda.
PRIVATE BILL
BELL CANADA-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, December 2, the
debate on the motion of Senator Deschatelets for the second
reading of Bill S-2, respecting Bell Canada.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I am sure the
chamber is aware that I adjourned this debate primarily for
the purpose of allowing an interval in which those who might
be interested in this most important bill would have time to
study it. There is some reason to believe that that adjournment
bas been effective, because there has been considerable study
of the bill at this stage. It seemed to me important that that
study should take place while the debate on second reading

December 7, 1976

was in progress and not only after the bill had, as the sponsor
indicated, been referred to committee.
Perhaps I may be pardoned for pointing out to honourable
senators that we are at the moment still debating the expediency of the petition. I mentioned this the other day and some
honourable senators said, "No", but the motion before us
includes the following words:
Whereas Bell Canada, hereinafter called the "Company", has by its petition prayed that its Act of Incorporation and the Acts in amendment thereof be amended as
hereinafter provided, and it is expedient to grant the
prayer of the petitionThat is the motion before us. We are discussing the expediency
of granting the petition. I will say no more on that point.
Those honourable senators who are interested will be aware of
the reason I have interjected that into my remarks.
At first glance, this seemed to be a bill merely asking the
Parliament of Canada to make the necessary arrangements for
Bell Canada to be able to increase its capitalization over the
next decade. I do not think anyone would question the necessity of Bell Canada's continually increasing its capitalization. It
is a highly capital intensive industry, and it is perfectly understandable that from time to time over the years since 1880 it
has found it necessary to increase its capitalization. This
company is a leader in Canada, a leader in the world, in high
science and technology, which is an area requiring large
capital expenditures. I would be the first to say that in many
ways Bell Canada, through its subsidiaries and on its own, bas
made a magnificent contribution to research and development
in Canada, and the use of research and development to produce important product innovations which not only serve the
domestic market but also make some important inroads in
export markets.
However, what struck me on a careful reading of the bill is
that Bell Canada-perhaps understandably-is seeking to get
out from under some of the controls which, up until now, the
Parliament of Canada and the public of Canada have deemed
necessary to control the operations of this very large company,
whose activities affect the everyday lives of so many Canadian
citizens.
In his explanation the sponsor said that one of the purposes
of the bill is to eliminate the need to obtain CRTC approval of
the amount, terms and conditions of each equity issue. We are
aware that up until now approval of such equity issues has
been required, but Bell Canada, for what I presume to be valid
reasons, understandable reasons, wishes to be exempt from the
control of this very important Canadian governmental
commission.
If I may, I should like to quote from the sponsor's remarks
as they are reported at page 182 of Hansardof December 2, as
follows:
The company also seeks authority to further alter its
objects, powers and share capital by applying to the
Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs for letters
patent, which would be subject to resolution by either

house of Parliament during a period of 30 sitting days
following their tabling before Parliament. This procedure,
commonly known as the negative resolution procedure, is
provided for in the Telesat Canada Act, and was most
recently made part of the Income Tax Conventions Act,
1976.
Does this mean that Bell Canada is now seeking, through this
apparently innocuous amendment, to get out from under the
control of Parliament?
We are aware that there have been changes in the Canada
Corporations Act whereby companies can be incorporated by
letters patent. I was surprised that the sponsor of the bill gave
us no explanation in this regard, and I think it is important
that this point be raised at this particular time when we are
dealing with the principle of the bill. It seems to me a very
important principle of this bill-that it is in the public interest
for Bell Canada, through an act of Parliament, to be allowed
out from under this important control which, up until now,
Parliament has found to be necessary. I am not at this stage
arguing the point of whether this is so or not, but I would hope
that the sponsor of the bill in speaking, as I presume he will,
on the principle of the bill, will go into much greater detail in
this respect than he did in his remarks on moving the second
reading.
•

(2020)

As a matter of fact, we have had no explanation of why Bell
Canada now seeks to get out from under these control mechanisms which up to now appear, as I say, to have been
regarded as necessary. I would ask him why Bell Canada now
finds it convenient, or necessary, or expedient, to elimate the
need to obtain the CRTC's approval of the amount, terms and
conditions of each equity issue, and also why Bell Canada now
seeks, to use the exact words of the sponsor, to further alter its
objectives, and so on, including share capital, by applying to
the minister, and to be able to do this by letters patent instead
of coming, as they do now, to the Parliament of Canada to
seek this authority.
This is particularly interesting to me in view of the fact that
the sponsor of the bill has told us that the proposed $3.2 billion
increase in capitalization at this particular time would meet
the requirements of Bell Canada for the next decade. If this is
so, why is it necessary to ask that Bell Canada be released
from the obligation to obtain CRTC approval of each equity
issue, thus-if that is the purpose-by-passing parliamentary
authority and, in future, obtaining this authority merely by
letters patent from the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.
I think we can all understand the desire of Bell Canada, or
any other company, to get out from under some of the controls
that the business community finds objectionable at the
moment, but it does seem to me rather startling that Bell
Canada would appear to find it necessary to remove in one fell
swoop these controls which, as I say, appear to have been
found necessary up to now.
Hon. Jean-Paul Deschatelets: Honourable senators-

80003-13/2

The Hon. the Speaker: I wish to inform the Senate that if
the honourable Senator Deschatelets speaks now his speech
will have the effect of closing the debate on the motion for
second reading of this bill.
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, I have listened
with great interest to the remarks made by some senators
during this debate, and I wish to thank them for their
comments.
It is not my intention to prolong this debate with any further
extensive remarks, since an opportunity will be given to deal
with all relevant matters pertaining to this bill when it is
examined by the standing Senate committee to which it will be
referred. There is one point, however, which I would like to
clarify. In my initial remarks I stated that over 97 per cent of
Bell Canada shareholders were resident in Canada. These
shareholders own approximately 98 per cent of all the shares
outstanding.
Last week the issue was raised-by Senator Greene, I
think-of the relationship between Bell Canada and the
American Telephone and Telegraph Company, or AT&T. He
referred to AT&T, as the parent company of Bell Canada,
exercising some form of control over it. I am advised that
AT&T no longer owns any shares of Bell Canada, and has not
owned any since January 1975, when it divested itself of what
amounted to less than 2 per cent of the outstanding common
stock of the company. I further understand that AT&T bas no
control whatsoever over Bell Canada. It is therefore correct to
say that Bell Canada is a truly Canadian-owned company.
There is no doubt that my friend, Senator Grosart, has
raised some important issues in connection with this bill. He
will understand that I would not like to, and do not think'that
I should, deal in depth at this time with the important points
he bas raised. This will be done with the officials of the
company in committee. I think that is the time at which to get
satisfactory answers to the points raised by Senator Grosart.
However, I want to make it perfectly clear that it is not the
intention of Bell Canada, through this bill, to remove or to get
away from total scrutiny by Parliament.
I would like to give just one clear-cut example of the
situation in which Bell Canada is today, and I take as an
example Canadian Pacific, which may increase its number of
directors without reference to Parliament. Bell Canada had
one experience some years ago when, because of the large
number of shareholders-which I think is now about a quarter
of a million-it was decided, in order to give the shareholders
better representation at the directorship level, to increase the
number of directors. I do not want to criticize our parliamentary system, but it took nearly 18 months to get that simple
amendment to their charter through Parliament.
I think all of Senator Grosart's questions go to the root of
the bill we have before us tonight. If this bill receives second
reading, I intend to move that it be referred to an appropriate
committee where it will be possible, with the officers of the
company, to scrutinize the philosophy behind all these amend-

196

SENA TE DEBA TES

ments. I am sure the officers of the company will be in a
position to give satisfactory answers.
Senator Grosart: I have no doubt that the bill will be dealt
with exhaustively in committee, but as we are dealing with the
principle of the bill here may I ask its sponsor if I am correct
in assuming, if it becomes an act of Parliament, that it will not
be necessary in future for Bell Canada to come to Parliament,
as it has in this instance, for authority to increase its share
capital? Is that the purpose, or the principle, of the bill?
Senator Deschatelets: The principle of the bill is that Bell
Canada would like to be in the same position as most Canadian companies under the Canada Corporations Act with respect
to amending its charter. I think that is the philosophy of the
bill. Of course, as Senator Grosart knows, this has nothing to
do with the rate structure of the company. It will still have to
go to the CRTC with respect to that.
I hope my answer satisfies you, Senator Grosart.
*

(2030)

Senator Grosart: I should like to be a little more specific, if
I may. If we agree to second reading today, are we agreeing to
the principle that in future Bell Canada may further alter its
objects, its powers and its share capital without coming to
Parliament? I just ask that simple question.
Senator Deschatelets: Under the Canada Corporations Act
or other devices they will have to proceed through letters
patent, I understand, under the Department of Consumer and
Corporate Affairs. Of course, the whole purpose of this bill is
to permit a company of the size of Bell Canada to get more
flexibility in the future. I think this is the purpose of the bill.
Senator Grosart: It is a nice word for less control.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time, on division.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, as you know, in
the case of a private bill there has to be a delay of one week
before there can be further study in committee. I therefore
move that this bill be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications.
Senator Grosart: I should just like to ask the sponsor a
question in this respect. My understanding, when we discussed
the bill earlier, was that it was the intention to refer it to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. The sponsor has now moved that it be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications. Is there a reason for this apparent change?
Senator Deschatelets: I am glad Senator Grosart has raised
this question. In my earlier remarks on second reading I said
that by its nature we are here dealing with a financial bill.
There is no doubt about that. I therefore thought the committee to study this bill should be the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce. However, on going over

December 7, 1976

the rules I see that the appropriate committee for a bill having
to do with telecommunications is the Transport and Communications Committee. This is the reason why I changed my mind.
I am in the hands of the Senate, if honourable senators wish
the bill to be referred to another committee.
Senator Grosart: I imagine we are governed by our rules in
this respect. Our rules clearly state to which committee it
should go.
Senator McIlraith: Honourable senators, I do not think the
rule says that a bill dealing with corporate finance should go to
the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications. It says something quite different. In any event, the
Senate has the authority and the power to send a bill to any
committee it wishes.
I assume the rule the honourable senator is referring to is
rule 67, which deals with standing committees, and provides in
subsection (1)(i):
The Senate Committee on Transport and Communications, composed of twenty members, five of whom shall
constitute a quorum, to which shall be referred, if there is
a motion to that effect, bills, messages, petitions, inquiries, papers and other matters relating to transport and
communications generally, including:
(i) transport and communications by land, air, water,
and space, whether by radio, telephone, telegraph, wire,
cableNow, is this a bill that comes under that category, or is it
one that comes under the jurisdiction of the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce? That is really
the point at issue and, as I read the rules, it is a matter of
opinion as to which committee honourable senators wish to
refer it. It is true that it deals with transport and communications, but surely it is the corporate financial structure of the
company that is the important point in this bill.
Senator Choquette: I move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. I do not see any objection to that.
Senator Deschatelets: If there is a consensus, I could amend
my motion in that manner. Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Transport and Communications; you were right the first time.
Senator Argue: You were right the first time; the rules say
you were right.
Senator Walker: They do not at all and no one knows more
about it than my friend Senator Deschatelets. It is obviously a
financial and corporate matter, and the bill should be referred
to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce, as suggested by my friend.
Senator Deschatelets: I believe there is a consensus and I
would like to amend my motion and have this bill referred to
the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Argue: As chairman of the committee, I am grateful for the wonderful cooperation I have received from him
and for the work he bas done in this regard.
We were fortunate in that the members of the committee
were active members who loyally attended the meetings. On no
occasion was a quorum problem created. I am hopeful that as
the committee inquires into other questions in the future, its
members will retain the same kind of interest in them.
I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the committee's
indebtedness to a number of people who made outstanding
contributions resulting in this report. I refer to the clerk of the
committee, Mrs. A. Pritchard, who bas devoted herself fully to
the work of the committee and was most capable in all her
undertakings in connection with this inquiry. Our research
director was Mr. Albert Chambers, who brought a clear mind
to the committee's deliberations and was the initial draftsman
of many of the committee's reports. He did an outstanding job.
The committee was fortunate in having the services of Mr.
Len Christie of the Parliamentary Library staff. He has
worked diligently on the committee's reports over a number of
years and bas made an efficient and substantial contribution.
The committee is indebted also to Mr. Tom Curren of the
Parliamentary Library staff who in recent months made an
important contribution towards the preparation of the report.
I want now to refer to Mr. P. L. Appleton who did a good
deal of research in a relatively short time and whose assistance
leading to the publication of this report was most valuable.
We consider this to be a positive report, one that makes a
positive contribution to the solution of agricultural problems in
Kent County. Honourable senators have over the years taken
some pride in the kind of reports which have been produced
from standing Senate committees-and, I think, justifiably so.
The Agriculture Committee, in producing this report, feels
that it can continue to make further important contributions.
While this may not be precisely on the subject before us, I
should like to point out that the committee has decided to
inquire into beef stabilization and, in this respect, we are
receiving a great deal of cooperation from the industry and
various producer organizations. The committee made its decision some weeks ago, following which I had a lengthy conversation with the Minister of Agriculture, the Honourable
Eugene Whelan. I have received nothing but a positive
response from the minister both to the inquiry's being made
and the Senate's participation in it. Those of us who know the
minister well acknowledge that he has been highly critical of
the Senate over the years, and we are particularly pleased to
have received from him a positive response to the proposed
nquiry.
There have been many inquiries made into the beef industry.
A recent commission inquired into marketing and price
spreads in the beef industry, and a report was presented. Each
of the three commissioners involved embodied, as it were, his
or her own report in the overall report of that commission, and
the minister said that the value of the report was greatly
reduced because there was no consensus among the commis-

December 7, 1976

sioners. That inquiry into beef price spreads covered a period
of 14 months and cost the country $777,000.
I am one hundred per cent confident of two things: first,
that the Senate committee's inquiry will cost the country only
a small fraction of what that earlier inquiry cost; and, secondly, that we shall accomplish a great deal more. I am confident
of that.
The Senate Agriculture Committee is in a preferred position
when compared with other commissions of inquiry. Some
commissions have filed their reports, cashed their last cheques,
and have gone home, and, by and large, that has been the end
of their contact with the government and the powers that be.
That has not been entirely their fault. It is just the way it is.
The government has a report, and it has to decide how much
of that report should be acted upon.
In the weeks ahead we hope to follow up the committee's
report on Kent County. The committee has today decided,
with its research people and others, to make contact with the
federal department on the various recommendations made by
the committee, and to ascertain what their response is to those
recommendations. We believe that if we stay on top of this
report, as it is our duty to do, we shall be able to accomplish
something substantial with regard to Kent County.
Kent County has been a problem for many years. But, as
has been pointed out by Senator Michaud, and as is pointed
out in this report, there are dozens of Kent Counties across
Canada-rural areas suffering from depressed agricultural
conditions, abandoned farms, and so on. We are confident that
the type of action suggested in our report can be applied in
more places than just Kent County.
Kent County has its own particular problem. Over the years
there has been an abandonment of very large sections of the
county. As a matter of fact, it is stated that some 80 per cent
of the people who used to live in Kent County have now left.
There has also been an abandonment of large parts of the
agricultural industry. Even in the last 20 years there has been
a large reduction in the agricultural acreage in that county,
from 91,000 cultivated acres in 1951 to 33,000 cultivated acres
in 1971; a reduction from 62,000 acres of crops in 1951 to
18,000 acres of crops in 1971. But the report points out that
the climate of Kent County is such as to be favourable to a
healthy agricultural industry. There are between 110 and 130
frost-free growing days; the annual precipitation is some 17
inches, which is favourable. As to the soil classification, 30.5
per cent is class 3 soil and 31.4 per cent is class 4 soil-two
classes of soil with good agricultural potential. The best, of
course, is class 1, and the second best is class 2, but classes 3
and 4 are very acceptable agricultural soil, so the potential
production is there.
Why has agriculture fallen away in Kent County? Well,
many reasons were put forward. One particular reason forms a
thread which runs through the whole inquiry, and it is that the
people lost hope. They decided there was no future in agriculture, and when they lost hope they left the agricultural industry. There were no assured markets, there was an insufficient

December 7, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

number of assured markets, and without any assurance of
markets interest in agriculture was lost. There was very little
technical assistance available. There was not the type of
technical assistance represented by agricultural representatives
or agronomes available to pass on necessary information to the
farmers. They found it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the
capital required to improve their farming lot.
We went down to Kent County and talked to the people
there, and we found that they were indeed pessimistic. We
found they were disheartened. For example, and here I am
reading from the report, "there is a feeling in some places that
agriculture should be written off in our area and all production
moved to the areas with the so-called comparative advantage,"; "the lack of information and, especially, the lack of
courses in French. This is why there should be courses offered
to interested parties in schools, institutes and universities".
Senator Walker: What county are you talking about?
Senator Argue: Kent County.
Senator Walker: In Ontario?
Senator Argue: No, in New Brunswick.
Senator Walker: At any rate, it is not in Saskatchewan.
Senator Argue: It is pointed out that about 60 per cent of
the farmers in Kent County are French-speaking, and that the
only way to provide technical information to those people in an
understandable form is to do it in the French language. I
might say that we brought in an interim report which dealt
with this particular subject. Our committee was fortunate
enough in one session to have as witnesses representatives from
Laval University, Moncton University, the Agricultural College in Nova Scotia, and so on. We got these people together.
They discussed the common problem and it appeared necessary to do something outstanding to make agricultural training
in the French language available to high school students from
Kent County, New Brunswick. Because of this meeting,
because of our efforts and because of subsequent action by the
federal authorities, with cooperation all the way along the line,
it has been possible for 20 French-speaking students from New
Brunswick to enroll in Laval University's four-year degree
course in agriculture, and they will soon be graduating. It is
everyone's hope that they will be able to go back to New
Brunswick to provide agricultural services in the French language to those who require them.
I am especially proud, honourable senators, of our committee's accomplishing this particular thing, not only as a contribution to agriculture but as a contribution to Canada and to
national unity.
The whole market possibility has been surveyed. It would
appear that with the exception of potatoes, blueberries and
strawberries, New Brunswick is a deficit area with respect to
other agricultural products. It was pointed out that there is a
large market in the eastern counties of New Brunswick-Kent
County and the four counties surrounding it-there is a very
substantial market in New Brunswick, the Maritimes, the
Gaspé Peninsula and Quebec for the kind of vegetables, a wide

ranging variety of vegetables, that could be grown on suitable
soils located in an area with a suitable climate, namely, in
Kent County. And it was felt action should be taken to
encourage farmers to produce the kind of agricultural products
for which a market could be made available.
It was recommended, and it is recommended in the report,
that we should not try to utilize all the potential agricultural
acreage in Kent County, but that a reasonable objective would
be to endeavour to restore to agricultural production the
number of acres that were in agricultural production in 1951.
This would mean an increase in agricultural production in that
area for the future of some 44,000 acres-24,000 acres in feed
grain, 10,000 acres in hay, 4,000 acres or more in vegetables,
6,000 acres in fruits, and so on.
There are many, many statistics in the report, but the report
speaks for itself. It is well documented and it points out that
there has to be action taken to assure a market-that is, to get
land into production and to match it with a market. It is
pointed out that there are some disadvantages for agriculture
in that part of Canada. For example, agricultural machinery is
priced higher in New Brunswick than it is in central Canada.
Fertilizer costs are higher. It is also pointed out that land costs
are lower. The cost of obtaining land in the first place is lower,
and there are other costs that are lower. The prices that the
farmers receive for agricultural products are higher in that
part of Canada. I think the report is able to demonstrate that
given the possibility of a market-and the market exists; it is
just a question of who is going to produce for the market given
the possibility of a market, then agricultural production can be
forthcoming on an economic basis in that part of Canada.
The committee has made a very large number of recommendations, and they have made them after concluding that the
situation is such as to require some very forthright action. This
is pointed out on page 77 under the heading "Conclusions."
In general, it is quite obvious that government programs, both federal and provincial, aimed at the development of rural areas have seldom succeeded in Kent
County or elsewhere. The preceding critique of government programs identifies a number of common mistakes
embodied in many of these programs.
1) Paternalism overrides all else in agriculture and
rural development policy. There are federal-provincial
agreements, never federal-provincial-people agreements.
2) Many national policies when they are applied
nationally are not suited for regional economies such as
we have in Canada, and should be adapted to regional
needs.
3) Shortage of experienced and knowledgeable
implementation officers hinders the operations of most
programs.
4) The lack of incentives in programs for people to
help themselves is too often missing.
"I would say that more must be done between the
provinces and the federal government in simply sitting

SENATE DEBATES
down with people in Kent County, or anywhere else in the
Atlantic Provinces, in an attempt to reach a tripartite
agreement, not federal-provincial, but one which would
commit the local people also."
Then there is a substantial number of recommendations, and
they are far-reaching. I shall not endeavour to refer to all of
them, but I should like to refer to some of the
recommendations:
1. That the federal and provincial governments and the
people of Kent go on record committing themselves to a
conscientious long-term agricultural development effort in
Kent County.
2. The establishment of the Kent County Development
Association, organized and run by the people to speak on
behalf of the people and the governments recognize this
body as the main spokesman for the development in Kent
County and that the activity of all government staff in
Kent be in line with the development plan for the county
as outlined by this association.
3. The establishment of an inter-organizational federalprovincial-people committee to coordinate government
support for development programs as outlined by the Kent
County Development Association.
It was recommended that the Kent County Development
Association should enter into a long-term agreement with a
top agricultural production specialist and also with a top
agricultural marketing specialist. It was recommended that
demonstration farms be established in Kent County for hogs,
beef and vegetables, grain and forages through contractual
arrangements with local farmers and the continued support in
their operation by the Kent County Development Association
and the Department of Agriculture.
It was recommended that courses be offered at Laval University, Nova Scotia Agricultural College, Macdonald College
or Memramcook Institute for a series of short courses on
agricultural production and on farm management.
There are many recommendations that go on in great detail
as proposed by the committee. We feel that government
programs, including LIP, New Horizons grants, DREE grants,
and so on, should be tailor-made in their application to the
needs of Kent County, and this would mean programs which
have economic development in that area as a key feature.

December 7, 1976

We are asking that the New Brunswick Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development establish an agricultural
and food marketing group to help Kent County obtain
imrproved markets. We are asking for changes in the federal
crop insurance program.
I have outlined in a brief way, perhaps an inadequate way,
some of the recommendations contained in this report. We
recognize that the report by itself will accomplish nothing
unless the federal government and its departments, the provincial government of New Brunswick and its departments, the
local people concerned and their organizations, will take up
some of these recommendations and some of these ideas to see
if they can be put into operation.
Representatives of our committee, members of our committee, hope to return to New Brunswick early in the new year to
talk with the local people to see what they feel about the report
and what action they are taking with respect to the report. We
hope to make contacts with the Government of New Brunswick along the same lines, and, as I said earlier, we are
endeavouring to make contacts with the federal government in
the hope that these recommendations will be followed up.
Senator Michaud is not here tonight because he has been in
ill health. He has had an operation. The operation was fully
successful. He is on the road to complete and early recovery.
His doctor has advised him not to participate in the deliberations of the Senate until after the holiday season. I know that
as soon as he is able he will be back in this chamber and will
make a more comprehensive, a more learned contribution to
this subject than I am able to do. But I am pleased on behalf
of the committee to draw the attention of the Senate to this
report. I hope there will be further contributions in the Senate
on this subject, and I hope in the days that are ahead that we
may be able to report to the Senate further successes in the
recommendations that we have made.
Senator Robichaud: Honourable senators, on behalf of
Senator Michaud, I move the adjournment of the debate;
however, if certain circumstances occur through which Senator
Michaud is unable to speak at an early point in the debate, I
shall gladly do so myself.
On motion of Senator Robichaud for Senator Michaud,

general, but with special emphasis on the eastern region of this
country.
Transportation is the lifeline of most of our provinces, but
especially our island provinces, Prince Edward Island and
Newfoundland. The whole economy of Prince Edward Island
is based on their ability to export their goods to the rest of
Canada as well as to the foreign markets of the world. It is
also necessary for island provinces to be able to compete
without elaborate transportation costs so that they can trade in
the marketplaces of this country. It is for that reason that I
believe the time has come when the Government of Canada
will have to place more emphasis, and special emphasis, on the
needs of transportation in Canada, especially in Atlantic
Canada, and probably more particularly in Prince Edward
Island and Newfoundland.

SENATE DEBATES
government is not going to give one part of the country special
treatment because they have geographic handicaps.
I believe that special treatment is not necessary. Rather,
what is necessary for Prince Edward Island is its just rights
and dues, as agreed between the province and the Government
of Canada under its terms of union. The Minister of Transport
is quoted further as saying that he regards the distance from
Saskatchewan to Ottawa the same, in his view, as the Northumberland Strait crossing between Prince Edward Island and
New Brunswick. He stated further that he could not treat the
ferry run as an extension of the Trans-Canada Highway
because of the problem of who whould have jurisdiction over
it.
I can assure the Minister of Transport that the people of
Prince Edward Island would be pleased to give him jurisdiction over transportation across the Northumberland Strait
because, according to the British North America Act, it is the
responsibility of the Government of Canada and not the
province of Prince Edward Island to provide and guarantee
continous communication with the mainland.
Increased ferry rates and transportation costs severely hurt
the economy of Prince Edward Island in the summer of 1976.
The tourist industry, which was probably the second most
important industry in the province, was down 10 per cent
because of increased transportation costs. At the same time, I
have been told, the provincial parks in Nova Scotia had an
increased usage of 20 per cent. When we consider that people
are penalized some $50 for going to Prince Edward Island with
their trailers for a few days' holiday, honourable senators can
see why so many tourists stayed in Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, thus increasing the demand on the provincial parks
in those provinces.
The greatest percentage of tourists visiting Prince Edward
Island come from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Last
summer they were deterred from coming because of increased
ferry rates and transportation costs, so it is my contention that
the user-pay policy cannot and must not be allowed to be the
federal government's policy with regard to Prince Edward
Island, or, for that matter, Atlantic Canada.
It is for this reason that I believe the time has come when
the Senate must become actively involved in protecting regional rights in this country, and consequently this subject matter
should be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Transport and Communications.
I believe that the committee should look into transportation
as it affects Canadian unity, the Canadian economy, and
regional growth and development. It should make recommendations to the department for a more equitable transportation
system, which would allow the sale of Prince Edward Island
potatoes to western Canada, of western wheat to eastern
Canada, of British Columbia lumber to eastern Canada, as
well as Atlantic coast lobsters to British Columbia, at a fair
and equitable cost and a small mark-up in value. But I do not
believe that the cost of the CNR and CPR operations should
be charged to any one segment of the country or of the

economy but, rather, should be made available to all Canadians so that they can trade together and ship their goods from
one province to another without having heavy transportation
charges added to the cost of their goods.
I believe there is need for a study into the possibility of the
Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific making more
refrigerator cars available so that eastern potatoes and western
apples, and other agricultural products, can be shipped without
fear of damage. I understand that the refrigerator cars owned
by these railway companies are now in short supply. People in
the shipping business know that reefer cars are required when
there is a market for potatoes, not two weeks hence when the
market has been lost.

•

(1420)

I further believe that the Canadian National Railways is
abandoning many railway lines in Prince Edward Island. It
presently has an application before the Canadian Transport
Commission to abandon the Murray River-Murray Harbour
line. If it is allowed to do so, it will no doubt seek permission to
abandon other lines in Prince Edward Island, which is precisely what has happened in respect of passenger train service. I
believe that the overall CNR transportation policy should be
studied, especially as to rail abandonment.
In the local newspaper of October 30, 1976, the Minister of
Transport is reported as saying that new airline style interiors
will gradually be introduced into passenger train service,
beginning with the equipping of trains on the transcontinental
and Montreal-Quebec City routes. He further stated that the
new design will be found in trains which will be ordered early
next year for the Montreal-Quebec City route. Those trains
are expected to begin operating on the CP lines between
Montreal and Quebec City in 1980. That is a good thing. I
further believe that rail transportation generally should be
upgraded from coast to coast. We need an overall transportation policy so that the people of Canada will know what to
expect in the way of rail passenger service and rail freight
service, what anticipated rate increases can be expected, how
the economies of the various regions of Canada will be affected, how best such a policy can be made to tie the regions of
Canada together rather than separating them, and how best
federal dollars can be expended in subsidizing transportation
losses, whether by sea, air or land.
I believe that an internal study is necessary, and now seems
to be the time. I believe that we have the personnel and the
capability in the Senate to carry out such a study and to make
strong recommendations to the Department of Transport on a
future transportation policy for Canada.
While I have mentioned a few of the weaknesses in the
transportation policy of this country, I should not like to leave
the impression that it is all bad. The Prince Edward Islandmainland ferry service received subsidies in 1975 in excess of
$16 million. When you consider that we are complaining about
a 100 per cent increase in cost, you can well imagine the cost
of using those ferries were the Minister of Transport to put
them on a user-pay basis.

Some ferry services in Atlantic Canada received even greater subsidies than that received by the Prince Edward Islandmainland ferry service. The Nova Scotia to Newfoundland
ferry service, for example, received $59.6 million by way of
federal aid in 1975; the Digby to Saint John ferry service
received $880,000 from the federal government in 1975; the
Yarmouth to Bar Harbour ferry service received $1.5 million;
and the Newfoundland coastal service received $22 million.
In addition to ferry service subsidies, the Atlantic region
received $16.1 million in 1975 under the Maritime Freight
Rates Act, and an additional $21 million was made available
in Atlantic region freight assistance. Air rates in Atlantic
Canada were subsidized in 1975 by $1.7 million.
The federal Department of Transport subsidizes transportation in one way or another in Atlantic Canada by $100 million
a year, for which we are certainly appreciative. However,
should the Government of Canada ever decide to put transportation on a user-pay basis, it would be the ruination of Atlantic
Canada. In that eventuality, we would have to look to European and American markets for trade purposes as transportation costs to markets within Canada would be astronomical.
Honourable senators, I should like the Standing Senate
Committee on Transport and Communications to be authorized to investigate transportation in Canada, to look into the
specific needs of specific regions of this country and bring back
a report containing recommendations it feels can be put into
effect so that the large sums of federal subsidies being paid out
by the Government of Canada can be put to better use; so that
transportation services can be upgraded; so that the Government of Canada will realize the folly of the user-pay policy
and, as a result, bring forth new direction and new policies for
transportation in Canada, whether it be along the coast of

First, does this indicate an on-and-off approach to this important problem of patriation-if that is the correct word-of the

problem of patriating the Constitution than was indicated in
some earlier official statements? Third, in view of the difference between the statement he made and the statement made
by the Prime Minister, again on the same date, the Prime

"at least some of the provinces," whereas in his statement the

and complex question. The reply I gave the other day was
based on the best information available to me at the time. I
think it would be wise for me to take this question as notice,
and I shall endeavour to make a full statement to the Senate
next week. It is an important question and I do not want to
offer anything less than the full reply it deserves.

HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO STUDY CAUSES OF
PERSONALITY DISORDERS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOURDEBATE ADJOURNED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator McGrand, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Norrie:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report

December 9, 1976

upon such experiences in prenatal life and early childhood
as may cause personality disorders or criminal behaviour
in later life and to consider and recommend such remedial
and preventative measures relating thereto as may be
reasonably expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of crime and violence in society;
That the committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical and clerical personnel as may
be required for the purpose of the inquiry; and
That the committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate.-(Honourable Senator Petten).
Senator Petten: Honourable senators, I defer to the Honourable Senator Norrie.
Hon. Margaret Norrie: Honourable senators, it is an honour
to be named the seconder of this motion, to which I give my
full support.
If honourable senators wish to refresh their memories of the
work the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science pursued during the months of April to June, 1976, on
the feasibility of such a study, I would recommend that they
re-read Senator McGrand's account of the witnesses and of
the letters he has received from far and near, for which
reference could be made to the Debates of the Senate of
December 2, 1976.
Along with other doctors, the Chief of Forensic Services,
Carke Institute of Psychiatry, Dr. C.K. McKnight, was most
positive and urgent in his remarks. In his opinion there are
many reasons why this study should be undertaken.
Although it would be hard to document all the reasons
for this study, there is a real sense of urgency that we
must do something concrete about these problems before
it is too late. Time is running out on us.
Learning disabilities usually show up forcefully in the child
and to the parents and teachers when the child starts school,
but those same disabilities were there during pre-school age
also.
Judge Holte, Superior Court judge in the State of Washington, recently spoke at a conference on "Youth in Trouble,"
sponsored by the British Columbia and Vancouver Association
of Canadian Learning Disabilities (ACLD). Prior to becoming
a judge, a little before 1971, he was a partner in a law firm.
One of his partners was a Mr. Paul Williams, who had several
children suffering from learning disabilities. While Judge
Holte was serving as a juvenile court judge, Mr. Williams
approached him concerning a possible connection, if any,
between learning disabilities and juvenile delinquency. The
judge had never heard of such a thing, but he agreed to make
inquiries to see if there might be any such connection. He
made a couple of superficial inquiries, but he was so abysmally
ignorant on the subject that he did not really know what he
was looking for. In February 1971, Mr. Williams informed
him that he was to be a luncheon speaker on March 27, 1971.
This luncheon was part of a symposium sponsored by The
Orton Society Incorporated, dealing with the subject, "Saving
Teenagers with Learning Disabilities." About March 1, the

December 9, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

138,000 illiterate people in Nova Scotia. I immediately telephoned the principal of the Nova Scotia Teachers' College for
his views on the matter and he seemed to think that it was a
rash statement. He said he would follow it up, but as yet I
have received no further details.
It any event, they were difficult to work with and everyone
felt sorry for them. Their parents and the school system had all
but given up. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to rehabilitate someone who can neither read nor write. In addition, they
appear to hate everyone and everything. It is the general
feeling among probation officers and social caseworkers, however, that they hate themselves most of all. It is extremely
discouraging to be branded a failure in the first or second
grade, and to carry that stigma through the sixth grade and
into junior high school.
Perhaps I should not be speaking at such length about young
people with learning disabilities. The point is that these same
learning disabilities were present when they were infants and
we, as adults, were not able to detect them, and as concerned
adults we must find a way to detect such impediments and
correct them before these young children become juvenile
delinquents.
If I may, I should like to give you one teenager's definition
of a learning disability, which is: Having a learning disability
is like climbing a mountain on your hands and knees while
everyone else has a ticket for the ski lift.
Another area of concern is that of daycare centres in
Canada. It is evident that daycare is available only to the very
poor, through the Canada Assistance Plan, or to the rich. We
have to ensure that the available facilities are adequate and
within everyone's reach. According to figures from the Daycare Child Development Council of America, as of September
1965, 38,000 children in the United States under the age of
five were left without adult care during working hours. Let us
hope and pray that in the intervening years that situation bas
improved. But who knows?
The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labour, in
1971, calculated that there were 17,400 children of working
mothers-children under 14 years of age-enrolled in daycare
centres. This represented only 11¼ per cent of the 1,380,000
such children. According to the 1973 figures of the Department of Health and Welfare, there were full-time daycare
facilities available in Canada for 26,811 children. However,
because of the increased number of women in the labour force,
that still only represents 13¾ per cent of children under the age
of 14 years with working mothers. While 7 per cent of children
in the three-to five-year age bracket of working mothers are
enrolled in licensed daycare facilities, less than 2 per cent of
children under three years of age are enrolled.
Honourable senators, there are other factors in addition to
learning disabilities which could lead to juvenile delinquency
and a life of crime if not detected early, such as mental cruelty
to children, battered children, malnutrition-both prenatal

the effect that there are some hood years.
Halifax newspaper recently to

judge started doing some research because he knew he would
be speaking to a group of professionals. When he saw the
names of the other speakers he knew he was out of his class.
As he researched his subject he became startled and concerned
about two things. First, there seemed to be a dearth of
material relating to any connection between learning disabilities and juvenile delinquency. He found only two articles in
this area. Secondly, he was appalled at his total lack of
knowledge on a subject which should be lifted up as crucial in
all areas concerned with juvenile problems and rehabilitation.
For the better part of a year he had worked with juveniles,
attending conferences, visiting institutions and talking to state
county and private professionals in the field. He had two
meetings with representatives of the 18 law enforcement agencies in his county. He talked to over 100 school administrators
and counsellors from that county. He spoke at and served on
panels for regional and state meetings of PTA. In all of this he
did not hear a single word about, nor was any concern
expressed for, learning disabilities. Educators, medical people,
and people in the behavioural sciences have all been aware of
learning disabilities for many years. Yet there appeared to be
little if any awareness of a connection between learning
disabilities and juvenile anti-social conduct.
As he thought back over the 700 or more cases he had heard
in the 10-month period while serving as a juvenile court judge,
he had a gut reaction that made him almost physically ill. He
could not remember them by name, but about 80 per cent of
the boys and half that percentage of the girls were experiencing difficulties in school. There is such an obvious pattern once
one is alerted and bas some idea what to look for that he could
not understand why people who had worked for years with
disturbed youngsters had not tried to do something about it.
Later he discovered some dedicated persons who had made
some progress in this area, but they are pitifully inadequate.
For some reason the schools seem anxious to get rid of the
disrupters, and the implication is there-and sometimes the
flat statement is made-that the juveniles are too dumb, too
stupid and too lazy to learn.
As he investigated and read the material available he noted
with growing concern how people with learning disabilities
transposed words and spelled phonetically. Some of the correspondence which had been intercepted when mailed from
detention centres flashed in his mind; "god" for "dog" and
"tac" for "cat" were a couple of samples. Fifteen- and 16-year
olds were spelling like second and third graders. Some of the
comments by probation officers and social case workers were
recalled: "This kid is plenty smart, but no one can motivate
him." Or "He seems intelligent enough, but he writes like a
third grader instead of a ninth grader."
No one seemed to know exactly why they had these 12- and
16-year old illiterates who had completed anywhere from six to
10 grades of school. Everyone felt sorry for them, but they
were very difficult to work with.

SENATE DEBATES
I should like to quote from the remarks of Dr. E. T. Barker,
who appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science on June 17, 1976, as follows:
I cannot help but be very greatly impressed by the
incisiveness and breadth of knowledge reflected in the
discussions of you and your committee members on this
matter. Perhaps I have become too used to more fuzzyminded psychiatric discussions! What comes through
from the proceedings, in addition, is the great tenacity
with which Senator McGrand has pursued this most
important matter. In my experience, such singleness of
purpose is both rare and admirable ... it is only through
more extensive knowledge regarding causal factors occurring very early in a child's life (pregnancy, birth, the first
two or three years) that preventive programs can be
developed. As has been known for many years now, it is in
these early years that "the die is cast" or "the concrete
hardens".
He went on to say:
Why should a Senate committee inquire into and report
factors occurring early in a child's life which may later
lead to disturbed or violent behaviour?
Because it is of such vital importance? Yes.
For many years, our government has been deeply concerned
about the rise in the crime rate in respect of both petty and
major incidents. Every avenue has been researched and
explored for possible causes of crime except in the disturbed
pre-school child and pre-natal baby, where the disturbance or
damage is due to malnutrition, injury or drugs. Senator
McGrand has received pointed and shocking statements from
many professional people which lead us to believe we should
carry this study further.
Dr. Barker feels that the Senate is a perfect arena for
receiving proof, often private and shocking, from fearful, timid
people. He says this:
A child can't run away. It can't fight back. It is totally
dependent on its parents. It can't hire a lawyer. Children
are accepted by society as their parents' chattels. You can
kick a kid in the head if you want to, or you can screw his
mind in other ways.
Physical abuse, the battered baby is only the tip of the
iceberg. For every kid who has had his head kicked in
there are thousands who have had their minds damaged
who are rendered less effective as adult human beings.
Dr. Laing said:
From the moment of birth, when the stone-age baby
confronts the twentieth century mother, the baby is subjected to forces of outrageous violence, called love, as the
mother and father have been and their parents and their
parents before them. These forces are concerned mainly
with destroying most of its potentialities.
And I would like to add that I was shocked, indeed, to sec
that there are exactly 54 pages of liquor advertisements in the
December issue of Maclean's magazine, 29 of which are

December 9, 1976

full-page colour advertisements, and 25 are part-page. To me,
that is not helping the children any.
Dr. Barker continued posing questions, ail of which he
answered in the affirmative:
Because the Senate can select a small group of competent, concerned lay people to maturely review from a
common-sense point of view the findings of highly specialized professionals from a wide range of disciplines? Yes.
I point out that the Senate is able to ask any lay person to
appear as a witness. Committee meetings can be held in
camera, and if the information these lay people give is private
they can feel quite confident it will remain private.
Because the stature of the Senate of Canada will be a
powerful force to evoke from the best minds in each
discipline an up-to-date summary of the known data in
that field? Yes.
Because the Senate committee already has the
resources (the Queen's Printer) to publish its proceedings
as a matter of course? Yes.
That is a matter of great consideration.
a

(1440)

Because the Senate is perhaps the only institution in
Canada secure enough to call before it witnesses who may
present evidence which we as a society are very reluctant
to hear? Yes.
I would like to conclude by repeating what Father Flanagan,
founder of the famous school for homeless boys in Omaha,
Nebraska, once said:
I can still say that I have never known a really bad boy;
only bad parents, bad environments, and bad examples. It
is wrong to call it juvenile delinquency. Why not call it
what it really is-delinquency of a callous and indifferent
society?
This is our opening, honourable senators, to help society. Do
not allow it to be denied us.
Senator Rowe: I wonder if I may ask Senator Norrie a
question? I understood her to say that in Nova Scotia it is
estimated that there are over 100,000 illiterates. I wonder if
that is an adult illiterate population.
Incidentally, I do not believe the figure, because it would
represent more than 10 per cent of the population. That strikes
me as being extremely high for a province which has had such
a tradition of education of the ordinary people. I cannot
understand that. Perhaps Senator Macdonald, or Senator
Carter, who was previously a professional in the field of adult
education, would know the answer.
Can Senator Norrie tell us if that figure includes children in
the schools who are supposed to be illiterate-that is, the
disabled children or those with learning disabilities-or is it
the number of adult illiterates in the province of Nova Scotia?
Senator Norrie: That is a good question, and the answer was
not stated in the newspaper. I called the principal of the
normal college and asked him if he knew anything about this.
He said it was an appalling figure, and he felt that the person

SENATE DEBATES

December 9, 1976

making these statements was very rash in what she had said.
He said he would look into it and let me know. That was about
one week ago. Therefore, I shall report further if I receive
additional information. I do not know if it represents adults or
children, or both.
On motion of Senator Macdonald, for Senator Asselin,
debate adjourned.

The Senate proceeded to consideration of the reports of the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance with respect
to the supplementary estimates (B) and (C) laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1977.
Senator Everett: Honourable senators, you have before you

Senator Everett: With leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1) (f), I move adoption now.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Sone Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Adopted. Senator Everett, do you
wish to speak?
Senator Everett: In light of the fact that the report has now
been adopted, if that is the intention of the house, I do not
think I need to be heard.
Senator Grosart: It has not been adopted; there is a motion
to adopt. Explain.
Senator Haig: Explain.
Senator Everett: It is very difficult to explain a motion that
has already been adopted.
Senator Grosart: It has not been adopted.
Senator Everett: The house in its wisdom has adopted the
report. Why should I explain what it has done?
Senator Grosart: On what is perhaps a point of order, I am
quite sure that the motion was really for the adoption of the
report, and we expected that the mover of the motion would
speak to it. It was an opinion, I believe, that it was adopted.
We were waiting.
Senator Everett: 1, of course, would wish to appeal to Her
Honour the Speaker. I am getting older and my hearing is not
as good as it used to be, but I distinctly heard the word
"adopted", and at that stage all concern for supplementary
estimates (B) and (C) ended for me and passed over to
Senator Langlois, who is waiting now for the appropriation bill
and to explain the whole business all over again.

I believe the report was adopted, honourable senators, and it
is done.
Senator Grosart: I do not intend to argue the point, because
very often these things go very quickly. However, there was a
motion by Senator Everett for the adoption of the report. It
was an opinion that it had been adopted.
Apart from that, it does not matter, but I would suggest that
it is important that we have an explanation from the chairman
of that committee with respect to this report. We have raised
this question here many times previously, and it is important
that the Senate be informed as to the decision of this committee on its review of these estimates.
In this case we have both supplementary estimates (B) and
supplementary estimates (C) before us. We have complained
that insufficient time and explanation is given to the Senate as
a whole before we consider the appropriation bills. Our understanding now is that the appropriation bills will come before us
very shortly-perhaps on Monday night.
Senator Langlois: On Monday night.
Senator Grosart: It is certainly my intention at this time to
expedite that procedure. I suggest, therefore, that it would be
in the interests of the Senate and useful to have this explanation on the record, particularly as today is Thursday, so that
honourable senators may at least look at it over the weekend
and ascertain why the committee has made the report it has.
No one is better equipped to do that than the distinguished
chairman of that committee.
I suggest, therefore, whatever our impasse may be on the
rules, that with leave the Senate we now hear Senator Everett.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Leave is granted.
Senator Everett: In those circumstances, I can do little else.
Honourable senators, you have before you the report of the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance on supplementary estimates (B) and supplementary estimates (C) for
the year ending March 31, 1977. There were some interesting
facts adduced in the evidence that the committee heard. First
of all, for the first time the supplementary estimates contain
an "Explanation of Requirement" which has been added to
each vote. For some time the committee has been calling for
this and, of course, we are delighted that the Treasury Board
has found it possible to give this explanation of each of the
items to be voted.
Supplementary estimates (B) will add $594 million to the
main estimates, and supplementary estimates (C) will add
some $150 million. During recent years the committee has
been concerned about the growth in the size of the supplementary estimates in relation to the increase in the main estimates,
and we are pleased to see that the Treasury Board has made a
conscious effort to hold the amount of the supplementary
estimates to some line. You will find on page 2 of the report a
table which indicates the increase in supplementary estimates

SENATE DEBATES
in relation to that in the main estimates, and I shall just read
the figures.
In 1974 the supplementary estimates amounted to $2.125
billion; in 1975, to $4.936 billion; in 1976, to $2.672 billion;
and this year, supplementary estimates (A), (B) and (C)
amount to $749 million. Probably still to come are supplementary estimates (D). It is hoped, however, with some reasonable
certainty, that they will not raise the total to anything like the
magnitude of previous years.

e

(1450)

Supplementary estimates (B) break down into different
categories. The statutory programs add $197 million, and the
remaining $397 million comprise items which are being voted
and cover programs which were not previously listed in the
main estimates. These include four major expenditures-the
1976-77 Local Initiative Program funds, contributions under
the housing programs announced in December 1975, the swine
flu immunization program, and the settlement of Indian land
claims under the James Bay agreement.
The remaining items are voted, but they are essentially
non-discretionary items, being for activities that arise from the
determination of an increase in programs by formula. These
include payments to the provinces towards language education,
increased educational and social assistance under Indian and
Eskimo affairs programs, special payments to Alberta under
the 1974 agreement on the maintenance of domestic oil prices,
and increased manpower training allowances.
We have been told by the President of the Treasury Board
and this, of course, is an announced policy-that it is the
deliberate goal of this government to hold the percentage
increase in federal government expenditures to the percentage
increase in the nominal gross national product. This, again, is
something that over many years the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance has been trying to establish as a rule
for government to follow in the control of its expenditures. In
the present year the increase will be held to 14 per cent, which
is in relation to the nominal growth of the gross national
product, and we were told by the President of the Treasury
Board and the Minister of Finance that next year the increase
in these expenditures will be held to some 1I per cent. Again,
that is the projected nominal growth in the gross national
product.
One of the features that concerned the committee was that
some of this reduction in expenditures-and honourable senators may recall that I mentioned this in previous reports-has
been achieved by simply delaying expenditures that will be
made at a later date. Clearly, if there are restraints on
expenditures, then delaying programs does nothing more than
cause a bulge in expenditures when those restraints come off.
We have been assured by the President of the Treasury Board
that the restraint program is a continuing objective of government, and that, indeed, as a continuing policy, expenditures
will be held within the nominal growth of the gross national
product. If this is true, then it means that the delays will not
have the effect I just mentioned.

December 9, 1976

In addition to that financial restraint, the government has
been restraining growth in the size of the public service. This
year it has restricted that growth to less than 1/2 per cent, and
next year its target is less than 1 per cent. This is a considerable reduction as compared to the kind of growth we have
experienced in the past two years and, of course, is welcomed
by the committee and by others as the sort of policy that this
government ought to be undertaking.
One of the areas that tended to worry us is the rather
phenomenal increase in the amounts being provided for professional and special services. When we made inquiries about that
we were told that the major part of those items includes the
cost of occupational training-which, as honourable senators
will know from our examination of Canada Manpower, aggregated somewhere in excess of $400 million last year-educational cost in Indian affairs and northern development, and the
use of commercial computer services. So the bulk of this
increase in expenditure on professional and special services is
really not in the sort of areas that we think of as coming under
the heading of professional and special services.
As a result, in the main estimates for this coming year, the
government will be providing a table which will show a
breakdown of these professional and special services into their
different categories. Through that table we will be able to sec
how much money is being put into true consulting services,
and how much is being used to supplement the size of the
public service through consulting agreements, and which, if
defined properly, should be regarded as offsetting the reduction in the growth of the public service to less than 12 per cent
this year and less than 1 per cent next year. This, therefore, is
something that the committee will be looking at very carefully
during this coming year, and we will report further on how
successful the government has been in controlling those kinds
of services.
Supplementary estimates (C) relate solely to the provision
of money to create jobs in areas of high unemployment
through the use of federal labour-intensive projects. One hundred million dollars is being provided for a supplement to the
Local Initiatives Programs, and $50 million is being given to
the Treasury Board to hire workers directly through government department activities. The President of the Treasury
Board mentioned certain criteria that would be used to control
these kinds of expenditures, and they were satisfactory to the
committee.
Most importantly, however, in this area of job creation, the
committee was concerned about the fact that these projects
must come to an end when they are no longer needed. This
year we will spend $200 million in job creation projects in
Canada. I doubt if very many people would argue that this
should not be done, but what is important, and what we
warned the Treasury Board about, is that the expenditure of
this money should come to an end when the need comes to an
end. They should take great care not to spend money on
projects that by themselves will create an on-going financial
need, or that will be a burden to either the federal government
or the provincial and municipal governments. If you look at

December 9, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

some of the LIP grants in the past you will see that this has
been one of the very real problems in the field of Local
Initiatives Programs, and the committee will be very concerned in the future to ensure that where job creation programs are mounted, they are mounted in such a way that they
do the job they were meant to do, and that they do not create a
whole new flock of expenditure requirements and commitments that have to be met by later appropriations.

Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I feel sure that you
might now be inclined to agree with me that it is important to
have this kind of explanation from the chairman of the committee. He bas gone considerably beyond the formal words of
the written report and, in my view, bas made an important
contribution to the understanding of the Senate of the kind of
work that is going on in this committee under his
chairmanship.
I know that Senator Everett has another appointment, and I
would say to him that he will not offend me in any way if he
finds it necessary to leave before hearing the compliment I
should like to make to him.
Senator Everett: After what Senator Grosart has just said
about me, I just could not leave, no matter how important the
other appointment is.
Senator Grosart: I was about to say that, in my view,
Senator Everett has been extremely modest about the accomplishments, under his chairmanship, of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance. He mentioned the very
important change that has just been made in the presentation
of the estimates. It applies for the first time to supplementary
estimates (B), which are before us. I refer, of course, to the
"Explanation of Requirements," which is now a heading in the
estimates.
As he said, our witnesses, including the President of the
Treasury Board and Mr. MacDonald, Deputy Secretary, Program Branch, paid the Senate the compliment of saying that
this important innovation was the result of the work of the
Senate committee.
Perhaps this is an occasion when I might recall that this is
not the first major change that bas been made in the presentation of the estimates over the past few years which bas been
attributed by the Treasury Board to the work of the Senate
committee. The first was the examination of the $1 items. The
Commons now requires this. For a long time they did not. We
asked for it, and I would say the Treasury Board was anxious
to provide this information, which they have done.
The matter referred to by Senator Everett, namely, the
public announcement by the present minister and the former
minister, Mr. Chrétien, that it is now definitely government
policy to constrain the increase in government public spending
to the increase in the GNP (both on nominal values) was again
a recommendation of this committee over the years. It is an

achievement of this committee that the government has given
this undertaking.
There are other similar achievements of the committee. I
shall not go into them all. Senator Everett referred to the
question of items dealing with professional and special services. When we looked over the estimates, we found that
supplementary estimates (B) alone had a total of $35 million
of these items. It naturally occurred to us to ask whether this
was just a way of saying, "Instead of hiring extra manpower
on the government payroll, we will hire consultants, and they
will not show on the payroll."
The minister and the deputy minister made it quite clear
that that is not the case. They have now undertaken-again at
the request of the committee-to break this down. So this will
not be one of the kinds of items that are often used, in my
opinion, as generic titles to hide rather than disclose
information.
It is also interesting to note that in the evidence we heard
the comment was made that Treasury Board had, some years
ago, persuaded the Public Accounts Committee in the other
place to agree to a major decrease in the number of votes. The
opinion was expressed in our committee that this was a
retrograde step. In other words, we said that the more votes
there are, the more disclosure there is. We had evidence that
today we have about the same number of votes in the estimates
as we had at that time-again an improvement for which the
Senate committee under Senator Everett is entitled to take
some small credit.
Another matter arose which, in my opinion, is of some
interest. It applies to supplementary estimates (C), and is an
estimate to provide for the special job creation program. As
Senator Everett has said, we would all agree with that in
principle. The question then arose as to whether this was really
absolutely new spending. We discussed the matter and
received some excellent response from the Treasury Board. It
was stated that perhaps the government should start to look at
the offsets in revenue in some of these expenditures. In this
particular case, obviously, if 100,000 new jobs were created,
there would automatically be an increase in revenue-a saving
of unemployment insurance, and also an increase in taxable
incomes.
I gained the impression from the minister that this was not
exactly a new thought on his part. He said it had been a
component of some decisions which had been made on some
particular programs. I considered it, however, to be a new
thought that might be applied over the whole range of the
estimates. Far be it for me to say anything that might be in the
interests of explaining government expenditures, but nevertheless, if we are going to be fair, it seems that this is an offsetting
item that might well be included in the presentation of the
estimates in the future.
In other words, the government is asking to spend money,
and it would be in its own interests, and in the interests of the

SENATE DEBATES
public, to suggest offsets which might reduce the actual total
of the demand in the long run on the consolidated revenue
fund of any such programs.
Senator Everett mentioned the restraints that were reported
to us on the proliferation of hiring in the public service. It was,
in my view, a matter of some assurance at least to the
members of the committee that a target of one per cent was set
for next year.
At another meeting of the committee we were given evidence that a one per cent increase in the public service, apart
from all the other expenses involved, would require an additional 225,000 square feet of space. The deputy secretary, in
that particular case, suggested that the additional space
required per new federal government employee is somewhere
between 100 and 150 square feet, which indicates that when
we are considering this problem of the proliferation of manhour requirements in the public service, it is not just the
salaries that are involved. I do not know what the total figure
might be. In business we normally say that it costs about
double; that to find the cost of a new employee one doubles his
salary to get a fair indication of what he will cost. We are
beginning to receive some evidence that that situation is being
appreciated in the public service, and that some work is being
done to bring it home to governments who have to make these
decisions that there are costs beyond the salaries or other
remuneration.
In dealing with this matter now, I hope the Leader of the
Government, and the deputy leader, will recognize that there
are times when I can be cooperative. I am speaking at this
time so that they will be able to get their appropriation bills
through to meet their time schedule.
* (1510)

Senator Deschatelets: Would Senator Everett permit a
question? My question has to do with supplementary estimates
(C). He has reported that the committee examined the President of the Treasury Board and the Deputy Secretary of the
Program Branch with respect to the justification of the jobcreation incentive program, and said that the committee was
also interested in determining when that program would endin other words, when it would no longer be justified because
unemployment would have decreased.
My question really is this: When the committee examines
the justification of such a program, do its terms of reference
give it a mandate to go as far as examining the actual causes
of unemployment? Can the committee look into the whole
unemployment situation?
Senator Everett: I am happy to answer your question,
senator. What you are asking is whether we can examine the
economic reasons behind the program. Our mandate is specifically directed to that kind of examination, and, indeed, the
committee did make such a definitive examination and issued
a report, Growth, Employment and Price Stability, on the
subject of the Canadian economy-the very subject you are
talking about. Moreover, that examination did include a discourse on job creation programs.
I will read to you the powers of the committee:
The Senate Committee on National Finance ... to which
shall be referred ...

bills, messages, petitions, inquiries,

December 9, 1976

papers and other matters relating to federal estimates
generally, including:
(i) national accounts and the report of the Auditor
General;
(ii) government finance.

I and others before me, including the Honourable Senator
Leonard, who was a distinguished chairman of this committee
for many years, have interpreted that to mean the broadest
mandate to look at the operation of the Canadian economy.
Indeed, as I say, we have done that in the past, and we will
continue to take a keen interest in the operation of the
Canadian economy. It is our intention in this session, when we
finish our hearings on the Department of Public Works and
before we issue the report that will emanate from those
hearings, to have nine hearings into the state of the Canadian
economy, which will include evidence from senior people in
government, people in the academic world and people in the
world of business and labour.
Senator Deschatelets: When you have finished your examination of the Department of Public Works and are looking into
this situation, I hope you will attach some importance to the
testimony of Mr. Scrivener, which he gave before the Standing
Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, dealing with CanadaUnited States relations. His testimony had to do precisely with
the fact that Canadian producers just cannot compete with
producers in the United States, the wealthiest country in the
world, and that this is now perhaps the first cause of our
unemployment problem. There are at present about 1,000
items in respect of which Canadian producers cannot compete
with American mills or American manufacturers. He suggests
the situation is so serious today that it is possible, in respect of
a great number of items produced in the United States, to
import them, pay the transportation costs and the duty, and
still put them on the market at a price lower than the price of
similar items produced in this country.
I am sure that is one aspect which your committee will
examine when it tackles this problem.
Senator Everett: I thank the honourable senator for his
worthwhile suggestion. I have not read Mr. Scrivener's evidence before the Foreign Affairs Committee but I am aware of
his deep concern about the state of the Canadian economy. I
am sometimes inclined, however, to wonder whether he has not
talked himself into his own special area of doom and gloom,
although I do think the issues he raises are worth examining. I
might just say that the recent drop in the exchange rate of the
Canadian dollar has donc a great deal to change the kind of
equation Mr. Scrivener is talking about.
However, while I feel Mr. Scrivener has much to contribute
and that we do have to be concerned about our costs in
Canada, nevertheless, I have the distinct feeling that his
reasoning on this matter is not totally balanced and that he is
looking at one side of the equation and one side alone; he is not
looking at the offsetting aspects. I will certainly read his
testimony. I know of his concern, and it is a concern which all
Canadians should have-that their economy be competitive.
Motions agreed to and reports adopted.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, December 13, at 8
p.m.

take ail funds out of the plan or to purchase a life annuity
from an insurance company.
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
Your Committee welcomes the proposed amendments to the
Act (Clauses 1, 5 and 56 (4)) to increase the maximum
amounts deductible for contributions to deferred compensation
plans. The proposed maximum for 1976 and subsequent years
is as follows:
Maximum

Proposed

available
Employee's contribution to
registered pension plan

$2,500

$3,500

Employee's combined
contribution to registered

contribution to registered

$4,000

$5,500

The first alternative will subject taxpayers to immediate tax
on the proceeds received. By purchasing an annuity, a taxpayer may defer tbe payment of tax and, in ail probability, pay
tax at a lower marginal rate. By doing so, bowever, be loses
control over the assets wbicb accumulated in bis plan. Annuitics issued by insurance companies may provide a lower rate of
return than migbt be available otberwise, together with eventuaI loss of capital.
Wbile tbe Committee recognizes the problems caused by
this inflexibility, it is also aware of the advantages.
Provisions dealing witb RRSP's were introduced to provide
relief for self-employed individuals or individuals witb an
inadequate pension plan. It was intended tbat the rules for
RRSP's would be comparable to those establisbed for pension
plans and since memrbers of registered pension plans were only
entitled to receive annuities for life, witb certain limîted
exceptions, it was provided that the proceeds of RRSP's would
have to be used to purchase life annuities. Their purpose is
neither to create an estate nor to be a general savings plan.
The RRSP is intended to belp taxpayers save in order to
provide retirement income. An annuity bas been perceived as
being the best metbod available of providing a person witb a
safe and steady source of income until deatb.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
It has been said that life insurance companies are making
high profits with respect to RRSP annuities. Your Committee
recognizes however that the life insurance business is a highly
competitive one and is aware of the Superintendent of Insurance's opinion that holders of RRSP's were receiving reasonable treatment when converting to life annuities.
The Minister of Finance is undertaking further study of the
inflexibility that appears at maturity of a plan. An investigation will be made to determine whether the inflexible provisions should be changed in the interests of the taxpayer. Your
Committee encourages such study. In any event, some of the
administrative exceptions available to annuitants of registered
pension plans should be made available to the beneficiaries of
RRSP's. For example, an exception is availabie to members of
pension plans if they can establish by statement from a
qualified medical practitioner that they have only a short life
expectancy. Their annuity payments would be adjusted
according to their shorter life expectancy.

CHILD CARE EXPENSE DEDUCTION
The Act presently allows certain taxpayers to deduct
amounts paid for child care services including baby-sitting
services, day nursing services or lodging at a boarding school
or camp. Your Committee concurs with the proposai (Clause
21) to double the deductions now available in respect of such
expenses. The maximum deduction now allowed is $15 per
week per child to a yearly maximum of $500 and a total
annual maximum of $2,000 per family. These limits will be
raised to a maximum of $30 per week per child, a maximum of
$1,000 per year per child and a maximum annual limit of
$4,000 per family.

December 9, 1976
December 9. 1976

(6) charities not meeting the requirements of the Act
will be subject to revocation and tax on the fair market
value of their net assets less those assets distributed within
one year of revocation to other charities. Any recipient of
net assets of a revoked charity other than another charity
will be jointly and severally liable for the same tax up to
the amount received.
Private foundations will have to distribute the greater of
90% of the income from certain assets, such as investments in
private companies, or 5% of the fair market value of such
assets at the end of the preceding year. If insufficient income is
realized from such investments, capital will have to be disbursed. Your Committee is concerned that the distribution of
5% of the fair market value of capital in such circumstances
may not be equitable, particularly in circumstances where the
assets have appreciated in value and the private foundation has
not been abusing its tax-exempt status. It is therefore suggested that the Bill be amended to oblige private foundations to
distribute only the lesser of fair market value of such assets
and their cost base.
SMALL BUSINESS DEDUCTION
The Act permits Canadian-controlled private corporations
to deduct from federal income tax otherwise payable up to
21% of active business income. Your Committee approves the
Bill's proposais (Clause 49) to increase the incentives given to
such corporations by raising the maximum amount on which
the deduction may be calculated each year from $100,000 to
$150,000 and to raise the cumulative limit from $500,000 to
$750,000.
CANADIAN EXPLORATION EXPENSES

CHARITIES
The Bill proposes (Clause 60) substantial changes respecting
the income tax treatment of charities. The purpose of the
changes is to ensure that charities are not inhibited from
carrying on their work in the most effective manner possible
and at the same time prevent abuses that could arise. The
following is a summary of the principal changes as proposed:
(1) charities will now be classified as follows:
a) charitable organizations, and
b) charitable foundations, public and private.
Each will receive different fiscal treatment;
(2) charitable organizations will have to be registered
to be exempt from tax. Heretofore they only had to be
registe-ed to issue receipts;
(3) charitable organizations will have to make disclosure by the filing of annual information returns;
(4) the cost of raising funds will be limited;
(5) further limitations will be placed on the expending
of their funds and the carrying on of business; and

Your Committee agrees with the proposai (Clause 24(1)) to
allow taxpayers the full amount of Canadian exploration
expenses incurred after May 25, 1976 and before July 1, 1979
in computing their income. The Income Tax Act now limits
the deduction of such expenses for taxpayers who are not
principal-business corporations to 30% per annum.
INDIVIDUAL SURTAX
There will be imposed on individuals and trusts, other than
mutual fund trusts, for 1976 only, a tax equal to 10% of the
tax otherwise payable in excess of $8,000 (Clause 65).
PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE
The Act now limits the exemption from tax on capital gains
on principal residences to those dwellings ordinarily inhabited
by the taxpayer only. Your Committee welcomes the amendment to the definition of a "principal residence" (Clause
14(1)) which will be expanded to include dwellings ordinarily
inhabited by a taxpayer's spouse or former spouse. This will
enable taxpayers living apart from their spouses to continue to
claim dwellings owned by them and lived in by their spouses as
their principal residences.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

TRANSFERS TO SPOUSES AND SPOUSAL TRUSTS
The disposition of property upon death to a spouse or a
spousal trust will give rise to no immediate income tax consequences; such consequences are postponed until the spouse's
death. It may be advantageous to have tax consequences apply
when a deceased leaves his assets to his spouse or a spousal
trust. For example, if the deceased had incurred capital losses
during his lifetime which were not offset by capital gains prior
to his death, the benefit of such losses would be lost at death
by the application of the rollover provisions. The Bill proposes
(Clause 27(2)) to allow a deceased's representatives the option
to elect not to have the rollover provisions of the Act apply to
property of the deceased selected by his representatives. In
other words, they could elect to incur a capital gain which
would be offset by the deceased's prior capital losses, which
gain would not be taxable upon the spouse's death. This
amendment will provide greater flexibility when planning an
estate.

DISABILITY DEDUCTION
Disabled persons are entitled to deduct amounts by which
$1,000 exceeds their taxable income for a year. The Bill
proposes (Clause 43(2)) that parents claiming a disabled child
as a dependant will be entitled to the unused portion of this
deduction.

OTHER AMENDMENTS
Other provisions of Bill C-22 which do not, generally speaking, provide relief to taxpayers are consequential or designed
to correct anomalies in the Act.
In addition to recommendations noted above, your Committee suggests that the following amendments be made to the
Bill or the Income Tax Act:(1) Several provisions exist in the Bill, mainly in favour
of the taxpayer, which have retroactive effect. Your Committee was advised by the Department's officiais that it is
the practice of the Department of National Revenue to
allow taxpayers to file amended returns when affected by
retroactive legislation. Your Committee feels that consideration should be given to incorporating such right in
the Act in order to ensure a taxpayer's right to file an
amended return.
(2) Taxpayers not entitled to claim a deduction for
their spouses are entitled to claim a deduction for certain
dependants equivalent to the deduction available for the
spouses, whether they live with their spouses or not.
Taxpayers living together are thereby able to claim their
children as dependants and have a larger deduction available to them. Clause 42(1) of the Bill proposes that this
deduction no longer be available to taxpayers who live
with their spouses.

This will prevent taxpayers living with their spouses from
claiming the higher deduction equivalent to the marriage
deduction for dependants where it was the intent of the
Act that they only be entitled to a lesser deduction. The
Department has advised your Committee that if the
amendment does not apply to the 1975 taxation year,
taxpayers who had not yet filed their 1975 tax returns or
were entitled to file amended returns for that year might
take advantage of this deficiency in the Act. Notwithstanding this fear, your Committee feels that the retroactive effect of this amendment would constitute a dangerous precedent. It is felt that this amendment should only
apply to 1976 and subsequent taxation years. If deemed
necessary, another amendment should be introduced to
the effect that a taxpayer who had filed his return and
had not claimed this deduction prior to May 25, 1976, is
refused the right to so claim. Taxpayers would also be
unable to make their claim by filing amended returns
after that date.
(3) Clause 43(1) of the Bill proposes amendments to
subparagraph 110(1)(c)(iv) of the Act. This subparagraph provides for the deduction as a medical expense,
within the limits set forth in the Act, of remuneration
paid for "one full-time attendant" or for full-time care in
a nursing home for persons confined for a substantial
period of time each day, by reason of illness, injury or
affliction to a bed or wheelchair. It is not clear to your
Committee whether the expression "one full-time attendant" means one attendant working a normal working shift
or means the equivalent of one full-time attendant working 24 hours a day. It is suggested that this subparagraph
be clarified to provide for a deduction of up to the
equivalent of one full-time attendant working 24 hours a
day. A deduction should also be allowed for 24-hour
attendant care for persons, confined by reason of physical
or mental infirmity for a long-continued period of indefinite duration (subparagraph 110(1)(c) (iv.1)), for persons
who lack normal mental development (subparagraph
110(1)(c)(v)) and the totally blind (subparagraph
110(1)(c)(viii)).
(4) Subparagraph 212 (14) (c) (i) of the Act provides
that the Minister may exempt non-resident charities from
withholding tax provided that if such charities were resident in Canada, they would have been exempt from
Canadian income tax. In other words, they would have to
have the same attributes as tax-exempt Canadian charities to be exempt from withholding tax. Clause 43(4) of
the Bill proposes to change the definition of a registered
charity to mean a charitable organization or charitable
foundation that is resident in Canada and either created
or established in Canada. No reference is made in subparagraph 212 (14) (c) (i) of the creation or establishment in Canada of such entities and it should be amended
accordingly. Otherwise, this could deprive foreign charities from a right which they have always enjoyed under
our law. This could also harm Canadian charities that
enjoy reciprocal rights under foreign law.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
(5) Tbere bas been a substantial amount of conflicting
jurisprudence as to whetber a taxpayer bas the right to
appeal an assessment which sbows "nil" tax payable. It
bas been held that an assessment was an assessment of
tax, not of income and therefore no appeal lay from a
"ýnil" assessment. As a result, taxpayers have been
deprived of a fundamental right under our legislation to
appeal such assessments. A taxpayer may wisb to appeal
such an assessment wben bie disagrees with tbe Department's determination of the amount of loss incurred. The
Department's officiais have expressed tbe view to your
Committee that the purpose of Clause 61 (1) is to cure
this anomaly by giving tbe rigbt to a taxpayer to appeal a
"Inil" assessment. Your Committee notes, bowever, that
this Clause, as presently drafted, does not oblige the
Minister to determine the amount of a taxpayer's loss. It
is felt that in tbe absence of sucb obligation, the taxpayer
may be left witb the samne problemn if the Minister refuses
to determine a taxpayer's losses and issues a "nil" assessment. Your Committee feels that the Act should be
amended to provide that an assessment showing no tax
payable shail be deemed to be an assessment. Alternatively, your Committee suggests that in recognition of the
administrative difficulties which the Department of National Revenue might face if it had to determine ail
taxpayers' losses, the amendment proposed in Clause
61 (1) could be modified to oblige the Minister to assess if

December 9,1976
December 9, 1976

a loss is applied against prior or subsequent years' profits
by a taxpayer or upon a taxpayer's request.
(6) Clause 75 provides that resident individuals must
insert their Social Insurance Numbers on ownership certificates wbicb must be completed when receiving interest
or dividend payments in respect of bearer coupons or
warrants. Should such an individual not provide bis Social
Insurance Number, the bank or paying agent would be
obliged to withhold 25% of tbe înterest or dividend payment. Your Committee feels tbis would constitute an
improper use of taxpayers' Social Insurance Numbers and
taxpayers should only be obliged to provide their proper
namnes and addresses.
Your Committee wishes to express its appreciation for the
services rendered in the review of the Bill by Messrs. Poissant
and Gillespie.
Your Committee bas examined and considered Bill C-22 in
accordance with its terms of reference and, except as noted
above, bas no comment to make to the Bill.

The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance to Committee therefore was pleased that the apparent trend

3. Supplementary Estimates (B) will add $594 million to the
total appropriations for 1976/77. Supplemnentary Estimates
(C), being reported on separately, wîll add a further $150
million. As the following table shows however the total for
supplementaries this fiscal year is significantly lower than the
amounts of corresponding supplementaries in recent years. The

Items to be Voted for essentially non-discretionary
programs. These arise from increased levels of activity
and benefits in programs where federal payments are
determined by formula. They include paymrents to the
provinces toward language education, increased education and social assistance under Indian and Eskimo
Affairs programn, special payment to Alberta under the
1974 agreement on maintenance of the Domestîc Oil
price and increased Manpower Training allowances.

5. The Committee was told that a deliberate policy goal bas
been adopted whicb wilI hold the percentage increase in federai government expenditures to the percentage increase in the
nominal Gross National Product. The current increase of 14
per cent over 1975/76 actual expenditures is witbin this target
ceiling. The Committee bas previously expressed concern that
expenditures should be related in this way to the growth of the
Gross National Product and is pleased that current planned
expenditures wilI do so. However in many instances savings
have been acbieved by delaying elements of planned programns
which will undoubtedly come forward in future estimates. The
Committee continues to be concerned that sucb delays will
only increase cost in the long ternt, and that these are there-

SENATE DEBATES

fore flot true savings. The Carnmittc therefore recornmends

once more tl)a, future increase in total government expenditures be held ta a percentage which reflects the percentage
growth oi tbe reai Gross National Product plus inflation.
6. Connected ta the grawth in expenditures is the grawth in
the total s:i.e of the public service. The Cornmittee was told
that in the current fiscal vear the total increase is less than 1.5
per cent and that the targ«et for 1977/'78 is one per cent or lcss.
In fact sarne twenty-seven departments of gavernmnent will
have fewer authorized numnbers than in the previaus twxo y cars.
The authari7ed increase in growth will be used ta meet
dcmands which cannot be ignored sucti as those for staffing
the penitentiaries and the RCMP. The size and continucd
growth of the public service has alarmed the Committec for
somc time. It therefore welcomed the Minister's assurance that
only these minimum increases would be allowed.

7. The provision of siubstantially increased amounts for
Professional and Special Services was questioned by the Committee. In these Supplementary Estimites same twenty-ane
items in fourteen departments were inciLded for this standard
abject of expenditure. Witnesses were asked ta explain what in
fact is provided for under this description. Major items included are casts of accupational training purchased from the
provinces, education costs in Indian Affairs and Northcrn
Development and use of commercial computer services. The
Committee accepted assurances from the witnesses that future
Estimates would include a table showing the nature of these
payments. The Committee is strongly of the opinion that such
a table is essential if the true nature of this expenditure is ta be
understood. The Coînmittee recommends that those services of
a true consulting nature be clearly indicated so that this
standard abject cannot be used ta supplement the size of the
public service. Further the Committee recommends that the
Treasury Board vigarously serutinize departmental estimates
for Professiona] and Special Services ta ensure that they are

Report of Standing Committee on National Finance On Supplementary Estimates (C)
Thursday, December 9, 1976
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance to
which the Supplementary Estimates (C) laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1977, were referred,
has in obedience to the order of reference of Tuesday, November 30, 1976, examined the said Supplementary Estimates "C"
and reports as follows:
1. In obedience to the foregoing the Committee made a
general examination of the Supplementary Estimates "C"and
beard evidence from the Honourable R. Andras, President of
the Treasury Board and Mr. B. A. MacDonald, Deputy-Secretary, Program Branch.
2. Supplementary Estimates (C) have been introduced solely
to provide money to create jobs in areas of high unemployment
tbrough federal labour intensive projects. Similar provision has
been made as a part of special winter employment programs
every year from 1970/71 except 1974/75. For 1976/77 the
sum of $150 million is requested through two Votes. The first
$100 million will supplement the Local Initiatives Program
and the second will establisb authority for the Treasury Board

to provide a total of $50 million to departments to hire workers
directly in projects with a high labour content.
3. The Committee was concerned that ail projects financed
by this appropriation would be self-terminating within this
fiscal year. It sought assurance from the witnesses that the
Treasury Board would apply criteria for the allocation of funds
which would ensure adherence to a stated terminal date. The
Committee recommends that aIl payments authorized through
the Federal Labour Intensive Program be made only toprojects
which have a stated date of termination and that such projects
have a direct impact on the reduction of local unemployment.
In no circumstances should the financing of a project through
this program commit the federal or any other level of government to future expenditures on it.

If Senator Steuart does not mind, I should like to repeat a
story I told on Thursday evening. I told those assembled that
Senator Steuart and I share a good many things in commonwe both have been mayors of communities; we both have been
active politically; we botb have very cbarming wives; we are
botb small in stature, and we both share an allegiance to that
great country of Ireland. 0f course, everyone was stunned
when I said that. I then added that the only différence is that
Senator Steuart calîs those little Irish people leprechauns and I
caîl them "leprecohens."
On behaîf of the people of Saskatchewan, I welcome Dave
Steuart to this chamber. I know we can look forward to a very
real contribution from bim.
Senator Argue: Honourable senators, so that my silence will
not be misunderstood, I want to make it a unanimous welcome
to Senator Steuart from the Saskatchewan senators.
Senator Sparrow, of course, had the distinction of escorting
Senator Steuart into the chamber, and Senator Buckwold bas
just completed a magnîficent speech of welcome. I should like
to put the new senator to work by inviting him to become a
member of the Agriculture Committee.
I amn certain that when Senator Steuart addresses the chamber, be will distinguish himself. In my judgment, hie is one of
the best orators that western Canada has produced-and, of
course, western Canada produces the best orators in the
country.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I can understand why
Senator Argue did not want to remain sulent. He hadl to stand
and be counted.
I had not had the pleasure of meeting our new colleague
until this evenîng. He is, of course, well qualified, having been
a leader of the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan. I arn quite
confident that he will distinguish bimself in bis work in this
chamber in the samne fashion as have so many former provincial leaders, botb those wbo became premiers of a province and
those who sat in opposition.
On behaîf of the officiai opposition in the Senate, I welcome
Senator Steuart.

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE OF FIRST
MINISTERS
AGENDA ITEMS-QUESTION

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, may I ask the Leader
of the Government, in view of the fact that the press was
expelled from the Conference of First Ministers, if be has
anything to report on this first day of the meeting?
Senator Perrault: I have no information to substantiate the
apparent allegation of the Leader of the Opposition that the
press was expelled. Indeed it has been the continuing policy of
this government to welcome the legitimate participation of the
press in conferences relating to public issues affecting the
people of this country. It was a unanimous decision, I understand, taken by the Premiers of Canada that they wished to
conduct certain aspects of their intricate and detailed discussions and negotiations privately. It was not a matter of expelling the press, but it was a matter of federal and provincial
political leaders of this country deciding they wanted to discuss
certain matters in private. I find that this in no sense creates a
dangerous precedent in this country. Indeed, all levels of
government from time to time have confidential meetings,
which enable a type of discussion and detailed deliberation
which would otherwise not be possible in front of television
cameras and radio microphones.
Senator Flynn: I'm impressed; but I wasn't inquiring only
about the absence of the press or the refusal to accept the
press. I also inquired of the leader whether he had anything to
report on the first day of the conference. This may come as a
shock to him, but everyone is very much interested in the
result of this first encounter between Mr. Trudeau and Mr.
Lévesque, and I was wondering if the leader had anything to
tell us that would be of interest not only to the Senate but to
the public in general.
80003-15

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, it seems to me that
to employ the word "encounter" is not conducive to promoting
the type of atmosphere that we would like to see at this
conference. My understanding is that the first day's deliberations have gone very well indeed, and I hope to be in a position
to report more fully to the bouse at the earliest opportunity.
Certainly, the Government of Canada does not approach this
meeting in a spirit of confrontation, in a spirit which suggests
or implies that some sort of crisis situation exists. Constructive
initiatives are being advanced by the Government of Canada.
An Hon. Senator: And also by the premiers.
Senator Perrault: As the Bible says, "Let us sit down and
reason together." This is what is taking place in our nation's
capital this weekSenator Croll: Even here.
Senator Flynn: Has the leader anything to tell us about the
agenda of the conference? He was going to explain the apparent contradiction in his reply of last week as to whether the
conference would discuss constitutional matters as well as
economic problems.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I hope to be able to
make a statement tomorrow when the Senate meets. I am
unable to provide a complete reply today because this has been
the first conference day, which involved, I understand, the
development and approval of an agenda.
Senator Flynn: If I remember correctly, the Leader of the
Government told us he would let us know about the agenda. I
said that if he does it after the conference has taken place it
will not be much of an accomplishment.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 5, 1976
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Léopold Langlois moved the second reading of Bill
C-28, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service for the financial year ending the 31st March,
1977.
He said: Honourable senators, before I came into the chamber this evening I requested that copies of the two tables I had
in my possession concerning this bill be distributed to all
honourable senators. The first table is entitled "Supply, 197677," and it, after a brief explanation of Appropriation Act No.
5, gives a summary of Appropriation Acts Nos. 2, 3 and 4, and
also a summary of supplementary estimates (B) and (C). The
second table is entitled "Estimates, 1976-77," and it gives a
résumé of the main estimates and supplementary estimates
(A), (B) and (C) in two columns, one headed "To be voted,"
and the other "Statutory," with totals for each. It also bas a
footnote giving a breakdown of the supplementary payments
which have been made in respect of old age pensions, guaranteed income supplement and spouse allowances, which were
contained in the main estimates tabled earlier in this chamber.
I thought these two tables would be of some use to honourable
senators in their consideration of the bill presently before us.

SENATE DEBATES
I come now to the bill itself. As honourable senators will
recall, approval was given on June 29 last to two appropriation
acts which released the balance of the main estimates, and the
total of supplementary estimates (A), for 1976-77. The bill
before us today is based on supplementary estimates (B) and
(C) for 1976-77, and provides a total of $577 million to meet
further expenditures in the current fiscal year.
«

(2030)

Supplementary estimates (B) for the fiscal year 1976-77
were tabled in this chamber and referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance on November 16. The
voted portion of these estimates totals $396 million, consisting
of $363 million in budgetary items and $33 million in nonbudgetary expenditures.
Supplementary estimates (C) for the fiscal year 1976-77
were tabled and referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on November 30. These estimates consist of
two votes which total, as honourable senators will recall, $150
million.
As honourable senators are aware, both sets of estimates
have been reviewed by the National Finance Committee, and
were discussed in committee with the President of the Treasury Board and his officials on December 8. I remind the
house that this meeting was the first one which the new
President of the Treasury Board, the Honourable Robert
Andras, attended. He created-and I am sure I am voicing the
opinion of all who were present at the meeting-a very good
impression on the committee by his detailed and precise
answers to all questions which were put to him.
Supplementary estimates (B) provide for the following programs which were not in the original or main estimates:
(1) $65 million for job creation under the 1976-77
Local Initiatives Program;
(2) $23 million as a gross requirement for contributions
under housing programs announced in December 1975.
This increase will be, of course, partially offset by expected lapses in other items, as was announced in committee
by the President of the Treasury Board;
(3) $15 million for the Swine Flu Immunization Program; and
(4) $9 million for settlement of the Indian land claims
under the James Bay Agreement.
The majority of remaining major supplementary items are
related to increased levels of activity and benefits under programs which are similar to statutory programs in that federal
payments are determined by formulae and are, therefore,
essentially non-discretionary. Included in this category are the
following:
(1) $32 million in payments to the provinces toward
language education;

December 13, 1976

(2) $27 million for increased education and social
assistance payments under the Indian and Eskimo affairs
program;
(3) $24 million for a special payment to Alberta in
accordance with the 1974 agreement on maintenance of
the domestic ail price; and
(4) $20 million for increased manpower training
allowances.
In addition, these estimates contain revisions to statutory
programs amounting to $197 million. For example, the
Canada Assistance Plan is to be supplemented by $115 million
to meet increased benefits and case loads. This increase is
offset in part by $1 Il million in funds available due to lower
than expected payments for other income security, social
assistance and health care items. Contracting-out payments
and fiscal transfers to the provinces account for a further $109
million of the statutory supplementaries, and increased payments to the railways, primarily for uneconomic branch lines
and passenger services, as was explained in detail to the
committee, result in an additional $63 million.
Supplementary estimates (C), which total $150 million,
provide money to create jobs in areas of high unemployment.
As honourable senators will sec, this estimate contains only
two items--one to increase the provision for the Local Initiatives Program for this winter by $100 million, and a second for
a vote of $50 million under the control of the Treasury Board
to provide funds to departments to hire workers directly in
projects with a high labour content. This new program was
fully explained by the minister on the day that this estimate
was reviewed by the National Finance Committee.
I should like also to emphasize that, as a result of the
government's extremely vigorous scrutiny of all requests for
supplementary funds by departments and agencies, these supplementary estimates include only items which are virtually
non-discretionary in nature, or which are absolutely essential
in order to deal effectively with very pressing problems that
have arisen since the tabling of the main estimates in
Parliament.
The total of the estimates to date for the year, including
both statutory and voted items, is $40.3 billion, which is well
within the government's previously announced target ceiling of
14 per cent growth over actual 1975-76 expenditures.
Honourable senators, I think I have covered the important
features of this bill, and if further explanations are required, I
shall be pleased to supply them.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I understand that
there is no urgency in respect of passing this appropriation bill
tonight, in which case I shall move the adjournment of the
debate.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

SENATE DEBATES
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE OF FIRST
MINISTERS
AGENDA ITE MS

QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, yesterday I promised to make a statement with respect to the Federal-Provincial Conference of First Ministers. I have some information
which I am able to provide today.
Honourable senators will recall that yesterday the Leader of
the Opposition asked about the items to be dealt with on the
conference agenda. The conference dealt with two items, fiscal
policy and the state of the economy. Discussions on the first
item have been quite productive. The discussion with respect to
fiscal policy occupied most of the time of the conference. This
discussion was completed at noon, and it is my understanding
that an agreement has been achieved on the basis for fiscal
arrangements between the federal government and the provinces for the period beginning April 1. As honourable senators
are aware, agreements of this kind are usually for a duration
of five years. Today's reported agreement seems to indicate
some very encouraging progress. The Prime Minister will hold
a press conference this afternoon, when I understand that
additional details will be provided with respect to this fiscal
agreement.
I can report that the subject of the Constitution of Canada
was not an official agenda item, at the request of one of the
premiers attending the conference. It is my understanding,
however, that a useful constitutional discussion was held privately at the Prime Minister's residence last night on the
occasion of the dinner which was attended by the provincial
premiers of Canada.
* (1410)

That is all that I am able to report on that subject at the
present time. More detail will be available later this week.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I wonder if I might
ask the Leader of the Government if there has been unanimous
agreement by the Il first ministers on the matter of the
five-year fiscal agreement.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, as I say, more
details will be announced by the Prime Minister this afternoon. It is my understanding that there has been substantial
agreement among the provinces with respect to the fiscal
sharing arrangements over the next five years. With regard to
the position of each of the provinces, I do not have that
information available, but an agreement has been achieved.
Senator Asselin: Was it unanimous?
[Translation]
Senator Perrault: I do not know. I have no information on
that.
[English)
Senator Grosart: 1 take it that the Leader of the Government is not aware at this time whether it was a unanimous
agreement?

December 14, 1976

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I hesitate to use the
word "unanimous" because I do not have the information
available to suggest unanimity. However, I shall seek that
information over the next hour, and hopefully I can report to
this chamber. The report made available to me was literally
made available 10 minutes before we entered the chamber, so I
do not have all the details.
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
SI!LVER JIBII EL CELE BRAT ION

QU ESIION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, on October 27
Senator Forsey asked a question with respect to the Queen's
Silver Jubilee, which falls on February 6, 1977. The question
was: What plans has the government for a special issue of
stamps or coins or both, to celebrate the event?
I replied then that the Government of Canada intends to
mark the Silver Jubilee in many appropriate ways.
Honourable senators may be interested to know that an
interdepartmental committee has now been established under
the auspices of one of the government departments. The
committee is in the process of studying various proposals to
mark the Jubilee Year 1977 in Canada. It is expected that an
announcement of the projects approved by the government will
be made shortly.
One project that has been announced is the awarding to
distinguished Canadians of a Silver Jubilee Medal. The medal
will be minted in Canada and will differ from the British
medal in that the reverse side will be designed by a Canadian
designer. The full details of the awarding criteria and distribution will be announced later.
Senator Hicks: May I ask a supplementary question? I take
it that it is implied in your answer-and please correct me if I
am wrong-that there will be no special stamps issued to mark
the occasion; otherwise, that would have to be known by this
time?
Senator Perrault: On the basis of the information available
to me, 1 am unable to comment on that possibility. I will make
a further inquiry of our philatelic people to determine whether
a stamp will be issued. It seems that it would be entirely
appropriate to have a stamp issued on an occasion such as this.
I mentioned the medal, really, to suggest that this is but one of
several projects which are to be undertaken by the government. A special stamp issue could well be part of the general
jubilee celebration.
Senator Williams: I should like to ask the Leader of the
Government if the competition for a design of that medal to be
presented to distinguished Canadians will include all artists in
Canada'?
In the past, Indian artists have not been notified of competitions. On one occasion an Indian design won a competition,
but the artist was not an Indian.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I shall bring that
concern to the attention of the minister responsible for the
work of that Jubilee Committee. Senator Williams appears to

December 14, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

have made a valid point, and I assure him that his concern will
be communicated.
ENERGY
PROPOSED INCREASE IN OIL PRICES BY OPEC-QUESTION
ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: On November 18 last Senator Austin
asked whether the government has any information yet about
the possibility of an increase in oil prices by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He also asked: "What is
the cost to Canada of an increase of $1 per barrel, based on
volumes of imports to Canada? Would the government leader
also inform this chamber what benefits the provinces of
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince
Edward Island and Newfoundland enjoy as a result of the
current lower-than-international price of oil imported and
consumed in those provinces?"
The answer is that the government has no concrete information as yet about the possibility of an increase in oil prices by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. A
number of reports have been issued, but nothing official.
Notwithstanding the possibly harmful effects of a further
world oil price increase on global economic recovery, there
seems to be a general expectation that some rise in OPEC
prices will occur in the early part of next year.
Based on net imports of approximately 300,000 barrels a
day, the net balance of payments cost to Canada in a full year
of an increase of $1 per barrel in our import costs would be
approximately $110 million.
Areas of Canada wholly or partly dependent on imported oil
currently benefit to the extent of over $3 per barrel under the
federal Oil Import Compensation Program. That is to say,
without this program, oil product prices in these areas would
be approximately 10 cents a gallon higher than they now are.
The aggregate amount paid out under the program between
January 1, 1974, and June 30, 1976, was approximately $3
billion, of which roughly two-thirds was for the benefit of
consumers in eastern Ontario and Quebec and one-third for
consumers in the Atlantic provinces.
NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION
RECONSTITUTION OF SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE-FURTHER
QUESTION

Senator Asselin: Can the Leader of the Government tell the
Senate why the Joint Committee on the National Capital
Region has not yet been constituted in this session?
Senator Perrault: A decision has still to be taken with
respect to the reconstitution of this committee. t said a few
days ago-the honourable senator may not have been in his
place-that I would report as soon as I could on the possibility
of this committee's being re-established. However, no decision
has yet been made.

CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
DOCUMENTARY PROGRAM-QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Senator Norrie: Honourable senators, t request leave to
make a statement concerning a CBC documentary program.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Norrie: My statement concerns a CBC documentary program The Fifth Estate, which I saw last Wednesday
evening, December 8, 1976. It was a 40-minute documentary,
handled chiefly by the CBC lady of the air Adrienne Clarkson,
on McCain Foods of Florenceville, New Brunswick.
Before mentioning my complaint, I wish to make it clear
that I am an "in-law" of one of the McCains involved. This
fact makes the following neither better nor worse. I merely
wish to have everything out in the open, which was certainly
not the case with Miss Clarkson's narration.
In my opinion, Miss Clarkson must have a perverted mind
when she is able to work so hard to find such ugly things to say
and insinuate about McCain Foods. The maritimes is one of
the "have not" areas so far as dollars and cents are concerned,
but, by God-and I say that reverently-we have many very
fine citizens who can hold their own with those anywhere in
the world, and the McCain boys and their families are exactly
that.
Miss Clarkson talked a lot about McCains using taxpayers'
money, and getting grants or loans to expand. Certainly they
did, over 20 years of hard work; they did not steal it.
Now tell me, Miss Clarkson, how many dollars of the
taxpayers' money in this country did you spend to gather all
the insults and what, in some instances, amounts to lies
because the material was taken out of context? Of course, this
is what the CBC likes-scandal, horror stories, inuendos, and
anything to ruin this great country of ours and its fine citizens.
She interviewed farmers who could not grow a burdock if
they died for it. Did she report on one of the many dozens of
good farmers who love every one of the McCains, and who
have been friends and have done business with them for 20
years? What happened to the interview with the member of
the Hatfield government who praised the McCains and all
aspects of their work? That would have spoiled the sadistic
tone of the show for Miss Clarkson. You should have heard the
radio stations buzzing after that rotten show.
0 (1420)

Now, Miss Clarkson, I demand a true expense account for
the hours you and your troupe spent travelling all through the
plants which the McCains operate, as well as for the coverage
of the plant which they opened recently in England. Please
send the account to the above address. Do not forget to include
the hours, days and weeks you have spent interviewing farmers, out of which you could find only two instances, bad
enough to report. The taxpayers will groan over this one.
Has the CBC come to this-wasted time; the ruination of
the names of good people; sensationalism; the twisting of facts

SENATE DEBATES
to display whatever meaning it wishes to make of them? If this
is so, we have had enough of the CBC in our free country.
Senator Beaubien: Hear, hear!
Senator Quart: Honourable senators, I have been heartened
at hearing Senator Norrie's speech. 1, too, listened to the
program on the McCains, and was shocked. Of course, 1 do
not particularly like Adrienne Clarkson, but despite that I was
shocked. In fact, I have no personal interest one way or
another with respect to whether McCain Foods is successful,
but it seems to me that this Canadian company is the largest
of its particular kind in the world. It is a processor of French
fried potatoes, and potatoes in various forms. Indeed, I have
probably contributed a little to their success. In my opinion,
Miss Clarkson's treatment of this company was absolutely
scandalous, and this was not the first such program in which
Adrienne Clarkson has put down Canadian business.
She is probably a naturalized Canadian now, but for several
years, when the program Take Thirty was on, she was not, and
it was my impression that she tried repeatedly to degrade
Canadians who had been successful.
I congratulate you, Senator Norrie. I have had so many
battles with the CBC that I am sure they would no longer
bother to listen to me, but there are many other programs
which should be examined because their programming situation seems to me to be pretty bad.
As one colleague to another, may I say that I much appreciate your raising this point.
Senator Norrie: Thank you very much.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 5, 1976
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Langlois for the second reading of Bill
C-28, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service for the financial year ending the 31st March,
1977.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I made some
remarks on the estimates on which this appropriation bill and
its companion are based. I will not repeat what I said then. On
this occasion 1 should like to say that we are all in the
embarrassing position of being asked to pass an appropriation
bill under the present circumstances.
I should say at once that this year, for the first time, these
appropriation bills bring the government expenditure in this
area, which is by no means the total area of government
expenditure in the year, over $40 billion. We are also told at
this time that the government is showing great restraint, and
we have a promise that the increase in government expenditure
next year will be held to 14 per cent.
Senator Perrault: Hear, hear.
Senator Grosart: The Leader of the Government says,
"Hear, hear." I wonder if it has occurred to him how ridicufous it is that we should have a government saying to everyone

December 14, 1976

else in Canada, "You must hold the line. You must control
expenditures far below 14 per cent, while we continue to spend
at a rate of increase of 14 per cent."
Nobody has explained to me yet why it makes any sense for
the government to say to the whole of the economy, including
the private sector of the economy, "A 14 per cent increase in
your expenditures would be disastrous. A 14 per cent increase
in your prices would be disastrous." And yet the government
says, "We are really saying to you that the evidence of our
restraint is that next year we will not increase expenditures
over 14 per cent."
Senator Perrault: Would the honourable senator permit a
question?
Senator Grosart: Yes, of course.
Senator Perrault: In the other place, of course, the hold-up
in the passage of Bill C-19 is precisely because the opposition
opposes some of the cutbacks proposed by the government in
this restraint program. That is the incredible illogicality of the
situation.
Senator Grosart: I am not surprised that the opposition
opposes anything suggested by this government in the whole
area of government expenditure at a time when we are told
that the government is wasting money. We have the evidence
of the Auditor General, and the kinds of things that are said in
that impartial outsider report are, for example, that government has "lost or is close to losing effective control of the
public purse."
i suggest that it is a ridiculous situation for this or any other
legislative body to be in, to be asked to pass this bill when we
have this statement that the government has lost or is close to
losing effective control of its own spending.
We are told by the Auditor General that "financial management and control in the Government of Canada is grossly
inadequate." I am quoting the Auditor General directly. He
refers to the "highly unsatisfactory state of financial control
throughout the government." I emphasize the word "throughout." Throughout the government there is this lack of control.
Yet here in the Senate we are asked to pass this bill, when, i
am sure, there is not a senator here who is not aware that there
are expenditures we are asked to consent to which are unnecessary. Because if the waste is there it is there. It is in this
appropriation bill. It is in the supplementary estimates. Yet we
are asked to pass this bill. Why? What is the reason?
The Auditor General suggests this is one reason: "Recognition and rewards in the federal public service have gone to
those who could devise ingenious new programs rather than to
those charged with the responsibility of restraining and controlling expenditures and ensuring that good value is obtained
for the money spent."
I am sure on reflection the Leader of the Government will
not be surprised that any suggestion in this whole area is
questioned in the other place; and some of them have been
questioned here and in our committee, I am glad to say.
What makes the whole situation even more embarrassing for
anyone asked to consent to the passage of these appropriation

December 14, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

bills is that the government itself has resisted the one clear
solution offered by the Auditor General. He said that the
answer, or a large part of the answer, would be to appoint a
comptroller general. But the government said no. This would
disturb the present setup. It would annoy deputy ruinisters,
because the comptroller general, as suggested, would have the
rank of deputy minister. Therefore, the government would not
accede to that request or suggestion. I cannot understand why
the government will not accede to this most sensible suggestion, the kind of suggestion which has been taken up in the
private sector over and over again. Almost any business has a
comptroller of expenditures, some one person who has the
overall job of looking after the expenditures and saying whether they are necessary. The suggestion was, of course, that the
comptroller general would have a fiscal officer in each department. This again has been turned down. My understanding is
that there has been a suggestion from the minister that there
might be fiscal officers appointed, but with no suggestion as to
whom they would be responsible. They would be responsible
probably only to their deputy ministers, which would not
change the situation in the least.
a

(1430)

What concerns me is the apparent indifference shown by the
government at the present time to the situation now presented
by the Auditor General. The Leader of the Government told us
a moment ago that one of the subjects that came before the
meeting of the First Ministers was the state of the economy. I
can understand why he did not give us any indication of what
the decision was-if there was a decision-by the First Ministers about the state of the economy.
Senator Perrault: A discussion.
Senator Grosart: I am sure it would be embarrassing for
him to have to relate to us some of the comments that were
made on the state of the economy and the reasons therefor,
particularly those that concerned policy decisions, or lack of
decisions, at the federal government level.
In presenting the bill, the deputy leader paid tribute to the
new minister. As far as the minister's presentation before the
committee is concerned, in general I would agree that the
tribute was well deserved. The minister carried on the tradition
of his immediate predecessor of giving frank answers to questions. However, perhaps elsewhere he was too frank, because
certainly many Canadians were shocked to hear him fluff
off-if I may use the common vulgarism-the concern of the
Auditor General by saying, "Well, it is only $6.6 billion. We
have added up all the complaints of the Auditor General and
they amount to only $6.6 billion."
Senator Croll: Million.
Senator Grosart: I am sorry, $6.6 million. If it was billion he
might have been more accurate. It is $6.6 million. It invites the
comment, "What's $6 million?" Maybe that is the natural
inflation of the government approach to these financial problems. Some years ago it was, "What's" $1 million?" Now it is,
"What's $6 million?" This is at a time when the best estimate
I can obtain is that the deficit in the federal budget this year

will be $5 billion or $6 billion. And I am right with the billion
this time. Yet we have this apparent unconcern, "What's $6.6
million?" Obviously, that is the tip of the iceberg. The minister has added up the specific complaints which, it is clear from
the Auditor General's report, were examples, instances, of this
lack of control, this loss of control.
I would ask any senators who might be interested in any
business, either as shareholders or as directors: What would
your response be if the external auditors made a report saying,
"The management of this company has lost, or is close to
losing, effective control"? You would fire them. Unfortunately, we are not in a position directly to fire the managers of our
affairs at the present time. That opportunity will come and I
for one hope that the public response will be what this kind of
attitude towards government expenditure warrants.
Hon. Léopold Langlois: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I wish to
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator Langlois
speaks now, his speech will have the effect of closing the
debate on the motion for second reading of this bill.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I will endeavour to
be as brief as possible, while trying to give answers to the
generalities that we have heard from my friend opposite.
The honourable senator first mentioned that the estimates
presently before us are an example of waste in government
expenditures. He also referred-and this was the essence of his
speech-to the Auditor General's report, but he forgot to
mention the comments made before the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance by the President of the Treasury
Board when he stated, rightly so to my mind, that it was
wrong, as was done in regard to the Auditor General's report,
to equate the criticism of the Auditor General to waste rather
than to accountability. I do not think any allegation of waste
made with respect to that report has been supported by factual
evidence. It is very easy to do what has been done. We have
seen in the newspapers and heard comments on the radio that
because an amount has not been accounted for in the clearest
terms possible it is tantamount to waste. There is no proof
whatsoever to that effect.
Senator Asselin: Eight million.
Senator Grosart: You have not read the report.
Senator Langlois: I have read the report, but I have not read
it the way you did, with an eye to criticism. There is no proof
of waste whatsoever. Even when the Auditor General says in
his report that some departments or crown agencies have lost
control, or are about to lose control, where does the truth lie?
Have they lost, or are they about to lose, control over their
management? Again we are in suspense.
Senator Grosart: The suspense is your fault.
Senator Langlois: Any comment can be made on that basis,
but this is not a factual comment.
Senator Phillips: Does the truth lie with Atomic Energy of
Canada Limited?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Langlois: There is no evidence that there was any
waste in that respect either. At this time my honourable friend
seems only to be drawing on his imagination. I know it is the
role of the opposition to try to find fault with the government
of the day, but they should not endeavour to find fault where
there are no facts on which to base it.
Senator Phillips: In fairness to the honourable senatorSenator Langlois: If you want to make a speech, I will sit
down to let you make one and I will reply to you afterwards. If
you have any questions, put them. I will not, however, allow
you to make a speech at this stage, because I am closing the
debate. I want to have an opportunity of replying to you or
anybody else who wishes to comment on the bill now before us.
Senator Phillips: I will leave your imagination on the
record.
Senator Langlois: Very well.
It is a question of accountability. The Deputy Leader of the
Opposition should have read the progress report tabled in the
other place by the President of the Treasury Board on November 19. If he had done so, I am sure he would have to conclude
with me that his remarks today were not based on factual
information, because something has been donc since the Glassco report, which was implemented, starting away back in 1969.
A lot has been donc on this report. I will not go over it all; it is
a very lengthy progress report, consisting of 13 pages. I will
limit my comments to quoting the last three paragraphs, which
read:
0

(1440)

But in all fairness, this evolution must be considered in
the appropriate historical perspective. It must be recognized that the policy of decentralized management adopted in 1962 was the most fundamental innovation to be
introduced in the public administration of Canada in the
last fifty years. This policy was adopted to implement the
recommendations of the Royal Commission on Government Organization (the Glassco Commission); and while
decentralization of management has resulted in a lengthy
and occasionally messy adjustment process, there can be
no doubt, in my view, that it has triggered a "quantum
leap" in the general efficiency and effectiveness of government operations. In this respect, credit must be given
where credit is due. While the recommendations of the
Glassco Commission were implemented by later administrations, I must pay tribute to the foresight which the
government led by the Right Honourable Member for
Prince Albert manifested in establishing, 16 years ago,
the Royal Commission on Government Organization.
Financial Administration is perhaps the most complex
and arcane aspect of government operations. It is an area
where Parliament and the Government must constantly
seek expert advice to ensure that the highest attainable
standards are met in the administration of public funds. It
is an area where the vigilance of the Auditor General has
been of invaluable assistance to us in assessing independently and without political bias the extent to which these

December 14, 1976

standards are effectively achieved in the day-to-day operations of government. The bill to which this house gave
first reading on November lst bears witness to the government's determination to clarify the duties and responsibilities of this servant of Parliament and to provide him
with better means of fulfilling his important function.
But, to paraphrase Georges Clémenceau, financial
administration is too serious a matter to be allowed to
become the exclusive preserve of accountants or management consultants. In our parliamentary system, the ultimate responsibility for financial control rests with Parliament, and with Parliament alone. Accordingly, it is my
ambition, during my tenure as President of the Treasury
Board, to ensure that parliamentarians will be provided
with all the factual and analytical information required
for them to exercise fully their constitutional responsibility in respect of financial administration.
I do not believe that anyone can criticize such an attitude on
the part of the President of the Treasury Board. This statement was preceded by another statement made in the house on
November 2. It is a lengthy statement and I will not quote
extensively from it, but I will limit myself to a few paragraphs
from the news release of that date by the minister acting as
President of the Treasury Board, as follows:
Commenting on the terms of reference of the commission, Mr. Andras noted that its mandate is basically
twofold, namely, to enquire and report on the structure,
systems and procedures required:
-to ensure that financial management and control exercised at all levels and in all federal departments and
agencies meet the highest attainable standards; and
-to establish effective administrative accountability of
deputy ministers and heads of crown agencies to the
government, and, where appropriate, to Parliament.
Before the committee the minister made a further comment,
of which my honourable friend on the other side seems to have
lost memory. The minister explained to the committee members why this matter had been referred to a royal commission
to underline the principle behind the establishment of crown
agencies and crown corporations, which principle is their
removal from political control. He asked us a question which
no one dared answer. How far can we go in controlling the
administration of these crown corporations or agencies without
destroying the very principle on which they are based and for
which they are created? This is the point: Members of Parliament cannot interfere with the managerial affairs of a corporation without making such corporation subject to political
control by parliamentarians, which would be to defeat exactly
the purposes for which the corporation was created. This is the
main reason behind the referral of this very delicate problem
to a royal commission.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Langlois: I believe the government was right, and
no one can criticize such a decision.
Senator Grosart: It has been criticized.

December 14, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Langlois: I had not anticipated entering such a
debate today, having been under the impression that we
intended to deal with the estimates before us.
Senator Grosart: They are not before us.
Senator Langlois: I will make a last comment, returning to
the subject matter of the present debate in refuting to the best
of my ability the argument advanced by my honourable friend
opposite that these estimates are an example of waste. I would
have liked him to have given us a single example in support of
such a statement. As he has no doubt himself noticed, and as I
pointed out in my address last evening, most of these items are
either to cover circumstances which did not exist when the
main estimates were tabled before Parliament, or are items
with respect to which the government has no discretion at all,
such as transfers to the provinces and statutory votes. Parliament has no control over such funds but has to provide them
for the purposes just mentioned. To conclude that there is
waste is, in my opinion, getting far away from the factual
situations which are covered by these estimates.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Langlois: With that I conclude my remarks, and
thank you for your kind attention.
Senator Grosart: Could I ask the deputy leader one question? Would he not regard it as strange that after this long
story of implementation of the Glassco Commission report 20
years ago that when the Auditor General still says, "The
government has lost or is close to losing effective control of the
public purse," the answer now is another royal commission?
Senator Langlois: The present royal commission, of course,
is to find a means to achieve exactly what was recommended
by the Auditor General. One cannot say that the government
intends to escape its responsibilities. As a matter of fact, the
government has already mentioned in the progress report of
the honourable minister, the President of the Treasury Board,
made to the House of Commons on November 19, that a long
time before the report of the Auditor General was issued the
government had already started initiating programs to control
expenditures of departments and agencies. My honourable
friend knows that as well as I do, and when the Auditor
General says that the government has either lost or is about to
lose control of the public purse, it is a very easy statement to
make, but it does not prove anything at all. What is the
situation? Has it lost, or is it about to lose, control, and, if so,
to what degree would control be lost? There is nothing to
establish that, and there is no possible relationship between
this statement and the factual information concerning the
circumstances of which he was complaining.
Senator Grosart: The deputy leader quoted the President of
the Treasury Board as saying that the comment by the Auditor
General was non-political.
Senator Phillips: And imaginative.
a

(1450)

Senator Langlois: What does that prove? Do you mean to
say that he is right simply because he is non-political? My

80003-16

friend can easily be wrong when he is political. I am reminded
of the comment that my honourable friends on the other side
of the house made when the present Auditor General was
appointed. As we all recall, the government was then accused
of making a political appointment. My honourable friend
cannot have his cake and eat it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved
that this bill be read a second time. Is it your pleasure to adopt
the motion?
Senator Grosart: On division.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time, on division.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?
Senator Langlois moved that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL SESSION, WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA,
U.S.A.-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Charles McElman rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Twenty-second Annual Session of the North Atlantic
Assembly, held in Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S.A., from
12th to 19th November, 1976, and in particular to the
discussions and proceedings of the Session and the participation therein of the delegation from Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I fear this may be one of
those occasions, the general effect of which will be to reduce
attendance in this chamber near to, but hopefully not below,
the quorum level.
The twenty-second annual session of the North Atlantic
Assembly was held from November 14 to 19 at colonial
Williamsburg in the state of Virginia, an appropriate setting
during the United States Bicentennial Year.
It is regrettable that the illness of Senator Hamilton McDonald prevents him from drawing the attention of the Senate to
this important meeting, and initiating a discussion of it, as was
his intention. I join with other honourable senators in wishing
Senator McDonald a speedy recovery and return to this
chamber.
In his absence, permit me to initiate the debate with some
general remarks concerning NATO and the North Atlantic
Assembly, along with specific comment on the activities of the
annual session of the Economic Committee, of which I was a
member. It is my understanding that other honourable senators will speak in this debate concerning the work of the
committees on which they served.
The Senate of Canada was well represented at Williamsburg. Senator Hamilton McDonald served on the Military
Committee; Senator Paul Yuzyk on the Committee on Education, Cultural Affairs and Information; Senator Paul Lafond

SENATE DEBATES
on the Scientific and Technical Committee; and Senator David
Walker on the Political Committee.
I might say, as an aside, that when we were attending our
briefing before going to Williamsburg, I commented to Senator Walker, in the best of good humour, that I found it
puzzling that he was nominated to the Political Committee,
since he was such a completely non-political person. However,
I must add that Senator Walker and I thoroughly enjoyed
each other's company while attending the sessions.
I should point out that delegates to the assembly are chosen
by their respective national parliaments from the various
political parties represented. It is expected that such delegates
should be representative of their nations rather than their
political parties in the partisan sense. The Canadian delegates
of all parties have an excellent record in this respect, an
example which could be emulated by some of the more socialistic delegates from several European nations, who tend to
"gang up."
The Canadian delegation was led by the president of the
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association, Mr. Tom
Lefebvre, M.P. for Pontiac, who is a very able and affable
representative. In addition to the five senators already mentioned, there were 19 delegates from the House of Commons.
Mr. Paul Langlois, M.P. for Chicoutimi, was present also in
his capacity as an executive officer of the Assembly, and he
was re-elected to the office of treasurer for another year.
Another Canadian parliamentarian, Mr. Ralph Stewart,
M.P. for Cochrane, was elected chairman of the Committee on
Education, Cultural Affairs and Information. I believe it to be
the first time that a Canadian has held that post.
This is in the tradition established by Canadian delegations
to the Assembly. Many honourable senators will recall with
affection that one of the persons most responsible for the
founding of the North Atlantic Assembly was the Honourable
Wishart Robertson, then Speaker of the Senate, who became
the first president of the Assembly. Canada has provided two
other presidents, Mr. Jean-Eudes Dubé, then an M.P. from
New Brunswick, in 1966-67, and Mr. Terrence Murphy, M.P.,
in 1971-72. It is noteworthy that until this year Canada was
the only one of the 15 nations to have provided three presidents of the Assembly, and each of them served with
distinction.
Prior to our arrival at Williamsburg, the Canadian delegation was taken on a special tour of military installations at
Norfolk, Virginia. It was an enlightening and seriously absorbing experience.
The various establishments of the United States Navy,
Army, Air Force and Marines combine to make Norfolk one
of the greatest and most modern military complexes in the
world. Its size can be appreciated when one realizes that the
total number of service and civilian personnel employed at
these establishments in Norfolk is approximately twice the
total of all servicemen and women in the Canadian Armed
Forces.

December 14, 1976

At Norfolk we were given a detailed briefing on the North
Atlantic defence shield by both Canadian and American officers, as well as a tour of the USS Dahlgren, a modern
guided-missile destroyer. It was most enlightening, to say the
least. These and other military aspects of the visit will be dealt
with in more detail by other participants in this debate.
As honourable senators are aware, NATO is composed of 15
member nations-the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark,
Norway, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, the United
States and Canada. Some 10 years ago France withdrew her
military forces from the day-to-day commitment to the
alliance, but remains involved in most other activities of the
organization. It was this withdrawal that necessitated the
removal of NATO headquarters from Paris to Brussels in
1967.
It should be noted that Spain has, in recent weeks, made the
necessary political decisions to prepare for free elections early
in the new year, and this will bring to office the first democratically elected government in Spain since Generalissimo
Francisco Franco seized power in 1939. It is being widely
forecast that, with the return to democracy, Spain will be
invited to become a member of NATO. The mixture they may
join is, indeed, a strange one.
Without question, NATO is a conglomerate whose component parts have a diversity of backgrounds, historic military
alliances and antagonisms, political philosophies, records of
economic stability and instability, varying levels of industrial
development and, currently, some very worrisome adversary
situations. Greece and Turkey still sit, although some distance
apart, at the conference tables of NATO and the North
Atlantic Assembly, while efforts continue to settle their differences over Cyprus and offshore territorial claims. Similarly,
the United Kingdom and Iceland seek distance between themselves at the meetings; but they still sit while a more lasting
solution to the temporary truce in the cod war is under
discussion.
The Federal Republic of Germany, the loser in World War
II, is the most stable economic unit of Europe in the alliance,
and displays, in addition, remarkable political stability-a
source of envy to some member nations who supposedly won
World War II.

The United Kingdom, brought to the brink of financial ruin
by socialist misdirection, has seen its once secure currency sink
to the depths, and has been humbled before the world in order
to meet the requirements for a desperation loan from the
International Monetary Fund. One can only hope that fiscal
sanity and the return of a strong Tory government there will
soon coincide.
Senator Grosart: Hear, hear.
Senator McElman: Honourable senators, were it not for the
overwhelming good humour of the Italian people, one would

and monetary instability of Italy and its governments. The

growth will be at the scaled-down rate of 4.3 per cent during
the first six months of 1977, and that it wili drop still further
to only 3.8 per cent in the last half of the year. Even these
forecasts could be reduced if the OPEC countries, which arc
meeting this week in Qatar-i believe tomorrow-should
decide upon an increase of greater than 10 per cent in the price

of oil exports.
* (1510)

Understandably, energy, oil prices and the security of the
supply of oil were prominent in the discussions. In response to
continuing price increases for oil, France has adopted a policy
of freezing its national annual total cost of oil imports, irrespective of price increases. In other words, while the price may
increase, the quantity of imported oil will diminish accordingly. This policy is serving the dual purpose of stemming the
outflow of French currency during this difficult economic
period and, at the same time, encouraging serious conservation
measures in energy consumption. France is endeavouring to
convince her partners in the European Community to adopt
the same policy. In the short-run, at least, this policy would
appear to be constructive, and may sound a cautionary note to
the OPEC leaders. It is to be hoped that the more moderate
OPEC nations, such as Saudi Arabia, will be strengthened in
holding the increase to a reasonably acceptable level.
Related to the price of oil is the continuing proposition by
some for the establishment of floor prices for other raw
materiais, referred to as "minimum safeguard prices." This
would require that no nation would resell designated raw
materials at less than the established minimum safeguard
price. Delegates from the United Kingdom argued strongly for
a minimum safeguard price of $7 per barrel for oil itself. This
is the approximate exploration-production cost of their North
Sea oil. They stressed their need for such an accepted floor
price to assist in financing the continuing development of their
oil reserves. This proposal received little support. The whole
proposition of floor prices for designated raw materials was
shot down as being incompatible with freer trade and free
enterprise, and a further cause of friction between First World
and Third World nations. The establishment of numerous new
price cartels to offset the effects of the aggravating oil price
cartel is not an acceptable solution.
Before leaving the reference to oil and OPEC, it should be
noted that OPEC's surplus is rising again, and that petrodollars are playing a major role in the world economy. It is
estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of the surplus is invested as
deposits in foreign currencies, with ail of the unsettling ramifications that presents. Of ail the OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia
has shown, thus far, a high degree of constructive responsibility in the handling of its new financial power. It must be noted,
however, that during the rapid slide of the British pound there
was reportedly a large sell-off of sterling by some members of
OPEC, which added immeasurably to the crisis.
Although West-East trade bas not yet reached any substantial level relative to total world trade, there is a growing
concern that care must be taken by the West in the further
development of such trade. The view was expressed that, as the

December 14, 1976

West provides the USSR with cereals and technology on
long-terni credit, Russia can release manpower and resources
to increase the speed of ber already rapid build-up of conventional arms and forces. At the same time, Western Europe has
been increasing her importation from the East of raw materials and energy. This trend is causing serious concern to
those who fear too great a dependency on these sources and
the future possibility of political blackmail.
There is a growing awareness that western nations must
define and co-ordinate their economic policies in accordance
with their own long-term interests, vis-à-vis the Soviet bloc.
This view is held by many, who also believe that the Soviet
bloc nations are already waging economic war against the
West, that the massive build-up of conventional arms and
forces in the East is designed, not as a shooting war plan, but
with the purpose of forcing tremendous military expenditures
upon western nations during a period of economic stress. The
end result of that scenario would be economic disarray within
the western nations, with consequent take-over, in ideological
terms, by the communist bloc in a piecemeal, peaceful fashion,
without the necessity for a shooting war.
Other serious discussions within the Economic Committec
included new ground rules for multi-national corporations; the
International Monetary Fund, of course; floating exchange
rates versus fixed but adjustable rates, with the usual strong
differences of view; the new north-south dialogue between the
EEC and the developing nations of Africa and the Middle
East; the "new world economic order"; and aid programs as
proposed by the Group of 77.
There was also intense interest, expressed in private conversations, in the election of Le Parti Québécois in the Quebec
elections that occurred while we were in Williamsburg. Some
delegates from European nations appeared to believe this
meant the immediate break-up of Canada, but Canadian
delegates were careful to explain that this was not the case.
Some delegates expressed concern over the proposed take-over
of the potash industry in Saskatchewan as a sign of developing
instability in this nation for secure foreign investment.
Honourable senators, ail of these subjects could be discussed
at length, but I have wearied you long enough with this report.
Let me conclude by saying that it is largely through NATO
that peace has been maintained in Western Europe, that
powder keg of history, since World War Il. Continuing peace,
or at least the absence of war, in that part of the worid will
depend upon the will and the resolve of member nations to
keep NATO strong. December 7 last week was the thirty-fifth
anniversary of Pearl Harbour, a reminder that the nations of
the Western World must remain prepared and alert.
In a recently published interview, His Royal Highness, the
Duke of Edinburgh, said:
If you would keep the peace ... prepare for war.

Honourable senators, Canada, the Canadian Parliament and
the Canadian people must continue to give strong and effective
support to NATO as our shield against aggression in the cause
of peace.
On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

CANADA-UNITED STATES RELATIONS
DIVERSION OF WATER FROM LAKE MICHIGAN-QUESTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I should like to ask
the Leader of the Government a question about the diversion
of water from Lake Michigan through the Chicago drainage
canal into the Mississippi system, which is an issue in CanadaUnited States relations which has existed for some 70 years
now.
The leader is no doubt aware that in the final session of the
last Congress a bill was passed authorizing officials in the
State of Illinois to divert waters at their discretion. Has the
Canadian government made representations to the United
States government in terms of that domestic United States law
and its operation, and does our government apprehend any
serious effect downstream on Canadian navigation as a result
of higher than ever levels of diversion into the Mississippi
system?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, because of the technical and detailed nature of the question, I shall take it as
notice.

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I take this
opportunity to welcome Senator Côté back to the chamber. He
has been in hospital but is now restored to his usual buoyant
good health.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: We are pleased to see him back.
Honourable senators, I have had a further report about the
condition of one of our other colleagues, Senator McDonald.
An Hon. Senator: Which one?
Senator Perrault: Senator A. H. McDonald. We have one
Macdonald here who is in excellent health, but the government
supporter McDonald, as honourable senators are aware, last

HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE

MOTION TO AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO STUDY CAUSES OF
PERSONALITY DISORDERS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOURDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, December 9, the
debate on the motion of Senator McGrand:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon such experiences in prenatal life and early childhood
as may cause personality disorders or criminal behaviour
in later life and to consider and recommend such remedial
and preventative measures relating thereto as may be
reasonably expected to lead to a reduction in the Incidence of crime and violence in society;
That the committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical and clerical personnel as may
be required for the purpose of the inquiry; and
That the committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate.
[Translation]
Hon. Martial Asselin: Honourable senators, last year Senator McGrand proposed to the Senate a motion nearly similar
to this one, except that Senator McGrand asked that his
motion be studied by a special Senate committee. This year,
Senator McGrand has amended his motion and is asking for
the Senate Committee on Health, Welfare, and Science to be
authorized to inquire into and report upon such experiences in
prenatal life and early childhood as may cause personality
disorders, and so on.
I think it is normal for a member of the official opposition to
take part in this debate. Of course, the motion proposed by
Senator McGrand deserves some attention in our opinion since
it concerns a serious social problem which causes among
Canadians increasing anxiety about violence. However, as a
member of the official opposition, I tried to make an in-depth
study of these questions. But as I am not an expert on the
subject, i consulted authors who have touched on this matter. i
also enlisted the help of the parliamentary library researchers,
who were of great assistance in preparing the few comments
that I would like to submit to you.
In my opinion, the whole problem submitted by Senator
McGrand can be summarized as the problem of violence and
crime that we have faced in our society, especially in the last
ten years. Every day, every newspaper and every radio or
television news bulletin mentions acts of violence committed in
Canada or elsewhere. Whether they be wars, guerilla actions,
acts of terrorism, murders, thefts, rapes, or other crimes that
we hear about, this violence, as we all know, is deplored by the
responsible members of our society.
Honourable senators, because of rising violence in our society, some say that like all animals in the universe, man is born
with an innate and instinctive violence, which has given rise to
the saying that "Man is a wolf for man". However, scientific
studies conducted by various ethologists, anthropologists and
sociologists over a period of several decades have clearly shown

December 15, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

that the saying I have just quoted-"Man is a wolf for
man"-is quite unfounded.
Indeed, not only is man not violent by himself, but the
animals themselves, with a few exceptions, detest crime. Moreover, experiments have shown that the behaviour of animals is
very different if they live in society with man. On the one
hand, fights are strictly symbolical and rarely cause the death
of the loser. Fights are limited to intimidating manoeuvers
which are more spectacular than dangerous. On the other
hand, the moment a new motive appears as the determination
of social rank among a pack of wolves, as you know there is a
fight, but it does not end in the death of the loser-he either
submits or departs. There are those who will say that the
behaviour of wolves has no parallel in human beings and that
man is the only social animal whose nature is essentially and
fundamentally violent.
Although it is impossible to study all societies which have
existed in the past, since some of them have already disappeared, the work of anthropologist Margaret Mead shows that
the Arapesh tribe of New Guinea manifests an extreme sensitivity and a complete ignorance of aggressive behaviour while
the Mundugumor tribe, living some 200 miles away, are rather
aggressive, hateful and selfish.
Confronted by these two types of individuals, that is those
whose behaviour does not reflect violence or aggressiveness
and those who show the opposite characteristics, we ask ourselves why, in one given society, the behaviour is aggressive
and violent whereas it is rather peaceful and non violent in
another. Moreover, why should certain individuals in our
society be or become violent when others are peaceful?
This line of thought brings us to consider three factors
which I believe are at the root of criminal or violent behaviour.
Since I shall be restricting this enumeration to social factors
only, I will let experts such as Senator McGrand and others
who have studied genetics present the results of their biological
studies.
A first factor would be the stress imposed on a pregnant
woman, as we have seen in so many cases, and the occurrences
which could affect the normal development of the foetus.
Indeed, experiments conducted on laboratory animals show
that there can be behavioural defects in the progeny of a
female who has been subjected to stress while pregnant.
On that subject I would suggest you read "The Modern
Perspective in International Child Psychiatry" by J. G.
Howells, a book published in 1971 in New York, where a
demonstration of this can be found.
Also, there is evidence that children were born from women
having suffered from psychological stress while pregnant. In
the first instance, the shock was caused by the pregnant
woman witnessing an accident where a child was crushed by
an automobile.
I myself witnessed such an occurrence. The wife of a friend
sitting on ber balcony saw an automobile run over ber child in
the street. She became insane and is still very much affected. I
believe it was enough for the pregnant woman, seeing ber child

killed in a car accident, to be mentally affected for the rest of
her life. In a second case, an expectant mother learnt that her
husband had been injured. In a third case, a pregnant mother
had to flee ber country for political reasons. That theory is to
be found in J. G. Howells' book I was referring to.
It should be noted that the studies I have just mentioned do
not prove a necessary link between the shock and the birth of
an abnormal child. Simply, scientists came to that conclusion
because there were no other possible explanations.
A second factor would be the lack of social relationships and
especially normal family relationships during adolescence,
because of poor families, broken-down marriages, parents that
barely bear one another, consumer society couples that get
together then separate.

•

(1420)

Because the family with its well-established father and
mother relationship and its naming system is the only social
structure that all men know from birth, this shows how
important it can be on any individual's behaviour. A survey
among prisoners in the Cowansville institution indicated 87
percent had experienced a significant lack of social or family
relationships while young. This study appeared in La Gazette
Pénitentiaire, a Cowansville inmate publication, of October
1976, volume 2, page 12.
A third factor would be the loneliness found in large cities.
The crowding of human beings in large urban centres is
mainly responsible for the blurring of visual and physical
contacts caused by speed and an ever-increasing number of
superimposed faces. City dwellers are therefore forced to live
anonymously and inhibit every feeling for people. Subject to
loneliness or being deprived of physical and social relationships, man, like any other mature mammal, suffers serious
deficiencies as regards his social, emotional and intellectual
adjustment. This phenomenon was demonstrated among male
animals in which a lack of social relationship resulted in
aggressiveness, whereas among the female group a mainly
bio-chemical change took place together with higher sensitivity
to some pharmaceutical substances. It has thus been shown
that monkeys which have been severed from their social environment-that is to say, isolated-tend to become depressive,
to retire within themselves and behave in an antisocial way
when they are back among their fellow-monkeys. When
brought up in a poor environment female monkeys become
callous and take no interest in their offspring.
As far as man is concerned, many experts have demonstrated how the lack of physical and emotional relationship disrupts
the communication of sensorial messages that are coordinated
by his brain. The first effect is that there is a sharp decrease in
the use of D-Glucose by the system which resuits in increased
renewed aggressiveness and of course hypersensitiveness of the
nervous system. A second effect is the depressive state which
first appears as a reaction which seems to be the opposite of
aggressiveness but which actually stems from the same
deficiency.

SENATE DEBATES
If isolation or anonymity is a serious reason for aggressiveness and a depressive state, what about our present penal
system which is seriously deficient as regards normal social
relationship? Although it is impossible at present to get rid of
the prison system, some recommendations in this regard are
made in the brief of a task force on the role of private services
operating in the field of criminal justice, which is entitled "La
Criminalité: responsabilité communautaire". I think honourable senators received recently this very interesting report,
prepared by a group of criminologists, which makes recommendations to the government regarding isolation in our penitentiaries. The recommendations made by the task force read
as follows:
First, according to them, we should ensure the operation of
half-way homes for the benefit of offenders and former offenders. In addition, we should encourage the community to follow
a new and innovating approach to help offenders get reinstated
in society.
Second, it would be necessary, through a post-imprisonment
action, to help create a warm community environment for
former offenders to ease their rehabilitation.
If the Senate should decide to refer this matter to the Senate
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science, what should this
committee do about this research? In my opinion, it should get
back to the discussion of tensions which a pregnant woman
undergoes because this is, of course, the purpose of Senator
McGrand's motion, and the events which would affect the
normal growth of the foetus.
In addition, it would be proper to consider the second and
third factors mentioned earlier and see whether experts found
some relation between those two factors and violent and
criminal behaviour.
Finally, if no research has been donc about the last two
factors, loss of social contacts and isolation or loneliness, or
even other factors, the committee could recommend that the
government fund the research in that area because of the costs
involved. Furthermore, an association of the public and private
sectors should be set up to keep some objectivity in the
research. That way, the government would be responsible for
certain aspects of the research, such as the collection of
statistics, while universities and other private research centres
would be responsible for the other aspects.
The government should recognize the need for independent
research facilities and take part in their financing since financing through grants to particular enterprises is uncertain. As to
the support of research by the government, it should take the
form of a commitment. It is hard to suggest a specific amount
but an amount of one per cent of all expenditures involved in
criminal justice would be in line with the recommendations
expressed in other endeavours.
Finally, in order to help establish an association of the
public and private sectors and maintain the objectivity of
research on criminal justice, the government should approve
the creation of an advisory committee on research including
representatives of the private sectors and organizations.

December 15, 1976

I am not empowered on behalf of the official opposition to
say that we agree to refer this motion to the Senate Committee
on Health, Welfare and Science. As I said in my findings, I
wonder whether this committee really has the means to consider thoroughly the purposes of a motion such as that submitted
by Senator McGrand. Obviously, if the Senate were to decide
not to refer this matter to the Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science, I think we might endorse the recommendations I just made in conclusion; that is to say, urge the
government to make grants for research purposes to independent and qualified groups which could thoroughly consider the
matter raised by the senator and, by doing so, contribute, in
my opinion, to a reduction of the violence and criminality
which now plague our society.

TRANSPORTATION
EFFECT ON DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CANADA--MOTION TO
REFER SUBJECT MATTER TO TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Bonnell seconded by the Honourable Senator
Norrie. that the subject matter of the inquiry of the
Honourable Senator Bonnell calling the attention of the
Senate to transportation in Canada, whether by land, by
air or by sea, especially as it affects the different regions
of Canada be referred to the Standing Senate Committee
on Transport and Communications.-(Honourable
Senator Langlois).
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I am pleased to
yield to Senator Bell.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. A. E. Haddon Bell: Thank you, Senator Langlois.
Honourable senators, I should like to take this opportunity,
first of all, to welcome our new senator. Senator Marchand is
best described by three Vs-volatile, vocal and vital and an
undoubted patriot. Bienvenue et félicitations.
I should also like to welcome Senator Steuart who adds to
the Saskatchewan representation here a very welcome and
well-known background in areas that we are concerned with.
We also welcome him as one of our 24 plus one-because we
have the Yukon senator-from the west. I think that we
sometimes overlook the fact that our institution is set up in
such a way that there are 24 western senators, 24 from
Ontario, 24 from Quebec and 24 from the maritimes. This was
to be the balance no matter how the population should develop. Now we have 24 plus six from the Atlantic provinces,
and 24 plus one from the western provinces. So, welcome
Senator Steuart.

December 15, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

I rise today to support Senator Bonnell's motion that we
refer the subject of transportation in Canada to the Standing
Senate Committee on Transport and Communications, and I
concur in his opinion that transportation is one of the most
important issues in Canada today, that it constitutes a
common bond making for stronger national unity if a proper
and equitable transportation policy can be implemented.
Senator Bonnell also stated in his speech on December 8
that the Senate must become actively involved in protecting
regional rights in this country, and consequently the subject
matter of the inquiry should be referred to our standing
committee. There are three aspects of transport which should
receive our immediate attention. The first is in the context of
national policy; the second is how this policy could be developed to serve best the national interest; and the third is the
long range probabilities in transport development, and the
strategic role of transport technology.
If we did such a study I think we would overcome the
problem of being blind-sided by some piecemeal legislation,
because we would have a broader background upon which to
make our decisions. As an example of this I would point out
that last spring I was most alarmed with the implications of a
proposed measure, Bill C-61, which would have confined
shipping between Canadian ports to Canadian vessels without
due regard to the impact on the various sections of our
economy. An example of that would be the forest industry
shipments from British Columbia to ports in eastern Canada.
This would undoubtedly have raised the price of forest products at a time when the whole industry in Canada is in difficult
straits. It would have also removed the competitive edge which
Canada enjoys at the moment in respect of shipping to American ports.
Another example of the difficulties that could have bit other
parts of the economy if the shipping bill had been enacted
would be the removal of the threat of competition to rail
transport. In other words, this possibility of shipping more
cheaply by water does hold the rail freight rates down. There
are other examples such as this, but that is one I wanted to
bring to your attention because like the phoenix it may rise
again.
* (1440)

On December 7, Paul St. Pierre, the former member of
Parliament for Coast-Chilcotin, and a well-known columnist in
British Columbia, wrote in the Vancouver Sun:
Transport, a sluggish monster, ostensibly controlling
everything from multi-million dollar airports to 18-foot
pleasure boat floats, should become two, if not three,
ministries.
While chatting with several of my colleagues from the other
place a week or two ago, I heard one, pointing his finger at the
other, say, "You should be minister of transport," and the
other respond plaintively, "Why do you hate me?"
It seems to me that the expertise one of our former ministers
of transport, who is now with us in this chamber, could lend to
such an inquiry-informing us as to some of the difficulties

faced by, and the background of, this sluggish, unwieldy
monster that the Department of Transport is, according to
Paul St. Pierre-would be most helpful. There are many
transportation problems which need solution. They will continue to be considered on an ad hoc basis until we ask ourselves
this question, and answer it: Is transportation a component of
national development, a tool to be used for economic growth,
social development and political unification; or is transportation to be considered in isolation in a narrow boundary of
direct cost benefit?
I notice that the new annual report of the Department of
Transport bas just come out, and when we consider the
recommendations in it, and the framework of the introduction
to it, it seems that it is doing all of the things that we would
want to have done. That, then, is something we should look
into, in order to see how the actual implementation is being
carried out.
Transportation was a condition of Confederation for most
provinces. For example, the first Canadian transcontinental
railway was built in fulfilment of a promise to British
Columbia for joining the Dominion in 1871. Transportation
today is still a real, vital force in our union.
Last April, when Senator Bonnell brought to our attention
the transportation problems facing the Atlantic provinces,
several honourable senators took part in the debate and added
a great deal to the fund of knowledge on that question.
Senators Phillips, Rowe, Duggan, Macdonald, Forsey, and
McDonald all contributed to that debate, and Senator Forsey
formally moved, seconded by Senator Norrie, that the subject
be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport
and Communications.
In this new session of Parliament we can no longer put off
coming to grips with Canada's transportation policy. Something that we sometimes forget, but which is a basic part of
our country's makeup, is that we are a trading nation with a
resource-based economy. We harvest our resources and we
have to move them somewhere. Whether they be animal,
vegetable or mineral, our resources have no value until they
are developed and moved to the users. Besides the obvious
economic considerations implicit in that, there are important
social considerations which will be much more difficult to
evaluate in terms of dollars and cents, but I think our committee should try.
Sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act,
relating to transportation, specifically give the provinces jurisdiction over intraprovincial transportation. However, there are
certain exceptions enumerated which give to the Dominion
government jurisdiction within a province, including works
which it declares to be for the general advantage of Canada or
two or more provinces.
If I may make an aside with respect to British Columbia's
joining Confederation, section 4 of the schedule to the Order
in Council provides for the Dominion government's maintaining a maritime link between Victoria and San Francisco
fortnightly, and maintaining a twice-a-week ferry service be-

SENATE DEBATES
tween Olympia, in the state of Washington, and Victoria. I
should point out that the ships were to carry mail, freight and
passengers. We have not held the federal government to that
promise, but today British Columbia does have a large provincially-owned ferry system, the construction of which was 60
per cent financed by the federal government. It is not federally
subsidized, however.
Senator Bonnell, on the other hand, brought out an important point in his speech on the necessity for an equitable
national transportation system, and with regard to that I must
point out that the British Columbia ferry system is subsidized
only by the people of British Columbia. It is not a money-makng proposition.
With respect to an equitable transportation system, Norman
Hacking wrote just recently, in the business section of the
Vancouver Province, that the forecast of federal expenditures
for ferry subsidies on the east coast for 1976-77 is $107,820,000, which is pretty close to a subsidy of $108 million. On the
other hand, the estimated expenditure for subsidizing shipping
on the west coast is only $2,450,000. That federal subsidy goes
toward developments on the northwestern coast of British
Columbia, and to various other transportation efforts that do
need it. But there is quite a difference, quite a discrepancy.
Another thing which interested me was that the East Coast
Marine and Ferry Service, which, I gather, is a crown corporation operating and running the ferry system in the Atlantic
area, does not pay any sales tax on fuel or other items like
that. It does not pay Board of Steamship Inspection fees. In
contrast to that, the federal sales tax payments alone cost the
British Columbia ferry system more than $1 million last year.
This disparity should be looked into by our committee. Is this
good for our national transportation policy?
On November 2 Senator Austin asked the Leader of the
Government four important questions regarding the abrupt
withdrawal by the Department of Transport of subsidies from
the British Columbia coast-subsidies which have been relied
upon for a long time. The Leader of the Government responded at length on November 18, and gave us a clear picture of
the situation as it existed then. However, it is obvious, as the
Minister of Transport has in fact admitted, that the federal
transportation policy with respect to western British Columbia
leaves something to be desired.
Inscribed on the inside of my bracelet are these words:
Silentum in Senatu est vitium.
I think freely translated that means:
To keep silent in the Senate is reprehensible.
With that in mind, I feel I cannot keep silent about the
disastrous bungle which has been made of west coast
transportation.

I have had a map distributed to honourable senators. One
can see on it the number of inlets, rivers, ports, and islands
which must be served between Alaska and the State of Washington. It is an extremely difficult problem even from an
administrative point of view to provide an adequate transporta-

December 15, 1976

tion system in that area. As of the end of this month, twothirds of British Columbia's coastal communities will be without suitable passenger and freight service. Their transportation
lifeline will be removed. Deliveries of mail and household and
commercial supplies will be left to the vagaries of weather and
equipment. Illness and accident victims will have to rely on
often unscheduled air transport, and this is in communities
where, at this time of year, the flying time is limited to eight
hours or less a day. The aircraft servicing these communities
must fly by visual flight rules. Even the scheduled service
which serves the Queen Charlotte Islands finds it difficult to
maintain its service because of fog, gales, and so forth.
Port Stewart and the Portland Canal are on the left-hand
side of the map; then there is Masset at the north end of the
Queen Charlotte Islands, Rivers Inlet on the mainland and,
north of Rivers Inlet, Ocean Falls. These are the communities
which will suffer the most as a result of the abandonment of
the federal government subsidy to the ferry and freight transportation system on the west coast.
The problem is that there is no adequate alternate plan. The
main shipping transport now between Prince Rupert on the
mainland and Masset at the north end of the Queen Charlotte
Islands is the Malibu Princess, a vessel leased by a tug and
barge company, which felt it could take over this operation
without a subsidy. The Malibu Princess used to be known as
the "carol" ship. It made its way around Vancouver harbour
during the Christmas season carrying different choirs. I am
confident that it will not remain in service too long. It does not
have the capacity to transport cars or trucks. The result is that
anyone wanting to travel between the mainland and the Queen
Charlotte Islands must do so by Pacific Western Airlines and
then wait a day or two for his car or truck to be transported by
barge. The result is that in addition to the higher cost of
travelling by air, one must then incur the cost of hotel accommodation while awaiting the arrival of one's car. It is a very
unsatisfactory situation. But that is not the worst of it. I
should like to quote an officer who had charge of the Malibu
Princessfor four years, a man who is thoroughly familiar with
Hecate Strait, which is where the Malibu Princess is being
utilized. He said:
The vessel was specifically designed to carry young
people to a summer camp on the most sheltered waters of
Georgia Strait. She was never intended to cope with
anything but the mildest weather conditions.
Hecate Strait is one of the most vicious and unpredictable areas of water around our coast.
He ended his remarks by saying:
... this statement is made from a very real concern for
the inability of the Malibu Princess to provide either
comfort or convenience to our northern residents; and a
very grave concern for their safety.
Why do we find ourselves in this position in British
Columbia? According to the British North America Act,
transportation is a provincial concern. The federal government
has subsidized this northern freight shipping service with

December 15, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

several steamship freighters. In addition, there was another
shipping service, unsubsidized, south of Masset, which ran
between Rivers Inlet and Ocean Falls and to Howe Sound,
serving about 5,000 people in 100 different communities, and
it served those people very well for 22 years, despite not having
sufficient funds to cope with high costs or competition from
subsidized outfits. It applied for subsidy but was refused after
eight months of waiting, and as a result it will have to go out
of business. That is another reason why we are faced with so
many frightful transportation difficulties on the west coast. I
should like to add that the situation, because of some very
hard work on the part of four cabinet ministers and the entire
B.C. Liberal caucus, has been rectified somewhat.
But that is not good enough for a national transportation
policy, which is why I bring it to the attention of the Senate
now. It is alarming that three years of consultation had gone
on, as the Leader of the Government reported to the Senate on
November 18 last, and yet none of the affected members of
Parliament had been consulted, none of the provincial MLAs
had been consulted, and none of the town councillors. Where
was the consultation? It must have been departmental officials
talking to each other. The residents of British Columbia's
coastal communities are not at all interested in which government is responsible. They are completely exasperated and
dismayed with the situation. But until a rational transportation
system is worked out, let them at least continue to hear the
friendly whistle of a safe ship.
We should regard our oceans and our navigable waters as
maintenance-free highways of commerce, and not as something that blocks us from development. Let us learn to use our
navigable waters and oceans more effectively.
There are many other problems which we will have to
consider in studying a national transportation policy. I should
like to just briefly enumerate some of them. One of the world's
best airlines, Canadian Pacific Airlines, with its head office in
British Columbia, has been boxed into a "heads I win, tails
you lose" situation with regard to international and domestic
air routes. Apparently there is a lack of comprehension about
competition in the field of transportation. Is competition
domestic, or is competition in Canada competing with the rest
of the world?
Another aspect of transportation is strikes, which is something Senator Buckwold raised when he spoke to us regarding
the Finkleman report. We should be reminded by Senator
Buckwold's remarks of the number of times we have had to
legislate an end to strikes in the field of transportation. We are
also faced with the disastrous results of illegal strikes. As was
evident from the illegal airport firemen's strike some time ago,
there is apparently no remedy in law for the innocent third
party in such an illegal strike. All these areas should be of
concern to the committee in considering a transportation
policy.

The abandonment of passenger and freight service by railways is in need of our immediate attention. It is receiving
everybody else's attention so it had better receive ours. We
must consider also the problems created by turning scarce
agricultural land into bands of concrete for highways and
runways.

And what are the transportation needs of ranchers and
farmers with relation to problems of getting their produce to
market and obtaining their feed, fertilizer and machinery? The
productive, self-reliant, industrious people in remote areas
such as British Columbia's northwest coast, which we have just
been discussing-the Cariboo, Peace River and the Chilcotin-pay taxes as do city dwellers. They ask for very little.
Surely it is common sense to see that they are supplied with
transportation and communications. If they are not, what is
the alternative? Should they give up and crowd into the cities
to join the faceless, depressed and hopeless throng?
The Prime Minister has said, "Poverty is to be without
hope." Shall we sentence these rugged, independent Canadians
to that type of poverty for lack of a rational transportation
system? These pioneers are few in number, and do not represent huge voting blocs; nevertheless, they are the people whom
the Senate has been specifically charged to represent. I can
think of no other comparable forum where their transportation
problems can be aired. Let us not avoid this responsibility.
I support the motion of Senator Bonnell.

is put, I should like to raise a point and ask a question of the

December 16, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Leader of the Government. He bas said nothing about the
possibility of the other place adjourning for the Christmas
recess tomorrow. I wonder whether the question should be put
now or whether it should be delayed until a little later this
afternoon in case the House of Commons should adjourn for
the Christmas recess tomorrow rather than next week.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I think this matter
should be dealt with after the question has been put. The
motion could always be withdrawn or postponed. I don't mind
speaking at this time, but according to proper procedure I
think the question should be put before the Leader of the
Government makes his statement. As far as I'm concerned, I
would prefer that Madam Speaker put the question and then I
shall have a few things to say about the matter.
The Hon. the Speaker: With leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(1)(g), it is moved by the Honourable
Senator Perrault, P.C., seconded by the Honourable Senator
Petten, that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Monday next, December 20, 1976, at 8 o'clock
in the evening.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I think what Senator
McIlraith has in mind is the possibility that the House of
Commons might terminate its work tomorrow evening and
then adjourn for the Christmas recess. The problem is that we
are not too sure that that will happen. But even if it did, and if
Bill C-19 and Bill C-22 did come to us tomorrow, in order to
have the Senate complete its work at the same time as the
House of Commons we would have to dispose of these bills in
less than an hour. In view of these circumstances and because
of the uncertainty involved, I think that the motion made by
the Leader of the Government is the practical solution. I
intensely dislike to see the Senate waiting around for bills that
might be sent to us. The House of Commons can come back
for royal assent next Tuesday or Wednesday when we have
finished with the bills they will have sent us. In any event,
since we shall not likely accomplish anything tomorrow, just to
wait around would be simply incompatible with the dignity of
the Senate and the respect we have for the processes commonly followed here. As has been indicated by the leader, many
senators have made plans to be away tomorrow and they may
not be able to stay. Therefore, I think the normal thing to do is
to come back on Monday evening, whatever happens. I'm sure
the House of Commons can send a corporal's guard, as they
did last night, for any royal assent next week, even if they
recess for all practical purposes tomorrow night. Therefore, in
view of the circumstances, I think the motion is one that
should be carried.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I respond to
some of the statements which have been made. On the basis of
information made available to me, and after discussion with
the house leader in the other place, the odds do not favour the
passage of Bill C-22 tomorrow. There is such a possibility, but
that is all that can be said at the moment. Honourable senators
in opposition here have indicated to me that they think the

chances may be rather slim that it will be passed tomorrow. I
agree with Senator Flynn that to have the Senate remain here
to await the possible passage of Bill C-19 and Bill C-22 in the
other place would really be an imposition so far as senators are
concerned in their travel plans. It is difficult to obtain plane
reservations at this particular time, and such uncertainty
would not be conducive to the kind of careful consideration we
like to give to the work placed before us. Moreover, we would
be very much open to public criticism if we hurried through an
important bill such as Bill C-22, despite the fact that it bas
been given considerable pre-study by honourable senators. We
would be open to criticism as well if we rushed through Bill
C-19, the government restraint bill, although most of the
arguments have been assembled for the debate on that.
Therefore, I rather think we should look forward to royal
assent on either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. In that
way we can give these bills the kind of consideration they
deserve. In saying that, I hope honourable senators will feel
able to support the motion I am placing before the chamber.
Senator McIlraith: Honourable senators, I should clear up
an obvious misunderstanding on the part of the government
leader. I was asking him a question as to whether or not, in
formulating the motion he presented here, he had considered
the possibility of the other place finishing its business on
Friday of this week. I was not advocating that the Senate
should stay here and attempt to finish its business tomorrow
night. I was simply asking a question in order to obtain
information.
Senator Perrault: Yes, that possibility is contemplated and
that possibility was known before the motion was formulated.
Senator McIlraith: I am not advocating that we try to finish
our business tomorrow.
Senator Perrault: I appreciate that clarification. There is
the possibility that the House of Commons will adjourn for the
recess tomorrow, but not a strong possibility as of information
received five minutes ago.
Senator Flynn: Just to clarify the situation for the Senate, I
understand that the government requires only the passage of
Bill C-19 and Bill C-22 before the Christmas recess.
Senator Perrault: That is correct. There is no other business.
Senator Flynn: No other business being required of us, in
the normal course we should be able to finish on either
Tuesday or Wednesday, according to the circumstances.
Senator Perrault: That is correct.
Motion agreed to.

TRANSPORTATION
EFFECT ON DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CANADA-MOTION TO
REFER SUBJECT MATTER TO TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Bonnell seconded by the Honourable Senator
Norrie, that the subject matter of the inquiry of the
Honourable Senator Bonnell calling the attention of the
Senate to transportation in Canada, whether by land, by
air or by sea, especially as it affects the different regions
of Canada, be referred to the Standing Senate Committee
on Transport and Communications.-(HonourableSenator Petten).
Senator Petten: Honourable senators, I yield to Senator
Buckwold.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, when the
question of transportation is raised in this house it is almost
automatic that someone from Saskatchewan will immediately

December 16, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

rise and respond to the challenge of this very important
subject.
Senator Flynn: Who else but Senator Buckwold should be
first?
Senator Buckwold: But that is to be expected, since you
have been waiting with bated breath for the words of wisdom
that might come from this side. At this time of year I am not
quite sure what bated breath is.
Honourable senators, I stand in some humility to talk on
this subject when we have in our chamber a former distinguished Minister of Transport in the person of Senator Marchand, who I hope will in due course participate in this debate,
a man who has become exceptionally knowledgeable on this
very complex subject. I hope he will forgive me for any
omissions I may make, but transportation is so important to
my part of the country that I feel it necessary to comment on
the motion moved by Senator Bonnell.
First, may I remind the bouse that Senator Bonnell rose to
call "the attention of the Senate to transportation in Canada,
whether by land, by air or by sea, especially as it affects the
different regions of Canada," and he moved that the subject
matter be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Transport and Communications. I think the motion is to be
commended, if only because of its motherhood aspect. If I
were Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications I would find it difficult to know just
how to handle an involved subject such as land, sea and air
transportation in all parts of Canada.
Without in any way commenting on the advisability of the
motion, I hope that before it is referred to the committee it
will be refined in a practical way so that the committee can
deal with it in a meaningful manner. I say this because for
western Canada the number of studies of commissions and
inquiries that have taken place during the last 50 years would
number, I suppose, into the hundreds. We have had major
commissions. One of the latest, back in 1959-60, was the
MacPherson Commission, which produced very comprehensive
documentation on grain costing procedures and established
many of the basic costing principles that are incorporated in
the Snavely report, which I will refer to in some detail during
the course of my remarks.
Studies are now going on. There is the Hall inquiry into rail
service in western Canada, which will involve passenger services as well as consideration of rail line abandonment; there
are studies going on by the Canadian Transport Commission,
which has a committee out looking at the whole question of
rail service; and, as I have indicated, there has recently been
tabled the first volume of the report of the commission on the
costs of transporting grain by rail. I pass this on to honourable
senators, although I am sure they are well aware of it. By the
nature of the problem, the complexity of it is such that I am
concerned about how a Senate committee, if this subject
matter is referred to a Senate committee, will be able to
handle the subject.

Why are western Canadians so involved in this subject? I
suppose that we are nurtured on protesting rail rates. Because
of the influence of the railroads, whether CPR or CNR, on our
way of life, it is almost second nature that rail costs, transportation costs and rail services become a fundamental subject of
discussion in my part of the country.
It is significant that on an average over 50 per cent of total
inbound and outbound rail tonnages for Saskatchewan consists
of statutory grain movements. Because of the relatively low
revenues generated by moving statutory grain, it is common
knowledge that the railways attempt to recoup their revenues
by charging discriminatory freight rates on other general
commodity movements. For example, due to the lack of
restraining competitive forces, rail revenues per ton mile generated on the movements of certain consumer goods into
Saskatchewan points range as high as 134 per cent in excess of
the same movement to Vancouver, which benefits from the
transcontinental rate. Also, average differentials on freight
rates favouring Vancouver over Saskatchewan points range
from 35 per cent to 50 per cent on iron and steel products, and
6 per cent to 18 per cent on foodstuffs. It is not incumbent on
the average consumer and shipper in Saskatchewan to be
burdened with excessive pricing of transportation to protect
railway revenues.
We are all aware of the usual reference to illustrations of a
carload of steel going from Hamilton through Saskatoon to
Vancouver costing considerably less than if the shipment
stopped halfway, at Saskatoon. These are the kinds of things
that concern us.
In a statement by the Government of Saskatchewan on
freight rates affecting that province, the following was said:
If because, as has been stated before, the railways are
recouping from other traffic movements, losses from hauling "Crow Rate" grain irrespective of cost, it is about
time that the authorities examined the consequences of
such policy from the view point of the right of Saskatchewan to develop her resources unimpeded from discrimination in freight rates, a matter over which the province has
little direct control.

e

(1430)

It is the current policy of the federal government to
maintain the "crow" level of rates for moving grain. If, as
has been stated numerous times by the railways, revenues
obtained from the movement of grain are not compensatory, any attempt to recover lost revenues from other commodity shipments affecting Saskatchewan is greatly
impeding Saskatchewan's right to develop her other
resources.
It is common knowledge that the movement of western
grain into world markets would cease if normal rates
applied on the movement of grain to export position
without provision of some form of direct subsidy. Canada
now is competing in world grain markets with producers
who are heavily subsidized directly by their respective
governments. As the movement of western Canada grain

SENATE DEBATES
into world inarkets produces directly and indirectly such
benefits as stimulation of domestic industry and assistance in the net balance of foreign payments, it behooves
Saskatchewan that the western Canada grain producer
should not be burdened with higher freight rates to
achieve these ends. Whatever the solution is to the problem it also should not be incumbent upon the average
consumer and shipper in Saskatchewan to be burdened
with excessive pricing of transportation to protect railway
revenues.
That is a sort of general overview of the problem. Crowsnest, of course, is a subject inviolate as regards its permanency
to the average western Canadian. It is no modest task today to
get into the philosophy of Crowsnest and whether it might be
better for western Canadians to release the railways from this
particular commitment and find other ways of compensating
farmers for the loss of revenue resulting from higher freight
rates, and through direct subsidies, enable western Canada,
and the prairie region especially, to develop its secondary
industry. Western Canada today is paying the price for Crowsnest. There is no doubt about that. But, as I say, to change it is
almost like amending the Ten Commandments. We are paying
the price because it is much more economic to ship raw
materials from those areas in the prairies than produce them
and have the secondary process take place in other parts of the
country.
One of these days the whole subject will have to be carefully
reviewed in an objective way.
I am not in any way suggesting that the farmer should be
out of pocket, but the country as a whole may have to find
another way to subsidize railways in order to maintain a
proper branch line service-standards are deteriorating rapidly-and balance the books so that farmers will not be out of
pocket. That part of the country must be able to develop its
natural industries. For that reason, as part of the whole
process of finding out what the railways were losing on Crowsnest, the Government of Canada appointed a commission on
the cost of transporting grain by rail.
Perhaps I may be allowed to comment on the report. I don't
know if most senators have any idea of the cost of shipping
grain out of the prairie region. The report indicates that 16 per
cent of the revenue per ton mile of all railroads in Canada is
made up of revenue received from the shipment of grain in
western Canada. The revenue in western Canada alone, the
revenue per ton mile for traffic hauled in western Canada,
amounts to 25 per cent of the revenue of the railroads.
To give the house some idea of the immensity of the
problem, for the year 1974, which was the basic year of the
study on grain transportation costs by rail, 336,813 carloads of
grain were shipped by rail. This represented 20,589,693 tons. I
might comment that 64 per cent of it was shipped through the
port of Thunder Bay rather than ports such as Vancouver,
Victoria, or Churchill on Hudson Bay.
I have indicated that the Crowsnest costs have for many
years been a continuous issue in the west, and the commission

December 16, 1976

was asked to obtain a completely independent assessment of
the issue. That commission was known as the Snavely Commission, that being the name of the chairman. It was established in April 1975. The purpose of the inquiry was as
follows: to identify the costs and revenues to the railways of
transporting grain at statutory rates; to evaluate and assess the
adequacy of contemporary railway costing practices as set out
in Canadian Transport Commission order R-6313; to identify
and review any other railway grain costing issues; to develop a
series of typical cost profiles for different categories of prairie
railway line; and to assess the impact of moving grain under a
series of different grain handling and transportation
assumptions.
Volume 1 of the report deals with the first two items;
namely, the costs and revenues to the railways of transporting
grain, and evaluating the adequacy of contemporary railway
costing pratices.
It is an interesting document. Mr. Snavely went to great
lengths to ensure that all interested parties had ample opportunity to put forward their point of view. This was accomplished
through a series of technical committee sessions which were
followed by a more formal series of hearings. These were
undertaken in two main stages, which permitted the interested
parties to outline their positions followed by the submission of
rebuttals. A third hearing was held in order to examine more
fuily the cost of money issue. Participants in the proceedings
included representatives from all sectors of the grain handling
and transportation industry-producers, grain companies, railways and provincial governments.
The findings fall into two basic categories. First, the commission identified the costs and revenues of moving grain at
statutory rates. For the year 1974, the latest year for which
full information was available, the commission found that the
costs exceeded the revenues received from the users of the
service by $141.3 million.
The total cost to the railways of moving that grain was $231
million. The costs, by the way, included a return on capital
costs, which I believe was determined at 11.31 per cent after
taxes in the railways' net investment employed in the transportation of statutory grain. That net investment represents capital and equity investment combined.
I have indicated that the total railway cost, as determined
by the commission, was $231 million. The revenue from users
of the service, the farmers who shipped, was $89.7 million. The
revenue from the branch line subsidy, which was given to the
railroads by governments-a subsidy which was not directly
related to grain but to line improvement-was $52 million.
The revenue shortfall incurred by the railways was $89.3
million.
We now have for the first time what might be a reasonably
accurate figure of the cost to the railways.
Senator Burchill: Over what period?
Senator Buckwold: For the year 1974. There have been
many assumptions, and the railways have given certain figures
to farm organizations, to provincial governments and others,

December 16, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

and the Snavely Commission determined that the revenue
shortfall incurred by the railways was $89.3 million.
Another way of stating its findings was that for the average
ton of grain moved, the user paid $4.36, the federal government $2.52, and the railways $4.34.
That represented the first part of the commission's findings.
In the second part the commission critically examined Canadian railway costing procedures and made a series of recommendations for changes. Both the railways and the' Canadian
Transport Commission incurred a certain amount of criticism
but the report does contain a series of detailed suggestions for
improvements. The issue that is likely to be the most contentious concerns the question of constant costs. The analysis
carried out by Snavely covers long run variable cost only with
no contribution towards fixed or constant costs. The railways
will likely strongly argue that constant costs must be regarded
as a cost of remaining in business. Other issues that may be
somewhat contentious are the use of historic costs as opposed
to replacement costs for depreciation purposes and cost of
capital.

e

(1440)

The significance of all this, honourable senators, is that for
the first time the total cost to the railways of moving statutory
grain by rail has been identified and, while not all parties
agreed on the actual cost, it is significant that everybody
agreed that the railways do lose money, substantial money,
carrying grain over and above the branch line subsidy.
Honourable senators, I thought that you would be interested, in view of our discussion on transportation, in this very new
report which I think throws significant light on many of the
aspects of transportation as it affects that very important grain
industry, important not just to the prairie provinces, the
producing provinces, but important more especially to all of
Canada which benefits from the export of these important
commodities.
I make this contribution hoping that it will add to the
consideration that will be given by the committee, if a committee does consider this, and with the intention of warning the
Senate that if a committee does look at it, it might be better to
try to bring the subject into an area that can be identified and
in which some tangible results can be achieved.

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, I should like to say a
few words in support of Senator McGrand's motion that the
Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report on such experiences in prenatal
life and early childhood as may cause personality disorders or
criminal behaviour in later life.
I realize it is difficult to get people enthused about such a
motion, but it is a very important subject we are dealing with.
We should not miss any opportunity to help our young people
in the hope that they may be prevented from becoming
involved in a life of crime. Any money spent on such a
program would certainly be insignificant compared to the
long-range benefits.
Because of our changing lifestyles, the availability of drugs
and the permissive society, I feel young people with any kind
of mental problem have a much more difficult time trying to
cope than was the case even ten years ago. I really believe this
will not improve in the years to come and is more likely to get
worse.
We are very fortunate in having people such as Senator
McGrand willing and able to take on such a difficult and
worthwhile task. Since all he is asking for is our support at this
time, I certainly give mine and hope you will also support this
motion.
I really should apologize, honourable senators, for making
such a short speech, but I think I shall withhold my apologies
until such time as I make one that is too long.

PERSONAITY DISORDERS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOURDEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:

December 20, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator McGrand, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Norrie:
That the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science be authorized to inquire into and report upon
such experiences in prenatal life and early childhood as
may cause personality disorders or criminal behaviour in
later life and to consider and recommend such remedial
and preventative measures relating thereto as may be
reasonably expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of crime and violence in society;
That the committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical and clerical personnel as may

That the committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate.-(Honourable Senator Deschatelets, P.C.).
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I would ask
leave to resume the debate in place of Senator Deschatelets.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Carter: Honourable senators, my remarks will be
quite brief because I have already spoken on this subject in the
debate on Senator McGrand's earlier motion which, as some
speakers have pointed out, was similar in substance to the
motion before us. My remarks are recorded on page 1288 of
Hansard of October 21, 1975, and I do not wish to repeat
what I said on that occasion. However, one or two points have
been raised by Senator McGrand and others to which I wish to
address myself, and for the benefit of the new senators and
new readers of Hansard it might be convenient to summarize
the history of events since this subject was first introduced.
On May 14, 1975, Senator McGrand placed a motion on the
order paper: "That the Senate considers it advisable that a
special committee of the Senate be established at an early date
to inquire into and report upon the crime and violence in
contemporary Canadian society."
On December 18, 1975, the Senate referred the subject
matter of Senator McGrand's motion to the Standing Senate
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science, and instructed
the committee "to look into and report upon the feasibility of a
Senate committee inquiring into and reporting upon crime and
violence in contemporary Canadian society and that if the
committee decides that such a study is feasible and warranted
it be further instructed to set down clearly how, by whom, and
under what precise terms of reference such a study should be
undertaken."
Thus the committee's task was threefold: one, to determine
whether the study was feasible; two, to determine whether, if
feasible, such a study was warranted; and three, if found to be
feasible and warranted, to outline how and by whom and
under what terms of reference the study should be undertaken.
The committee held a number of meetings and reported
back on June 22, 1976. The report can be found on page 2242

of Hansardof that date. A motion was passed the same date to
take the report into consideration at the next sitting of the
Senate. Although as chairman of the committee I was prepared to open a debate on the report, and although the Senate
continued to sit until July 16, this item was set aside sitting
after sitting and died on the order paper when the session was
prorogued and a new session began.
In the light of the facts I have just stated, one cannot help
but infer that for some reason, which was never explained to
me, someone did not wish to have this report debated. Therefore, Senator McGrand has every reason to feel disappointed
with the treatment his earlier motion received, which should be
a matter of regret for all of us because this type of procedure
certainly does nothing to enhance the image of the Senate.
Now Senator McGrand is trying again, and he deserves congratulations, not only for his perseverence but also for the
thoughtful and scholarly speech with which he opened this
debate.
I said earlier that Senator McGrand's motion is similar in
substance to his earlier motion, but in fact it follows very
closely the terms of reference suggested in the committee's
report. The committee found and reported that a wide open
inquiry into the causes of crime and violence in Canada is
neither feasible nor warranted because the common factors
influencing crime-poverty, broken homes, unemployment,
drugs, the penal system, lack of education, vocational training,
and so on-are already well known and well documented.
However, the committee did find that there was one area
related to the causes of crime about which very little is known,
and which is engaging the attention of research specialists in
the United States, France and a number of other countries.
This area includes those influences experienced in early childhood which may lead to violent and criminal behaviour later
on.
The committee found that such a restricted inquiry was both
feasible and warranted, and suggested that the terms of reference be to inquire into and report upon what is being done, and
what further avenues of research are required to detect factors
occurring before birth or during the first three years of life
which may lead to personality difficulties or to violent behaviour in later life. This is very similar to the motion now before
us, with the exception that Senator McGrand's motion
requires the study to be carried out by the Senate Standing
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science whereas the committee suggested that it should be done by a small special
committee of eight senators.
As some senators have already pointed out, this would be a
fact-finding committee narrowly focussed on those factors
which come into play in the early years of a child's life, even
before birth, which could result in violent or criminal behaviour later on. Dr. McGrand has already outlined some of these
factors, and, as I understand it, the committee's task will be to
try and find out what information on this subject already
exists, what lines of research are being followed, what results
are being achieved or contemplated, what kind of statistics are
being compiled and so forth.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Asselin, in his excellent speech, suggested that the
government should fund research by various bodies, including
government agencies, universities and other suitable organizations. I think that is an excellent idea, and ultimately that is
where the real research will have to be done, but it seems to
me that these agencies would be able to carry out their
research more efficiently, and would get better returns for
their research dollar, if they had a body of information,
references and authorities available to them before they started. As I understand it, it would be the purpose of the committee to assemble and compile such a body of information, which
would enable them to select lines of research best suited to
their facilities, and at the same time avoid duplication and
overlapping with the work of other agencies.
a

(2020)

Incidentally, the committee had not advanced very far into
its study when it discovered that no statistics pertinent to this
study are available from Statistics Canada and, indeed, if the
statistics are to be compiled at all it would have to be done by
the provincial governments, by the hospitals in which babies
are born, and perhaps even by the family doctor and obstetrician who treated the mother during her pregnancy. It seems,
therefore, that some such inquiry as envisaged by this motion
will be necessary to enable provincial governments and hospitals, et cetera, to determine the kind of information that
should be compiled.
Honourable senators, this study proposed in Senator
McGrand's motion is of utmost importance, for two reasons.
In the first place it is an attempt to come to grips with the
causes of crime and violence, to try to get at the roots of the
problem and to have a better understanding of it, and also to
endeavour to find out what can be done to determine what
factors and what experiences in the early stages of a child's
life, before and after birth, can lead to violent and/or criminal
behaviour in later life. It is also an attempt to determine what
can be done to detect and remedy the effects of those factors
before the child's pattern of behaviour becomes crystallized.
Dr. Susan Stevenson, a Vancouver psychiatrist, has observed
that "there is no such thing as a born criminal . . . they always

come from incredibly deprived backgrounds." Dr. Elliott
Parker, a fact-finding psychiatrist at Penetanguishene and a
witness who appeared before our committee, stated, "1 accept
that in the early years of life the die is cast."
It has been recognized in recent years that babies can be
mentally ill. An article in the Globe and Mail of June 9, 1976
states as follows:
Rene Spitz of France studied war orphans in an institution, filmed suicidal one-year olds, babies so anxious to
die they succumbed to trivial infections.
The same article quotes Dr. Andrew Crowcroft, Director of
the West End Crèche, as saying:
We find that with four-year olds we are often too late.
The most therapeutic success comes in the first year or
two of life.

December 20, 1976

The motion, therefore, is aimed at preventing crime at its
source rather than dealing with it after it has become a
problem and, inasmuch as our human resources are our most
valuable resources, that fact in itself is sufficient to stress the
importance and urgency of the study.
There is a second reason, and that is the financial cost of
crime. A survey conducted in the United States several years
ago estimated that the cost of crime was around $75 billion per
year. Since then, crime has increased considerably, in both the
United States and Canada and, as Senator Asselin pointed out,
crime and violence in Canada is already a major problem and
its steady increase is becoming one of our major concerns.
Unfortunately we do not have statistics related to the cost of
crime in Canada, but using the United States statistics on a
basis proportionate to our population, and bearing in mind
that the pattern of crime in Canada is in many cases very
similar to that in the United States, the cost of crime in
Canada must be anywhere from $8 to $10 billion per year.
Honourable senators, these two reasons alone in my opinion
are sufficient to justify support for this motion.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Denis: May I ask a question of the honourable
senator? In the event that we discover what is going on in the
mind of a man who fathers a child who might be a violent
person or a criminal, what do we intend to do? I wish to know
if there is a solution, a remedy. Would we forbid such a man to
father children? I wish to know if that is the intention?
Senator Carter: I
misunderstood.

believe

my honourable

friend has

Senator Denis: No, no.
Senator Carter: You have certainly misunderstood what I
said. All I said was that this committee would carry out some
research into what is being donc. In order to find the answers
to this problem, further research must be undertaken by
someone, presumably a government agency at the provincial or
community level.
What this motion is about, as I understand it, and what this
committee will undertake, is the collation of information from
all available sources to find out what is being done, what has
already been learned about this problem in various parts of the
world, and what lines of research should be carried out; and
then to assemble that body of information and have it ready
for provincial agencies who will use it in determining, through
common lines of research, how best to provide the answer to
the question you ask.
Senator Denis: When we have done all that, what will we do
next? What will be the advantage of that inquiry if we do not
know what to do after we have the information?
Senator Carter: I do not think I can add anything to what I
have already said.
On motion of Senator Petten, for Senator Deschatelets,

SENATE DEBATES

GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES RESTRAINT BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Raymond J. Perrault moved the second reading of Bill
C-19, to amend or repeal certain statutes to enable restraint of
government expenditures.
He said: Honourable senators, you will recall that in the fall
of 1975 the government became increasingly concerned by the
accumulating evidence that federal expenditures for 1976-77
were likely to be higher than had been planned. The main
reason, of course, was the pressure of inflation, a pressure felt
by all Canadians regardless of political affiliation-the pressure of inflation on indexed transfer payments (family allowances, old age security, and the government contribution to the
unemployment insurance program) interest charges on the
debt, and departmental operating and capital costs. The government ordered a review of expenditure commitments with a
view to bringing the total outlays for 1976-77 under a ceiling
of $42,150,000,000. It was decided to cut the expenditure
commitments by $1.5 billion in order to achieve that target.
The components of the reduction are well known to members of this chamber. However, I should like to review some of
them at this time. First, the well-publicized freeze on the
salaries of members of the Senate and the House of Commons,
including ministers; the freeze on the salaries of all judges of
the Supreme Court, the Federal Court and provincial superior
courts, and also of public servants in the higher salaried
categories.
Senator Flynn: Did you say only Supreme Court judges?
Senator Perrault: The Supreme Court, the Federal Court,
and provincial superior court judges.
Senator Flynn: I thought it was a mistake when you said it
the first time. I didn't know you would repeat it.

•

(2030)

Senator Perrault: If the honourable senator has some specific questions, I will certainly endeavor to have the answers
provided for him.
Senator Flynn: I will provide the answers rather than the
questions.
Senator Perrault: To continue: a freeze was announced in
the salaries of public servants in the higher-salaried positions,
a freeze in the number of higher-salaried positions in the
public service, a reduction in the amount of money available to
pay replacements for public servants sent on language training
courses, a reduction of $30 million in expenditures on buildings, aid to the granting councils was frozen at 1975-76 levels
despite the rising costs of their clients. The budget of DREE
was also held to the amount provided for in 1975-76. The
allocations originally contemplated for loans for crown corporations and others were cut; the originally approved level for
foreign aid was reduced. There was a freeze on the number of
external affairs posts abroad. It was announced that there
would be a termination of the Opportunities for Youth Program, the agencies known as Information Canada and the
Company of Young Canadians. It was announced that there

253

would be an elimination of indexation of family allowances for
the year, and it was announced that there would be measures
to defer or to reduce loans to crown corporations or to require
them to obtain funds from the commercial sector.
The limit on growth in the public service was set at 1.5 per
cent. The net growth of 4,007 man-years allowed was distributed throughout a number of departments; emphasis, however, was placed on the need to reinforce the government's
Peace and Security Program and thereby help to improve law
enforcement services in this country.
Transportation subsidies were reduced; reductions in the
number of subsidies to industrial development were made. It
was proposed to eliminate the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Program.
Just a word about the current outlook for the country. The
ceiling of $42.150 billion was set and announced last February
when the main estimates were tabled. It included a provision
for supplementary estimates, and the realistic expectation that
events were going to occur which would require further expenditures. It can be said that with supplementary estimates
approved so far, and with the final supplementary estimates
Parliament will be asked to approve next March, there is every
prospect of staying under the ceiling barring some completely
unforeseen event. It has been possible to so order priorities
within the set limit to make additional payments to the
provinces under shared-cost programs, and, in the form of
fiscal transfers, to launch a large direct employment program,
to provide higher statutory amounts on passenger and uneconomic rail lines, and to increase the budget for housing
assistance, and to undertake other measures. The government
is considering other priority expenditure needs to be met
before the year-end, all within the expenditure ceiling established more than a year ago.
The rate of growth in expenditures for 1976-77 over 197576 will be 14 per cent at the most, down from 18 per cent the
year before and 28 per cent the year before that. The government has announced its intention to hold the growth to a still
lower figure-1 1 per cent-for the next year, and to follow the
general trend of the GNP as a matter of policy, and it is
expected that in the next fiscal year the increase in GNP will
be in the order of 10 or 11 per cent.
So I think honourable senators must agree that we appear to
be moving in the right direction as a national government.
However, to be effective a program of restraint calls for the
cooperation of all sectors of society.
Had these reductions not been imposed, the main estimates
which were tabled on February 18, 1976, would have been $1
billion higher than they were, and the capital budgets of crown
corporations which are approved by Order in Council would
have been about $1.5 billion higher. The levels of expenditure
for some of the items involved in these reductions are regulated by specific provisions in certain acts of Parliament, as
honourable senators know, and to effect the reductions it is
necessary to amend these provisions.

SENATE DEBATES
The purpose of the legislation now before us is to provide the
authority necessary to enable certain planned expenditure
reductions to be made. Perhaps I may now summarize the
intent and major provisions of Bill C-19, an act to amend or
repeal certain statutes to enable

restraint of government

expenditures.
First of all, the bill repeals sections 7 and 8 of the Adult
Occupational Training Act and substitutes new sections for
them. This change is necessary to eliminate the present statutory requirement for an automatic annual escalation of trainee
allowances in accordance with increases in the manufacturing
wage index, and to substitute a provision that would permit the
setting of these allowances by regulation without reference to
an indexing provision, subsequent to an annual ministerial
review. Under the present act, training allowances are
increased annually on July 1 in accordance with the increase in
the manufacturing wage index for the previous calendar year.
i would comment just briefly on the proposed substitution of
these new sections 7 and 8 in the Adult Occupational Training
Act. The hope was to have this measure passed earlier in the
year. Parliament in its wisdom decided that it was an important measure-which it is-and this resulted in a long debate.
Senators will recall that it had not been found possible to pass
the predecessor bill, Bill C-87, before the summer recess, so
additional expenditures of $20 million in this fiscal year were
made necessary. However, if the bill is passed now, and the
decision is taken not to further increase the allowance rates,
then an estimated saving of $20 million in 1977-78 will result,
although there will be no saving in 1976-77. In other words,
there was a requirement to make these additional payments on
July 1 because Bill C-87 had not been enshrined in statute
form. For that reason the full saving which had been contemplated is not to be realized. However, we can look forward to a
saving in excess of $20 million in the fiscal year 1977-78.
The Company of Young Canadians Act is repealed, and
provision is made for the transfer of the Company's assets and
liabilities to Her Majesty and for the Secretary of State to
administer the closing out of the Company.
Honourable senators may be interested to know that the
operations of the Company have now been completely phased
out. Its 35 local offices were closed as of March 31, 1976, and,
effective April 1, 1976, the Department of Secretary of State
assumed responsibility for a skeleton staff operation in the
Ottawa headquarters to clear up outstanding administrative
matters such as the payment of bills and transfer of documents
to the public archives, and to facilitate the financial audit
being conducted by the Auditor General. Closing-out activities
were completed by April 30, 1976.
There may be some lingering suspicion on the part of some
honourable senators that the personnel of the Company of
Young Canadians and Information Canada will be merely
transfered to other departments and as a result there will not
be a significant net saving to the taxpayers of this country. The
overall increase in public service hirings of 1.5 per cent
contemplated in this fiscal year includes any movement of

December 20, 1976

personnel from these phased-out agencies to other government
positions.

In actual fact, not all of the permanent employees of the
Company of Young Canadians, for example, have been successfully relocated in other employment. Honourable senators
may be interested to know that, by the end of the fiscal year
1975-76, 70 per cent of the permanent employees located in
Ottawa and 35 per cent of permanent employees located
outside Ottawa had found employment.
Senator Asselin: Where?
Senator Perrault: The indications were that a relatively
small number of volunteers had been placed because of difficulties in relocating from isolated rural areas.
* (2040)

We may be able to provide information with respect to the
areas of placement for the displaced personnel as a result of
the abolition of the Company of Young Canadians. However,
the movement of personnel, as I stated, is within the 1.5 per
cent increase in public service hirings for this fiscal year.
New subsections are to be added to the Family Allowances
Act, 1973, with the result that for 1976 the rates at which the
allowances will be paid will be frozen at the 1975 level. It will
be made clear that provincial rates for family allowances may
be specified by provincial regulations. The question of family
allowance rates is one which has attracted a good deal of
comment, not only in this place but throughout the country.
Honourable senators are aware, of course, that provincial
governments have certain rights in respect of family allowances, such as the right to allocate a greater or lesser amount
for older children, and a greater or lesser amount per child in
families with a number of children. Federal government payments to the provinces are made on a per capita basis for
young people from birth to 18 years of age inclusive. Other
amendments are consequential on the foregoing.
Some senators will have noted newspaper reports to the
effect that the Minister of Finance announced on December 15
that these allowances would be indexed in 1977. No government likes to cut back or restrain the indexing of payments in
such a worthwhile area of budget allocation as family allowances. Family allowances, since their creation, have been
improved upon by various governments down through the
years. Indeed, I recall that a government of another political
persuasion between 1957 and 1967 supported the family allowances program and even increased the rates which were paid
under the program. Programs such as these are important, and
it was with great regret that the government felt it necessary
to institute some restraint in this particular program, even for
one year. However, family allowances will be indexed for
1977, which is good news for the families of this country.
The Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act is
also included in the measure before us. That act is to be
repealed, and to accomplish that it must be amended to end
the period during which assistance is available for research
and development, and to provide that all applications for
grants will be cut off as of December 31, 1976. The amend-

December 20, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

ment provides that once the provisions of the act are fulfilled,
it may be repealed by proclamation of the Governor in
Council.
It was expected that the predecessor bill would result in a
saving of $45 million for the fiscal year 1976-77. That bill, of
course, because of prolonged debate in ParliamentSenator Flynn: In the other place.
Senator Perrault: Yes, in the other place. In any event, it
was not proclaimed. As a result, the expected saving was not
realized. There will be something in the order of a $15 million
phase-out cost in the fiscal year 1977-78. However, there will
be a substantial saving in fiscal 1977-78 in comparison with
this year's cost of the program of approximately $45 million.
It was found that the level of support for industrial research
and development had no relation to the absolute level of
research and development costs for companies, except for
companies undertaking this activity for the first time. It
provided limited assistance to companies which had already
reached their optimum level in research and development
programs. It had its maximum impact when the level of
economie activity and research and development was rising,
and its minimum benefit at a time of declining activity. The
government assessed the pros and cons of this particular
program and, as a result, has moved to phase out the program
completely. The program has not realized all the high expectations held for it when it was first introduced.
The next feature of Bill C-19 relates to Appropriation Act
No. 3, 1970, vote 25, Supply and Services, which was the
legislation setting up Information Canada. That vote must now
be repealed so that Information Canada may be formally
abolished.
Reference is made in Bill C-19 to the Western Grain
Stabilization Act. Section 41 of that act is being amended so
as to authorize the Minister of Finance to postpone crediting
amounts in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the stabilization
account until a later time, at which time interest would also be
credited.
There are some technical questions in this area which I
know honourable senators will wish to ask in committee should
the Senate support the motion to refer this bill to committee.
Honourable senators, may I say that the other elements of
the expenditure reduction program announced on December
18, 1975, do not require legislation since they fall within the
scope of executive action. The 1976-77 savings which will
result from the passage of Bill C-19, it is estimated, will be in
excess of $250 million.
It is not an easy task to reduce expenditures. No government
finds it a simple process to achieve maximum budget reductions. I know that the distinguished former Premier of Nova
Scotia, Senator Smith (Colchester), found it no easy task to
reduce expenditures when he was premier, and others who
have served in positions of governmental responsibility have
had the same experience.
Let me provide the Senate with a few facts by way of
summary. In 1968-69 the total federal government outlay was

$12.621 billion; by 1975-76 it had risen to $36.439 billion. The
outlay for 1968-69 represented 16.9 per cent of the gross
national product, whereas the total outlay for 1975-76 represented 21.8 per cent of the gross national product. Estimates
for the current fiscal year are not yet available.
In 1968-69, transfers to the provinces and local governments
totalled $2.49 billion; transfer payments to the provinces in
1975-76 represented $7.627 billion. The transfers to provinces
and local governments represented 3.3 per cent of the gross
national product in 1968-69, compared with 4.5 per cent in
1975-76.
Total federal government expenditures in 1968-69 amounted
to $10.128 billion, increasing to $28.812 billion in 1975-76.
Provincial government expenditures-and this is a fact which
is often omitted by those who comment on the subject of
government spending-have increased from $6.512 billion in
1968-69 to $20.619 billion in 1975-76, representing an
increase in percentage of gross national product from 5.9 per
cent in 1968-69 to 9 per cent in 1975-76. There has been a
substantially greater percentage increase, of course, in provincial expenditures during that seven-year period than was the
case at the federal level. I am not suggesting that part of that
increase was not due to certain shared-cost programs initiated
by the federal government, but we have the phenomenon, if
you wish to describe it that way, of substantially greater local
and provincial total governmental expenditures than federal
government expenditures, and the amounts seem to be increasing year by year. It seems to suggest that in order to achieve
some of our economic objectives, and particularly that of
restraint in spending, we are going to have to have the
cooperation of local and provincial governments.

Honourable senators, I think I have spoken long enough on
this measure, and I know that other members of the house
wish to contribute to the debate. Certainly, however, before
discussion of the merits of this bill has been completed I would
hope to help provide as much detailed information as honourable senators may feel they require.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
Senator Carter: Honourable senators, before the debate is
adjourned, would the Leader of the Government permit a
question? The leader mentioned a saving of $20 million, which
might have been realized, but which was not because of
prolonged debate in the other place. Was $20 million the total
saving in respect of all programs under this legislation, or was
it the total saving in respect of one program?
Senator Flynn: He did not say that.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the $20 million
anticipated but not realized relates only to one part of the
restraints program. There was also an amount of $45 million
which it was hoped could be saved through cancellation of one
other program. I want to assure honourable senators that
despite the fact that the full impact of this restraints program
bas been delayed because of the debating time taken in the

SENATE DEBATES
other place-and I do not say that critically; it is the right of
the opposition to raise questions-we will still come in under
that $42-plus billion total for the budget. It does not mean that
because not all restraint savings have been realized the budget
will soar over $42 billion. The government has been working
very energetically in other directions to make up for the fact
that the full proposed savings in restraint will not be realized
in certain programs referred to in the bill before us.
Senator Grosart: I wonder if the Leader of the Government
would care to give a further explanation as to this saving of
$20 million that was not realized because of the prolonged
debate in Parliament, in view of the fact that some of this
legislation provides for that by being completely retroactive. I
refer, for example, to clause 3 of the bill, which provides:
The Company of Young Canadians established by section 3 of the Company of Young Canadians Act shall
cease to exist or be deemed to have ceased to exist on
April 1, 1976.
In view of this option, which is one of the favourite devices
of the government-that of making legislation retroactivehow can the Leader of the Government complain that Parliament somehow cost the country $20 million?
Senator Perrault: Unlike certain other programs, such as
Information Canada, where the government, in effect, proceeded to deny funds to the agency for the carrying on of its
work-an action which made necessary the termination of

December 20, 1976

Information Canada operations throughout the country-we
have the example of the Adult Occupational Training Act,
which contains a statutory requirement that an increase in
trainee allowances must be made, effective July 1 of each year.
By July 1 of this year the bill had not been passed by
Parliament and, as a result, under the law, the government was
required to increase the rate. That cost the Canadian taxpayer
$20 million. Other measures, such as industrial research and
development-I think I mentioned that situation-are very
much in the same category. A statutory requirement exists. In
some of the other programs, however, there is no such statutory requirement.
Senator Flynn: With regard to family allowances, for
instance, I think the government decided it would make the
freeze applicable from January 1, 1976, without any legislative
power to do so.
Senator Perrault: If the honourable senator investigates the
legal basis for family allowances he will find, I think, that any
indexing must be done in the calendar year 1976. There must
be some point in the year when the new index for family
allowances is announced, and only then are allowances
increased. The government has until the end of the year to
take appropriate action.
Senator Flynn: We will see about that.
On motion of Senator Flynn, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

AIR TRANSPORTATION
REPORT OF 1970 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OCCUPATIONAL
STUDY-BILINGUALISM IN AIR COMMUNICATIONS-QUESTION

Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to tuie Leader of the Government. Last week an
article in the Montreal newspaper La Presse revealed that a
report had been submitted in 1970 by the advisers of the
Department of Supply and Services claiming that bilingualism
in the air is a security factor. The article further stated:
Following an in-depth study of all the consequences of
the application of bilingualism to air communications, the
writers of the report found that the use of both French
and English in control towers would make air traffic not
only safer but more efficient.
My question therefore is as follows: Does the Leader of the
Government know whether the Department of Transport has
received and examined this report and whether the minister
knew about it in 1970? Moreover, in case such a report does
exist and the minister has it, could the Leader of the Government table it in the Senate?
[English]
Senator Perrault: Because of its detailed nature, I must take
the question as notice. I will endeavour to provide the answer
as quickly as possible.
Senator Flynn: Tomorrow?
Senator Perrault: It is possible.
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES RESTRAINT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Perrault for the second reading of Bill C- 19,
80003-17

to amend or repeal certain statutes to enable restraint of
government expenditures.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, yesterday the
Leader of the Government treated us to a most entertaining
dissertation when he introduced Bill C-19. He recited most of
the proposals for restraint made in October 1975, when the
Prime Minister announced the anti-inflation program to Parliament and to the Canadian people. The leader could have
restricted himself to dealing only with the proposals included
in Bill C-19. But, without the context of the entire so-called
restraint program these proposals would have appeared so
negligible as to be an insult to the intelligence of Parliament
and the public. The fact is that Bill C-19 is part of a cynical,
hypocritical exercise in fakery; it is pure, unadulterated window-dressing, meant to deceive and delude the poor gullible
taxpayer.

•

(1410)

I will mention a few cases in point. First, the Leader of the
Government said in his speech:
-a freeze was announced in the salaries of public
servants in the higher-salaried positions, a freeze in the
number of higher-salaried positions in the public service.
Earlier he had referred to:
-the freeze on the salaries of all judges of the Supreme
Court, the Federal Court and provincial superior courts.
I dealt with this matter at the time it was introduced over a
year ago. I drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that
these salaries had been increased, and substantially increased,
about six weeks before the announced freeze, so that the freeze
meant absolutely nothing. It was more obvious in the case of
judges of the Supreme Court, the Federal Court and provincial
superior courts. Only three months earlier we had provided
these members of the judiciary with a substantial increase,
from a minimum of $38,000, generally, to over $50,000. At
that time it had been announced that these new salary levels
would remain constant for at least three years. So, in those two
cases the freeze was of recently increased salaries that were
already frozen. I said at that time, and I repeat now, this was
pure propaganda; it meant nothing whatsoever.
The second point I want to draw to your attention has to do
with the total budget about which the Leader of the Government said yesterday:
Had these reductions not been imposed, the main estimates which were tabled on February 18, 1976, would
have been $1 billion higher than they were, and the
capital budgets of crown corporations which are approved
by order in council would have been about $1.5 billion
higher.

SENATE DEBATES
I suggest that here again-and it was not the first time; it was
at least the second time-the government was saying, "We
will not spend all we intended to spend in the coming year."
That represents no real restraint at all. All it did was set aside
additional or exceptional increases for the time being.
I suggest that this government will try to convince us that it
saved money by setting aside programs it had never even
considered seriously. That constitutes a demonstration of arrogance and contempt for the taxpayer. But then, what more can
we expect from the most profligate administration in the
history of Canada.
Yesterday the leader mentioned that two years ago the
increase in the federal budget was 28 per cent; that last year it
was 18 per cent, and now we have an increase of 14 per cent.
When Mr. Trudeau took over in 1968 the budget was for
$11.9 billion. Within six years it had more than doubled, and
the budget has again nearly doubled during the last three
years, so that it now stands as a target and only a targetbecause the Leader of the Government said yesterday, "barring unforeseen circumstances"-of $42.150 billion.
Government spending has increased fourfold since Mr. Trudeau took over. There certainly was no restraint being exercised during all that time. The government promised that
federal spending this year would be kept in line with the
growth in the gross national product. It was not; the government broke its own guidelines. The growth in GNP for this
year will be in the order of 11 per cent and the growth in
government spending will be 14 per cent. Next year's growth
in federal spending, if we can call that control, will be 11 per
cent. This will bring us to a total federal government expenditure for next year of $46.7 billion. These figures are very
impressive but to get the full impact they must be considered
in the light of the statement of the Auditor General last year,
as follows:
The present state of financial management and control
systems of departments and agencies of the Government
of Canada is significantly below acceptable standards of
quality.
With respect to crown corporations, for which this government
bas ultimate responsibility, the Auditor General had this to
say:
In the majority of the crown corporations . . . financial

management and control is weak and ineffective. Moreover, coordination and guidance by controlled government
agencies of financial management and control practices in
the crown corporations are virtually non-existent.
Mr. Macdonell was led this year to the inescapable opinion
that:
Financial management and control in the Government of
Canada is grossly inadequate. Furthermore, it is likely to
remain so until the government takes a strong, appropriate and effective measure to rectify this critically serious
situation.
In the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons
he volunteered in May of this year:

December 21, 1976

Unless the systems are corrected the day may well come
when I really cannot give a clear certificate on the
accounts of Canada.
He was telling us that the administration of our tax money was
in the hands of incompetents and wastrels, a vast bureaucracy
so stupid with the money it holds in trust and spends on our
behalf, that he could not be sure it was not being wasted or
used non-productively. In fact, he could not be sure that there
was not outright fraud going on.
Did matters improve after that frightening report? Not a
bit. Is the taxpayer still being ripped off? You bet he is.
According to the Auditor General, this government "has lost
or is losing effective control of the public purse". Countless
millions of dollars have been squandered in the past eight or
nine years. No fancy spending restraint program would have
been necessary to avoid that. So if this government had really
been serious about cutting expenses it would long ago have
started on the simple things. It would have cleaned up its own
act. It also would have implemented some of the suggestions
made by Max Henderson and the present Auditor General.
However, it has not; nor has it acted upon very many of the
suggestions emanating from Parliament, in particular the
Public Accounts Committee. The recommendations of the
Glassco Commission have been only partially implemented,
which has done more harm than good, as half measures often
will. The Auditor General's most recent suggestion-that of
appointing a comptroller general with the responsibility for
creating and maintaining effective systems of financial control-has been met with the appointment of a royal commission to study the idea. So, once again, cynicism, arrogance and
political expediency triumph over what is right and what is
required-in this instance, financial efficiency. The commission will not report until after the next election. Criticism will
be quieted in the interim, and the government ends up saving
its donkey, to use a synonym.

e

(1420)

i ask honourable senators: In view of this government's
complete irresponsibility, its persistent extravagance, and utter
refusal to make any serious attempt at restraint, how is it
possible to treat Bill C-19 with anything but contempt? The
bill is just a public relations gimmick, and a mighty poor one
at that.
Let us look at the bill. The first item is the Adult Occupational Training Act. The bill would repeal the automatic
annual escalation in accordance with the wage index and
provide for the minister to review the rates each year, on April
1. The minister could very well freeze those rates, but he could
also increase them more than is provided by the existing
legislation. In any event, an adjustment was made last July, so
it will be very easy for the minister to freeze them next April.
But the Leader of the Government said yesterday that if the
legislation had been passed by Parliament last July, we would
have saved a lot of money. I again ask the Leader of the
Government-as he was asked last night, if not on this specific
subject then on something related to it-why did not the
minister freeze them before the legislation was passed, in

December 21, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

much the same way as the government did with family allowances. There was no legislation freezing or putting back the
family allowances to the 1975 level, yet that was done. Therefore, to say that Parliament, because it did not act on this bill
last spring, was the cause of a certain amount of money having
been spent unnecessarily, is not a valid statement.
Here again I say that the principle involved in this amendment is important because it gives far greater discretion and
much more power to the minister. The minister could very well
choose another index than the wage index, and increase those
rates at a higher level than was provided in the existing
legislation.
Now let us go to the second item, the Company of Young
Canadians Act. The decision to scrap this organization was
very easy to make because of public criticism of the organization. Even if there had been no restraint program, the government would very likely have made this decision in view of
public suspicion concerning the use of this organization.
Again the intent here, obviously, is pure propaganda in
support of the so-called program of restraint. Is the government prepared to say that it was wrong in creating that
company? Is it prepared to say that it is right in dispensing
with it? I doubt that there has been any statement to that
effect one way or the other. The government says only that it
will save money. Again I say it is a device, not so much to save
money as to help the government save face.
Family Allowances: freeze for 1976 on the basis of the 1975
payments. This bas been done, as I mentioned before, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation for that purpose has not
yet been enacted. Why the government decided to do that in
this particular case and not in the other cases I have mentioned, and in yet another that I shall mention later, I do not
know. But there is the rather interesting fact that the family
allowances will have been frozen only for 1976. I quote from
the statement of the Leader of the Government which we had
already seen in the press:
Some senators will have noted newspaper reports to the
effect that the Minister of Finance announced on December 15 that these allowances would be indexed in 1977.
No government likes to cut back or restrain the indexing
of payments in such a worthwhile area of budget allocation as family allowances. Family allowances, since their
creation, have been improved upon by various governments down through the years.
What does that suggest? That it was wrong to freeze them
for 1976? Was the government sincere when it did that for
1976, without any legislative authority? A strange thing-but
the legislation will be passed only to confirm the decision of
the government for 1976 taken without any legislative authority, and yet the family allowances will start to be indexed
again for 1977. I repeat, this is sheer hypocrisy; it indicates a
singular lack of conviction.
Now, honourable senators, I come to the third item, the
Industrial Research Development Act which will end on
December 31, 1976. The government leader said it will have

80003 -17½

cost the government $5 million in 1976 because the bill was
not passed prior to now. Again I ask him: If the government
was able to stop payments to the Company of Young Canadians, and if they were able to freeze the family allowances
without legislation, why does he suggest that they could not
have stopped paying the subsidies under this act since they had
announced they were going to end it. In any event this
program has not been proven to be of any significant import,
and industry has indicated that it would prefer to have tax
incentives instead. So, this is just another sacrificial lamb in
the government's concerted effort to appear to be applying
restraints.
There is no merit in dispensing with this program. The
Leader of the Government in his speech last night admitted
that this program was of very little influence. When you are
serious about applying restraints, honourable senators, you
don't just choose those items that you are already satisfied
should be stopped whether you had a restraint program or not.
But that is the attitude the government betrays by this bill.
I come now to Information Canada, and this is a nice item
indeed. The decision in this case is also simply part of a snow
job. Information Canada had been extremely unpopular and
severely criticized, so the government decided to get rid of it.
But is it really to save money or simply to save face? By
abolishing Information Canada we supposedly save $11.5 million. But what we are not told is that at the same time the
government increases the amount spent by the various departments on information services by over $15 million. One of the
components of administrative operating expenses which bas
shown the most rapid rate of increase is information services.
Despite the disbanding of Information Canada, the budget
figure for 1976-77 is $104.128 million. The increase in 196667 over 1974-75 is over $30 million, or 40.6 per cent. The
budget figure of over $100 million is only a portion of the true
cost of information services since it does not include the pay
and allowances of those involved in the work, the cost of their
accommodation or of other services provided. The Public
Service Commission shows 1,155 for service positions filled out
of a notarized total of 1,485. The minimum salary and allowance cost for these positions would be $25 million. Again, to
say that abolishing Information Canada was an act of government restraint is a horrible twisting of the truth.
* (1430)

With respect to the Western Grain Stabilization Act, I must
refer now to the comments of the Leader of the Government,
because, like him, I am no expert in this field. I am sorry
Senator Argue is not here, because he would have been able to
explain this; but the leader had this to say at page 255:
Reference is made in Bill C-19 to the Western Grain
Stabilization Act. Section 41 of that act is being amended
so as to authorize the Minister of Finance to postpone
crediting amounts in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to
the stabilization account until a later time, at which time
interest would also be credited.
There are some technical questions in this area which I
know honourable senators will wish to ask in committee

SENATE DEBATES
should the Senate support the motion to refer this bill to
committee.
Well, if I read the bill as did the Leader of the Government,
this doesn't amount to much of a saving. If it is only to
postpone crediting amounts to the stabilization account until a
later time-and we don't know what that time is-at which
time interest will also be credited-the banks' interest, I
suppose-it seems to me that it is a device which really does
not amount to very much in practice. I cannot see anything
there worth boasting about.
Now, what is left of this bill? We know that clause 15 of the
original bill, which was dropped, would have repealed section
272 of the Railway Act and would thereby have removed the
provision maintaining at the 1960 level the rates for moving
grain, and at the 1966 level the rates for moving flour for
export to eastern ports, and would also have removed the
subsidy paid to railway companies to enable them to move
grain and flour at those rates. Well, the government dropped
that provision, because it met with serious reaction in the
maritime provinces, those provinces feeling they had been
betrayed since those special rates were part of the agreement
under which they joined Confederation. But the government's
action in dropping the provision merely shows us how ill
prepared it was in establishing its restraint program.
Bill C-19 is quite simply a shabby and rather transparent
PR program. The government is not seriously thinking of
restraining its expenditures at all; all it has donc is make a few
empty gestures. It has missed all the real opportunities to
exercise restraint. For example, there is an enormous potential
for restraint in crown corporations and agencies such as Air
Canada, the CBC, the CNR, Atomic Energy of Canada, and
so on; but I see nothing to indicate that the government is
about to move on that front.
In addition, departments such as the Department of Public
Works, the Post Office, the Secretary of State, could likely
yield incredible savings if their expenditures were more thoroughly scrutinized. Again, I see nothing to indicate that the
government is about to move on that front either.
The government rejects the Auditor General's suggestion for
a comptroller general, or rather gives the task to a royal
commission, which is an expensive way of doing the same
thing. Where is the restraint in that? But there are other ways
the government could keep us informed concerning its expenditures, and therein lies the answer. If the government is serious
about restraint, it must provide the taxpayers with more
information as to exactly how their money is being spent. That
being done, the taxpayers will see to it that the government
toes the line.
The Canadian Economic Policy Committee, a private sector
group, has suggested that the government should be required
to publish an economic impact statement before imposing any
new regulations, starting a new spending program, taking over
a private enterprise, or raising a new tax. For its part, the C.D.
Howe Research Institute bas suggested a five-year forecast for
each public spending program, including a careful distinction

December 21, 1976

between the spending needed to maintain the existing level of
service and that needed to improve or expand such service.
The Fraser Institute has suggested a government spending
review board, which would replace the Anti-Inflation Board,
and would have the power to roll back government spending to
keep it in line with the guidelines.
Those are just some of the control and information devices
the government might have considered if it were seriously
interested in bringing about restraint in spending.
Honourable senators, I think I have said enoughAn Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: I am quite sure that came from my good
friend Senator Buckwold. I have had occasion to do the same
when he was speaking.
I think I have said enough to demonstrate the emptiness of
Bill C-19. Its main characteristic, I suggest, is that of hypocrisy. It is yet another piece of evidence indicating this government's insincerity in the area of spending restraints. Here
again, as in many other areas, the government is more interested in appearing to be doing something as opposed to actually
showing political courage in bringing about spending
restraints. This government fears political courage. As a Liberal Party, its main principle is to remain in office at all costs,
including budgetary costs; should it lose power, it will sacrifice
anything for the purpose of re-achieving it, including the
well-being of Canadians.
We will allow this bill-perhaps Senator Côté has something interesting he wishes to say.
Senator Côté: No, nothing.
Senator Flynn: I am not surprised at your admission. We
will allow this bill to pass second reading, but only on division
to indicate that we cannot be. accomplices in such a shameful
betrayal of solemn promises repeatedly made over the past
three years.
Senator Greene: Will the honourable senator permit a
question?
Senator Flynn: Indeed. I always welcome questions.
Senator Greene: Can you advise the Senate as to whether
you speak for your party in enunciating the view that the
supreme spending power and the supreme control over public
spending should be taken away from Parliament and placed
with some appointed review board, as you indicated in your
speech? Is it a policy of the Conservative Party that the
Parliament of Canada should no longer be the supreme authority over public spending?
Senator Smith (Colchester): Where did you get that
baloney?
Senator Flynn: I am quite sure that no one understood my
words in the way Senator Greene is suggesting they be interpreted. I merely suggested that the Parliament of Canada
should have more help than it has at present with respect to
controlling public spending and that the public of Canada
should have more information than is presently available to it

with respect to public spending. There is no doubt in my mind,
and there should be no doubt in Senator Greene's mind, that
Parliament is losing control over expenditures. This is because
the government is not frank enough and because the government is, of itself, unable to control expenditures. What I am
suggesting is that Parliament should have more information,
and should be able to control the government, which is something it has been unable to do for several years. It is about
time we tried to devise some means of helping Parliament to
accomplish its most important task.

Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, Senator Flynn
has already indicated that this bill, and the act which it is
intended to create, is misnamed. Clause 1 says that it may be
cited as the Government Expenditures Restraint Act, but I
suggest that it might more properly be called "An act to give
belated legislative authority to certain unplanned panic decisions made by certain so-called experts in the planning of the
Canadian welfare and the Canadian economy."
Perhaps the one word that is really relevant to the circumstances surrounding the introduction of this bill is the word
"act", and, as Senator Flynn has suggested, what an act it is!
What a piece of stagecraft it is! It is very hard to say whether
it is more comedy than tragedy, or more tragedy than comedy,
but, as Senator Flynn has intimated, it is not our intention to
hold up passage of this bill in any way. For one thing, it is long
overdue in its retroactive aspects, and it does offer some degree
of comfort to those of us who have been looking for an
indication that the government would eventually match its
actions to some of its promises. After years of denial that
expenditures could be cut by the government, an act of Parliament is now proposed which, I think, for the first time in
Canadian history, imposes on the government the necessity of
restraining expenditures. How often have we been told here
that expenditures cannot be cut? How often has the Leader of
the Government, in reply to opposition suggestions that expenditures should be cut, asked that snide question, "Where would
you cut?"
The answer to that is in this bill. The Leader of the
Government rose and listed item after item where cuts could
be made in government expenditures in spite of the fact, as I
say, that when we asked this question it was suggested that
there was no answer. The government, however, has now been
forced to find an answer, and this indicates the truth of the old
saying, "Where there's a will there's a way," or, perhaps more
properly in this case, "Where there was no will, there was no
way," since that was the phrase used over and over again"There is no way we can cut expenditures."
We should also welcome, I think, the fact that this bill does
indicate that some of the promises that were made, in the light
of circumstances surrounding it, that increases in government
expenditures will in future be limited to the increase in the
gross national product, will be kept. It will therefore be very
interesting to see, when the accounts are in for next year, or
even this year, whether those promises have been kept. Personally, I doubt that this will be the case, because the latest

evidence that we have is that every estimate that has been
made recently of the potential increase in our gross national
product next year is that it will be lower than that estimated a
week ago, a month ago, or six months ago. In fact, the latest
estimate is that the real increase in the gross national product
will be no more than 3 per cent. It will be interesting to see
whether real government expenditure is maintained at or
below the level of 3 per cent. I doubt if it will be.
The bill also gives us some hope that we will hear the end of
the nonsense that has been spoken in this house, and the other
place, over and over again, to the effect that the budget, the
estimates and the appropriation bills include a very large
percentage of "uncontrollable" expenditures. Reference, of
course, is always made to statutory expenditures. How often
have we been told, "You cannot cut statutory expenditures"?
The phrase has been used by Ministers of Finance and Presidents of the Treasury Board. Although I am not sure whether
it was used by the Leader of the Government here, it certainly
was used by the leader of the other house.
We have been told constantly, I repeat, that these are
uncontrollable expenditures, yet here we have at last-and we
should welcome it-the clearest evidence that we shall be
hearing that phrase no more, since we have before us a list of
statutes which are to be amended so as to cut expenditures.
Whether this will put an end to all of the self-praise we have
heard from the government about how well it plans the
economySenator Perrault: Hear, hear.
Senator Grosart: -and
remains to be seen.

about how well it plans its spending,

We hear of one-year projections and two-year projections.
Lately government expenditures have been on the basis of
five-year projections. This bill gives the lie to that because 14
of its 15 clauses are retroactive. Here is the clearest evidence
that the whole of the spending that has been carried out in this
particular period was unplanned. This is a panic bill. This is a
bill to authorize decisions made by the government which in
each case are the very opposite of the plans it put before
Parliament in the estimates. This, obviously, is why the auditor
general used the phrase, quoted again by the Leader of the
Opposition today, that the government has either lost already,
or is about to lose, control of its expenditures.
There was nothing in the circumstances of this particular
fiscal year that could not have been anticipated. Inflation was
here, unemployment was high, and our economy was seriously
affected by the high level of government expenditure. Economist after economist said to the government, "The main cause
of inflation is your spending," so why were these decisions not
taken a year ago? Why were we given estimates that were
totally wrong? Estimates were approved by Parliament, appropriation bills were approved by Parliament, and the government suddenly panicked and said, without legislative authority, as Senator Flynn has so ably pointed out, "We are going to
change the decisions of Parliament in these respects."

SENATE DEBATES
In the bill before us we have, as I say, 14 out of 15 clauses
that are all retroactive. That includes the title of the bill
because, far from being a government expenditures restraint
act, it is an act to authorize decisions made without the
authority of Parliament.
The absurdity is apparent, as Senator Flynn pointed out, in
the suggestion that we will now have an act of Parliament, or a
section of an act of Parliament, that will be in effect for
probably seven days, since the reference in that particular
case-family allowances-is to the calendar year. In other
words, those sections of this act will be in effect for seven days,
and then nullified. This surely points out the absurdity of this
kind of bill, and the utter ineptness of the government in its
planning.
Some of these retroactive effective dates are as follows: the
Company of Young Canadians, April 1, 1976; the family
allowances, January 1, 1976; the IRDIA program, January 1,
1976; and the western grain changes, April 1, 1976. There is
only one clause which, in its effect, is ongoing and that, of
course, is clause 2, which comes into effect on July 1, 1977.

•

(1450)

Senator Flynn has dealt with these clauses in detail. I find
myself in complete agreement with the criticism he has made,
and his overall summary of the utter absurdity of this bill.
However, I suppose it is one case where we should hope it
receives quick passage by the Senate. Far be it for us to
prolong the agony of this retroactive legislation authorizing
these panic decisions which were made months and months
ago.
It is a late confession, and I suppose we should be charitable
to the confessant. It is a late confession of decision-making
ineptitude, of belated repentance for profligate spending and,
again, a belated attempt to make amends for the harm already
done to the welfare aspect of the country and the economy as a
whole. We, as members of a good confessional, will accept the
confession in that spirit, and hope that our temporary release
from the guilt of the government will be accepted with
humility.
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I wish to inform the Senate that if
the Honourable Senator Perrault, P.C., speaks now, his speech
will have the effect of closing the debate on the motion for
second reading of this bill.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, we have listened
with interest to the spirited assault on this measure by the
Leader of the Opposition and his deputy. It is never a happy
process to bring in a measure which suggests the need for
restraint and, indeed, enacts provisions which are going to
reduce the level of public spending in some programs which
have a certain amount of support in the country.
I was rather intrigued, however, to hear the last speaker,
Senator Grosart, accuse the government of being finally drawn
to the spirit of late repentance, and his suggestion that somehow this bill is severely retroactive. I would simply remind
honourable senators that for one year the government has been

December 21, 1976

attempting to drag the opposition, kicking and struggling, into
the war against inflation through spending restraints, but it
has not been possible to get the opposition to support the view
that these restraints are necessary. Indeed, it is not the government which can be accused of being late converts to the view
that restraint is required but, rather, the opposition. This
measure is the second in a series of bills introduced by this
government to cut back where possible on certain programs in
this country.
Senator Grosart: Too late!
Senator Perrault: The program has been held up in the
other place because of the absolute intransigence demonstrated
by the opposition that certain cuts should not be effected.
Indeed, the only condition under which this bill in its concatenated form comes before the Senate is because the opposition in the other chamber absolutely refused to accept the
proposition that the full amount of cuts were required or
necessary. And now we, as a government, are accused of being
dilatory. We are accused of retroactivity and, indeed, had the
measure been passed early in 1976, there would not have been
very much retroactive about it. So I appeal to the traditional
good sense of senators, and ask them not to accept the specious
argument advanced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in
this house.
We have been accused of sacrificing the well-being of
Canadians for some sort of political target, some political
advantage, either in the short term or the long term. I want to
tell the members of'this chamber that Canada today is conducting one of the most effective economic programs of any
nation in the world, and put on the record some facts concerning the growth of the country's gross national product in real
terms-and these are meaningful figures that really go far
beyond the type of criticisms which we have heard this afternoon-after the "artificial" growth built into the dollar figures
by rising prices has been eliminated.
In 1972, the country's real GNP stood at about $99.7
billion. In the following three years our real GNP expanded by
6.8 per cent, 3.2 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively, so that
last year it had risen to about $111 billion. According to the
latest OECD forecast, our real GNP growth rate this year is
likely to be about 4.8 per cent, which will bring it to about
$116.5 billion. In other words, this country, under the toughest
economic conditions facing the world since the 1930sbrought about, as honourable senators are aware, by the
escalating cost of oil and energy-has managed to achieve
during the four years from 1973 to the end of 1976 a real-not
inflationary, but a real-GNP gain of about $16.8 billion.
To assess our performance on this score we must find out
what our growth would have been if we had pursued different
economic policies, and policies which included a program of
rigorous restraint in the area of government spending. We
would have to find out what the performance would have been
if we had pursued different economic policies more or less
similar to those adopted by other industrialized countries.
Senator Flynn: Like?

December 21, 1976

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Perrault: You all know that economic policy-making involves difficult choices on "trade-offs" between goals
such as those of growth of output, price stability, expanding
employment, government expenditure and so on. It should
surprise no one, therefore, that other industrialized countries
have made forecasts and trade-offs between economic goals
somewhat different frem ours. But were these choices any
better than ours? We heard the criticism from the opposition
today that we have done one of the worst jobs in the world in
this country. To answer this question, let us see what would
have been the real GNP gains in Canada if our national output
had grown over the past four years at the same rates as those
observed in other countries.
Only one country, Japan, has had a better growth performance than Canada since 1972.
Senator Grosart: Not true.
Senator Perrault: Only one country-and then only by a
slim margin and at a comparatively high cost in terms of
inflation and unemployment. If the Canadian economy had
grown during those four years at the same rate as the Japanese
economy, our real GNP gain would have been about $17.4
billion.
Comparisons with every other major industrialized country
are highly favourable to us. The growth performance of
France since 1972, for example, has been quite outstanding by
OECD standards; yet if Canada had had the same year-toyear growth rates, its real GNP gains would have been lower
by about $3.4 billion than what they have actually been.
Similarly, if our GNP had increased at the same rate as that
of Belgium or the Netherlands, our output would have been
lower by more than $4 billion. If our economy had expanded at
rates comparable to those of Italy or Sweden, we would have
been lower by $6 billion; and if our economic policies had been
more or less along the lines of those of the United States and
the Federal Republic of Germany-the two countries which
have had significantly lower rates of inflation than Canadawe would have lost $8 billion or more in goods and services. As
for Britain, it is well known that it has been seriously lagging
behind the OECD pack in growth rate. A Canadian GNP
growth at British rates would have involved a loss of output of
$11.6 billion. So much for the so-called "British disease"
which, according to some of our critics, is supposed to be
infecting the Canadian economy. I believe it is time these facts
were put on the record of Parliament.
0 (1500)
Let me turn, secondly, to inflationSenator Grosart: Before the government leader leaves that
point, will he permit a question? Would he not agree that the
largest single component of GNP is government spending? Is
that not the largest single component?
Senator Perrault: It is part of the GNP, but may I suggest
to the honourable senator that government spending, properly
directed, can be of great benefit to the economy.
Senator Grosart: No question.

Senator Perrault: It can be of great benefit to the economy.
Let me turn to inflation. The opposition critics have said
that the government bas not encouraged restraint, that many
of these programs were planned and have now been simply
cancelled. That was the inference. The fact is that when a
department, for example, holds the line on its spending for the
present fiscal year in comparison with, say, the fiscal year
1975-76, with a 7.5 per cent inflation rate, there is a reduction
in real dollars expended by that department, and that is a very
real constraint because a number of departments have gone
through that process. This is wholly apart from the measurable
tangible cutbacks that are represented in Bill C-19.
With regard to inflation, we are all aware that our performance on this score, until the end of last year, was disappointing,
at least by comparison with that of the United States and the
relatively low rates of inflation which we had prior to 1972.
That is why the federal government, in spite of its reluctance
to interfere with economic decisions in the private sector, and
particularly the wage bargaining process, introduced in the fall
of 1975 a controls program which, while highly controversial,
has without question been successful. The latest consumer
price index figures published by Statistics Canada are most
encouraging. The year-to-year increase in consumer prices
registered last month was only 5.6 per cent, less than half the
figure registered in November 1975, and the lowest recorded
since 1972. One would assume that the opposition would
rejoice with us in the achievement of this goal.
Senator Grosart: Did you say a 5 per cent increase?
Senator Perrault: A 5.6 per cent increase, and it is coming
down.
Senator Grosart: In one month?
Senator Perrault: I said year-to-year. I said that the year-toyear increase in consumer prices registered last month was
only 5.6 per cent.
Over the past four years, consumer prices have risen in
Canada by about 41.4 per cent, a rate of increase which
clearly cannot be sustained in the long-run if the economic
expectations of Canadians are to be met. But there again,
comparisons with the price performance of other OECD countries indicate that, relatively speaking, our experience has not
been bad. Two countries have done much better than usGermany with a four-year price increase of about 33 per cent,
and the United States with an increase of about 35 per centbut they have done so at great sacrifice in terms of GNP
growth. Two other countries, Sweden and the Netherlands,
have experienced a rate of inflation similar to ours, but they
have done so at a much higher price in terms of lost output
and employment. The other five major OECD countries have
all suffered from much higher inflation than Canada since
1972. There has been a rate of price increase of about 70 per
cent in the case of Japan, and in Italy consumer prices have
more than doubled since 1972.
Honourable senators, I will not go through all the available
statistical data, but it suggests that, through a combination of
fiscal and monetary policy, the direction of government spend-

SENATE DEBATES
ing and efforts to achieve a measure of restraint in our
economy Canada is meeting the world-wide economic challenge more successfully than almost any other country. Certainly we are among the top half-dozen countries in the world.
I know it is always easy in opposition to demand cut-backs in
expenditure, but what we have discovered through the travail
which has been associated with this bill during the past twelve
months is that all parliamentarians, while they appear to
support the principle of restraint, find it very difficult to bring
themselves to actually vote for restraint.
We need only look at how the taxpayers' money is spent in
this country to see how dramatically little room there actually
is for the federal government to bring about measurable and
meaningful major reductions in the budget. Right off the top
of a budget of $42.15 billion, for example, 21 per cent goes to
other levels of government. There are medicare, the Canada
Assistance Plan, hospital insurance, post-secondary education
and shared cost programs. Does the opposition seriously suggest that we should take 25 per cent off those amounts that go
to the provinces? Indeed, the political counterparts of our
friends in opposition in this chamber were recently at a
federal-provincial conference demanding a far larger chunk of
federal government revenues and tax collections.
Senator Asselin: They were right.
Senator Perrault: If the full extent of those demands had
been met one need only surmise what the effect would have
been on the budget in the fiscal year 1976-77.
Secondly, 44 per cent of the budget is immediately taken
away by old age security payments, family allowances and war
veterans' allowances. Does the opposition really think this
government is prepared to fight inflation on the backs of the
veteransSenator Grosart: You have donc it.
Senator Perrault: -and the families of Canada who need
the money, and the old age pensioners? We are not prepared
to do that.
Senator Grosart: You have donc it.
Senator Perrault: We are not prepared to do that.
Senator Asselin: You have donc it.
Senator Perrault: We are not prepared to do that.
Senator Grosart: You do it by this bill.
Senator Perrault: We are not prepared to do that.
Senator Asselin: It is in the bill.
Senator Perrault: We are prepared to continue our grants to
those receiving family allowances, with indexation to resume
in 1977.
Senator Flynn: Why did you stop it?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, this party has a
record of introducing family allowances in the face of bitter
opposition from the Conservative Party of Canada. One need
only turn to the Hansard record of Parliament to sec the old

December 21, 1976

age pension described by one opposition parliamentarian as the
first step towards red communism. That is the record.
Senator Asselin: The same old slogans.
Senator Perrault: As between the other levels of government
and the payments to persons, we have 45 per cent of the
budget immediately allocated to those essential programs
which are not flexible enough to allow any federal government
unilaterally to say they are going to cut back in any major
way.
Senator Grosart: Except the cuts you have just made.
Senator Perrault: Then we come to subsidies and other
transfers, 11 per cent, and oil import compensation. Incidentally, our friends in opposition who say how the budget has
ballooned over the past ten years always ignore the fact that
one of the recent major government expenses relates to the oil
import compensation program to allow the cost of energy in
this country to be reasonable for certain provinces. That is an
item which bas bounced up from $1 billion in 1968-69 to $4.1
billion. But no one in opposition is asking for that to be
cancelled.
Senator Flynn: How much did you collect in taxes?
Senator Perrault: Then we have the railway subsidies. The
opposition keeps on demanding that we not abandon any rail
lines, that we increase our rail services to the small centres of
Canada. They don't want that cancelled. They don't want the
resource development programs cancelled either. They think
that is all very valuable. They support that in principle. So
already we have 56 per cent of the entire federal budget taken
up.

Then we have crown corporations and the CBC deficit. An
honourable senator suggested we should cut back on the CBC.
Senator Grosart: Who did?
Senator Flynn: t did.
Senator Perrault: Was it the CBC? Reference was made to
the CBC. Then there are the St. Lawrence Seaway and other
crown corporations.
With respect to the public debt, which accounts for 12 per
cent or $4.65 billion, does the opposition seriously suggest that
we renege on it? Then we have 9 per cent for national defence.
The opposition says we are not spending enough money on
national defence; we need more fighter planes and tanks, and
we should expande

(1510)

Senator Grosart: No.
Senator Perrault: Well, honourable senators have been
saying this. So, what do we really come down to? We come
down to a federal budget, and we can exercise restraint in
respect of only 21 per cent of it. However, we have in that 21
per cent the Post Office deficit, all the public service salaries,
capital expenditures, the cost of penitentiaries and the cost of
Parliament. By means of this bill we are attempting to restrain
expenditures in certain programs which experience has shown

may no longer be top priority. In the case of family allowances, it is with great reluctance that this action is taken.
Senator Flynn: It is not taken.

Senator Perrault: But, senator, I believe you would agree
with me that it would be useful-

Senator Perrault: But, honourable senators, let no one
delude himself that it is an easy process. It has not been easy
for the provinces to engage in this process of cancellation of
programs and restraint.

Senator Perrault: All I am saying is that it would be useful
if all Canadian taxpayers-municipal, provincial and federal-had the benefits of the office of an auditor general to
make sure that their dollars are spent efficiently.

Senator Flynn: It was imposed by the federal government.
Senator Perrault: It has not been easy for the federal
government, but in the next fiscal year-I repeat this once
again-it is hoped that the increase in expenditure can be
around 11 per cent, and that it will continue to decrease until
it roughly matches the increase in the GNP.
The honourable senator said that next year 11 per cent may
not be the increase in the gross national product. He could be
entirely right. It depends on the general economic situation of
the world and the position of our trading partners. However, I
urge all honourable senators to give their support to this
measure, to give it the kind of support it deserves. Indeed, had
this measure come before Parliament and been dealt with by
Parliament earlier in the year, we would have saved the
Canadian taxpayer many millions of dollars which can no
longer be saved because we have missed certain time deadlines,
such as July 1 for the training program.
Senator Flynn: I do not know how you were able to do that
with respect to family allowances, and not with respect to
other items.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, reference was made
to the role of the Auditor General. It is very refreshing,
however, to know that we have in Canada at the present time a
government which is not afraid to have an auditor general, and
not afraid to provide him with the resources which he requires
to probe government finances.

Senator Flynn: They may not need it as much as the present
government, though.
Senator Perrault: That is a theory to which I do not
subscribe.
Senator Grosart: You could not spare him; he bas too much
work to do.
Senator Phillips: Think of all the royal commissions you
could have.
Senator Perrault: The concept of a royal commission bas
been hailed by Mr. Macdonell, a person for whom you have
great respect, and for whom we on this side have respect.
Senator Flynn: But you do not agree with the recommendations he makes.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have spoken sufficiently with respect to this particular measure.
Senator Flynn: You have spoken too much.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I urge your support
for this bill which strives earnestly to meet some of the
objectives with which we all agree.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Senator Flynn: On division.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time, on division.

Senator Flynn: Why?

Senator Flynn: That is new.
Senator Perrault: I remember that when the present Auditor General was appointed the opposition said, "Oh, he's
probably nothing but a government front; he will do his best to
provide cosmetic protection for the government."
Senator Flynn: That's what you were hoping.
Senator Perrault: It is a different tune now.
Senator Flynn: You are disappointed, are you not?
Senator Perrault: I would suggest that if the Auditor Generai finds some spare time-which may not be possible for
him-we lend him to some of the Conservative and NDP
provincial governments in this country who have been fighting
the idea of an auditor general for years.
Senator Flynn: Do you not think you have enough on your
hands without giving advice to provincial governments?
Senator Perrault: I intend to give no advice to provincial
governments.
Senator Flynn: That is what you are doing.

That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon such experiences in prenatal life and early childhood
as may cause personality disorders or criminal behaviour

in later life and to consider and recommend such remedial
and preventative measures relating thereto as may be
reasonably expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of crime and violence in society;
That the Committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical and clerical personnel as may
be required for the purpose of the inquiry; and
That the Committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate.
Hon. Jean-Paul Deschatelets: Honourable senators, when I
adjourned this debate last week I forgot that I had already
spoken in it, as reported at page 191 of Hansard.However, I
do have a few remarks I should like to add.
Senator Flynn: I do not mind, but it is strange that you
should have forgotten and that we also should have forgotten.
You may as well speak.
Senator Deschatelets: Senator Flynn, I must tell you very
frankly that I am more concerned about the fact that you have
forgotten my remarks.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable senator is not registered as having spoken.
Senator Flynn: Agreed.
[Translation]
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, I will be very
brief. I went over Hansard,particularly the remarks by Senator McGrand and other honourable senators who took part in
this interesting debate. One thing is sure, and this can be seen
in all the speeches that were made on this motion. We are
faced here with one of the most complex, the most difficult
problems to have been referred to one of our committees. But I
believe that such complexity must not prevent us from thinking that if there is a body in this country which can shed a bit
of light on this issue of violence in society and the sources of
crime, it is indeed one of the standing committees of the
Senate of Canada. That is why I am confident that honourable
senators, even those who hesitate because of the complexity of
the problems, will not hesitate to entrust the Senate Commit-

December 21,1976

tee on Health, Welfare and Science with the task of studying
this problem.
There is another point I want to mention. This has to do
with the last paragraph of the speech by Senator McGrand, as
reported at page 191 of the English version of Hansard,and I
quote:
[En glish]
Honourable senators, don't worry about the cost of this
proposed investigation. It will not be very much. We will
not need a staff of researchers; the committee will not
travel from place to place. The Auditor General will never
find fault with or question expenses incurred by this
committee.
I would like to say to Senator McGrand that I appreciate
his humility, but I do not agree with this statement. I am of
the opinion that this inquiry is necessary. If we feel that one of
our most important standing committees should inquire into
this matter, we should not be afraid of the expenses which
might be incurred.
*

(1520)

Many honourable senators who have spoken on Senator
McGrand's motion have said that the committee will be
pioneering if it investigates this difficult problem. I am sure
that if it is permitted to undertake the inquiry, its recommendations will open new avenues of research for other organizations such as universities, and so on. An inquiry such as this
can best be undertaken by a standing committee of the Senate.
If we decide to agree with Senator McGrand's proposai, I hope
that the committee will be given the tools to enable it to make
recommendations that will be beneficial to our society.
On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC
AREA AND BOUNDARY-NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Senator Carter: Honourable senators, I give notice that I
will inquire of the government on Monday, January 17, 1977,
as follows:
1. What is the present area of the Province of Quebec?
2. What was the area of the province at the time of
Confederation?
3. How is the present boundary of Quebec defined?
4. What changes have been made in the boundary of
Quebec since 1867?
5. What are the instruments and authorities that give

GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES RESTRAINT BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Senator Sparrow, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance, reported that the committee
had considered Bill C-19, to amend or repeal certain statutes
to enable restraint of government expenditures, and had
directed that the bill be reported without amendment.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a third time?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, with leave, I move
that the bill be read a third time now.
Senator Flynn: Leave is not granted at this time. I suggest
that the question be put as the first order of the day. I want to
know what is planned before I grant leave.
Senator Greene: We cannot perform miracles in here.
Senator Flynn: You are certainly not able to do that.
Senator Perrault: There is no objection to that procedure.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with leave, it is
moved by the Honourable Senator Perrault, P.C., seconded by
the Honourable Senator Langlois, that this bill be read a third
time later this day.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
ADJOURNMENT

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(g), I move that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Tuesday,
February 1, 1977, at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Honourable senators, before the question is put I should like
to add that this date was chosen having regard to the progress
made in the other place with the legislative program, which
indicates that there will be no legislation before us when the
other place reconvenes on January 24. Of course, this proposed
adjournment date is subject ot the Senate's being recalled
should any legislation come to us from the other place, or from
other sources, before February 1 next.
• (1410)
Senator Flynn: That is legislation of certain importance. I
wonder whether Senator Carter would object to this date in
view of the fact that he proposed a very important topic of
discussion for January 17?
Senator Greene: It will be a solo.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I explain that
there has been a measure under discussion in the other place
with respect to metric conversion and the application of certain

SENATE DEBATES
metric measurements to the grain industry. It is hoped that
this legislation will come before us during the first week in
February. There is a possibility that we could get it sooner. In
any event, the Leader of the Opposition and I can keep in
touch with respect to this matter, and perhaps a debate could
be arranged for January 31.
Senator Flynn: I understand that the government has abandoned the idea of having Bill C-22 passed before the end of the
year. Will that cause any problem with regard to taxpayers
completing their income tax returns before this bill has
received royal assent?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the government
never abandons hope for any piece of legislation.
An Hon. Senator: Hope springs eternal.
Senator Perrault: Yes, hope springs eternal. There is not
encouraging likelihood that the legislation will be debated
before the end of the year. The government awaits the determination of Parliament with respect to that legislation. Presumably, it will be debated in the other place after January 24.
Senator Carter: Honourable senators, with respect to the
point raised by Senator Flynn, regarding the date of my
inquiry, I have been advised that the date that will appear on
the order paper is perfectly proper. However, if honourable
senators prefer, I will gladly amend it to the date of opening.
Senator Grosart: Forget it.
Senator Flynn: You do not have to amend it. I was just
wondering if you wished the Senate to return especially to
discuss your inquiry.
Senator Carter: It would not be a bad idea.
Motion agreed to.

Senator Flynn: Is there any reply to the question posed
yesterday by Senator Asselin?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I regret to say that I
do not have the necessary information available to answer the
important question posed by Senator Asselin.
Senator Denis: January 17.
Senator Flynn: It will likely be an anti-climax.

THIRD READING

Senator Perrault moved third reading of Bill C-1 9, to
,amend or repeal certain statutes to enable restraint of government expenditures.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I promise that I
will hot keep you very long.
Senator Greene: Hear, hear.

December 22, 1976

Senator Flynn: Yesterday I thought similar applause came
from Senator Buckwold, but someone told me that it was the
usual applause from Senator Greene. Now he confirms that. I
hope that he will ask another question today. As I have
observed previously, I always like the questions Senator
Greene asks because they help me to make my point and to
clarify the situation for him. I am not entirely satisfied that it
clarifies the mind of Senator Greene, but it may help me if it
does not help him.
Senator Greene: If it helps you, I think it is worthwhile.
Senator Flynn: There are many ways of helping in this
place. You have your own, which is very special and, I might
add, very peculiar.
Arising out of the study of the bill in committee, and for
other reasons, I should like to make a few comments. The first
concerns the statement made by the government leader when
he introduced the bill. He said at least twice in his remarks
that because of the delay in the adoption of the bill-a delay
caused by prolonged debate in the other place-the government was forced to spend more than it had intended to. I quote
now from page 254 of Debates of the Senate for Tuesday,
December 21, 1976:
I would comment just briefly on the proposed substitution of these new sections 7 and 8 in the Adult Occupational Training Act. The hope was to have this measure
passed earlier in the year. Parliament in its wisdom
decided that it was an important measure-which it isand this resulted in a long debate. Senators will recall that
it had not been found possible to pass the predecessor bill,
Bill C-87, before the summer recess, so additional expenditures of $20 million in this fiscal year were made
necessary.
Later in his speech, at page 255, Senator Perrault said:
It was expected that the predecessor bill would result in
a saving of $45 million for the fiscal year 1976-77. That
bill, of course, because of prolonged debate in ParliamentI again underline the words "prolonged debate in Parliament",
and I interjected to say "In the other place". Senator Perrault
replied:
Yes, in the other place. In any event, it was not
proclaimed. As a result, the expected saving was not
realized. There will be something in the order of a $15
million phase-out cost in the fiscal year 1977-78I was not too sure about the "prolonged debate," but I could
not dispute the statement at that time. However, I checked
and found that Bill C-87 was introduced in the House of
Commons on March 8, 1976 and that it was never brought up
for discussion in the last session. So, to say that it was
impossible for the government to give effect to these reductions
in spending because of a prolonged debate on Bill C-87 is, in
my opinion, entirely false. The record should make that point
very clear.

December 22, 1976
December 22, 1976

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

The facts concerning the problem of the Adult Occupational
Training Act are that the first bill, Bill C-87, provided in
clause 16 that section 2, which is the one in question:
shall come into force or be deemed to have come into
force on April 1, 1976.
That provision was changed in Bill C-19 to read:
Section 2 shall come into force on July 1, 1977.
So it is very interesting to note that if they had not changed
the bill in this respect, these sums of money could have been
saved, and it is only because Bill C-19 was changed to provide
that "Section 2 shall come into force on July 1, 1977"precisely the date when the minister had to make a decision on
the increase and the amounts-that it made it possible for the
government to increase the amount and impossible for them to
realize any savings.
The record should be clear that if there was no saving, it was
not because of Parliament. It was because of the decision of
the government not to bring the bill before the House of
Commons during the last session, and because of the change
made in Bill C-87 of the last session before it was reintroduced
as Bill C-19 in this session. Nobody in the government can
with any validity claim that the expenditure of the $20 million-money which was not saved for this current year-is due
to a prolonged debate in the House of Commons; it was due to
the inaction of the government and to the decision to change
Bill C-87 to provide those things that are provided in Bill C-19
now before us. I think that that should be made clear.
e (1420)
Now, with regard to our study of this bill in committee, it
was also made clear, for instance, that other provisions did not
mean much. As far as family allowances are concerned, the
government is saving the amount it would have had to disburse
during the year 1976 which is roughly $170 million, after
deducting the income tax payable on family allowance
increases. It saved this amount, but again it saved it only for
that year because we are resuming the indexing of family
allowances. So the principle involved in the freezing last year
in Bill C-87 has been completely abandoned.
With respect to Information Canada, the committee could
not .clarify whether the jobs which were eliminated by the
abolishing of Information Canada were not in the end paid for
by filling vacancies in information services in various departments. But I suggest to you that the figures I put on the record
yesterday as far as this is concerned suggest that there was no
real saving there.
With regard to the Western Grain Stabilization Act, it was
also made clear in committee that this was merely postponing
the payment to the account from the Consolidated Revenue
Fund of certain sums of money. But no gain was made there,
none at all. It simply meant the government was considering as
an account payable during the present fiscal year a sum of $68
million, an account payable but not paid. Therefore, a reduction in expenditures was realized for that year by postponing
this amount to future fiscal years. But, if you keep an account
payable and you do not pay it, you are not getting richer; you

are not spending less, because in the end it must be paid. I
think the study by the committee of this bill has shown what I
have said and what others have said, that is, that this bill is
nothing more than window dressing. It means virtually nothing. It is a piece of pure propaganda, a shameful part of the
PR program outlined when the anti-inflation program was
announced to Parliament and to the Canadian people.
Nobody should entertain any illusions as to the real effectiveness of this legislation. It is a base attempt at convincing
the Canadian people that the government is doing something
in the way of spending restraint when in reality it was merely
abandoning programs which had to be abandoned Qne way or
the other. Whether restraint was the order of the day or not,
Information Canada and the Company of Young Canadians
had to go. Therefore, their abandonment means absolutely
nothing. The government saves a few dollars, but it is not
doing what it told the Canadian people it would do; in fact, it
is not even trying.
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senators, I had not
expected this intervention at this time by the Leader of the
OppositionSenator Flynn: You should have.
Senator Perrault: -but he certainly has every right to
intervene. No one will dispute the fact that this bill has had a
difficult gestation periodSenator Flynn: Gestation?
Senator Perrault: -as have many measures in Parliament
during the past few months. Without any question at all there
have been long and unforeseen delays in the consideration of
many bills by Parliament generally, including Bill C-19 and its
predecessor, and this has led to substantially less than had
been anticipated would be saved by this package of restraints
that we have before us for consideration now. It was not
possible to meet the initial target date of July 1, 1976, with
respect to the Adult Occupational Training Act, and no
amount of obfuscation by the Leader of the Opposition will
change that fact.
I do not want to be unkind or uncharitable, but I do want to
be factual. Under the present act, training allowances are
increased annually on July 1, as the honourable senator is
aware, in accordance with the increase in the manufacturing
wage index for the previous calendar year. Bill C-19 provides
for the repeal of this provision, and its replacement by a
section which would authorize the minister to pay to every
adult being trained in an occupational training course authorized under the act a training allowance related to the family
circumstances and living costs of that adult at a rate determined as prescribed by the regulations, and so on. Had it been
possible to get the support of Parliament for the predecessor
billSenator Flynn: You did not ask for it.
Senator Perrault: -there would have been a substantial
saving as of July 1, 1976, without any question.
Senator Asselin: That was not discussed at all.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Grosart: Was there prolonged debate on that billyes or no?
Senator Perrault: There has been prolonged debate in Parliament. There has been prolonged debate on Bill C-19. I
would ask honourable senators to review the record of debate
in the other placeSenator Flynn: You should have donc that the other day.
Senator Perrault: -where they will sec that in actual fact
the opposition refused to allow this bill to move forward unless
the clause with respect to railway movements and subsidies for
flour and grain exports from east coast portsSenator Grosart: False!
Senator Perrault: -unless
bill.

that clause was stricken from the

Senator Grosart: Was there long debate-yes or no?
Senator Perrault: Too much debate, honourable senators,
too much debate.
Senator Grosart: Was there prolonged debate-yes or no?
Senator Perrault: There has been prolonged debate in the
other place on a number of measures.
Senator Grosart: I am asking about this bill.
Senator Perrault: Yes, I would say so, certainly in my
judgment.
Senator Flynn: Hah, hah!
Senator Perrault: We have before us an important measure
with respect to income tax, and the opposition steadfastly
refuses to let that bill be considered by Parliament.
Senator Flynn: Not the official opposition.
Senator Perrault: Before the recess.
Senator Flynn: Speak of this bill.
Senator Perrault: I simply believe that those facts should be
put on record.
So far as withholding information about Information
Canada, the assurance was given to the Leader of the Opposition in committee yesterday, and certainly the other day when
I spoke on behalf of the government, that the relocation of
certain members of that Information Canada staff has been
totally consistent with the general employment guideline
established for the public service, and that is that there will be
no more than a 1.5 per cent increase in the current fiscal year.
It meets all of the budgetary requirements of the government
during this program of restraint. Not all of the employees have
been relocated. With respect to employees in the rural areas,
something like 30 per cent of them have been relocated; the
others have either had to find employment outside the public
service or have been unable to find employment at all. I
understand that the figure in the urban centres, where there
have been Information Canada offices, runs at around 70 per
cent.

December 22, 1976

There bas been criticism of the Western Grain Stabilization
Act. The government bas never said any more about the act
than that it authorizes the Minister of Finance to postpone
crediting amounts in the consolidated revenue fund to the
stabilization account until a later time, at which time accrued
interest will also be credited. But that may or may not,
depending on the price of grain, represent an expense so far as
the taxpayers of Canada are concerned.

e

(1430)

Senator Flynn: Window dressing.
Senator Grosart: No restraint.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I think the Leader of
the Government should admit that there was no debate on Bill
C-87, and Bill C-19 was only brought forward in the other
place on November 1 last. His position that there has been a
prolonged debate does not stand as far as this bill is concerned.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I am certainly not
accusing the opposition in this chamber of indulging in a
prolonged debate. In fact, I think the debate in this chamber
has been a very responsible one. I will certainly undertake to
review the record of debate in the other place.
Senator Flynn: You should have done so before today.
Senator Perrault: We must look to this session as a whole to
determine whether there has been a tendency on the part of
the opposition to help expedite the legislative program of the
government or whether there have been efforts made to slow
down debate in a number of areas leading to delays in the
implementation of important legislation, some of which means
tax savings for the Canadian people.
Senator Flynn: There was no priority given this bill.
Senator Grosart: That is not what you said.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Flynn: On division.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed, on
division.

CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARY GUIDE
CORRECTIONS TO BIOGRAPHIES-SUBMISSION DATE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, 1 have received
inquiries about the time limit for corrections to biographies
which appear each year in the Canadian ParliamentaryGuide.
I have Iooked into the matter and 1 arn now in a position to
inform the Senate that any such corrections or new biographies should be forwarded in writing before February 15,
1977, to the following address:
Canadian Parliamentary Guide,
P.O. Box 3453,
Station "C",
Ottawa, Ontario, K1Y 4J6.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, since Her Honour the
Speaker has mentioned the Canadian Parliamentary Guide,
may 1 say that it has occurred to me for a long time that
something should be done about improving that publication. 1
was wondering if Madam Speaker, and perhaps the Standing
Committee on Internal Economny, Budgets and Administration, could examine what should be done in this respect. It
seems to me that, generally speaking, it is badly presented.
Since both Houses of Parliament provide somne funds for its
printing, I think we should have something to say about it on
occasion. It has foliowed the same pattern for 1 don't know
how many years-probably ever since it was first publishedand it is about time it was revamped and reviewed.
Senator Laniontagne: Do you think we are too humble?
Senator Flynn: No, not necessarihy. 1 know that many
biographies could be cut in haif, or even to one-third their
present length.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, there is certainly no
objection from this side to that proposal. Of course, the
Canadian Parliamentary Guide is essentially a private,
independent publication. However, I am sure the editor would
welcome any suggestion honourable senators may wish to
make.
Senator Flynn: It is a private publication, but it is financed
by Parliament.

CONFEDERATION
PROPOSED SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE MATTERS
OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO ALL CANADIANS-NOTICE OF
INQUIRY

Senator Cook: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, February 2,
1977, I will call the attention of the Senate to matters of
interest concerning Labrador and also to the desirability of
establishing a special joint committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons to examine matters of mutual interest to
all Canadians whether they reside in Quebec or elsewhere in
Canada.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is leave
granted?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Flynn: This matter appears to be so urgent that I
think we have to give leave.
BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE

that rule 76(4) be suspended in relation thereto.
Motion agreed to.
AIR TRANSPORTATION
REPORT OF 1970 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OCCUPATIONAL
STUDY-BILINGUALISM IN AIR COMMUNICATIONS-QUESTION
ANSWERED

[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, on December 21,
1976, 1 asked the Leader of the Government an important
question which concerned mainly a report submitted in 1970
by the advisers of the Department of Supply and Services of
Canada claiming that bilingualism in the air is a safety factor.
The next day, I think, the Leader of the Opposition asked
whether the Leader of the Government was in a position to
answer my question.
Since we had a month's holiday, and since the Leader of the
Government must have put his advisers and researchers to
work, I wonder if he can give his answer tonight.
Senator Perrault: Of course, the officials of the Department
of Transport were aware of the document long before they
started to try formally to find procedures to allow for the use
of both languages in the control of air traffic in the province of
Quebec.
[English]
Honourable senators, following the original study, transport
safety officials began to look at the practical use of the two
languages and determined that it, indeed, was an important
improvement in safety when the two languages could be made
available because, of course, the pilot would be able to communicate with the air traffic controller in his first language.
That principle, however, was always applied with great care in
that the government insists upon the maintenance of the high
standard of safety which we have come to know and appreciate
throughout this country, and this is how we have proceeded
with the matter since.
In 1969, an air traffic control occupational study was initiated. Of the subjects to come under study, the question of
bilingualism in air traffic services operational environments
was discussed and resulted in a number of recommendations,
which were later referred to a special air traffic control
implementation team for revicw and action. This, in fact, led

February 1, 1977

to the eventual formation of the task force on bilingualism
known as project BILCOM.
[Translation]
If you wish I would be glad to obtain for you the 74-81
recommendations of the Lisson study on bilingualism. However, the study was for internal and confidential use and must
reman so.
[English]
I would be pleased to make available, however, on a private
basis, to the honourable senator some of the more detailed
information which he may wish to have.
Senator Asselin: I would be very pleased to receive this
report, because I need it to prepare some work during this
session with respect to this very auspicious subject.
Senator Perrault: I would be pleased to make that available
to the honourable senator.

PATRIATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
LETTERS FROM PRIME MINISTER TO PROVINCIAL PREMIERSQUESTION

Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I wonder if I might
ask the Leader of the Government whether he has considered
making available, attached to the Minutes of today's date or in
Hansard, the letters from the Prime Minister to the Premiers
of the provinces with regard to patriation of the Constitution.
It is very nice to have them tabled, but I think it might be
useful for some of us to have them easily available in the
record of this house.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, those letters, of
course, were tabled a few moments ago along with other
documents. Is the honourable senator suggesting that they be
printed as an appendix to the Debates of the Senate for today?
Senator Forsey: That is what I am suggesting. They would
be more easily available, I think, to most of us if they were
attached or printed as an appendix to today's Minutes, if that
is not inconvenient or too expensive.
Senator Flynn: I do not object but, if I am not mistaken, I
found copies of those letters in my mail. It would simply be an
additional expenditure.
[Translation]
Senator Forsey: You are luckier than 1,honourable senator.
Senator Flynn: In that case, I would gladly lend my copy to
Senator Forsey. Not being an expert myself, I merely try to
remember the essence of the proposals.
[English]
Senator Perrault: If it is the wish of honourable senators
that the contents of these letters form part of the permanent
printed record of the deliberations of the Senate, and leave is
granted, certainly there is no objection on the part of the
government to having them printed as an appendix to the
proceedings of today's date.

SENATE DEBATES

February 1, 1977

Senator Flynn: I was not objecting. However, given these
times of austerity and financial constraint, I was merely trying
to save a few dollars of the taxpayers' money. If the government continues in this vein, I can understand the public's
doubt as to its intention to exercise restraint in the fiscal area.
Senator Perrault: I appreciate the honourable senator's
desire to conserve newsprint, but if honourable senators wish
to see these important letters printed as an appendix to the
Minutes of the Proceedings of today's date the government
would be pleased to support such a proposal.
Senator Sparrow: Leave is not granted.
Senator Mcllraith: Honourable senators, since there is no
formal motion before the house at the moment, I wonder if I
might make a few comments on this question. It is not a
matter of saving newsprint in this case; it is a matter of saving
Canada as we now know it. It is my hope that these letters will
be placed on the record where they would be available to ail
Canadians interested in the subject.
Senator Flynn: They may have been placed on the record of
the other place.
Senator Croll: No.
NATIONAL UNITY
ROLL OF SENATE-QUESTIONS

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might direct a question to the Leader of the Government.
During the recess there was a news item to the effect that the
Leader of the Government had indicated that there was a
significant role that the Senate might play insofar as the
subject of Canadian unity and the state of Confederation is
concerned. I am wondering whether the Leader of the Government has anything further to add to that statement.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, it is the view of
many members of this chamber that the Senate has an important role to play during the current national dialogue with
respect to national unity. I have had a number of useful,
helpful and constructive conversations with honourable senators on both sides of the house representing different political
persuasions with respect to what possible role the Senate might
play. I have had the opportunity to discuss the matter in a
preliminary way with the Leader of the Opposition. It is my
hope that these discussions will continue, and that in the near
future it may be possible for a resolution to come before the
house with respect to the type of activity the Senate may
become involved in with a view to furthering the goals of
national unity-goals which are supported, I am certain, by ail
members of this chamber.
Senator Lang: Honourable senators, may I ask the honourable Leader of the Government a supplementary question?
I have had at least half a dozen telephone calls regarding
the news release referred to by my colleague, Senator Buckwold, and what the Senate might be able to accomplish in
terms of this crucial issue. I was not able to respond very

intelligently to those inquiries. I should like to ask the Leader
of the Government if it is his intention-and I would take it to
be so from the press releases-to utilize the Senate as a body,
or whether he is intending to ask honourable senators individually to make whatever contributions they can in their own
constituencies?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, one of the historical
justifications for the existence of the Senate, surely, is that,
among other responsibilities, it is a body to reinforce regional
representation in Ottawa; that it can convey to the seat of
government the aspirations, the hopes, the problems, the issues
and the special economic circumstances which exist in various
parts of Canada so that the government and Parliament may
respond more fully and effectively to the wishes and needs of
Canadians, wherever they may live.
With this thought in mind a number of honourable senators
have suggested that perhaps at this time in Canada's history,
which some feel may be a critical juncture, a special Senate
committee on national unity should be formed, a committee
representative of aIl political opinion in this chamber, and that
we should as a body and, yes, as individuals, endeavour to do
aIl we can to convey to the Canadian people our views on the
subject of Confederation, national unity and federal-provincial
relations and, in return, receive their views.
I suggest to honourable senators that the concept and the
idea is in the planning stage, and that their views with respect
to this idea are welcome. I am sure they would be welcomed
also by the Leader of the Opposition. In this connection I
quote the words of Winston Churchill in 1945, when he said so
eloquently:
I shall not remain supine and silent while ail that we
have fought for and built is swept away.
I think that is the view of most of the people who serve in
Ottawa. We want to play a constructive role in the next two
years particularly to demonstrate to Canadians, wherever they
may live, our concern about the future of this country and our
concern that their views be properly assessed by those of us
with the responsibility of serving here in Ottawa.
Senator Lang: Honourable senators, may I ask the leader an
additional supplementary question?
Is the leader prepared to introduce in this chamber a motion
that would effectively implement his ideas as expressed this
evening, and to which I am sure ail of us give our wholehearted support?
Senator Perrault: It is my profound conviction that such a
resolution should be introduced in this chamber, but I believe
it necessary that the matter be discussed not only with government members here but with the official opposition, because I
think we must work in concert for goals in which there can be
no partisan differences.
Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, if I may be permitted a question, I am wondering whether the Leader of the
Governmert might consider the possibility of a general debate
on this subject before any specific plans are made so that the
members of this house have the opportunity to state their views

SENATE DEBATES
and to listen to the views of others. I am particularly interested
in hearing the views of some of my colleagues from la belle
province on this matter, and those of senators from other parts
of the country who are also very interested in the subject.
Senator Asselin: You have known those for a long time.
Senator Buckwold: Since I feel that this is the kind of work
we should be doing in the Senate, I would simply pass on the
suggestion that the leader might consider the possibility of
giving some time to the discussion of this matter in this
chamber.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, it seems to me to be up
to the honourable senator, if he wants to invite the Senate to
consider the question, to move the appropriate motion himself.
He does not have to ask leave of his leader, or of the
government leader, in fact, because there is a difference
between being government leader and party leader.
Senator Cook: Perhaps, honourable senators, my inquiry
may do just that. It may start such a debate.
Senator Flynn: It seemed to me that the notice of inquiry
was restricted to Labrador and Newfoundland. Perhaps your
speech will be wider than that.
Senator Perrault: Of course, if a resolution comes before the
the Senate advocating the formation of such a committee there
will be wide latitude for debating the subject by all honourable
senators. But, in the meantime, I am certain that this matter is
one which will be discussed in caucus, and together with the
Leader of the Opposition we can compare views with regard to
the terms of reference, because I believe he supports the view
that they must be very carefully drawn.

(2030)

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, that is the reason why
I have been so quiet throughout what has been said about this
matter tonight.
Senator Asselin: I should like to know whether the Leader
of the Government has consulted the Prime Minister on this
question, and whether the Prime Minister is willing that the
question be debated in the Senate.
Senator Perrault: As of this minute, no discussion has been
had with the Prime Minister with respect to this question.
Moreover, I believe that the Senate has the power, the intellectual resources and the energy to initiate its own study of this
kind without direction from any source.
Senator Asselin: But, surely, it would be much better for
you to discuss this with the Prime Minister.
Senator Flynn: No, don't push it.
Senator Everett: May I ask a question of the government
leader?
My understanding is that the government leader held a press
conference at which he made an announcement about the
matter under consideration at this moment. Could he tell us
what he said on this subject at the press conference, or does he
have a transcript of what he said?

February 1, 1977

Senator Perrault: On the subject of national unity I held no
press conference. There was a report which found its way into
the hands of one of the members of the press gallery which
suggested that the Senate was considering a study of this kind.
I was asked whether or not that was true, and at a meeting
which was held in my office, involving only one member of the
press gallery, I gave him my personal opinions with respect to
the matter of national unity. I said, however, that the matter
would have to be discussed thoroughly in the Senate before
any decisions were made, that a resolution would have to come
before the Senate, and that I intended to discuss the issue with
members of the opposition.
Senator Asselin: Was there a press release?
Senator Perrault: There was no press release at all. It was
simply a discussion about one senator's views with respect to
national unity.
Senator Everett: Is the government leader suggesting that
those views were given to the reporter on a personal basis and
not for publication?
Senator Perrault: Well, quite candidly, there were some
remarks which I suggested were of a public nature, and one or
two which were off the record-as is the case when most
politicians or people in public life discuss matters with the
press. I do not feel there was any violation of confidence
involved in the interview.
Senator Everett: Could the government leader then tell me
what he said in respect of the matter?
Senator Perrault: All I can say at this point is that I do not
have a transcript of my remarks. They were random comments. There was no tape recording. There was a report in the
newspapers with respect to what I was purported to have said.
Frankly, if I had written the story, I might have phrased it
differently, but I think that the writer of the story exercised a
legitimate degree of editorial judgment with respect to anything I said to him, and I think that, generally, the report was
a reasonably competent one, although the attributed quotations may not be exact in every detail.
Senator Flynn: May I ask a supplementary question, perhaps in a lighter vein?
I believe it was on the same occasion that the Leader of the
Government made some reference to coming appointments to
the Senate, and the possibility of adding to the strength of the
opposition. I was wondering if on that matter the Leader of the
Government was misquoted, even by such an able reporter.
Senator Perrault: I did make clear to the representative of
the press, who sought me out for an interview-I did not seek
him out-that I felt it important in Parliament and in the
democratic process that there be a vigorous opposition with
adequate representation in every chamber, whether at the
federal level or provincial level. And let me remind honourable
senators that I served for nine years as an opposition leader in
another assembly, and I value greatly the kind of alert opposition which any government needs. I certainly hope there will

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

February 1, 1977
Februarv 1, 1977

be opposition appointments, and I must say that I have pressed
consistently for some opposition appointments here.
I say again, with my colleagues in the Senate as witnesses,
that I would hope that the Leader of the Opposition, and those
people with whom he confers, will make available to the
government as soon as possible the names of those they believe
should be appointed to this chamber.
Senator Flynn: I can assure the Leader of the Government
that I believe everything was done on our part. It is not
difficult to find people who would like to serve on the opposition side of the house. It is even easier, I would say, than
sitting with those on the government side.
Senator Perrault: I am delighted to hear that there are a
number of volunteers from the opposition. Again, I trust that
the list of proposed names can be made available as quickly as
possible.
LABOUR
WORKER REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF
CORPORATIONS-QUESTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I should like to ask
the Leader of the Government if, at the meeting earlier this
week between members of the government and the Canadian
Labour Congress, the question of worker representation on the
boards of directors of corporations was raised; whether the
Leader of the Government is aware of a report by Mr. Charles
Connaghan to the Canadian Department of Labour with
respect to the subject, recommending that a review of Canadian labour relations be held to take account of increased labour
representation in government business; and whether the
Leader of the Government is aware that a royal commission in
the United Kingdom during the past week has made such a
recommendation to the British government under the title of
"The Bullock Report."
Senator Perrault: I must take that question as notice. It is
my understanding, however, that most of the sessions were of a
confidential nature.
PATRIATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
LETTERS FROM PRIME MINISTER TO PROVINCIAL PREMIERS

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed

The Hon. the Speaker: On division?
Senator Grosart: No. There is no motion. No leave.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is there a majority of senators saying

Senator Flynn: I heard two "nos."
The Hon. the Speaker: Those who are in favour, say yes.
Some Hon. Senators: Yes.

is not because I do not want to help my good friend, Senator
Forsey. I offered him my copy.
Senator Perrault: If honourable senators have difficulty
obtaining copies of the letters to the premiers, I may be able to
obtain extra copies, which I will forward to those interested.
The Hon. the Speaker: I will take the matter under
advisement.
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
SILVER JUBILEE CELEBRATION-SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION
ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have one more
reply that I should like to provide for honourable senators.
A question was asked by Senator Hicks on December 14,
1976. It reads, in part, as follows:
I take it that it is implied in your answer-and please
correct me if I am wrong-that there will be no special
stamps issued to mark the occasionThat is, of the Silver Jubilee of the Queen's coronation, which
falls on February 6, 1977.
I am pleased to report to honourable senators that there will
indeed be a special Silver Jubilee stamp, the Queen Elizabeth
Il Silver Jubilee stamp. It will feature a remarkably fine
portrait of the Queen, and will be given widespread circulation
throughout the country.
I shall not read all of the material describing it, but the
accompanying release is going out to all post offices in
Canada, and to a wide mailing list in this country, states:
The monarchy is a valid expression of Canadian society
and a useful governmental institution with roots deep in
our history. For these reasons and because of our great
affection for the present sovereign, Canadians will long
remember the Silver Jubilee of Her Most Excellent
Majesty Elizabeth The Second.
e (2040)
There is a good deal of other useful biographical and other
information in the pamphlet which I hold in my hands.
Senator Forsey: I wonder if I might ask the Leader of the
Government a question.
In view of his remark that the Jubilee stamp-which, by the
way, bears nothing on it to say that it is a Jubilee stamp-will
have, and I quote his words exactly, I think, "widespread
circulation throughout the country," why is it only a 25-cent
stamp that is to be issued, which will not get any circulation in
the country at all, but will only go on air mail outside the
country, or, if it gets into circulation inside the country, will do
so either among stamp collectors, who are not, perhaps, a very
numerous body, or among people who happen to send some-

SENATE DEBATES
thing that weighs so much that they have to put a 25-cent
stamp on it? It will not get wide circulation at all in view of
the denomination in which it is issued. I find it very difficult,
therefore, to understand what the leader said, and I would be
very glad of an explanation.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the decision made
by post office officials was that a 25-cent Jubilee stamp will be
particularly appropriate, in view of the fact that this year
marks the Silver Jubilee-the 25th anniversary of the Queen's
coronation. The figure "25" will appear on the Jubilee stamp
in silver. I think many Canadians will want to put this fine
25-cent stamp on their letters in order to honour The Queen's
Silver Jubilee, and in doing so they will not only honour this
memorable occasion but may, as well, improve the deficit
situation in the post office.
An Hon. Senator: Not noticeably.
PATRIATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
LETTERS FROM PRIME MINISTER TO PROVINCIAL PREMIERS

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with respect to
Senator Forsey's request, rule 109 reads as follows:
The printing or publishing of anything relating to the

The expression "ordered by the Senate" is defined as follows
in rule 5(j):
"ordered by the Senate" or any expression of like
import means ordered by majority decision.
Consequently, the leave of the Senate is not required.
Senator Flynn: If it is Your Honour's interpretation that a
vote can be taken on whether a letter is to be printed as an
appendix to Hansard, I am going to test it right away, because
it has never been my understanding that that may be done.
There has to be a motion before the Senate to have a majority
decision of the Senate.
[Translation]
Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I believe that
we are again getting into the complexity of the rules. i do not
believe that we are here in the Senate to bother with all those
details although i believe it is important that we have a set of
rules. But I think that in this instance there should be a way of
producing that letter which is very important for the future of
our Constitution. It is very important to give it the largest
dissemination as possible. So I believe that rather than letting
the rules or the letter of the rules stop us, we should abide by
the spirit of the rules, particularly the purpose sought by this
proposal before us.
Senator Flynn: If the rules are to be interpreted only when it
suits my learned colleague opposite, well, I cannot take that
risk. There will eventually be other instances when the rules
will be abused. i have no objection, as i say, to those letters
being printed as an appendix to today's proceedings. The fact

February 1, 1977

still remains that it is an expenditure, and everybody received
copies of themSome Hon. Senators: No.
Senator Flynn: Well, if you did not get a copy, look in your
mail. Maybe you did not have time; look, honourable senators.
The question is as follows: When there is no motion or
proposal before the house unanimous consent must be given. i
did not personally say no, but at least two senators did say no.
So, that is the point I want to make, because those senators
have a right to their opinion. They have the right to say no
when there is a motion asking for the unanimous consent of
the house. That is the principle I want to safeguard despite the
good intentions of Senator Lamontagne.
[English]
Senator Sparrow: Honourable senators, I said no, and i
want to make it clear why I did so. My opinion is that if there
is a motion before the chamber, and it is adopted by a majority
at some point, then it can appear in the Minutes of the
Proceedingsof the Senate, but I said no, and I think that that
position will stand as far as the records are concerned. If
someone wishes to make a motion, and it is adopted by a
simple majority in this chamber, then certainly it can appear
in the Minutes of the Proceedings.
i would like to say this, that I do not take particular
exception to this letter, but I just do not believe that every item
that comes before this chamber should be printed in Hansard
simply as a result of someone's standing up and saying, "Let
us have it printed in the Minutes." That is the principle I am
standing on.
There are a number of letters that the Prime Minister has
written to the premiers of this country, and there are a number
of letters that have been received from the premiers by the
Prime Minister, copies of which each of us has received in the
mail. I have not checked my mail for that particular letter, but
I am assuming that it is there, as all other letters have been; if
it is not, then the Leader of the Government is going to see to
it, as he said he would, that I and all honourable senators get a
copy of it.
If that is not enough, then I think probably all of the
correspondence that has taken place in regard to this matter
should be tabled in this house, and then a motion should be put
forward that it all be incorporated in Hansard.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I will study
this case and give an answer tomorrow.

Honourable senators, as was stated in tbe report of Senator
Charles McElman on December 14 last, Canada was repre-

sented by a strong delegation at the Twenty-second Annual
Session of the North Atlantic Assembly wbicb was beld from
November 12 to 19 in Williamsburg, Virginia, on the occasion
of the bicentennial of the American independence. Our delegation, composed of five senators and 21 members of the House
of Commons, headed by Mr. Tom Lefebvre, M.P., was the
largest Canadian group in the history of the NATO Assembiy
and, I would like to add, the strongest. This is the first time, 1
believe, since the inception of NATO, that the Canadian
Senate was adequately represented and, therefore, made an
effective contribution in the five permanent committees of the
North Atlantic Assembly. Senator A. H. McDonald participated in the Military Committee; Senator C. R. McElman
in the Economic Committee; Senator Paul Lafond in the
Scientific and Tecbnical Committee; Senator David Walker in
the Education, Cultural Affairs and Information Committee.
That the work in these committees was heavy can be gatbered
from the excellent account given by Senator McElman, who
was active in the Economic Committee. Our role in the
committees, as well as in the plenary sessions of the Assembly,
was positively evident and effective and was generally
appreciated by the other NATO countries because our members bad acquired considerable experience as delegates at
previous sessions.
The majority of the delegates from the other chamber bad
previous experience in NATO assemblies, as had the Senate
representatives. As a resuit of the excellent cooperation of ail
members of three parties of the Canadian Parliament, the
Canadian presence and input was strong. Our achievements
were noticeable in policy decisions and in the structural organization of tbe Assembly. Mr. Paul Langlois, M.P., was reelected treasurer of the Assembly, and Mr. Ralpb Stewart was
elected chairman of the Education, Cultural Affairs and Information Committee, wbich I understand was the first time that
Canadians have held these positions. Unlike some of the other
countries, tbe Canadian delegation always presented a united
front and stand in the committees and in the plenary sessions,
which won us considerable respect.
This the fourth time that 1 have had the privilege of
representing the Senate in tbe Canadian delegations to the
North Atlantic Assembly. 1 had participated in tbe Eighteer:tb
Session in Bonn, Germany, in 1972; in the Twentieth Session
in London, the United Kingdom, in 1974, and in the Twentyfirst Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1975. At eacb of
those sessions I was a member of tbe Education, Cultural
Affairs and Information Committee, and twice I served on the
Political Committee as welI, as tbere bad flot been enough
senators to man each committee until last year. Because I
personally knew many delegates from tbe other countries, it
was easier for me to play a more active part in the work of this
committee, wbose stature has greatly increased since the
Helsinki Declaration. More was expected of me tbis time in
Williamsburg.
The Education, Cultural Affairs and Information Committee followed up the work and the resolutions of the previous
session. Since the chairman wbo had been elected last year was

SENATE DEBATES
subsequently defeated in an election and therefore was unable
to attend, it was our fortune that our Canadian delegate, Mr.
Ralph Stewart, was unanimously elected as the new chairman
until the next session. He did a good job.
The General Rapporteur, Lord Lyell, of the United Kingdom, presented the general report for discussion. The following
topics were dealt with:
1. The general political outlook in the NATO countries
2. Alexander Solzhenitsyn on the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
3. The new Soviet threat in Angola
4. The present state of the Alliance
5. Education in relation to NATO
6. The state of religion in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe
7. Proposed parliamentary staff exchange program
8. Responses from governments on the implementation
of the Third Basket of the Helsinki Declaration
9. Subcommittees' activities:
a. Subcommittee on the Survey of Textbooks in the
Alliance countries
b. Subcommittee on the Free Flow of Information
It is not my intention to discuss each of these important
topics, as this would take some time. I shall only make some
general comments. The economic weakness of Italy and the
United Kingdom affect the political strength of these countries
in the Alliance. As has been explained by Senator McElman,
much attention was paid to Eurocommunism in Italy and
France, as a rising threat to NATO. In a BBC television
interview last spring, which was reproduced for the members
of this Assembly, Solzhenitsyn presented an extremely powerful indictment of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact
countries with regard to the sincerity of their intentions to
permit free exchange of ideas, information and people in their
countries. He warns the West of the imminent threat to our
continued survival and calls upon the West to act now and use
every means at our disposal to compel the Soviet Union to live
up to its end of the bargain struck at Helsinki. The Alliance
appears to be in no immediate danger at this time because its
members continue to give considerable attention to effective
forms of defence.
On the topic of education, the position taken was that
educational matters have been slighted by the member countries of the Alliance and that we should be more concerned
that our ideas of freedom and democracy are being properly
transmitted to the young. Proposals were made for a study of
the status and content of citizenship education in the Alliance
and for a seminar-lecture program by Alliance parliamentarians. The question of the purpose and scope of higher education
is being explored for the next Assembly session.
The section on the religious situation in the Communist-bloc
countries explored the possible effect that the Helsinki accord
has had on religious freedom in those countries. The picture is
generally a rather grim one, except in Poland where the

February 1, 1977

Catholic Church is as strong as ever and the official position of
the Polish government appears to be one of religious tolerance.
It was here that I was able to provide more up-to-date
information, showing that since the Helsinki Agreement the
Soviet government bas actually stepped up the persecution of
religious denominations and leaders. As evidence, I submitted
for study a recent illustrated brochure, entitled "Soviet Persecution of Religion in Ukraine," providing documentation
which was published by the World Congress of Free Ukrainians, with headquarters in Toronto. This brochure was sent last
December to all senators and members of the House of
Commons. After discussion, the committee unanimously
accepted this brochure as an appendix to the general report.
Some attention was focussed on Recommendation 50, presented jointly by the Political Committee and the Committee
on Education, Cultural Affairs and Information and adopted
by the 21st Plenary Session in Copenhagen in 1975. Great
emphasis was placed upon the need for each government of the
Alliance to carefully monitor the implementation of the Helsinki Agreement. Statements were received from Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece,
Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the United States. The
other NATO members are urged to present the views of their
governments.
Recognizing that détente at the present time was "the only
alternative to policies of crises and confrontation" and that it
"does not mean an end to deep political and ideological
differences, nor the disappearance of super-power competition," last year's North Atlantic Assembly requested member
governments "to monitor carefully the implementation of
human, cultural, educational and information obligations in
the Helsinki Agreement so that a detailed accounting may be
presented to the follow-up conference in Belgrade in June
1977." For this purpose a Subcommittee on the Free Flow of
Information, composed of seven members, chaired by Mr.
Gessner of the Federal Republic of Germany, was established.
The subcommittee has issued two bulletins so far, and is
preparing for issues regarding the monitoring of the "third
basket," noting the violation of the Warsaw Pact countries.
• (2100)
The work of the subcommittee on the Free Flow of Information was approved, and its title was expanded by adding "and
People." It was decided to expand the size from seven to ten
members, which included the chairman of the Committee on
Education, Cultural Affairs and Information, Mr. Ralph
Stewart of Canada. The delegates from the Federal Republic
of Germany and the United States insisted that I become a
member of the subcommittee, and a motion was unanimously
passed to increase the size of the committee to eleven. Thus I
was elected to this subcommittee, which now includes two
Canadians. It will meet two or three times to prepare the
monitoring report to be presented at the follow-up Conference
on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is being
planned to be held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in June this year.
The Committee on Education, Cultural Affairs and Information also adopted a resolution urging the NATO countries

February 1, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

to include parliamentarians in the delegation to CSCE in
Belgrade, which was then adopted by the Assembly. This
resolution was initiated by the Canadian delegation, which felt
that parliamentarians were just as important as civil servants,
if not more so, in the formulation and implementation of
policies at the international level.
Honourable senators, each of the committees presented
several resolutions and recommendations to the plenary session. Most of them were approved in their original form, but
some were revised. I believe that some members of this chamber will be interested in giving closer examination to these
important matters, and, with leave, I should like to move that
the full texts of all the resolutions, recommendations and
orders, 57 in number, be appended to the Minutes of the
Proceedingsof the Senate of this day.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed?

détente. Under the détente the Helsinki Agreement had been
primarily manoeuvred by the Soviet Union to legitimate its
borders. It is important to remember that the "third basket"
was not favoured by the Soviet Union, which is faced with the
problem of curbing the growing number of its own dissidents.
The West has heard, and is hearing, from some of the most
important of these, such as Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, Litvinov,
Moroz, Amalrik and others, who are exposing the weaknesses
and injustices of this communist system, and some, such as the
historian Amalrik, are predicting the downfall of this regime
and the Soviet empire about 1984. They are appealing to the
democratic countries to strengthen their forces and to support
the dissidents in their struggle for the achievement of human
rights and the self-determination of the subjugated peoples in
the Soviet Union. Every effort must be made to make the
U.S.S.R. and its satellites adhere to the principles of the "third
basket" of the Helsinki accord, which they have endorsed.

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Yuzyk: I should like approval of the Senate to have
the resolutions, recommendations and orders of the NATO
Assembly appended to the Debates of the Senate of today.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?

In conclusion, I warned the members of the North Atlantic
Assembly that on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of
the Bolshevik revolution, in 1977 the Soviet regime will launch
a massive propaganda campaign in the West to extol the
virtues of Russian communism, while at the same time building up their military forces and armaments. The NATO
countries must counteract by strengthening their own military
forces and armaments, and equally important must be the
fostering of broad education in all our countries, which will
strengthen the political will and the democratic spirit of the
freedom of our peoples. Special attention must be paid to the
education of our youth throughout their school career to
enhance their faith in NATO to keep the world safe for
freedom and democracy. I was very happy that my speech was
warmly applauded.

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For text of document, see appendix "A".)
Senator Yuzyk: Honourable senators, I considered it a great
honour when I was asked by the chairman and the general
rapporteur of the Committee on Education, Cultural Affairs
and Information to address the plenary session of the
Assembly on behalf of the committee. They reminded me that
I was a vice-chairman of the Canadian NATO Parliamentary
Association, and that establishment of similar bodies in
NATO countries could substantially strengthen the work and
effectiveness of NATO in the parliaments and countries of the
alliance.
With the indulgence of honourable senators, I should like to
summarize briefly the ideas that I expressed. In its 27 years of
existence, NATO has been developing from the original military alliance into an Atlantic community, which is now beginning to resolve many common problems in the political, economic, social and cultural fields. NATO, as an international
body, is the bulwark of freedom and democracy, pitted against
the Soviet Russian imperialist, dictatorial, totalitarian, communist, police regime. The Soviet Russian empire, with more than
half the population being non-Russian, consists of 15 so-called
republics, dominated by the large Russian Soviet Federal
Socialist Republic. In reality, the other 14 republics have been
reduced to colonial status, and now are mere provinces. This
becomes evident when compared with the satellite countries
under Moscow domination. These satellites have their own
armies, currencies and embassies, but the component republics
of the U.S.S.R. do not possess these characteristics. Ukraine
and Byelorussia, who are members of the United Nations,
were not allowed representation at the Helsinki Conference.
External relations with the Soviet Union have gone through
three phases: cold war, peaceful co-existence, and now the

Honourable senators, I have returned from Williamsburg
satisfied that Canada is playing a constructive role in NATO,
which is being appreciated. The Canadian delegates to the
Twenty-second North Atlantic Assembly met last December
with the Minister of External Affairs, the Honourable Donald
Jamieson, and the Minister of National Defence, the Honourable B. J. Danson, with whom we have begun discussing the
problems of the Alliance. This cooperation of the government
with the parliamentarians will, hopefully, improve our role in
NATO as well as our international image.
Our parliamentarians and citizens should be aware of the
general contents of the views of the Canadian government with
respect to the implementation of the "third basket" of the
Helsinki Agreement. The Canadian government, in its presentation to the North Atlantic Assembly, supports and is contributing to the monitoring in preparation for the review
meeting in Belgrade, considering each "basket" of equal
importance. Of particular interest are the humanitarian issues,
especially family reunification, which was originally sponsored
by Canada. Eastern countries should pay more attention to
"basket three". Regarding the degree of success in resolving
family reunification, Canada presented the record of each of
these countries, with the assessment being:

SENATE DEBATES
In most cases Helsinki does not appear to have produced
any significant change in the number of cases.

(2110)

Actually the situation has worsened. In other areas of
implementation, Canada has found that western tourism to
East European countries has steadily increased, but the
number of easterners, that is from the other side of the iron
curtain, coming to Canada has even decreased from some of
these countries. The price of travel passports for Soviet citizens
has been reduced from approximately 400 to 100 rubles, but
exit visas are difficult to get. I quote:
In the field of the exchange of information and ideas
very little progress has occurred.
And the Soviets have stepped up the ideological campaign to
prevent inappropriate Western ideas from spreading in the
U.S.S.R., complaining against the CBC international service.
For this year the U.S.S.R. has broadened the Exchange Agreement of 1971, but little has been done. The following is the
concluding paragraph:
At the Belgrade review meeting in 1977 Canada will
most likely take a two-pronged approach. Without engaging in an exercise of recrimination, we shall remind the
Eastern countries of their obligations under the Final Act,
particularly in relation to human rights. Our second
approach will be to seek ways to further what progress
has been made since Helsinki 1975 so that the momentum
of the entire Conference is not lost.
From the above statements it appears obvious that the
Canadian government is avoiding mention of Soviet persecution of religion, in spite of having received memoranda from
many Canadian churches and secular organizations. So far the
Prime Minister has turned a deaf car, which I hope will
change. Religious persecution is a flagrant violation of human
rights, and pressure must be brought to bear on the governments of the Soviet Union and the satellite countries. The
evidence of the Soviet persecution is overwhelming and
undeniable and therefore the violation of human rights must
be condemned in the United Nations and at Belgrade. The
Canadian government should not be passive but, in the face of
the mounting evidence, must condemn the Soviet and satellite
persecution of religion and their double standards, and
demand the fulfilment of human rights, which they have
endorsed. If the Canadian government fails to do this, it leaves
itself open to the allegation that it condones such inhumanity,
making it look as hypocritical as the Soviet regime.
Honourable senators, the observance of the 28th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights last December
10 in several centres in Canada, and in many other countries
of the world, should remind all people, leaders, governments,
and particularly parliamentarians, that this basic United
Nations document embodies all aspects of the freedom of
many people and nations. Although much has been accomplished in this field, much still remains to be pursued, if the
principles are to be fully implemented and upheld.

February 1, 1977

We must also remember that some United Nations members who have sanctioned the Declaration have consistently
violated human rights in their countries. The largest of these
countries is the Soviet Union, the largest totalitarian empire of
subjugated nations. We have become more aware of the
large-scale persecution of dissidents and religion in the
U.S.S.R. from the recent statements and publications of
Solzhenitsyn, the great Russian writer; Sakharov, the father of
the Soviet atomic bomb; Moroz, the Ukrainian historian, and
many others.
We know that the Soviet regime has liquidated the large
Ukrainian Orthodox and Ukrainian Catholic churches, Judaic
congregations, and most of the churches of other peoples,
many of which have counterparts in Canada and, under Stalin,
has executed large numbers and imprisoned in forced labour
camps millions of the leaders, common people and adherents
of all religious denominations. We know that millions have
undergone similar harsh treatment for having political ideas
different from those of the Communist Party leadership or for
having been critical of the Soviet government. We know that
the recent wave of persecutions of large numbers of dissenters,
many religious, in Ukraine, the Baltic states, of Jews, Russians
and intellectuals of other origins, who have defended language
and cultural rights, freedom of speech, freedom to emigrate,
freedom to worship, which are ostensibly guaranteed by the
constitution of the U.S.S.R. and the republics, employed such
methods as closed trials meting out prison sentences up to 25
years, intimidation, torture and internment in mental asylums.
Amnesty International has not been allowed to investigate
these cases and to provide defence.
Not only must these flagrant violations of human rights in
the Soviet Union, in the Soviet satellites and other countries
who are UN members and signatories of the Charter and the
Declaration be outrightly condemned, but they must also be
compelled by the UN to allow investigation teams in these
countries and to respect human rights. The UN Human Rights
Commission must be given power to deal effectively with
violations and violators.
The Soviet Union is a signatory to several international
accords in which it pledges to promote the observance of
human rights for all, notwithstanding their religious beliefs or
practices. Here are some of the U.S.S.R. pledges that were
signed by the government of the Soviet Union.
Firstly, that every person has the "right to freedom of
thought, conscience and religion" and the right "to manifest
his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and
observance."
Secondly, to "promote understanding, tolerance and friendship" among all religious groups through its educational
system.
Thirdly, to guarantee the rights of parents to choose the
educational system which would "ensure the religious and
moral education of their children in conformity with their own
convictions."

Fourthly, to recognize the right of each citizen to participate
in public affairs, to vote and be elected to public office and to
"have access on general terms of equality, to public service in
his country."
Fifthly, to ensure the right of all religious minorities to
profess and practise their own religions. All of these points are
found in the United Nations Charter; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention Against Discrimination in Education; and the Helsinki Accord, Basket Three.
Although the Soviet Constitution of 1936 guarantees the
"freedom of conscience" including "freedom of religious worship and of anti-religious propaganda," these guarantees are
nullified by the perversion of legality which characterizes the
entire Soviet administrative system. Unpublished administrative orders take precedence over published ones and decrees
supersede statutes and laws. Through such double standards
the Soviet regime exercises sweeping powers over religion,
religious groups and individual believers and adherents.
Here are some of these insidious powers.
Firstly, through the procedure of obligatory "registration"
all local congregations are either legalized or banned. Lists of
members must be submitted to local authorities; such believers
are then discriminated against in their occupations, in housing
allocations, et cetera.
Secondly, every minister of religion, known as "servant of a
cult," must be "registered" before being allowed to carry out
his duties; this "registration" can be granted, denied, or withdrawn as in the case of local congregations.
Thirdly, the state owns all houses of worship and their
contents, which can be leased or denied at any time. Even if a
church is denied a lease, permission must be obtained on each
occasion for a group to meet in a private home, which is
usually denied.

destroyed by the government. Religious persecution is being
systematically carried out as it is the objective of atheistic
Marxism-Leninism to totally eradicate all forms of religion.
All freedom-loving people and democrats must come to the
defence of the churches and believers, as well as the dissidents
and the subjugated nations, in their heroic struggle for the
recognition and implementation of human rights in the Communist-bloc countries.
Let us remember that human rights are equated with freedom and democracy, the most precious heritage of mankind,
and the cornerstone of the Canadian way of life. Freedom and
democracy are being systematically destroyed by totalitarian,
dictatorial regimes in many parts of the world. Canada must
therefore play a leading role in keeping NATO strong, as this
is in ber best interests. Wholehearted support of NATO should
be the cornerstone of our foreign policy.

Forces participating in the maintenance of peace and
security?
2. What is the size of the force in each case?
3. On whose invitation, at what cost per annum and for
how long have Canadian Armed Forces been participating

Senator Desruisseaux: Honourabie senators, 1 shouid like to
point out to Senator Grosart, in respect of the question he
raised on my inquiry, that the phrase "he will inquire" aiso
appears in Inquiry No. 2 and, in the case of Inquiry No. 3, the
phrase is "she wili inquire."
Senator Grosart: 0f course, this raises the question of
whether we shouid have oral and written questions ciearly
defined. Many of the questions that are put in Question Period
are obviousiy questions which, under our ruies, as i interpret
them, should be regarded as written questions. If we are going
to have written and oral questions, weil and good, but i think
they shouid be so defined so that we know the difference.

Fbur 1, 1977
February ,17

When an honourable senator says he will inquire of the
government, normaily we are entitied to expect to wait until he
does inquire. We have neyer made a practice in the Senate of
separating oral and written questions, and perhaps the Leader
of the Government shouid take this under consideration.
Senator Desruisseaux: i appreciate Senator Grosart's
remarks on this, but 1 shouid like to point out to him that,
after saying that 1 wouid inquire of the government, i did read
these questions.
Senator Forsey: You have inquired now.

RECOMMENDATION 53
on the NATO research and fellowship programme
The Assembly,
Noting that Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty calls
upon the Parties to contribute to a better understanding of the
principles upon which their free institutions are founded;
Recognizing that our greatest claim to the affection and
loyalty of men comes from our ideas and philosophy;
Concerned that these ideas and philosophy should be transmitted to the young;
Regretting that NATO has not devoted much attention to
the field of education and cultural affairs;
Considering that the Committee on Education, Cultural
Affairs and Information wishes to encourage and assist in
projects aimed at promoting an understanding of our free
institutions and the conditions necessary to sustain them;
RECOMMENDS that:
1. the North Atlantic Council, in the spirit of Article 2
of the North Atlantic Treaty, provide increased support
for the NATO research and fellowship programme;
2. the NATO research and fellowship programme, in
association with the Committee on Education, Cultural
Affairs and Information, support scholarship which would
explore the status and content of citizenship education in
selected countries of the Alliance.
RECOMMENDATION 54
on reinforcement
The Assembly,
Recognizing the importance of rapid and timely reinforcements to the NATO strategy of flexible response;
Welcoming the demonstration of this capability in this
year's Autumn Forge Exercise;
Noting the importance of prepositioned equipment and
stocks of equipment and fuel to the reinforcement strategy;
Concerned, however, that there remain serious deficiencies
in NATO's reinforcement strategy;
Conscious that member governments are not making sufficient use of the civilian resources available to them;
Concerned at the random reliance on merchant shipping for
sea lift capability and that NATO deficiencies in ASW vessels
will mean heavy losses at sea;
Recognizing the importance of the "in place" forces, alarmed
at recent reports concerning the combat readiness of these
forces and the problems involved in the mobilization procedures to bring them to full strength;
RECOMMENDS that the Defence Planning Committee of
NATO:
1. make available to the Military Committee of the
North Atlantic Assembly, a detailed study of NATO's
80003-19

current reinforcement potential to counter aggression
both in the Center and on the Flanks, with particular
reference to current deficiencies and the extent to which
these are being addressed;
2. encourage member governments to make the maximum use of civilian resources including the financing of
the modifications needed for the utilization of civilian
aircraft and the provision of specialized merchant
shipping;
3. inform the Military Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly of the present deficiencies concerning the
combat readiness, current 'on line' force strengths and
mobilization procedures for NATO's 'in place' forces.
RECOMMENDATION 55
on the Soviet maritime threat
The Assembly,
Noting the continued expansion of the Soviet Navy since the
special Report on the Soviet maritime threat presented by the
Military Committee in 1972;
Noting that the power of the Soviet Navy is likely to reach
its peak relative to NATO in the next 3-5 years;
Concerned that the danger to NATO's oil supplies from the
Persian Gulf and the Middle East has considerably increased
since 1972;
Concerned that member governments of the Alliance continue to underestimate the danger of the Soviet maritime threat;
Alarmed that the ratio of Soviet nuclear submarines to
NATO ASW vessels is increasing in the Soviets' favour;
Noting the recent deployment of Soviet airpower in the form
of the Kiev and the practice in Operation Okean of attacking
convoys;
RECOMMENDS that the North Atlantic Council:
1. urge member governments to give top priority to
increasing the strength of NATO ASW vessels and
aircraft;
2. reinforce the authority given to SACLANT with
regard to planning the protection of vital shipping lanes.
RECOMMENDATION 56
on the rationalization of defence resources
The Assembly,
Recognizing the budgetary constraints which continue to
affect the abilities of member countries to sustain defence
expenditure;
Recalling its previous recommendations in this respect, particularly the Ottawa recommendation to the Defence Planning
Committee to investigate as a matter of urgency the possibility
of reducing the number of separate fully fledged national
armed services in order to make, through gradual integration

and a new division of labour, North Atlantic defence more
effective as well as to obtain better value for money;
Noting that in this field no substantial progress has been
made;
Concerned at the losses, both in financial terms and in
combat effectiveness, to NATO's forces through the consistent
failure to co-operate in the development and production of
armaments;
Recognizing that in the short term considerable low cost
improvements can be made to military efficiency through
measures designed to increase the interoperability of forces
and systems, particularly through the implementation of STANAGS (Standardisation Agreements);
Welcoming the formation by the NATO Council of the Ad
Hoc Group on interoperability;
Noting the Secretary General's comments to last year's
Recommendation that the CNAD are beginning to plan new
equipment on the basis of required military missions, concepts,
the threat to be countered and the mix of weapons required;
Stressing that these activities should be intensified to facilitate the input of NATO agreed doctrine and requirements into
CNAD planning;
Welcoming the recent agreement between the United States
and German governments in their attempt to co-ordinate their
tank development programmes as a positive sign of high level
political involvement with, and dedication to, the achievement
of greater standardisation;
RECOMMENDS that the North Atlantic Council:
1. review the possibilities of improving NATO's effectiveness as indicated by the Ottawa declaration;
2. make available to the Military Committee of the
North Atlantic Assembly the results of the working
groups of the Ad Hoc Group on interoperability;
3. provide the necessary political leadership to help
overcome the problems which national industries might
encounter during the process towards standardization of
armaments.
RECOMMENDATION 57

should commemorate the Thirtieth Anniversary of the proclamation of the Marshall Plan by convening a conference to
undertake a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy of
existing NATO institutions and to formulate recommendations for strengthening and perfecting these institutions over
the next thirty years.
RECOMMENDATION 58
on a reassessment of NATO institutions
The Assembly,
Concerned at the inability of member governments to cope
with the increasing pressures on defense expenditures;
Concerned at the inefficiency inherent in the present system
of allied co-operation which leads to a wastage of resources
and an ultimate weakening of the credibility of the Alliance;
Considering that the present Alliance framework could be
improved to cope with these trends and other problems;
Noting the growing belief within European political circles
that a stronger European identity is essential for the future of
the Alliance;
Noting a growing recognition within the United States of
the need for the evolution of a more cohesive European entity,
capable of playing a fully responsible and credible role within
the Alliance;
Noting the difficulties inherent in the process of European
unification with regard to the formulation of a common
defence policy;
Urges the European member governments to take action in
order to examine the desirability and the possibilities or a
proper common responsibility of the European partners in
defence efforts, within a new conception of NATO.
RECOMMENDS that the North Atlantic Council:
establish a project (study group) to investigate the possibility
of a thorough reassessment of the institutions of the Alliance,
giving attention to the possible advantages and disadvantages
of a new framework, based on the two-pillar-concept in which
the European States co-operate with their North American
partners.

on the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Marshall Plan

RECOMMENDATION 59

The Assembly,
Recognizing that the year 1977 marks the Thirtieth Anniversary of the proclamation of the Marshall Plan;
Recognizing the importance of that initiative for the cause
of Western freedom, security and prosperity;
Recognizing that our continued well-being depends on the
quality of our intellectual imagination and upon our willingness to provide forums and opportunities in which creative
impulses like the Marshall Plan may be born;

on nuclear proliferation

RECOMMENDS that the North Atlantic Council:

The Assembly,
Concerned by the spread of nuclear power around the world
and the resulting danger of more and more countries becoming
capable of making nuclear explosive materials;
Worried by the danger that plutonium might be obtained by
small terrorist groups and used for political blackmail in
countries where security measures are inadequate;
Underlining the relative inefficiency of safeguards due to
lack of control, and the imminent danger that future govern-

ments of new nuclear countries may not feel bound to safeguards agreed on today;
Welcoming the restrictions on the export of sensitive nuclear
technologies agreed to by the London group of nuclear exporting countries, and hoping that they can be further improved;
RECOMMENDS that the North Atlantic Council:
1. provide an indepth study of the proliferation
problem;
2. establish itself as a forum of continous consultation
among member governments exporting nuclear technology with a view to developing a homogenous policy of
Alliance member countries on proliferation;
3. elaborate strict regulations in nuclear exports and
strengthened safeguards;
4. consider the possibility of excluding countries which
are not members of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty from
receiving any nuclear technology from Alliance member
countries if they are unwilling to provide a full guarantee
that they accept the strict inspection and supervision
measures foreseen by the NPT;
5. develop alternatives to delivering facilities for uranium enrichment, the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and
the refining of heavy water to non-nuclear countries.
RESOLUTION 43

mainly in the framework of the United Nations General
Assembly, UNCTAD and the "North-South Dialogue" in
Paris;
Concerned by the failure of the member governments of the
Alliance to determine so far a common stand on the scope and
objectives of their negotiating position towards the developing
countries;
Convinced that a failure in achieving an agreement with
those countries could imply the risk of entering an age of
festering resentment, increased resort to economic warfare, a
hardening of new blocs, the undermining of co-operation, and
the erosion of international institutions;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
1. to develop a common policy concerning the future
shape of the world economic order;
2. to offer developing countries concrete proposals on a
restructuring of the world economy and a new world-wide
division of labour;
3. to work out an effective export earnings stabilization
scheme for the developing countries to allow them to
develop and diversify their economies, taking into consideration the experience gained in the framework of the
STABEX scheme, as established by the EEC under the
Lomé Convention.

paying tribute to President Wayne L. Hays

RESOLUTION 45

The Assembly,
Whereas its President, the Hon. Wayne L. Hays, is unable
to take part in the proceedings of the 22nd Annual Session due
to poor health;
Recognizing his many creative and substantial contributions
to the early development and growth of the Assembly;
Recognizing his perseverance and continued solid support
for the aims of the Assembly;
Recalling his unswerving loyalty to and support of the
Atlantic Alliance as a member of the United States Congress
and, from 1955 until 1976, as a leading member of the North
Atlantic Assembly;
EXTENDS its sincere and heartfelt appreciation to President Wayne L. Hays and conveys to him expression of gratitude for all his work to promote friendship across the Atlantic,
and best wishes from all of his colleagues.

on a joint strategy for further economic development

RESOLUTION 44
on an improvement of the world economic order
The Assembly,
Recalling its Resolution 30, adopted at the 21st Annual
Session in September 1975;
Noting the results of international discussions with regard to
the achievement of a "new international economic order",

80003-19'/2

The Assembly,
Welcoming the economic recovery in most member
countries;
Mindful of the economic difficulties of some member countries, which, for various reasons, have not been able so far to
find an appropriate policy out of the world recession;
Stressing the need for improved co-operation with regard to
achieving a comparable level of economic development;
Underlining the importance of making every possible effort
to develop the necessary instruments to prevent another recession, similar to the recent one;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
1. to study carefully the origins of the recent worldwide economic recession and to draw the necessary political conclusions;
2. to improve their co-operation by holding regular
economic summit meetings;
3. to maintain specific policies of co-operation and
solidarity towards member countries of the Alliance
facing particular difficulties;
4. with regard to the improvement of international
economic co-operation, to ask all institutions dealing with
statistics to work out a scheme to make it possible to

compare the different economic figures, especially those
on unemployment and inflation.
RESOLUTION 46
on floor prices for raw materials and their impact on
international trade
The Assembly,
Considering the implications of fixing floor prices for certain raw materials;
Mindful of the necessity of protecting investments in the
exploitation of indigenous raw materials resources which are
undertaken to decrease national economic dependence on certain raw materials supplies;
Stressing, however, that this protection would also be possible through other ways and means than the fixing of the floor
price;
Desirous to minimize the obstacles for a just and open world
trade and economy;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
to abstain from fixing floor prices for raw materials and to
develop alternative solutions for the protection of investments
in the exploitation of indigenous raw materials.
RESOLUTION 47
on energy supplies
The Assembly,
Appreciative of the work donc in 1976 by the Joint SubCommittee on Energy Supplies;
Deploring the failure to diminish the dependence of its
member countries on oil imports from Arab oil exporting
countries;
Underlining the imminent possibility of a new oil shortage in
1977;
Recognizing the most useful international work done in the
framework of the OECD, its International Energy Agency and
elsewhere;
Noting the energy conservation efforts in all countries;
Believing that due to lack of competitiveness or sufficiently
advanced technology, alternative energy sources will not, in
the near future, bring the decisive relief for the energy supplies
situation which it was hoped they would provide;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
1. to make every effort to achieve an early agreement
with the non-European oil exporting countries on mutually fruitful co-operation;
2. to continue the efforts to save energy, and to develop
the maximum potential for further energy conservation,

especially by applying all measures recommended by the
International Energy Agency;
3. to continue giving support for energy research and
development programmes even if, for the time being,
some alternative energy sources are not competitive.
RESOLUTION 48
on the human, cultural, educational and informational aspects
of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
The Assembly,
Believing that the continuation of the process of "détente"
between East and West is in the interest of both;
Noting that "détente" must yield improvements in the daily
lives of people for it to be regarded as truly significant;
Mindful of the many charges and countercharges from both
East and West regarding a lack of implementation of the
humanitarian aspects of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe;
Emphasizing the continuing necessity to carefully monitor
developments, positive and negative, in the so-called "Third
Basket" of the Helsinki Agreement in order to adequately
prepare for the follow-up conference scheduled to take place in
Belgrade in June 1977;
Recognizing the contribution to this monitoring being made
by the Sub-Committee on the Free Flow of Information;
Recognizing also that Western views on implementation of
the humanitarian aspects of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe evidence some differences;
Recognizing further that access to information is prerequisite to parliamentary policy considerations regarding the forthcoming CSCE follow-up conference to be held in Belgrade;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
1. to take a most careful accounting of the implementation of the human, cultural, educational and information
obligations in the Helsinki Accord;

order to speak, as inuch as possible, with one voice
regarding implementation in the "Third Basket" of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at
the follow-up conference in Belgrade;
3. to make periodic and detailed reports to the parliaments of their respective countries;
4. to include members of parliament in their delegations to the follow-up conference.
RESOLUTION 49
on the protection of North Sea energy sources
The Assembly,
Recognizing the importance of the new oil and gas installations to the economies of member countries;

Emphasizing the vulnerability of these installations to a
wide range of threats both during times of peace and war;
Concerned at the substantial increase in size and economic
importance of this responsibility and the inadequacy of present
protective measures;
Welcoming the decision that NATO will co-ordinate their
protection in time of war;
Noting the vital necessity for good communications and
crisis control;
Welcoming
Conference;

the

formation

of

the ad

hoc

Regional

URGES the interested member governments of the North
Atlantic Alliance:
1. to ensure maximum co-ordination with regard to
standardized equipment and doctrine;
2. to establish a centralized crisis management and
communications organization;
3. to establish machinery for the rapid transfer of
responsibility to NATO in time of tension.
RESOLUTION 50
on Atlantic co-operation for tactical combat aircraft
The Assembly,
Concerned that standardization is one of the most important
objectives the Alliance has to reach to strengthen its interior
capabilities by furthering the cost effectiveness of the financial
input member countries undertake;
Concerned that the best way to get full standardization is to
begin as early as possible the standardization of military
requirements and at least common production of main weapon
systems;
URGES:
that members governments participating in the European Programme Group obtain agreement as soon as possible to cooperate with the United States government in order to reach a
US-European Memorandum of Understanding for a common
requirement, design and development of a tactical combat
aircraft for the late 1980's and the 1990's.
RESOLUTION 51
on interoperability of communication systems
The Assembly,
Recognizing that seven NATO nations plan to introduce
new major tactical communication systems of six different
types in the next seven years;
Recognizing that not one of these seven systems is directly
interoperable with any of the others or with the NATO
integrated communications systems;

Recognizing that it will be 1995 or later before the equipment can be realistically replaced with fully standardized
inter-operable systems;
URGES:
the NATO countries concerned to work together while there is
still time in order to achieve a more acceptable measure of
interoperability.
RESOLUTION 52
on European defence co-operation
The Assembly,
Recognizing the necessity of the development of a coordinated European approach to the development and production of armaments within the Alliance;
Welcoming the formation and progress of the European
Programme Group as a tangible sign of co-operation between
European members of the Alliance in this field;
Noting that the activities of the Eurogroup continue in fields
not covered in the European Programme Group;
Concerned that the future progress of the European Programme Group should be maintained within the framework of
the Alliance;
Concerned that the impetus developed by the Eurogroup
towards the establishment of a "two-way street" with the
United States in the development and production of armaments should not be lost;
Convinced that negotiations between members of the
Alliance on armaments programmes would be greatly facilitated if compensation agreements did not necessarily have to take
place on a project by project basis;
Welcoming the legislation recently passed by the Congress
of the United States concerning standardization and European
co-operation as a sign of the seriousness of United States
intentions towards this issue;
Recognizing the need for a European response to these
declarations;
Urges all European member governments:
1. that European co-ordination in the development and
production of armaments as developed in the European
Programme Group should take place within the framework and the spirit of the Alliance with its final objective
the development of a cohesive European response to the
United States;
2. that if the European Programme Group fails to
facilitate a European response that will further Alliance
standardization, the Eurogroup redevelop its earlier initiative concerning the "two-way street";
3. to develop a mechanism comparable with that of the
American/Canadian material co-operation agreements
which will facilitate multiproject compensation between
member states over a number of years;

4. to examine seriously the need for a permanent
secretariat for the European Programme Group in order
for it to function as a European Procurement Agency.
RESOLUTION 53
on a common nuclear export policy
The Assembly,
Recognizing that the spread of nuclear weapon capabilities
threatens world peace, undermines the security of NATO and
the stability of the international community generally;
Recognizing that the spread of nuclear weapons capability is
facilitated by the commercial sale or transfer of plants which
separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel, by exports of
strategically significant quantities of highly enriched uranium,
separated plutonium, or plutonomium-bearing reprocessed
reactor fuel and by the way the storage of nuclear wastes is
handled;
Recognizing that such activities give a recipient country a
near-term capability for nuclear weapons which creates anxieties and instabilities among other countries irrespective of
whether a recipient country actually takes the final step of
producing nuclear weapons itself;
Recognizing that the technology and arrangements for
effectively safeguarding nuclear material which can be fashioned into nuclear bombs are not yet at hand;
Recognizing that peaceful nuclear power has in the view of
many nations an important and legitimate role to play in
helping nations to meet the problems of the worldwide energy
crisis and the problems created by the monopolistic practice of
the OPEC oil exporting nations;
Recognizing that the principal suppliers of nuclear material
and technology have already joined together informally in the
so-called 'nuclear suppliers club' to seek co-ordination of policies and practices respecting nuclear exports to non-nuclear
weapons states;
URGES the governments of the member countries of the
North Atlantic Alliance:
1. to agree forthwith to defer for the present the
transfer of nuclear reprocessing facilities to non-nuclear
weapons countries pending agreement upon satisfactory
international safeguards and standards designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities;
2. to consider the desirability of regional centres for
recipient countries under effective international control
for the storage of spent reactor fuel, the fabrication of
low-enriched uranium fuel elements, and the conduct of
critical reactor experimentation;
3. to insist that nuclear safeguards provide for timely
warning of diversion of nuclear material capable of
making atomic weaponry;
4. to support urgently efforts to strengthen, expand and
update the authority and capability of the IAEA, Eura-

tom, and/or other international institutions now existing
or which may be established, to deal with nuclear facilities provided to non-nuclear weapons states for the purpose of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and further adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, while facilitating the development of peaceful
uses of nuclear power.
RESOLUTION 54
on the coming to power of Communist parties
The Assembly,
Disturbed at the impact that the coming to power in
member countries of the Alliance of representatives of Communist parties would have on the structure and solidity of the
Atlantic Alliance;
Expresses its scepticism at statements by some of the representatives of these parties undertaking to respect the expression of universal suffrage within a society that would remain
pluralistic, and to maintain alliances already concluded,
primarily the Atlantic Alliance;
Takes the view that giving credence to the declarations of
some of the Communist parties referred to above would lead to
disarming public opinion with respect to the pursuit of the
necessary defence policy for the West;
Recalls that the main aim of the Alliance is, while guaranteeing the right of all peoples to self-determination, to defend
the fundamental principles of a free society and that such
defence cannot compromise with the danger that the coming to
power of parties whose collectivist doctrine is diametrically
opposed to those principles would represent.
RESOLUTION 55
on future East-West relations and détente
The Assembly,
Recalling that the relaxation of tensions is one of several
important elements of security between East and West;
Concerned at the lack of progress of East-West negotiations
on arms control and disarmament, especially the selective
détente policy by the Soviet Union pursued for the unilateral
military improvement of Soviet positions worldwide;
Deploring the reluctance of East European countries to
implement the Final Act of the CSCE in all aspects, especially
in the sphere of human rights, the reuniting of families and the
freer exchange of peoples, ideas and information;
Referring to the obligations incurred by the participants in
the CSCE concerning the respect for human rights as an
essential prerequisite to friendly relations between nations, and
in particular to the glaring example of violations of human
rights at the inner-German border, which also constitutes the
dividing line between NATO and the Warsaw Pact;

Considering that détente and East-West co-operation have
already had some results which have made possible more
human and economic contacts;
Stressing the need for further improvements of these and
other contacts and the continuity of the détente process;
URGES member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
1. to press for new initiatives which can help to stop an
arms race and facilitate arms control measures;
2. to review thoroughly and realistically all results in
implementing the Final Act of the CSCE before CSCE
participants meet in Belgrade in June 1977, and to decide
on the approach Alliance members should take with
respect to future détente policies;
3. to bring political and moral influence to bear on the
Government of the German Democratic Republic, causing it to respect within its territory all obligations on
human rights and fundamental freedoms according to the
Final Act of CSCE and the respective documents of the
United Nations.
RESOLUTION 56
on Alliance political problems
The Assembly,
Welcomes the report of the General Rapporteur to the
Political Committee as a valuable personal contribution by
him to a new and sustained reassessment of Alliance political
problems in the light of our experience of the consequences of
détente and notes its contents;
Reaffirms its determination to ensure that the security
preparations of the Atlantic Alliance be maintained at a level
which will provide an effective shield for the Alliance and all
of its constituent members against unacceptable military and
psychological pressure which might result from the continued
buildup of the military capabilities of the Soviet Bloc; and
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
to support the suggestion of President-Elect Carter that the
time has come for a new architectural effort within the
Alliance with an appreciation of the supreme importance of
giving the highest priority to the economic health of members
of the Alliance in order best to achieve its objectives, namely
peace and prosperity with justice to the people of the world.
RESOLUTION 57
on Spain
The Assembly,
Considering the role played by Spain in the overall defence
pattern of Western Europe;
Considering the progress made by that country towards
making its institutions democratic;

Considering that it is desirable and in the joint interests of
both parties for the Assembly to establish relations with Spain;
Considering, however, that such contacts should not lead to
the approval of any procedure for the admission of Spain to
the Alliance until democratic conditions are fully reestablished
in that country;
Welcoming the efforts made by the Spanish Crown and
Government to lead their country towards democracy;
EXPRESSES the wish that Spanish parliamentary observers should be invited to attend future meetings of the
Assembly immediately after the next free general elections;
STATES, however, that admission of Spain to the Alliance
proper cannot be considered until such time as a truly democratic system has been fully restored in that country.
RESOLUTION 58
on Southern Africa
The Assembly,
Concerned at the deterioration of the political situation in
Southern Africa which constitutes a threat to international
peace and security;
Considering that member countries must adopt a position of
responsibility towards this situation based on a concern for
human rights, a commitment to greater economic and social
justice in the world, and a desire for international peace and
security;
Confirming the United Nations Charter which states that
"international peace can only be obtained on a foundation of
self determination, fundamental freedom and human rights,
for all without regard to race, sex, language or religion";
Condemning the policy of racial discrimination known as
"apartheid" practised by South Africa as totally abhorrent
and utterly irreconcilable with the fundamental rights and
freedoms established by the Charter of the United Nations
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
Condemning South Africa's policy of continued illegal occupation of, and the extension of apartheid to Namibia, and her
refusal to comply with the demands of the Security Council;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic

modifying the arms race, provided that these initiatives
are genuinely multilateral and involve no unilateral weakening of the Alliance;
4. to encourage programmes which direct the interest of
scientists and researchers towards fields which also constitute challenges to our societies: food, energy, raw materials, medicine, the exploitation of oceans and the protection of the environment.
RESOLUTION 60
on a rational development of the oceans
The Assembly,
Noting the growing interest at the international level for all
questions pertaining to the oceans;
Noting the tremendous prospects for the exploitation of
marine resources;
Regretting the failure so far to achieve an international
consensus at the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference;
Hoping, however, that it will become possible to realize the
concept of the oceans being a common heritage for humanity;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
1. to undertake the necessary steps regarding the early
ratification of the proposed two-hundred mile economic
zone;
2. to support the proposal of creating an international
body, under the United Nations, entrusted with regulating and managing sea development outside the two-hundred mile economic zone;
3. to establish a "common heritage fund for humanity"
to be managed by the United Nations, to which developed
countries would allocate a certain percentage of their
revenues from exploiting the two-hundred mile economic
zone, and to use this fund, among other things, for the
promotion of marine environment protection and of the
transfer of technology to developing countries;

4. to establish institutions and mechanisms for the
efficient control of the transnational corporations' activities in the development of marine resources, with a view

on control of narcotics
The Assembly,
Recalling its Recommendation 13 adopted at the 1971
Annual Session in Ottawa;
Noting the actions taken by the member governments of the
Alliance on Recommendation 13;
Deploring that uncontrolled and illicit cultivation of the
opium poppy, the coca bush and the cannabis plant continues
on a substantial scale, especially in Eastern Asian countries
and in Mexico;
Underlining the importance of continued vigilance, since
drug abuse has not by any means diminished;
Regretting that the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances could still not enter into force, being the only drug
control treaty which has not obtained the necessary number of
accessions;
URGES the member governments of the North Atlantic
Alliance:
1. to make every effort to ratify and implement the
1971 Conventión on Psychotropic Substances, and the

the structural development or other measures;
Convinced that any appropriate further policy aimed at
taking precautions against structural unemployment could be
ruined if no attempt is made towards establishing a system of

ORDER 15
on a parliamentary staff exchange programme
The Assembly,
Aware that the parliamentary staff who assist the national
delegations of the Assembly perform an extremely significant
role in the work of the Assembly;
Recognizing that it would be highly desirable for parliamentary staff members to acquire an understanding of the operating procedures in the parliaments of member countries;
Recognizing also that parliamentary staff members would
greatly benefit from an understanding of the attitude member
parliaments have towards the Alliance;
Mindful that understanding of the operating procedures and
attitudes of member parliaments is best achieved from direct
observation in another parliament;
Recalling Order 13 on a parliamentary staff exchange
programme;
Recalling also that the General Report of 1975 observed
that while the funding and administration of such a programme had encountered some difficulties, the Chairman and
the International Secretariat believed this was a programme
worth pursuing;
REQUESTS:
the Standing Committee to ask the International Secretariat
to study further the feasibility of establishing and financing a
programme of exchange between parliamentary staff members
whose work directly benefits the Assembly.
ORDER 16
on the survey of textbooks used in the school systems of
selected Alliance countries
The Assembly,
Welcoming the final Report on the survey of the contents of
textbooks used in the school systems of selected Alliance
countries;
Thanking the Atlantic Information Centre for Teachers for
remaining cooperative and responsive throughout the period
covered by this study;

Noting that a study such as this may well be of interest to a
much wider audience;
Recognizing that due to the qualitative and quantitative
aspects of this study a judicious use of the study will require
some consideration;
REQUESTS:
the Standing Committee to take under consideration the
matter of how this material may best be used so as to
contribute to a greater public understanding of the present
state of the Alliance.
ORDER 17
on relations between the Assembly and NATO
The Assembly,
Considering the importance of the work of the North Atlantic Assembly in helping to realize the objectives of the North
Atlantic Alliance;
Recognizing the critical importance of the economic problems faced by member countries of the Alliance and the need
to utilize the provisions of Article 2 of the North Atlantic
Treaty;
REQUESTS:
the President of the Assembly and the Standing Committee to
confer with the Secretary General of NATO and other appropriate authorities in the Alliance in order to establish better
means for receiving, considering and conveying the answers of
the NATO Council to all the recommendations and inquiries
of the Assembly, and to establish the part the Assembly should
take in the work of the Alliance and in pursuance of all its
objectives.

Wednesday, Fehruary 2, 1977

The Senate met at 2 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.
Prayers.
PATRIATION 0F THE CONSTITUTION
LETTERS FROM PRIME MINISTER TO PROVINCIAL PREMIERS
PRINTED AS APPENDIX

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, yesterday the
Leader of the Government tabled a number of documents, and
among them were copies of letters from the Prime Minister of
Canada to the premiers of the provinces concerning the patriation of the Constitution, witb draft resolution attacbed thereto,
dated January 19, 1977, as recorded in the Minutes of the
Senate at page 179.
Incidentai to this proceeding the Honourable Senator Forsey
requested that the letters be printed in the Debates of ihe
Senate. The following excbange with respect to this request
took place, and will be found at page 279 of yesterday's
Debates:
THE HON. THE SPEAKER: Honourable senators, is it
agreed that the letters referred to by Senator Forsey be
printed in the Minutes of today's proceedings?
SENATOR GROSART: No. If it is with leave, no.
THE HON. THE SPEAKER: On division?
SENATOR GROSART: No. There is no motion. No leave.
THE HON. THE SPEAKER: Is there a majority of senators saying yes?
SENATOR FLYNN: 1 heard two "nos."
THE HON. THE SPEAKER: Those who are in favour, say
yes.
SOME HON. SENATORS: Yes.
THE HON. THEf SPEAKER: Those who are against, say
no.
SENATOR FLYNN: No. It requires unanimous consent.
There is no motion before the bouse. If there is a motion
that is another tbing, but there is no motion before the
bouse. In any event, it is not because I do not want to belp
my good friend, Senator Forsey. 1 offered bim my copy.
1 then indicated that I would take the matter under
advisement.
The question concerns the proper procedure to be followed
when an honourable senator desires to have a document printed in the Debates of the Senate or in the Minutes of the
Proceedingsof the Senate, or both.
1 sbould like to refer to the rules of the Senate that were in
force in that regard prior to 1968; that is, before the rules of
the Senate were revised by the Special Committee of the
80003 -20'

Senate on the Rules of the Senate. Rule 100 as it was then
numbered read as follows:
Ail papers laid on the Table stand referred to the Joint
Committee on Printing, wbo decide and report whetber
they are to be printed.
The special committee recommended that this rule be
replaced by the present rule 109, wbich reads as follows:
The printing or publisbing of anything relating to the
proceedings of the Senate shaîl be as ordered by the
Senate.
The explanatory note contained in the special committee's
report is to the effect that this rule is intended to eliminate aIl
doubts concerning the printing of documents as appendixes to
the Debates of the Senate and to the Minutes.
Since the adoption of the revised rules of the Senate in 1968,
the Senate is now governed by rule 109, wbich I just quoted,
and by rule 5üj), which defines tbe expression "ordered by the
Senate" as meaning "ordered by majority decision."
It bas been a long standing practice in the Senate that when
a senator desires that a document be prînted as an appendix to
the Debates of the Senate or to the Minutes, the senator may
s0 request without a formai motion. The Speaker will then put
the question as follows:
Is it agreed, bonourable senators, that (and the Speaker repeats the senator's request in that regard).
If agreed, it is then so ordered. In fact, yesterday, wben
Senator Yuzyk resumed the debate on Senator McElman's
inquiry respecting the Twenty-second Annual Session of the
North Atlantic Assembly, he requested that a certain document to whicb he referred be printed as an appendix to the
Debates of the Senate and the Minutes and it was agreed and
s0 ordered.
0 (1410)
Indeed, on October 22, 1976, Senator Perrault tabled letters
excbanged between the Prime Minister and the Premier of
Alberta concerning the patriation of the Constitution, and
Senator Forsey asked that the correspondence be printed as an
appendix to that day's Debates of the Senate and it was agreed
and so ordered.
In the case of Senator Forsey's request yesterday, agreement
was not expressed and tbe debate to whicb I referred earlier
took place. I now bave to make a decision and, in doing so, I
am guided by rules 109 and 5üj). I am also guided by
Beaucbesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms, 4th edition,
citation 8, paragraph 3, whicb reads as follows:
In the interpretation of tbe rules or standing orders the
bouse is generally guided, not so mucb by the literaI

February

SENATE DEBATES
construction of the orders themselves as by tbe consideration of wbat bas been the practice of the bouse witb
respect to them.
Consequently, in view of tbe prescrit rules relating to tbe
printing of documents as appendixes to tbe Senate Minutes
and to tbe Debates of the Senate and tbe practice of tbis bouse
with respect to those rules, 1 rule tbat leave of tbe Senate is not
required if a senator, in tbe course of bis speecb, requests to
bave a document printed in tbe record or to bave certain
material appear in tbe body of bis remarks or be printed as an
appendix to tbe Debates or to the Minutes of the Proceedings
of the Senate. It may be ordcred by a majority decision of tbe
Senate. So, bonourable senators, 1 now ask you if it is agreed
tbat the letters be printed as requested by Senator Forsey.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Some Hon. Senators: No.
The Hon. the Speaker: Tbose wbo are in favour please say
yea.

Senator McIlraith: You cannot raise a point of order at this
point.
Senator Flynn: When can 1 raise it? After it has been donc?
Senator Mcllraith: Either before vote proceedings arc startcd or after-preferably before a vote is called.
Senator Flynn: Let us discuss my point of order. 1 will be
pleased to listen to Senator McIlraitb.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Actually, nobody asked to vote.
Senator Flynn: 1 intend to ask for clarification from the
Speaker. Wbo moved it and who seconded it?
The Hon. the Speaker: It is only a question now. Those in
favour of the printing of the letters please risc.
Senator Flynn: That is not the way to put the question.
The question was resolved in the affirmative on the following division:

Some Hon. Senators: Yea.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those wbo are against please say
nay.
Soine Hon. Senators: Nay.
Senator Argue: On division.
Senator Flynn: Oh, no, not on division.
The Hon. the Speaker: In my opinion tbe yeas bave it.
Senator Flynn: Tbcn let us bave a vote on it.
And more than two honourable senators having risen.
The Hon. the Speaker: Cal! in the senators.

CUSTOMS TARIFF
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. W. M. Benidickson moved the second reading of Bill
C- 15, to amend the Customs Tariff.
He said: Honourabie senators, tbis bill is one of several
wbicb follow budget presentations, the others normaily dealing
with amendments to the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act,
and occasionally other acts. The bis we are now receiving
basically give effect to the budget presentation of May 25,
1976, and they were preceded by a ways and means motion.
The notice of ways and means motion, tabled in the House of
Commons at the time of tbe budget, contaîns some tariffs
detail that is not provided in the bill wbicb is now before us.
The Commons ways and means motion provides information
as to tbe rates of tariff tbat were in effect prior to the
proposais brought forward on budget nigbt. Bill C-15 does not
provide that information.
For the benefit of new senators, and those wbo find these
financial bis ratber complicated, perbaps 1 shouid outline
briefly the source of material for proceeding in tbe debate and
the study of this bill by the Senate Banking, Trade and
Commerce committee. The notice of ways and means motion,
as I indicated, was first contained in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Gommons of May 25, 1976, and members
of Parliament in botb bouses were later provided witb a budget
packet whicb, in larger print and witb beadings, and so fortb,
made it easier for them to sec the various categories of
taxation tbat were being affected.
Tbe first notice of ways and means motion was tabled in tbe
other place on May 25, 1976, and copies are available tbrougb
tbe distribution office. It was copied and circuiated iast session
in a more convenient form, being item "A" of tbe Budget
Papers. Tbe budget speech is also available in a green covered

SENATE DEBATES
document which is easier to read than Hansard of the other
place, and that, too, is available from the distribution office.
The references to tariff changes appear at page 26 of the
green covered copy of the budget speech, as well as at page
13,829 of Hansardof the other place of May 25, 1976.
The bill before us replaces Bill C-95, which was introduced
in the last session but not proceeded with to the final stages.
The amendments to tariffs in Bill C-15 are based fundamentally on the budget of 1973, and in that connection perhaps I
could read from the introduction to the references made to
tariff changes by the Minister of Finance on budget night,
May 25, 1976, when he said in the Commons:
I should like now to deal with certain tariff changes.
Honourable members will recall that in February, 1973,
tariffs were cut on a wide range of consumer products in
order to moderate upward pressures on prices. These
reductions were originally introduced for one year only
but most were subsequently renewed until June 30, 1976.
The provisions of the 1973 budget in this connection ran out,
and in February 1974, by a special ways and means motion,
the provisions were renewed until June 30, 1974. The budget
of May 1974 then extended those changes to the end of 1974.
That budget, as all honourable senators will no doubt recall,
was defeated, resulting in a general election. On July 1, 1974,
the rates reverted to the pre-February 1973 rates. A budget
was presented in November 1974, which reintroduced, with
some few exceptions, the basic reductions contained in the
1973 budget, and carried those reductions forward on a
so-called temporary basis to June 30, 1976. The budget of
May 25, 1976 proposed extending again most of the 1973
reductions in tariffs to June 30, 1977.

(1440)

Budget Bill C-95, to amend the Customs Tariff, was not
completely dealt with last session and it died on the order
paper. This bill, C-15, is a reintroduction of the subject matter.
It contains really just two changes or amendments since the
budget of May 25, 1976. Those items relate to canned herring
and scientific preparations imported by hospitals and other
institutions such as universities. The authority for the alteration of these two items is to be found in the ways and means
motion tabled in the House of Commons on October 13, 1976,
in this current session of Parliament. These two amendments
have effect as of October 14, 1976, while the remainder of the
bill has effect as of May 26, 1976, the day following the last
budget.
Clause 1, which is the principal provision of the bill, together with schedule I which is found at the back of the bill,
provide for the extension until June 30, 1977 of a number of
so-called "temporary" tariff reductions on consumer goods
which, as I have said, were originally introduced as an antiinflationary measure in the budget of February 1973. Were it
not for this bill those numerous consumer-oriented tariff
reductions would have expired on June 30, 1976.
In fact, a couple of tariff reductions, which were in force
prior to June 30, have been allowed to expire, namely, those

February 2, 1977

with respect to tires and tubes and scissors. They were dropped
from the proposals contained in the budget of May 25 last
because imports at the reduced tariff rates were causing
serious problems for Canadian producers and workers.
This bill does relate to some new tariff reductions on several
food products. These include fresh pork, ham, and bacon,
about which I will have more to say later, as well as to
macaroni and other pasta products. There is also provision for
deeper tariff cuts than those previously in force on certain
canned meats.
I should also comment on the item covering canned herring,
tariff item 12200-1. Due to a printing error when the budget
papers were being prepared, the reduced rate on that product
was shown as 5 per cent rather than the intended 10 per cent.
Under the terms of the present bill, the 5 per cent rate will
remain in effect for the period from May 26 to October 13,
but as of October 14, because of the new ways and means
motion in this new session, it reverts to the intended 10 per
cent, which is comparable to the so-called permanent or
pre-February 1973 rate of 12½ per cent.
The temporary tariff reductions proposed in this bill affect
imports, the estimated value of which will be about $1.6 billion
in terms of 1975 imports. Close to half of these are in the food
sector and cover such products as raw and refined sugar, fresh
and processed vegetables, fish products, cereal foods and biscuits. Some of the more important products in the non-food
sector which are covered by the package are drugs and pharmaceutical products, kitchen and dinner ware, plumbing fixtures, hand tools, photographic equipment and sporting goods.
Clause 2 and schedule Il to the bill provide for the introduction of a number of miscellaneous tariff changes. The most
important of these is the introduction of tariff item 42701-1,
which provides for the withdrawal from Britain and Ireland of
the 21/2 per cent British preferential tariff on compressor sets
and electricity generating sets. Canada ceased to be obliged to
accord preferential tariff rates to Britain and Ireland when
they became members of the European Economic Community.
Although the government's policy has been to retain the
existing preferential rates in the customs tariff, the Minister of
Finance did announce in his budget speech that the department would be undertaking a comprehensive review of the
tariffs on machinery from Britain and Ireland in view of
representations from Canadian manufacturers to the effect
that imports over the preferential rate were adversely affecting
production in Canada.
This review, I can report, is now well under way. It was felt,
however, that there was a need to act immediately in respect of
compressor and generating sets. Therefore, commencing on
May 26 last, the day following the budget, the most-favourednation rate of 15 per cent became applicable, although it will
still be possible for importers to obtain remission of the duty
under the machinery program for any sets that are not available from Canadian production.
I might say that this is not particularly significant as a
departure from the British preferential tariff, in that I am

February 2, 1977

informed that the importation from Great Britain and Ireland that, unknown to him, was produced by prison labour, and

general tariff-are free in relation to these categories of goods
which are of use to, and of interest to, hospitals, universities,
scientific establishments, and so on. Will the honourable senator please explain to me again what he said about the government's intention concerning this tariff item.
Senator Benidickson: Senator Hicks, perhaps I should read
in more detail the explanation that has been given to me
concerning tariff item 69605-1, dealing with goods for hospitais, educational and other institutions.
The purpose of the proposed amendment was to restore,
as closely as possible, the coverage which the item had
before the implementation of a Tariff Board decision on
two appeals concerning the tariff classification of pharmaceutical preparations. For a number of years, Revenue
Canada, Customs and Excise has interpreted the provision
for scientific preparations as covering goods which were
used in scientific research and analysis. The Tariff Board
ruled that the word "scientific" refers to the nature or the
manner in which an article has been prepared and that
there is no restrictive condition in the item as to their use
by qualified users.
The effect of this Tariff Board decision would be to
give duty-free entry to all preparations imported by qualifying institutions.
I am familiar with my honourable friend's interest in these
institutions of an educational nature.
These preparations, when used for other than research,
have in the recent past generally been subject to a 10 p.c.
duty (15 p.c. after June 30, 1977).
If there is no extension of this so-called temporary reduction in
rates in the 1973 budget.
All drugs and pharmaceuticals imported by hospitals for
administration to patients, for instance, would have been
allowed duty-free entry.
But some of these are produced in Canada.
Senator Hicks: It seems to me that this schedule does not in
fact exempt them from duty.
Senator Benidickson: Well, I think that anything in the
nature of detail of this type is better discussed in the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, to
which this bill, according to past practice, will doubtless be
referred, and at which time representatives of the Department
of Finance will be present.

Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, to
which I will move that this bill be referred.
Senator Hicks: Honourable senators, perhaps I might just
say a word on the bill at this stage, on the assumption that its
sponsor proposes to move that it be referred to the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee.
Senator Benidickson: Yes.
Senator Hicks: My colleagues in the universities and
research institutions of Canada have calculated that if the
duties are restored on this it would cover a category of goods,
running in value to many millions of dollars-as much as $30
million has been estimated-and used by hospitals, universities
and research institutions across the country. If the provision
obtains, one must distinguish between a particular chemical or
piece of apparatus used for research or for teaching, which
would be the immediate differential that would be of concern
to universities, and that used in the care of patients, which
would obtain in relation to hospital supplies and so on. It will,
of course, mean the imposition of the very difficult task of
determining what proportion of any given batch of chemicals,
or what proportion of the time of any given piece of apparatus,
and so on, relates to research and what relates to other uses,
such as teaching or the care of patients in hospitals. I do think
this is important.
For example, universities today depend upon governments
across Canada for 75 per cent, and as much as 90 per cent, of
their income. It seems that the government is really only
imposing a burden upon itself when it takes away the duty-free
status of hospitals and scientific and educational institutions of
this kind.
When the bill is considered more carefully by the committee
to which it is referred, I hope that the propriety of destroying
this exemption, which has been enjoyed for some time by these
institutions, will be inquired into very carefully.
Senator Grosart: For the purpose of further clarification, I
wonder if I might ask Senator Benidickson if that is not
exactly what the government says it intends to do? Will he
perhaps confirm my reading of the bill, and the statements
made here and elsewhere about the bill, that what has happened here is that the Tariff Board has made a ruling that
brought these particular items under a duty and the minister
intends to proceed under the Financial Administration Act to
remit the duties-in other words, to reverse the decision of the
Tariff Board? Is that the position?
Senator Benidickson: I think it is correct to say it alters the
effect of the Tariff Board decision.
Senator Deschatelets: May I ask a supplementary question
on the point raised by my colleague, Senator Hicks? With
respect to the change provided in the bill referred to by him,
does the sponsor have a breakdown of the amounts involved?
Senator Benidickson: No. Senator Hicks has, from some
source, given an estimate, and I did ask for some information
when I was asked to sponsor the bill. I indicated that in respect
of the total tariff reductions provided in 1973 it was estimated

SENATE DEBATES
Even if Quebec, in the course of time, becomes a separate
state, Canada is, by contract, bound to Newfoundland, and
could not agree to submit any question touching Labrador to
any court without Newfoundland's consent. That consent
Newfoundland will never give.
There is, however, another matter which is a cause of
friction between Newfoundland and Quebec,-one which is
indeed a debatable matter. I refer now to the Churchill Falls
hydro development.
Since Newfoundland became part of Canada, Quebec and
Newfoundland have been closely connected in the development
of hydro power from Churchill Falls, Labrador. It now appears
Quebec is enjoying very large windfall profits from its contract
for the purchase of power from Churchill Falls. Be that as it
may, a contract is a contract. As events have turned out,
Quebec is benefiting. In my opinion there is no useful purpose
to be served for Newfoundland to cry over spilt milk. At the
time the contract was made no one could foresee the subsequent events which increased the value of the power. Today,
from the Churchill Falls power contract, Quebec is making a
profit of over $350 million a year, which amount will escalate
sharply as the years go by, and this will continue for over 60
years yet to come. Nevertheless, as I have said, a contract is a
contract and I, for one, can find no cause to criticize Quebec in
this respect.
However, I an advised that great new additional power
developments at Churchill Falls, which would benefit not only
Newfoundland but ail Canada, are not going forward, partly
because of the uncooperative attitude of the government of
Quebec. Newfoundlanders, are forced to the conclusion that
there are times when the policy of the Quebec governnent
seems to be: "What is yours is mine, and what is mine is my
own.
In the meantime, the federal government, properly concerned about the energy shortage, urges citizens to turn off
their TV sets when not looking at them, while remaining
strangely silent about the development of Labrador hydro.
Before leaving this subject it may be worth noting that
should Quebec decide to cease to be part of Canada, that in
itself would terminate the Churchill Falls power contract
should Newfoundland elect to treat the contract at an end.
A contract made with Hydro Quebec at a time when
is part of Canada does not carry over to Hydro
should Quebec become a foreign country. One only
has to examine what would happen to the contract to appreciate the correctness of that view. The contract now is between
agencies of two sister provinces of Canada. It runs for 60
years, and is to be interpreted and governed by the laws of the
Province of Quebec. After separation the contract would be
altered. It would then be between an agency of the Province of
Newfoundland and an agency of a foreign power. It would be
governed by the law of that foreign state and be interpreted by
the courts of that state. Newfoundland would lose the right of
recourse to the Supreme Court of Canada, which it now has,

Quebec
Quebec

February 2, 1977

as the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada would not
be recognized in the new state.
In addition to ail this, the contract would be governed by the
laws of a foreign power, which claims the absolute ownership
of the natural resources giving rise to the very existence of the
contract itself. In my opinion, some of the principal elements
of the original contract would disappear, and the contract
would have to be renegotiated or be terminated.
The Churchill Falls hydro contract may be only a minor
matter. I mention it because there must be others that will also
be affected one way or the other should Canada cease to be
one country.
I have so far mentioned only issues of particular interest to
Quebec and Newfoundland. I should like to continue and
comment on the issue of separatism. Separatism, it cannot be
too strongly emphasized, affects aIl Canada as much as it
affects Quebec itself.
There are two very local minorities in Canada-a French
minority, committed to a separated and sovereign Quebec, and
an English minority which, for various reasons, professes itself
agreeable, even eager, to see Quebec depart from our
Confederation.
Between those two extremes, there is a large, and largely
silent, majority that remains unalterably opposed to the division of Canada. We do not want to sec our country torn
asunder. In the next few years, as the government of Premier
Lévesque works toward a referendum which will, they hope,
authorize their avowed aim, we do not wish to stand idly by
with our fingers crossed, hoping that somehow "things will
work out." We wish to do something-anything-to prevent
what we view as a catastrophe for the country, but we don't
quite know what that something is.
It serves no useful purpose to criticize anyone for being
emotional and uptight about his history or on the subject
matter of his rights. Indeed, that is a favourite occupation of
aIl Newfoundlanders. You do not have to scratch a Newfoundlander very deep before you start a long playing record on the
whole question of the wrongs we have suffered, and how our
rights are still withheld even in this day and age.
However, those who indulge in this pastime of recounting
how they have suffered, and are suffering, must also concede
that others have their own history and their own wrongs. It
should also be borne in mind that history is history, and
perhaps it may be wiser to forget, or at least play down, some
parts rather than nurse past grievances. As regards rights, this
is a constant two-way street, and the best way to view rights is
to recognize that every day now, and in the future, a debate
between two different views constantly yields some progress.
To illustrate this view, reference may be made to the
Official Languages Act. Surely this was a correct step in the
right direction, taken against the wishes and vocal outcries of
the extremists on both sides but taken, nevertheless, with the
full concurrence of ail political parties and supported, in the
main, with goodwill by the great majority of Canadians.

February 2, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Those who believe in Quebec for Quebecers contend that the
issue of separatism is a matter for Quebecers alone, and all
other Canadians must keep out. This is a very self-centred,
selfish and, indeed, arrogant attitude. Surely if a man who
claims to own a house in the centre of a row announces he
intends to tear it down, including party and retaining walls on
both sides, his neighbours have the right to make representation and to argue the issues involved.
Therefore, if, notwithstanding the good will on both sides,
the issue of separation must be faced there are some aspects of
the results of separation concerning which there has been very
little informed debate and which should be studied in depth
without further delay.
(<1520)

If we accept in principle the idea of a separate, independent
and foreign state of Quebec, both Canada and Quebec will
have to agree which part is Quebec and which part is Canada.
This will be a problem not free from difficulty, but it does
seem as if many of those who are advocating the idea are
under the impression that, on the one hand, the now province
of Quebec is indivisible while the now existing country of
Canada may be torn asunder at will. This view recognizes the
proposition that Quebec has paramount rights, and denies the
proposition that Canada has any rights. This seems to put the
cart before the horse. Surely the correct, true and logical
position is that by the Treaty of Paris of 1763 all the area
occupied by Quebec became part of British North America.
During the course of the years, British North America
became Canada, and British citizens became Canadians. The
paramount rights of Canada over the provinces is well illustrated by the preamble and provisions of the British North
America Act.
The matter may be put in its correct legal and historical
perspective, and in a form easily understandable by the man in
the street, by reference to the law of landlord and tenant. If a
person owns ten farms which are occupied and worked by ten
tenants, the landlord and any one or more of his tenants may,
of course, agree in principle to terminate in any one or more
cases the relationship of landlord and tenant. However, if they
do so agree there is no good reason to conclude that the tenant
alone will decide the course to be followed, and which of the
two parties takes what land, when the relationship comes to an
end. The very least that Canadians would expect their government to insist upon is that the creation of the new state of
Quebec will not endanger the lines of communication by land,
air and water or in any way jeopardize the continued existence
of Canada.
The splitting up of Canada would, in my opinion, be an
unmitigated disaster for both Quebec and Canada. If it should
come it will cause many, many problems which will never be
solved to the satisfaction of both sides. It would be a serious
mistake for the Premier of Quebec to paint a rosy picture of
the negotiations which will have to take place.
It may well be false and misleading to invite the voters of
Quebec to make a determination on the matter of separatism

on the assumption that the independent state may enjoy the
benefits of a common union, and also common or dual citizenship, with separated Canada. These things will not be for
Quebec alone to decide. If these privileges are extended to the
new independent state, they would surely only be extended if a
very large measure of agreement came about on most of the
important issues which would arise. The new state of Quebec
could not have one without the other.
It is submitted that Quebec now remains unhappy with the
rest of Canada after more than 100 years of negotiations with
successive Governments of Canada which have always had, or
hoped to have, a strong power base in Quebec. Surely, then,
negotiating in the future with a Government of Canada which
owes no duty or obligation to Quebec, a government whose
entire power base is outside Quebec, will not make the situation any better. Is it possible that some people are crying for
the moon? If so, they never will be satisfied inside or outside
Confederation.
We have heard, and no doubt rightly heard, much of the
sensitivities and feelings of Quebecers. But many of those who
are most vocal on this matter seem to deny to other Canadians
their sensitivities or feelings. If we should be so misguided as
to travel down the dark road which leads to a divided Canada,
we will end up with two peoples each of whom will be deeply
wounded by the other, and who will only regard the other with
anger and bitterness born of mutual frustration.
If we must cry slogans, let us concentrate on al] the areas of
goodwill now existing and let those earnest young people who
now cry, "Quebec for Quebecers" join hands throughout the
whole land and cry, "Canada for Canadians."
The present Government of Quebec will hold a plebiscite
when it considers the time is opportune and the voters of
Quebec are sufficiently influenced towards opting to separate
from Canada. When the plebiscite is held, the voters of
Quebec will be divided into three groups. There will be the
convinced separatists; there will be the dedicated federalists;
and there will be a group of bewildered honest men and
women, young and old, who want to cast an intelligent vote so
that the future will be as secure and hold as much promise as
possible not only for themselves but for their children and their
children's children. These voters will not, and should not, be
too much influenced by those who attempt to stir them up by
recitals, accurate or otherwise, of past wrongs. What is past is
past.
As far as the present is concerned, no great changes for
better or worse will come quickly whatever any government
does. It is the future, therefore, which must concern the
honest, undecided voters as they have to decide what is more
likely to be better for them and for those for whom they are
responsible. Where are these people to obtain the best possible
information about the future of Quebec inside or outside
Canada? I, for one, do not think they will receive honest
information and true guidance from the present Government
of Quebec, nor will they receive any rational assistance from
the intelligentsia of the party. The mentality of too many

party is generally negative. They display a querulous attitude,
a complete lack at ail limes of any constructive suggestions.
There is little in them except the irresponsible carping of
people who, up to now, have never been and have never
expected to be in a position of power.
The federal Parliament, which is the Parliament of ail
Canada, has, therefore, a duty and a responsibility to make
available to them ail the facts, and a fair and honest appraisal
of the future, as far as that is possible. This also is a duty
which the federal Parliament must undertake and discharge
for ail Canadians. Even though the decision will be made in
Quebec, it will nonetheless seriously affect ail Canadians. Not
only Canadians living in Quebec but Canadians living everywhere in Canada should have, as far as it is possible to give
them, reasonable answers to the following, among other,
questions:
How are the national assets to bc apportioned between an

independent Quebec and Canada?
What proportion of the national obligations will Quebec and
Canada assume?
What will be the likely boundaries of an independent
Quebec?
low will the air, land and water lines of communication of
Canada be provided for and protected?
Will it be possible and desirable to have a common
currency?
What federal government payments to the Quebec government and to the citizens of Quebec will cease if the country
divides?
What will happen to Quebec industries which depend on the
whole Canadian market, such as the shipbuilding industry and
the textile industry? It is important to note that 60 per cent of
all workers in the textile industry live in Quebec.
Would the separate, independent country of Quebec pay the
world price for ail its requirements of oil?
Will there be any mutual continuing services?
Is common or dual citizenship and a common market likely
to be beneficial to both countries?
It is truc that these questions are negative ones. Answers
may inform, but certainly will not inspire anyone. How are
Canadians to be inspired? How can we be made aware that we

good deal about Canadians generally and what kind of people
they are.
* (1530)

The voters of Quebec should have from their federal Parliament a pretty good idea of what a separate Government of
Quebec and a separate Government of Canada would likely
agree upon as reasonable, fair and equitable arrangements, not
after hostile and unfriendly negotiations, but rather after
negotiations between two governments which would nevertheless be at "arm's length" one from one another.
In order that the federal Parliament might discharge this
responsibility, I suggest that a joint parliamentary committee
be constituted. I suggest it be given, as far as possible, a
parliamentary mandate and not a government mandate. By
this I mean that at least one of the joint chairmen should be
chosen from outside the government party.
The time has passed when the issue may be used by political
parties to make smart debating scores over each other. It is
also too important and too urgent to be settled by mortal
combat as between two gladiators, no matter how colourful
each may be.
The committee should be fully and adequately staffed by
well-known, well-recognized, legal, financial and other
authorities. It will be most important that the committee have
the very best staff available anywhere in Canada. Such a staff
will be necessary in order that vital territorial, financial and
other basic issues be fully researched for the committee. These
issues should also be researched, and checked and rcchecked,
by well recognized outside organizations. The average Canadian is tired of arguments and counter arguments, and of words,
words, millions of words. If indeed he now faces the very
depressing and ugly possibility of Canada being divided, he
does not want the gut issues drowned in further countless
words, or swept under the rug.
Ail Canadians are worried. They are entitled to the facts,
and they want them now.
Finally, honourable senators, a parliamentary committee
representing aIl parties may give us one more opportunity to
reach out to each other, and to reason together for the
common good of ail.

brief questions?

the media, so that means can be devised by which Canadians
may be reminded over and over again of their history, their
heritage and, generally, the constructive side of the Canadian
nation and the Canadian way of life.

Senator Bell: And what was the date of the agreement
referred to?

When Newfoundland voted on the question of union with
Canada we did not, of course, have the final terms, but

or almost self-supporting. In 1936 or 1937 our Constitution

sufficient information was available to give us a pretty clear

idea of what would be the final results, and we knew also a

PATRIATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
LETTERS FROM PRIME MINISTER TO PROVINCIAL PREMIERS AND COPY
OF DRAFT RESOLUTION RESPECTING THE CONSTITUTION

The Honourable William G. Davis, Q.C.,
Premier of Ontario,

My dear Premier:
I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which I am
sending today to Premier Lougheed in reply to his letter of
October 14th reporting on the discussions of the Premiers in
August and October on "patriation" of the constitution. Also
enclosed is a copy of the draft resolution I am sending with my
letter.
As you will note, I am planning to make this correspondence
and the draft resolution public on Friday next, January 21st. It
will also be tabled in the House of Commons when it resumes
its sessions on January 24th.
Sincerely,
P. E. Trudeau
Ottawa KIA 0A2,
January 19th, 1977
The Honourable Peter Lougheed,
Premier of Alberta,
Legislative Building,
Edmonton, Alberta.
T5K 2B7
My dear Premier:
I was glad to have the occasion, presented by my dinner
with you and the Premiers of the other provinces on December
13th, to discuss briefly your letter of October 14th reporting
on the discussions of the Premiers in August and October,
1976, on "patriation" of the Constitution. I told you then-and
this seemed to be agreeable to the other Premiers-that I
would be replying to your letter, further to the interim reply I
sent on October 18th, to round out this particular part of our
constitutional discussions.
It seems to me that the results of the meetings of Premiers,
as reflected in your letter, are, in a sense, either too much or
too little. They are too much in relation to the limited exercise
we embarked upon in April, 1975. That, as reflected in my
letter of April 19th, 1975, was intended to accomplish "patriation" of our Constitution from Britain with the amending
clause agreed on at Victoria. We-the provinces and the
federal government-decided deliberately to avoid the complexities of constitutional reform which had been so clearly
demonstrated in the conferences, meetings and discussions
from 1968 to 1971. While the very limited scope of our
exercise grew somewhat in the course of discussions in 1975
and early 1976, the proposals embodied in your letter carry the
exercise into new areas and even raise some aspects of the

distribution of powers. This is precisely the sort of thing we
had, in April 1975, sought to avoid.
If the proposals in your letter are too much in relation to the
immediate exercise, they are too little in relation to constitutional reform. We got into many other aspects of the constitution in 1968-1971 and, if we are now to embark on changes in
the distribution of powers and other fundamental matters, I
think our review and our changes should be much more
extensive than those covered in your letter of October 14th. I
have made it clear on many occasions that the federal government is prepared to re-embark on a fundamental review of our
Constitution. We would be quite prepared to have such a
process begin at a very early date if that is the general wish.
The exercise since April 1975 has been based on experience,
over the many years of effort in this area, which seemed to
demonstrate the wisdom of trying to proceed by stages: first to
"patriate" with an amending procedure that most think satisfactory; then to decide upon the changes in a document that
would be totally Canadian and totally amendable by procedures to be executed entirely in Canada. The federal government is prepared to proceed by either route: action by stages,
such as we have been concentrating on, or action all at once by
fundamental constitutional revision.
Having said that the proposals in your letter are, in our
judgment, either too much or too little, the federal government
is prepared to see if agreement can be achieved on the basis of
your letter, but with modifications, so that "patriation" can be
effected as soon as possible. The most significant modification
we would suggest is that we should not, if we are to adhere to
this limited exercise, enter in any way into the distribution of
powers. The federal government is quite ready to go into that
problem but it is both complex and difficult. To do it partially,
in the way your letter suggests, without a coherent total plan
would, in our view, be a serious mistake. We have, therefore,
tried to see what might reasonably be done to meet the
concerns to which your letter refers, while leaving all matters
of constitutional powers for comprehensive study and action at
the second stage, after "patriation". So that there can be no
possibility of misunderstanding I repeat that, if the provinces
now feel that this is not the right course, the federal government is ready to embark on the other route of total constitutional review. If we adopt that course, it will be essential for all
of us to be willing to meet the challenge that this task will pose
in as open-minded a way as possible consistent with our
responsibilities, unbu-dened by commitments to any preconceived outcome, and constrained only by the dictates of our
sense of what will best serve the interests of Canadians in all
parts of Canada. In this spirit, I am convinced, lies the greatest
promise of a constitution that will be Canadian in the best
sense, that is to say an institutional framework for our future
that will be effective and workable, yet justly and sensitively
balanced as between its constituent elements. Having made

SENATE D[BATES

these points, 1 return I0 the possibilitv of' action in stages, o ith
a firsi stage buili upon the proposaIs in your citter.
If "patriation" can bc agreed upon using the discussions of
the last two years as the hasis, we o ill need Io irnplernn il by
rnans of a Proclamation by thte Governor General and legisialion by the British Parliament to terminale ils possers t0
legisiate with regard to Canada. A draf't of such a Proclamation was sent to you and the other Premiers svith my citter of
March 3 lst, 1976. Il has seemed to us that tl might advancc
matters if the proposais of the federal government, in reply bo
your letter of October I 4th, were commiunicated in the forni of'
a revised Proclamation. Such a document is enclosed heressith
as part of a draft of a resolution that might be placcd beforc
Parlianient. The limitations on what it contains relate in large
part to the comnients 1 have already made that tl woulId be
unwise, in this limited exercise, 10 touch the distribution of'
possers. Apart fromn that broad comment, possibly il would be
helpful if 1 were 10 make the f'ollowing brief explanations
concerning the different parts of the document.
Part 1 Amendments to the Constitution
This sets forth the Victoria amiending formlula. Wlîile the
formula may not bc perfect, there is general agreement that tl
is ihe bcst that has been devised in nearîs fifîs s cars of effort.
Il was agrecd to by aIl eleven govcrnnments 'in' 1971 and by
eighi of' the ten provinces aI xour meeting in Toronto last
October. We are neyer likely 10 gel a Itiglier degree of' consensus on anx formula. Accordingîs o b0ile the federal gos ernnmenî
s not entirely satisfied about one or 1550 aspects of flhc
formula, tl seemis Io us that the ss se course o ould bc bo accept
il and get ahead wiîh "paitriaition' on the basîs of' il. 1If ever
we
get ans thing that lias a higher les cI of' consensus, il can bc
establishied by use of the Victoria f'ormnula.
Part Il Senate Representation
This is entircly ncw and represenîs a response 10 the s iess
thai the western part of Canada is mucli under-represenîed in
the Senate it the present time. While Senate representation
bas neyer been direcîlv re lated bo population in Canada, but
rather t0 regions, il is clear that the west is indccd underrepresented whlen one considers the oas in o hici ils iîuîportance in confedieration lias grossn since the present Senate
miiîbersliip was set in 1915S. Varions forniulac can be dcx ised
for increased representation Iromi the western pros mes. Part
Il represents a suggestion thai the federal governmnenî o ould
support.
Vshen we come to fundaniental reN ies of the Constitution.
we will wanî to consider mans' things rclatîîîg 0 the Senate.
The federal government will have a nuiîber of proposaIs to
niake. For purposes of the present exercise, however, we ssould
be prepared 10 hase early decision on modification of ssesterni
representation since that sceîts clearly to be unsatisfactoî y
and capable of correction ait Ibis stage.

Part 111-

February ,17
Fbur 2, 1977

Language Righis

Your Icîter includes, as one of' the matters -unanimously
agreed 10" by the provinces in the 1976 nmeetings, "a confirma-

tion of the language rights of English and French generally
along the fies discussed in Victoria in 1971". The Victoria
provisions included certain obligations that specifie provinces
then agreed they were prepared to accept with regard to the
officiaI language that is in a minority position within ils
boundaries. We arc not ai aIl certain whether the wording of
your letter indicates that those provinces arc now prcpared to
accept the same or siîîiflar obligations. The federal governmenî
is prepared to do so. Articles 14 Io 20 in the enclosed draft are
along the lînes ut' Victoria but, in view of' the uncerîainîy to
wbich 1 refer, they arc in ihis îcxt made applicable t0 the
Parliatiieni and Government of Canada onîs', wiîb a provision
like ihiat eontained in the Victoria Charter (Article 19 here)
o herehy a province can adopt siniilar provisions and give them
constitutional status if tl so wisbes. If provinces would be
prepared, as ai Victoria, t0 bave obligations insertcd in the
varions articles wiîlî respect t0 îbcmselves that would, of
course, strengthcn the provisions. 1 hope that is the sort of
possibifity t0 wbieh your Icîter refers.
Article 211o as not a part ut' the Victoria proposaIs. Il is a
modificationi oil Article 38 in the draf't 1 sent you on Marcb
31 st. 1976. I understand that a number of the Premiers ocre
concerncd ,îî the indef'initeness of' the reference to "culture"

to laiguagc and preservation of' it. It applies t0 federal powers

P[art IV -R2gional Disparities
Your letter says the meetings of Premîiers produced '-unanimlous agreemlent on the clause contained in the draf't proclanmation''. It also saxs there ssas "a high degree of' consensus on
ineorporatiiîg clauses in the Constitution pîovidiîîg toi equalization'. Article 22 retîroduces the article that met svîth umamilons; agreement. Part (b) of' il oas, as you know, designed as a

aiîiending procedure to establisb a nesx province, as your letter

nceo provinces ssonld not, of course, affect in any way the
s1îecific requirenients in the proposed amending formula for
ilme degree of consent reqnired aiong the existing provinces

February 2, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

for any future constitutional change. Nor would what is
proposed affect the existing provision that the boundaries of a
province cannot be altered without the consent of its
Legislature.
Article 25 would require consultation before any use of the
declaratory power of the federal Parliament. A requirement
for provincial consent, as your letter suggests, would be tantamount to changing the division of legislative powers. As I
have already said, we feel that any entry upon the distribution
of powers is too fundamental a matter for the present exercise.
Such a change could be considered following "patriation" as a
part of a total review.
Article 26 is a substantial and structured constitutional
obligation to consultation in the areas referred to. Your letter
referred to a desire for "a greater degree of provincial involvement in immigration", which is now a concurrent power with
federal paramountcy under Section 95 of the B.N.A. Act.
Your letter also refers to "a new concurrent power" in relation
to culture and to "greater provincial control in communications". These comments all appear to suggest changes in the
distribution of powers. As I have said, the federal government
considers such changes to be proper material for consideration
at the second stage of our constitutional reform if we are to
proceed by stages. For this stage, we would suggest that an
obligation to consult along the lines of that in Article 26 would
provide a new measure of assurance that provincial interests
would be taken into account to the greatest possible degree
before the federal government or Parliament acted within
federal constitutional powers in these areas. This would not, of
course, preclude any changes in the relevant powers that might
be agreed upon in the second stage. They could be brought
into effect under the amending procedure.
Part VI-Miscellaneous
Article 37 would remedy a deficiency in our Constitution as
it now stands: the lack of an official French-language text with
full force and effect. It would be critically important that such
a text should be approved by a means acceptable to all and
therefore the approval mechanism bas for the time being been
left blank. One possibility is that a small group of eminent
jurists might be appointed to review the French-language
versions to ensure complete accuracy before they become law.
Draft British Legislation
This is along the lines discussed in the meetings preparatory
to the Victoria Conference. It would provide the legal base for
the Proclamation and would terminate the power of the British
Parliament to legislate with respect to Canada.
The only parts of your letter to which I have not referred are
those relating to the Supreme Court of Canada, the "jurisdiction of provincial governments of taxation in the areas of
primary production" and the exercise of the federal spending
power. With regard to the last two, both get into the distribution of powers. As I have already indicated, the federal
government considers that this is a matter for extensive and

full discussion after "patriation" if we are following the course
of action by stages.
So far as the Supreme Court of Canada is concerned, the
Victoria Charter contained a number of specific articles dealing with the procedure to be followed in making appointments
to the Court. They would have given the provinces a limited
but explicit role in the appointment process. In your letter you
indicated that, at the October meeting, the provincial Premiers
agreed that the provinces should have a greater role in this
process than was accorded to them by the Victoria provisions,
although your letter does not detail what that greater role
should be. You said that "a number of other modifications
were suggested" to the Victoria provisions.
The federal government, for its part, has also had some
second thoughts about the articles agreed to at Victoria. We
reached the conclusion that they appear to have sufficiently
adverse implications for the Supreme Court, as a vital institution of our federation, that they ought not simply to be
reintroduced as part of this current proposal without at least a
very careful re-examination of those implications by all of our
governments. We also concluded that it would be possible to
achieve a better regional distribution of the judges, as well as
more effective consultation, through a constitutional provision
that would require selection of the judges on a geographical
basis. This would ensure that a regional distribution is invariably present on the Court. It would, of course, retain and
guarantee constitutionally the presence on the Court of at least
three judges experienced in the civil law of Quebec. We would
welcome the views of the Premiers on a new provision of this
kind, combined with a constitutional obligation to consult with
the Attorney General of the province or provinces concerned
before an appointment was made.
I am sending copies of this letter to your fellow Premiers so
they may be aware of these proposals that the federal government is making in response to your letter and the meetings of
August and October, 1976. As I have said, we would be happy
to sec "patriation" effected forthwith on the basis of the draft
proclamation and legislation I am enclosing, to which could be
added provisions about the Supreme Court if there is agreement on them. If it seems likely that that result could be
achieved after a further conference to discuss modifications
that any of the Premiers might think desirable, I would be
happy to join in such a conference at a mutually convenient
date.
It is quite possible, however, that the areas of disagreement
may be various and perhaps substantial. If so, I cannot help
wondering whether it would not be better to return to our
regional plan of April 1975-nothing but "patriation" with the
Victoria amending formula-leaving everything else for discussion and action at the next stage, after "patriation". You
will have noted that Premiers Schreyer and Campbell in their
letters to me of October 21st and November 10th made clear
that they do not consider that "patriation" need be conditional
upon a consensus with regard to the matters referred to in your
letter.

SENATE DEBATES

1 should apprcciatc your comments on the proposais in this
lecter and particularly your suggestion as tu wvhat the next
stage ought to be in order to complete the -patriation" exerCisc that we have now been working on for nearly two years. 1
arn asking the Premiers of the other provinces for their cornments and suggestions in the same way. 1 hope that wc can
achieve "patriation", with the Victoria amcnding formula,
without much more dclay and bring t0 an end this remnant of
our colonial condition of a century ago.
As our correspondence in October was made public forthwith, 1 would think that the same ought to be donc with this
letter and the brief covcring letters 1 amn sending tu the

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING AND JOINT COMMUNIQUÉ

INTRODUCTION

The Prime Minister of Canada and the Premiers of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island recognize
the importance of setting aside jurisdictional differences in
order to encourage resource exploitation in areas off-shore
their coasts, and industrial and commercial development in the
Maritime Region.

BOARI) D)MINISI RAI ION AND MANAGFMENI
5. In order to give effect to the Agreement, a Board, to be
called the Maritime Offshore Resources Board, will be
established to oversee the administration and management of mineral resources in that part of the Area

Province, landward of the M.R.A. Line, with the authority to;
(i) issue rights in respect of those mineral resources;
(ii) set the terms and conditions pursuant to which such
rights will be issued;
(iii) commission economic, sociological and other relatcd studies in respect of the exploration for, and exploitation of, those minera resources and the optimization
of the regional benefits to be derived therefrom by
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward

Consequently, they agree that it is in the best interests of
Canada and the three Provinces to work together to provide
for the administration and management, including exploration
and exploitation, of the seabed and subsoil seaward from the
ordinary low water mark on the coasts of the three Provinces,
on the following basis:
THE AGREEMENT
1

Island:

Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince

Area.
THE AREA

2. The area to becovered bythe Agreement will be the seabed
and subsoil seaward from the ordinary low water mark
on the coasts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and
Prince Edward Island to the continental margin, or to
the limits of Canada's jurisdiction to explore and exploit
the seabed and subsoil off Canada's coast, whichever
may be farther, and, where applicable, to the Interprovincial Lines of Demarcation agreed upon in 1964 by
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.
3 I he area will be di\ ided into tw o parts foi the pur-poses of
the Agreement;
(i) A part landward of a line to be called the Minerail
Resources Administration Line (the "M.R.A. Line"),
which will be fixed by the Agreement, but which will be
at least five kilometres seaward from the ordinary low
water mark on the coasts of the three Provinces, and
will be beyond any coal resources accessible by mining
from land; and,
(ii) A part seaward of the M.R.A. Line.
4.

I he disision of the Area among Nova Scotia, New'

(v) provide for the receipt and distribution of the
revenue described in this Understanding.
The Board will be composed of six members, three
representing Canada, and one from each of the three
Pro inces.
In order to give effect to the Agreement, Canada and the
three Provinces will ask Parliament and their respective
Legislatures to enact such legislation as is necessary to

include, for example, export or commodity taxes, or any
part of that revenue which is equivalent to any payment
by Canada in respect of any international agreement
whether negotiated before or after the coming into force
of the Agreement.
Il. The Board will be empowered to provide for the distribution of the revenue to be shared, calculated as of the end
of each fiscal year, with interim payments in respect
thereof, in accordance with the following formula.:

regional revenue sharing pool to be provided for in the
Agreement, and to which the three Provinces will contribute such portion of their respective shares as may be
agreed among them.
(iii) Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island will each receive 100 per cent of the revenue
derived from the administration and management of
the mineral resources in the respective sections of that
part of the Area landward of the M.R.A. Line attributed to them in accordance with paragraph 4, subject to
such pooling as is described above.
12. The Agreement will provide that 100 per cent of the
revenues within a revenue sharing line to be fixed by the
Agreement around Sable Island, which Island is
acknowledged to be within Nova Scotia, will accrue to
Nova Scotia.
DURATION

13. The Agreement will provide that in the event that
Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick or Prince Edward
Island wish to withdraw from participation in the Agreement, they will give five years notice of such intent.
14. The Agreement will make detailed provision for any
such withdrawal, particularly with respect to the continuance of any rights, to mineral resources in the Area,
issued pursuant to the Agreement.
15. The Agreement will provide that Canada will accord to
the three Maritime Provinces any additional advantages
in respect of the administration and management of
mineral resources in offshore areas subsequently agreed
to with any other province, and will consider a revision of
the Agreement where such advantages otherwise accrue
to any other province.

Premier of New Brunswick
February 1, 1977
JOINT COMMUNIQUE
FROM CANADA AND THE PROVINCES
OF NOVA SCOTIA, NEW BRUNSWICK AND PRINCE
EDWARD ISLAND
The Prime Minister and the Premiers of Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island today signed a Memorandum of Understanding which provides a co-operative
framework for the development of offshore mineral resources
on the coasts of the three provinces.
The Memorandum is a significant demonstration of federalism accommodating provincial needs and aspirations in a
flexible structure that can work to the greater benefit of all
parties.
This Memorandum lays the groundwork for a detailed
agreement to be negotiated between the federal government
and the three provinces by which all mineral resources within
agreed demarcated offshore areas would be managed by a
Board composed of three members from Canada, and one
from each of the three provinces. It is to be called the
Maritime Offshore Resources Board.
A federal body, entirely paid for by Ottawa, will act on the
Board's behalf and undertake the day-to-day administration of
offshore resources. The Board itself will be funded 25 per cent
by Canada and 75 per cent by the three provinces.
All revenues from offshore resources will be shared according to a formula by which the three provinces share 75 per
cent of revenue derived from an area seaward of at least five
kilometres from low water on their coasts to the continental
margin, or to the limits of Canada's jurisdiction over the
coastal seabed, the federal government receiving 25 per cent of
revenue in this area. The three provinces share 100 per cent of
revenues landward of this area.
In addition, Nova Scotia retains 100 per cent of revenues
within a revenue sharing line to be fixed by agreement around
Sable Island.
The framework is flexible enough to adapt to the entry of
other provinces in the future.

CUSTOMS TARIFF

CANADA-UNITED STATES RELATIONS
DIVERSION OF WATER FROM LAKE MICHIGAN-QUESTION
ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, on December 15
last, Senator Austin asked the following question with respect
to the Chicago diversion:
Has the Canadian government made representations to
the United States government in terms of that domestic
United States law and its operation, and does our government apprehend any serious effect downstream on Canadian navigation as a result of higher than ever levels of
diversion into the Mississippi system?
The American law in question is U.S. Public Law No. 94-587.
On October 8, 1976, a diplomatic note was presented to the
U.S. Department of State in which Canada's long-standing
and continued opposition to any unilateral increase in diversions at Chicago was set out. The note expressed strong
Canadian concern that the United States was contemplating a
unilateral program to lower Great Lakes levels at a time when
it had been agreed to hold joint consultations on the possibility
of submitting a reference to the International Joint Commission on the effects of consumptive uses and diversions into or
out of the Great Lakes basin. The note pointed out that the
effects of increased diversions at Chicago would not be felt in
the lower lakes for two to three years and that these delayed
effects could coincide with a period of low levels, thus producing problems for navigation, not only in downstream international channels, but in the Canadian section of the St. Lawrence River.
The note also stated that additional diversions would cause
significant adverse economic and environmental consequences
in Canada due to the resultant loss in hydro-electric generating capacity at Niagara Falls, Cornwall and the Canadian
section of the St. Lawrence, and the consequent greater consumption of fossil fuels.
The text of the note was released on October 12, 1976. I am
prepared to table it for the information of honourable senators.

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Benidickson for the second reading of Bill
C-15, to amend the Customs Tariff.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, yesterday we
heard from Senator Benidickson a full and excellent explanation of this bill, particularly of the long and tortuous, and
sometimes absurd, procedures that seem to be necessary to
bring this kind of housekeeping amendment to the Customs
Tariff before Parliament. Senator Benidickson was good
enough to run through some of the stages which, to me,
substantiate my view that we are dealing with an absurd
process in Parliament and in the whole area of our 'trade
relations with other countries.

The bill before us continues, in substance, the general tariff
reductions that were made. in 1973. There are some changes
from that, some additions to the tariff rates and some further
reductions which have taken place along the line since that
time. I point out that we are now implementing a decision
made, and which became effective, as long ago as last May. I
think this indicates that there is some element of absurdity in
the parliamentary process, as we carry it out in this Parliament. The Leader of the Government will wish to say, of
course, that this is the fault of the opposition in holding up
legislation, but I think that anybody who has studied the
parliamentary process as it exists would agree that the fault
lies on both sides, and particularly in the lack of initiative on
the part of the government in respect of bringing about a
methodology for the passage of legislation which would not
result in this kind of absurd situation wherein both houses are
asked to implement changes in the Customs Tariff which are
in effect, and have been in effect since May 1976 and October
1976.
As Senator Benidickson explained so well yesterday, the
broad range of items covered by this bill amount to about $1.6
billion of our imports, based on 1975 figures. These reductions,
covering this large amount of $1.6 billion, were brought about
by the early stages of the anti-inflation program of the government. As explained at that time by the minister, and subsequently by others, the purpose was to reduce the tariff rates on
imports in order to bring down prices in Canada. I shall not at

SENATE DEBATES
this time discuss how effective that has been, but certainly that
was the intent, and it must have had some effect, if not in
lowering prices, then, at least, in keeping them from going
higher than they would otherwise have gone.
This, of course, points up the essential conflict, with respect
to this kind of legislation, between the various areas of public
interest. As was stated, the consumer interest was given high
priority in the structuring of the original bill, and the carryingforward of its provisions by this bill to June 1977. Many of the
changes-the reductions and increases in tariffs, which are
scattered throughout this bill-represent the other interest;
that is, the interest of the producer, the employer and the
employee. And the more I look at this whole question of
international customs tariffs the more I become convinced that
it is a large scale charade that does not really mean very much
in substance.
The changes that are made from time to time-sometimes
called housekeeping changes-are made largely in response to
changing circumstances and particularly to representations,
sometimes from consumers, but more often from producers,
manufacturers and business generally in Canada who find that
their position in the export, and particularly the domestic,
market is affected by low rates or reductions in the existing
tariff rates.
This particular bill has been a long time coming to us, and
that is part of the absurdity of this process in which we seem to
be eternally involved. Bill C-15 is the successor to Bill C-95 of
the last session, which was introduced following the budget
and budget papers in 1976, and which died on the order paper
when the session ended. I say there is something completely
absurd about this situation in which tariff changes affecting
business, consumers and consumer prices, cannot be passed
into law within a reasonable time after budget decisions. We
should not be in the position we find ourselves in February
1977, of implementing-because that is what Parliament does
when it passes legislation of this kind-of implementing fundamental changes which have already been made.
Many suggestions have been made as to possible solutions of
this difficulty, but I see no evidence of any serious attempt-I
am not speaking now only of the government-in Parliament
to solve this problem. The problem has been solved in other
jurisdictions similar to ours, and I find it passing strange that
in Canada we have not been able to solve it.
For example, we have this statement: were it not for this
bill, these changes would have expired on June 30, 1976. The
fact is, of course, that they have not expired; they have been
carried on by extra-parliamentary means. And that is what I
refer to as the absurdity of this method of dealing with the
nation's business.
There are not many of them, but in the bill there are both
some increases and decreases in the existing tariff rates under
the 1973 or subsequent legislation. A change of some consequence, referred to in a question by Senator Hicks, is the
matter of certain scientific items which were the subject of a
decision by the Tariff Board which greatly expanded the

February 3, 1977

exemptions. This had the effect of giving a great deal of
satisfaction to the institutions-hospitals, universities and others-which were using this scientific equipment. In effect, the
Tariff Board said that if the essence of the manufacture is
scientific, the items are exempt. That was the judgment of the
Tariff Board. I admit immediately that the function of the
Tariff Board is to interpret the legislation as it stands, but I
suspect that it had other reasons for reaching that conclusion.
The present bill provides for a method by which the government can overrule the decision of the Tariff Board. I do not
object to that. There may be occasions when the Tariff Board's
interpretation is at variance with what was intended by the
legislation, and that is the situation in this case. However, it
seems to me that when this bill goes to committee there should
be a full explanation of that. I hope Senator Hicks and others
in committee will ask to have the Tariff Board decision
discussed in full so that in this house we may be in a position
to ascertain the soundness or otherwise of the government's
decision to overrule the Tariff Board.
S(1440)

I am taking no position on that because there have been
representations, but my reading of the discussions which have
taken place so far suggests that insufficient consideration has
been given to this particular item which is found in clause 3 of
the bill.
Another interesting statement made in connection with the
bill is that these reduced rates-that is, the rates covering
something like $1.6 billion of our imports-will not be the
basis of our negotiations in GATT. The GATT negotiations
are made on what is called the liberalization of trade internationally, and Canada bas taken different positions. Sometimes
we are for liberalization, and sometimes we are for higher
tariffs.
One of the reasons why I call this whole business of tariff
rates a charade is that we are going to say, "We have now
reduced these tariff items in the interests of our own consumers, but we are not negotiating from that base. We go back to
the pre-1975 rates. That is where we start to talk rates and to
enter into negotiations."
Senator Benidickson: Do you mean pre-1973 rates?
Senator Grosart: Yes, I am sorry, I meant to say the
pre-1973 rates.
This brings me to the other aspect of the charade, that
everywhere in the world today, and particularly in Canadawe are among the worst offenders, because we substitute
immediately a tariff reduction by a non-tariff barrier-it is
freely said that the formal tariff barriers are far less obstructing to international trade than the non-tariff barriers. As I
have said, Canada is in the lead among the nations of the
world in saying that, and we have even invented some which
none of the others have thought of in the textile field.
t am not attempting to take a stance in favour of a unilateral or bilateral free trade, or the Canadian position in respect to
multilateral free trade, but it does seem to me that there are
absurdities inherent in this whole process. We are using kinds

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

of non-tariff barriers that are almost an insuit ta the intelligence of anyone trying ta understand legisiation. For example,
we say, "We wilI subsidize aur own exports"-that, of course,
is the other side af the coin-a-r, "We will maintain these
duties but we will impose quantitative restrictions ta the
import quotas." What is the sense af having a tariff-which is
this huge book-which tells other cauntries, "These are the
rates that we will impose if yau export ta Canada," and then
saying, "We will allow the importation ai only so much"?
There are ather kinds af NTBs that are just as unrealistic in
substance, just as much fiction and foreign ta the real fact that
we are deliberately restricting imports.
We are flot the only ones. Several countries are doing it. The
OECD, a iew years aga, identified no less than 800 kinds af
nan-tariff barriers ail fiction. Some cauntries, for example,
wiii say, "Your invaice must be in the language af the port ai
entry," whicb in same cases may be a dialect of the national
language. This is just a fiction.
It is because of this that I say we are dealing witb a charade
when we talk of customs tariffs. 1 would hope that the time
wiil came befare long wben an attempt will be made ta assess
Canada's position in respect ta the whole question of barriers
ta international trade.in and out ai Canada.
Another matter that is deait with-and Senator Benidickson
referred ta it-is the question ai the British preferential tarjiff.
Honourable senators will recali that when Britain entered the
European Community she autamatically, under the terms ai
entry, iarieited hier rigbt ta the British preferential tariff in
Canada. That applies alsa ta the Republic af Ireland.
It has been Canadian palicy, as Senator Benidicksan said,
nat ta withdraw that preference, but there is a case here in
whicb there is a limited withdrawal. Senator Benidickson
mentianed also that there is under way a study ai certain items
in that British preferential tariff.
Senator Benidickson: Related ta machinery.
Senator Grosart: Yes, ta specific items. There is one other
besides machinery. 1 would hope that a study is being undertaken of aur attitude ta the whale question ai the Britisb and
Irish preferential tarifi as against the mast-favoured-nation
tarifi ta which we have reverted in these twa cases.
1 suggest that, in this wbale area ai aur tarifi rates and
tariff palicies, we seem ta be gaing alang an a very ad hoc
basis. This can. be ratianalized because, as times change and as
other nations take variaus steps, we respond ta them. We now
have the international theary af cauntervailing duties, which is
the wbale philosaphy ai how any nation may respond ta a
fictional nan-tarifi barrier by another fiction called cauntervailing duties.
These matters are under discussion. We ail hope that the
time will came wben Canada and other nations will bring some
degree ai rationality inta this whole question, because it is ai
the utmast importance ta Canada. There may be one other
nation, or perhaps two others, in the warld-perbaps mare
since the ail situation-that are more dependent an their
expart trade than Canada.

80003-21'/2

The very circumstances 1 have been discussing have braught
about a campletely ambivalent approach ta these prablems
from the Canadian point ai view. Same ai aur experts have
taken a leading and distinguisbed part in the GATT negotiatians but, as one reads the reports ai the GATT discussions,
one sympathizes with them because tbey must certainly have
ta run bat and cold.
It is almost impossible for me, as a Canadian abraad, ta say
wbether we have high ar law tarifis, or wbether or nat we are
in favour ai the liberalizatian ai international trade. We keep
saying we are, but, an the ather band, it is said that in certain
areas ai industrial equipment we have the highest tarifis in the
world-certainly in the OECD warld. 1 am nat saying that aur
whale tarifi is hîgher, but in those items that are under a tarifi
restriction it is said that we have the bigbest tarifis among
Western industrialized nations.
1 hope there will be same discussion ai those variaus aspects.
Senator Benidickson, in bis intraduction, most certainly gave
us the lead. 1 am not a member ai the committee ta which I
understand this bill will be referred, but I hope that Senatar
Hicks wiIl pursue tbe point he raised. 1 arn certain that
Senator Benidickson will press for explanations ai the aspects
ai tbe legislation that bie outlined as being possibly
contraversial.

Hon. W. M. Benidickson: Hanaurable senatrsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senatars, 1 wish ta
iniorm tbe Senate that if the Honaurable Senator Benidickson
speaks now bis speech will have tbe eifect ai closing the debate
on the motion for second reading ai this bill.
Senator Benidickson: Honourable senators, I listened with
great interest ta the remfarks made by Senator Grosart, who
has represented us frequently in international conierences and
wbo is very knowledgeable in tbis field, but 1 do feel that a
word or two should be said in reply.
He used pretty strang language in bis opening remarks when
hie said that a bill ai tbis kind introduces absurd and tortuous
procedures. I would point out tbat he bas really answered bis
own criticism because he realizes that tbis was empbasized as
being temporary legisiation in 1973, being introduced for a
period ai ane year only, on the basis ai the general knowledge
that we would be iacing international bargaining and trading
under GATT and other procedures, and that we were nat
giving notice ta the world that we bad permanently given up
the rates that had prevailed prior ta early 1973.
Insofar as tbe interests ai consumers are concerned, since
1973 their position bas not cbanged. There bas been international inflation in pricing, and the same reasons that were
recited in 1973 bave continued ta prevail as strang arguments
for doing everything possible ta pratect the consumer in the
face ai those rising prices. In this regard 1 tbink that perhaps a
re-reading is justified at tbis point ai what the then Minister ai
Finance said when he introduced this broad package in 1973.
The minister at that time was tbe Honaurable John Turner-

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Flynn: Who?
Senator Grosart: John who?
Senator Benidickson: -and when he referred to proposals
concerning the Customs Tariff he said this:
The government is now recommending to parliament
ternporaryAnd we have referred several times to the word "temporary".
-cuts in the tariffs on a wide range of consumer products ... In choosing the products that would be subject to
these tariff reductions, and in deciding how large the
reductions should be, every effort has been made to avoid
any adverse impact on production and employment in our
factories and farms across Canada. At the same time, we
wished to ensure that the tariff reductions would be
sufficiently broad in scope, and of sufficient magnitude to
have a significant effect in dampening the upward pressure on consumer prices.
Of course, as the years have passed since 1973, we have seen
that the reasons for this objective still obtain. The minister
continued, still referring to this large package, involving trade
estimated at that time to be $1.3 billion, as follows:
Particular attention was given to foods and other consumer goods for which tariff rates are higher than average, especially to those that are dutiable at a rate of more
than 15 per cent. This rate is now pretty generally the
basic protective rate in the Canadian tariff. The measure
also covers a number of products in short supply, such as
meats and out of season fruits and vegetables, for which
there is not now a good case for a protective tariff.
Among the non-food consumer products covered by the
measure are drugs and pharmaceuticals, kitchen and dinnerware, furniture, electrical appliances, house trailers,
photographic equipment, sporting goods and toys.
Substantial cuts are also proposed for a number of
most-favoured-nation tariff rates on goods that are not
produced in Canada.
I just wanted to emphasize that the package is large, and
that the section giving order-in-council authority to eliminate
the reductions made in 1973 has been used very sparingly.
I thought Senator Grosart went pretty far when he said that
Canada was a leader in what he referred to as "this charade"
around the world, and in the use of certain subterfuges. He
gave very few examples of this, but he did refer to the question
of quotas. We are met with quotas from many other nations in
the world, in terms of which a departure is made from the
basic rates of tariffs as published and enacted in those countries. In this kind of world we are sometimes forced to fight
fire with fire.
My recollection, over a great number of years, is that
Canada has not been a primary offender in this respect, and I
think that when Senator Grosart indicated that we were at the
top of the list of offenders he was going too far, and I do not
agree with him. On the contrary, over the long years of record
of liberalization of trade, I think Canada has been a leader

among the nations of the world, and certainly cannot be called
a stand-out in the use of charades or subterfuges in the matter
of international trading.
As a matter of fact, I think that Senator Grosart later
retreated from his original rather strong statement, because he
did realize, apparently, or showed some recognition of the fact,
that ad hoc decisions have to be made from time to time by
way of departure from the written tariff rates as provided by
budget procedures.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

EXCISE TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND'READING-DEBATE

ADJOURNED

Hon. Augustus Irvine Barrow moved the second reading of
Bill C-21, to amend the Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, first of all, I should like to
congratulate Senator Benidickson on the very lucid explanation he gave yesterday of the procedure followed with respect
to the various amendinents to the taxing acts.
The bill which we have before us today, which contains
amendments to the Excise Tax Act, is an important bill in that
its main features constitute additional steps it is proposed to
take in order to achieve the government's overall objectives for
energy conservation.
a (1500)

Honourable senators will recall that a special excise tax on
high-energy-consuming vehicles, as well as levies on privatelyowned aircraft, motorcycles and boat motors, were imposed
effective November 18, 1974. Other measures include the
government's reduction of exports of Canadian oil and
petroleum products, and the special excise tax on gasoline for
personal use.
In addition, in a document entitled An Energy Strategy for
Self-Reliance, issued in April 1976 and,
Canada-Policiesfor
I believe, tabled in this house, the government has stated its
objective of energy self-reliance as well as indicating a series of
specific energy targets. This document also enumerated specific policy elements and priorities such as appropriate energy
pricing, increased exploration and development, and energy
conservation. In order for Canada to accomplish a reduction in
the average rate of growth of energy use over the next ten
years, further energy conservation incentives, including
increased taxes in some areas and reduced taxes in others, are
required.

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Accordingly, this bill provides for two measures to deter
wasteful consumption of energy: the imposition of a special
excise tax of $100 on air conditioners for use in automobiles,
stationwagons, vans, and smaller trucks, and significant
increases in the special excise tax on high-energy-consuming
motor vehicles.
Since the introduction of the special excise tax on automobile air conditioners some questions have been raised as to the
extent to which automobile air conditioners consume energy.
Studies indicate that motor vehicle air conditioners increase
fuel consumption appreciably. The exact amount of fuel consumed by a particular air-conditioned vehicle can vary depending upon such factors as size, weight and operating conditions.
However, it must be remembered that the fundamental purpose of the special excise tax, as well as the other special excise
taxes to which I referred earlier, is to deter unnecessary or
avoidable consumption of energy. There is no doubt that motor
vehicle air conditioners do increase fuel consumption.
It should be kept in mind that the special excise tax does not
preclude the purchase of an automobile air conditioner.
Rather, the tax acts as a deterrent, as it requires those who
insist on having such items to make a special payment in
recognition of their added consumption of our nation's scarce
energy resources. This will deter some potential purchasers,
but such adaptations are necessary if the critical energy situation is not to force upon Canadians much more severe adjustments at a later date.
This bill also provides for the reduction of the weight
threshold above which the special excise tax on high-energyconsuming vehicles takes effect, as well as an increase in the
rates of tax applicable to vehicles which exceed their respective
weight limits. The weight threshold for automobiles is reduced
to 4,425 pounds, and the weight threshold for stationwagons
and vans is reduced to 5,000 pounds. Vehicles exceeding these
thresholds are subject to a tax of $30 for the first 100 pounds
over the threshold, $40 for the second 100 pounds, $50 for the
third 100 pounds, and $60 for each additional 100 pounds in
excess of the weight limit.
I would point out to honourable senators that the reduction
of 75 pounds in the automobile weight limit, and the reduction
of 100 pounds in the weight limit for station wagons and vans,
differ from the reductions of 250 and 350 pounds respectively
which were proposed in the May 25 budget speech. This
change, as well as a change in the effective date of the
proposals, from August 1, 1976 to September 1, 1976, was
reflected in an amended notice of ways and means motion
tabled on October 28, 1976, and resulted from extensive
discussions between representatives of the automobile industry
and government officials. As a result of these discussions, the
government has been persuaded that an alternative form of
tax, based on fuel consumption rather than weight, should
receive in-depth analysis.
To provide sufficient time for the examination of this alternative form of tax, it was decided that the impact of the tax
changes announced in the budget speech should be reduced.
For this same reason, the further reductions in the weight

thresholds proposed in the May budget, which were to come
into effect in 1977 through 1979, have also been deferred
pending completion of the detailed analysis of the miles per
gallon alternative by the automobile industry and the
government.
As I indicated earlier, this bill also provides energy conservation incentives in the form of reduced taxes. In this regard,
the bill provides for the removal of the federal sales tax from a
number of items which contribute directly to the development
of energy sources other than fossil fuels. Included in this list
are such items as solar furnaces, solar panels and tubes, solar
cells and wind-powered generating equipment. Tax relief is
also provided for goods which provide for more efficient use of
energy, such as heat pumps and heat recovery units for
extracting heat from exhaust air or waste water. To encourage
the increased use of thermal insulation, the current sales tax
exemption for thermal insulation materials for buildings is
extended to include thermal insulation materials designed for
use in the insulation of pipes and ducts in buildings and
mechanical systems.
Developments in the field of energy conservation are taking
place at an increased rate. For this reason, and to allow
prompt tax relief for new energy conservation equipment, this
bill also provides that the Governor in Council may prescribe
by regulation additional equipment, articles and material to be
energy conservation equipment for purposes of the Excise Tax
Act and, therefore, exempt from federal sales tax.
While the energy conservation measures I have outlined are
the major features of this bill, a number of technical changes
are also provided. In order to reduce compliance costs for
taxpayers who deal in excisable goods, the licensed wholesaler
concept has been extended. This will allow taxpayers, who hold
a wholesaler's licence and who deal in excisable goods, to
purchase such goods without payment of tax. Instead, these
taxpayers will be required to account for excise tax at the time
of sale, if the goods are sold under taxable conditions. Previously, when excisable goods were sold under tax-exempt conditions, these licensed wholesalers were required to file for a
refund to recover the excise tax paid at the time of purchase of
the goods.
During the debate on this bill in the other place, concerns
were raised as to the appropriateness of the dollar barrier of
sales below which persons are not required to comply with the
provisions of the Excise Tax Act. I am referring to the
so-called small manufacturer's exemption. Currently, this
dollar barrier of sales is established at $3,000. Comments on
this provision centered around the appropriateness of this
dollar level as an incentive to small business in light of
inflation and the passage of time since this level was
established.
However, it should be pointed out that the purpose of the
small manufacturer's provision is not to provide an incentive
for small business; rather, it is solely to avoid licensing those
businesses whose sales volume, if licensed, would not generate
sufficient revenue to cover the cost of complying with the
Excise Tax Act. This provision is an administrative matter and

as such is the responsibility of the Minister of National
Revenue. 1 have been assured that the min ister is aware of the
concerns voiced in this area and is giving them careful
consideration.

February 3, 1977

This concludes my remarks on second reading. I would ask
ail honourable senators to give consideration to the passage of
this bill.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.

A.-INTRODUCTION
2. The purpose of this Report is to acquaint both Houses of
Parliament with the work of the Committee between January
1974 and January 27, 1977, and to present to both Houses
particular issues and problems that confront the Commnittee.
In this Report matters arising from divers individual statutory
instruments considered by the Committee wilI be used as
illustrations only.
3. The Committee's primary function is to maintain a watch
on the subordinate Iaw made by delegates of Parliament. In
the modern era Parliament bas been forced by considerations
of time and lack of technical and scientific expertise to leave to
subordii1 ates the making of detailed mules and regulations and
to confine itself increasingly to setting the main structures of
legislative interventions in society. However, Parliament
retains responsibility for the Iaw of the land and to the extent
that those detailed rules and egulations are not subject t0
Pamliamentary scrutiny Parliament is forfeiting its effective
right to settle tbe Iaws tbat must be obeyed by the people.
Parliamentary scrutiny of ail such subordinate or delegated
Iaw is now an accepted part of the Parliamentary tradition in
the Commonwealth. Its advent in Canada owes much to the

SENATE DEBATES

Report of the MacGuigan Committee-(1) which led to the
passage of the Statutory Instruments Act. The Standing Joint
Committee is aware of its serious responsibility in maintaining
parliamentary sovereignty and supremacy.
4. The Committee has not to date reported on any particular
statutory instruments partly because many instruments to
which it has taken objection have been amended to remove the
objectionable features. Similarly, undertakings to effect
amendments or to take account of the Committee's objections
in the next general review of a particular set of regulations or
other statutory instruments have in many instances been
accepted. Yet the principal reason for the Committee's delay
in reporting on any particular instruments lies in the preoccupation of the Committee with legal problems, problems relating to its jurisdiction, the meaning of certain provisions of the
Statutory Instruments Act, the powers contended for by the
Crown as flowing from enabling powers in common use, and
the refusal of legal officers of the Department of Justice
serving in departments in certain circumstances to enter into
significant correspondence with the Committee because they
are aware of the Deputy Minister's original view, later supported by the present Minister, that the Committee should not
be given any explanation or information because they were of
the opinion that this would involve officers of the Department
of Justice in the expression of legal opinions. To ail these
problems this Report will address itself.
5. The Committee wishes to assure both Houses that in
accepting undertakings by departments of state and regulation-making authorities to repeal or to amend regulations and
other statutory instruments the Committee does not compromise its independence, nor does it divest itself of jurisdiction.
Ali statutory instruments stand permanently referred to the
Committee by virtue of section 26 of the Statutory Instruments Act and every undertaking to repeal, to amend or to
reconsider a regulation or other statutory instrument is kept
under review to ensure that the undertaking is carried out. The
Committee wishes to record its appreciation of the co-operation extended to it by many departments and regulation-making authorities.
6. The following general statistics as of 15th July, 1976,
may serve to illustrate the extent and progress of the Committee's work.

Instruments awaiting consideration by the Committee -332
* 84 of these Instruments are included in one enquiry directed

13/76
7. The Committee's manner of proceeding may be of interest to Honourable Senators and Members of the House of
Commons as it differs somewhat from the procedure adopted
by like Committees in Great Britain and in Commonwealth
countries where instruments are in most instances scrutinized
either as part of the very process of their making or are subject
to negative disallowance and positive affirmation procedures.
Your Committee sees instruments only after they have already
been made (and published, in those cases in which they are
published) and there were in 1969 only i1 Statutes of Canada
which provide for disallowance or affirmation procedures in
the Houses.-(2)
8. Instruments, as published, or as they come to the attention of the Committee or its counsel, are first perused by
counsel who submit the instruments to the Committee with
any pertinent comments or explanatory material elicited from
departments and regulation-making authorities. The Committee, which meets weekly in public while the Houses are sitting,
and monthly otherwise, to deal with its permanent reference,
considers the instruments and accompanying material and if it
finds any feature of a particular instrument questionable as
appearing to transgress any of its Criteria for scrutiny, the
relevant department or authority is informed of the Committee's views through its Designated Instruments Officer and
invited to offer an explanation or to give assurances either as
to the meaning and operation of an instrument or as to
amendment of the instrument. In many instances the explanations or assurances received from departments are entirely
acceptable to the Committee upon its further consideration of
the instruments and nothing further need be done unless

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

promised action is not taken. In cases in which the Committee
regards the explanation as not disposing of the objection the
department or authority is informed of the Committee's views
and of the Committee's suggestions as to the remedial action
which should be taken. As will appear from the statistics in
paragraph 6, this procedure has resulted in many amendments
to and undertakings to amend instruments. Unfortunately, the
Committee's manner of proceeding has been frustrated in a
considerable number of other instances by the refusal of some
Designated Instruments Officers, who are lawyers in the service of the Department of Justice, to give explanations which
involve any points of law or to accept the Committee's invitation to give reasons why some feature of an instrument which
appears to the Committee to be ultra vires the enabling power
is in truth intra vires. Further, there have been instances of a
refusal to expreàs any view on the interpretation of words in an
instrument or to affirm or to deny that they are obscure or
ambiguous or otherwise in need of clarification. This causes
serious difficulties to the Committee. This matter receives a
separate treatment in section G of this Report: "The Withholding of Information from the Committee".
B.-CRITERIA FOR SCRUTINY OF STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
9. In order to assess statutory instruments in the exercise of
its permanent reference the Committee has adopted fourteen
criteria. These were adopted by the Senate on November 14,
1974 (English text) and December 4, 1974 (French text) and
were concurred in by the House of Commons in both languages on December 13, 1974.
10. The criteria are as follows:
Whether any Regulation or other Statutory Instrument
within its terms of reference that, in the judgement of the
Committee:
(1) (a) is not authorized by the terms of the enabling
statute, or, if it is made pursuant to the prerogative, its
terms are not in conformity with the common law, or
(b) does not clearly state therein the precise authority for
the making of the Instrument;
(2) has not complied with the provisions of the Statutory
Instruments Act with respect to transmittal, recording,
numbering or publication;
(3) (a) has not complied with any tabling provision or
other condition set forth in the enabling statute; or
(b) does not clearly state therein the time and manner of
compliance with any such condition;
(4) makes some unusual or unexpected use of the powers
conferred by the enabling statute or by the prerogative;
(5) (a) tends directly or indirectly to exclude the jurisdiction of the Courts without explicit authorization therefor in
the enabling statute; or
(b) makes the rights and liberties of the subject dependent
on administrative discretion rather than on the judicial
process;

80003-22

(6) purports to have retroactive effect where the enabling
statute confers no express authority so to provide or, where
such authority is so provided, the retroactive effect appears
to be oppressive, harsh or unnecessary;
(7) appears for any reason to infringe the rule of law or
the rules of natural justice;
(8) provides without good and sufficient reason that it
shall come into force before registration by the Clerk of the
Privy Council;
(9) in the absence of express authority to that effect in the
enabling statute or prerogative, appears to amount to the
exercise of a substantive legislative power properly the
subject of direct parliamentary enactment, and not merely
to the formulation of subordinate provisions of a technical or
administrative character properly the subject of delegated
legislation;
(10) without express provision to the effect having been
made in the enabling statute or prerogative, imposes a fine,
imprisonment or other penalty, or shifts the onus of proof of
innocence to the person accused of an offence;
(11) imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains
provisions requiring payment to be made to the Crown or to
any other authority in consideration of any license or service
to be rendered, or prescribes the amount of any such charge
or payment, without express authority to that effect having
been provided in the enabling statute or prerogative;
(12) is not in conformity with the Canadian Bill of
Rights;
(13) is unclear in its meaning or otherwise defective in its
drafting;
(14) for any other reason requires elucidation as to its
form or purport.
The Committee recommends that its criteria for scrutiny be
written into the Statutory Instruments Act so that they will
not need to be adopted and concurred in anew by the two
Houses at the commencement of every Session and Parliament. The Committee believes that an additional criterion
should be added, namely, whether a statutory instrument
trespasses unduly on the rights and liberties of the subject.
I1. The following examples of regulations and other statutory instruments that have been found by the Committee to
transgress qr to illustrate the above criteria may assist in an
understanding of the Committee's work.
Criterion 1(a)-is not authorized by the terms of the enabling
statute, or, if it is made pursuant to the prerogative, its
terms are not in conforimity with the common law.
1. The Committee draws attention to its remarks upon subdelegation of rule-making power and the pretended power of
dispensing with regulations in sections H, I and J of this
Report.
2. SOR/74-49, Kesler Loan Regulations
At the time of the making of these Regulations, section
34.15(3) of the National Housing Act did not permit of

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
regulations being made to dispense with the existing regulations governing the minimum number of persons to occupy
premises in respect of which loans were made. The number
was set at not less than two occupants, one an adult and one a
dependent child of that adult. (Section 97.3 of the National
Housing Loan Regulations-SOR/73-461). Notwithstanding
that provision, SOR/74-49 purported to dispense with that
requirement and to allow a loan to be made in respect of a
housing unit to be occupied by two named adult persons
resident in Lethbridge, Alberta. In the course of correspondence with the Legal Division of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, it became apparent that the attempt by
SOR/73-461 to specify the "composition" of the minimum
number of occupants was itself ultra vires. Subsequently,
section 34.15(3) of the Act was amended by 23-24 Eliz. Il cap.
82, section 3, to give the Governor in Council power both to
specify the composition of the minimum number of occupants
and to make regulations specifying different numbers of occupants for different family housing units.
3. SOR/72-402, Public Service Employment Regulations,
amendment
The Committee considered section 7(2) of the Regulations
to be both ultra vires the Public Service Employment Act and
inconsistent with sections 10 and 33 of the same Act, for it
constituted an attempt to alter the basic system of recruitment
laid down in mandatory terms in section 10 in substituting the
opinion of a responsible staffing officer in other than cases of
urgency for a "process of selection designed to establish the
merit of candidates." The Committee also considered section
7(2) of the Regulations to be inconsistent with section 11 of
the Act in that the opinion the subsection refers to is not that
of the Commission, as called for by section 11, but of a
"responsible staffing officer".
The Public Service Commission appears to have accepted
the force of the Committee's views. The Commission is currently preparing amendments to the Act and the Committee
has informed the Commission that what is required is a
retroactive amendment to the Act validating the appointments
made under section 7(2) of the Regulations (which is still
purportedly in force) and indemnifying all involved in the
paying of salary and fringe benefits to all those so appointed.
4. SOR/74-8,
Regulations

Indian Off-Reserve

and

Eskimo Housing

The authority for these Regulations rests in a series of votes
in Appropriation Acts. (This method of authorizing subordinate legislation is discussed fully infra, section K.) Originally
confined to making loans to Indians, the purposes of the earlier
votes were extended by Vote L51a, Appropriation Act No. 7,
1967 to include loans to Eskimos "on the same terms and
conditions, for the same purposes and subject to the same
provisions ...

as loans made to Indians

...

". However,

section 3(l)(b) of the Regulations imposes a restriction on a
loan to an Eskimo which does not apply in the case of a loan to
an Indian, namely that the location of the house in respect of

February 3, 1977

February 3, 1977

which the loan is to be made must be acceptable to the
Minister.
The Designated Instruments Officer of the Department of
Indian Affairs and Northern Development declined to advance
any argument to the Committee justifying this provision as
intra vires the enabling power on the grounds that to do so
would involve him in the expression of a legal opinion to the
Committee which the Deputy Minister of Justice has opined is
not a proper function for an officer of the Department of
Justice. This withholding of information from the Committee
is considered infra, section G.
Criterion No. I(b)-does not clearly state therein the precise
authority for the making of the Instrument.
1. While all Departments and authorities, with the exception
of the Honourable the Treasury Board, appear now to be
prepared to disclose all the authority on which they are relying
in making regulations, the Committee draws attention to the
non disclosure of the place of publication of some authority
(Sections D and E infra) and the failure to shew when and
where enabling sections in statutes have been amended since
the last revision of the statutes in 1970 (section F infra).
2. SOR/73-548, Copyright Fees Order, SOR/73-549, Industrial Design Fees Order
These two Orders were headed respectively Copyright Act
and Industrial Design Act. They were expressed to be made
pursuant to unpublished Orders in Council. The Committee
considers that, where the authority for a piece of subordinate
legislation is an Order in Council which has not itself been
treated as a regulation, it should nonetheless be published for
otherwise no one can determine whether or not the subordinate
legislation is in truth intra vires and all conditions in the Order
have been observed.
In the case of both these Orders, the true enabling authority
was section 13 of the Financial Administration Act, under
which the unpublished Orders in Council were made authorizing the Minister to set fees. In the case of the Copyright Act,
section 41(1) does provide a power to impose higher charges
than those imposed under the Act, but there is no such
provision in the Industrial Design Act. The Privy Council
Office has agreed that in future cases section 13 of the
Financial Administration Act will be cited as the enabling
authority along with the Order in Council made thereunder,
which will in future be published as a matter of public interest
in Part Il of the Canada Gazette.
3. SI/73-48, Schedule to the Narcotic Control Act,
amendment
This addition of a substance to the Schedule was accomplished in an Order which recited the incorrect enabling
authority. The Privy Council Office has relied upon the dismissal of leave to appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada
from a conviction for possession of the substance so added, for
the proposition that an instrument is not rendered invalid by a
misrecital of enabling authority. The Committee has this
proposition under advisement but considers, nonetheless, that

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

this statutory instrument should be revoked and a new addition
to the Schedule made reciting the correct authority. It would
appear that the Privy Council Office is not prepared to comply
with the Committee's views.
Criterion No. 2-has not complied with the provisions of the
Statutory Instruments Act with respect to transmittal,
recording, numbering or publication.
The Committee has had no occasion to invoke this Criterion.
However, the Committee is of the view that many statutory
instruments have not been treated as such because of the view
taken by the Department of Justice of the definition of a
statutory instrument in section 2 of the Statutory Instruments
Act. This matter is considered in detail in section E infra.
Criterion No. 3(a)-has not complied with any tabling provision or other condition set forth in the enabling statute.
SOR/72-261, Direction to the Canadian Radio-Television
Commission Respecting ineligibility to hold Broadcasting
Licences
Section 27(2) of the Broadcasting Act imposes a tabling
requirement which applies to this Direction. It did not appear
to the Committee that the tabling requirement had been met.
an impression that was confirmed by the Department of
Communications by letter of July 30, 1975. Despite reminders
the Department took over one year to examine the legal status
of the untabled Direction only to advise on September 1, 1976
that it was the Department's view that "the failure to have the
order tabled before Parliament, as is required under Section 27
of the Broadcasting Act, does not invalidate it". To date the
Direction has not been tabled. Nor has it been remade and
tabled within due time. The Committee has the Department's
view as to the consequences of failure to table under
advisement.
Criterion No. 3(b)-does not clearly state therein the time and
manner of compliance with any such condition.
1. SOR/74-596, Cranberries Duty Order, 1974
Section 11 of the Customs Tariff empowers the Governor in
Council to reduce duties on goods imported into Canada "from
any country or countries as may be deemed reasonable by way
of compensation for concessions granted by any such country
or countries". The Cranberries Duty Order, 1974 did not
reveal upon its face that some concession or concessions had
been granted which led to the reduction of duties on cranberries. The Designated Instruments Officer for the Department
of Finance has advised the Committee that in future Orders
issued pursuant to section 11 of the Customs Tariff will refer
to the fact of concessions having been granted by other countries to Canada justifying the duty reductions provided for in
the Orders.
2. SOR/73-14, SOR/73-128, SOR/73-244, SOR/74-122,
SOR/74-550, Federal Court Rules
Section 46(4) of the Federal Court Act requires that notice
be given in the Canada Gazette of any proposal to amend,
vary, revoke or add to any rule or rules of the Court ai least

80003-22'/

sixty days before implementing the proposal with the consent
of the Governor in Council, either as originally drafted or
altered in light of representations received as a result of
publication of the notice in the Gazette. The form of notice
must invite interested persons to submit written representations. While the Committee's searches revealed that the
requirements had been complied with, compliance did not
appear on the face of the amending Orders. The Director of
Legal Services to the Privy Council Office acquiesced in the
Committee's views that compliance with the terms of section
46(4) of the Act should appear in all future amendments.
Criterion No. 4-makes some unusual or unexpected use of
the powers conferred by the enabling statute or by the
prerogative.

1. SOR/73-604, Pacific Tariff of Wharf Charges, section
15(4)
Section 15(1) provides for two circumstances in which free
time shall be allowed. Yet section 15(4) confers upon the
National Harbours Board a discretion to extend or to limit the
free time so provided for. The National Harbours Board
advised the Committee that the reason for the discretion was
to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, sucb as labour
problems, which can delay processing of documents on handling of cargo. Given this explanation, the Committee could
not see why the Board should require a discretion to limit free
time. The National Harbours Board has agreed and will be
revising the Regulations at an early date. The Committee
notes that in SOR/76-190, Montreal Harbour Railway Tariff,
a similar provision (section 4.1) has been confined to the
extension of free time.
2. SOR/75-291, Port Alberni Harbour Small Vessel Facilities
The Port Alberni Harbour Commission bas, in certain circumstances, power to require a small vessel to vacate its
position at a small vessel facility before the time contracted
and paid for has expired. Pursuant to section 7 of these
Regulations the Commission has a discretion whether or not to
refund rates paid in advance in respect of the period for which
a vessel is required to vacate its berth. The Committee considered that there should be an obligation to make such a
refund and that, if the Commission wished to have authority to
set off against such a refund any other sums owing to it by a
vessel owner, it should be given that authority expressly. The
Ministry of Transport advised that refunds are made subject to
deductions for liabilities incurred during the actual periods of
berthage, for example utility services. It had been considered
that a provision specifically covering such deductions would be
too complex. The Ministry has agreed to reconsider the matter
when the next amendment to the Regulations is processed.
3. SOR/75-384, Petroleum Import Cost Compensation Regulations, section 10(a)(ii)
The Committee has questioned this provision on the grounds
of vires as being made under an enabling power introduced by
the word "respecting", a matter discussed more fully infra
section H, paragraph 84 and section 1, paragraphs 89, 90, 91

SENATE DEBATES

and 92. The provision also strikes the Committee, even if intra
vires, as obnoxious as amounting to a gross interference with
the liberties of the subject and as an attempt to force importers
to countenance the re-creation of the General Warrant,
declared to be illegal in Entick v. Carrington (1765).-(3) The
provision reads:
"10. No payment shall be made under these Regulations to
an eligible importer unless he has
(a) given an undertaking in writing to the Board that ...
(ii) he will allow any person designated by the Board to
enter any premises of the importer in order to examine,
take copies of or extracts from, any records, books,
papers or other document found thereon that, in the
opinion of that person, relates to the payment of import
compensation to that importer,"
It is observed that this provision does not confine the right of
entry to reasonable times of the day. It also gives the designated person an unfettered discretion to decide what documents do and do not relate to the payment of import compensation. This necessarily carries with it the "right" to inspect
any and all papers or records of an importer (including, for
example, his personal records, income tax records, etc.) for the
purpose of classifying them. There is no let whatever on the
classification arrived at by the officer and hence on the
documents he may copy. Such extraordinarily wide powers of
entry and inspection are thoroughly undesirable.
4. SOR/72-407, Explosives Regulations, amendment
While power to make regulations governing the sale of
explosives is provided for by section 4(n) of the Explosives Act,
the Committee objected to the new section 108.1(2) of the
Regulations, added by this amendment, in that it prohibited
the sale of fireworks to a person who appears to be under the
age of eighteen years. The Committee considered that the
subsection could be given effect to in this wise: even if you are
over the age of eighteen years, if you appear to be under
eighteen years, you may not buy fireworks.
The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources agreed
that the subsection should be replaced by more equitable
wording, a result accomplished by SOR/75-557 so that the
subsection now reads:
"108.1(2) No person shall sell any fireworks to a person
who appears to be under the age of eighteen years and does
not produce evidence that he is of the age of eighteen years
or over."
Criterion No. 5(a)-tends directly or indirectly to exclude the
jurisdiction of the Courts without explicit authorization
therefor in the enabling statute.
1. The Committee draws attention to its remarks on subjectively worded tests infra, section T.
2. SOR/74-59, Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Regulations, section 16(4)
This subsection provides that:

Februarv 3, 1977
February

3

1977

"(4) Where any vessel or goods have been seized under
subsection (1) and proceedings in respect of the offence have
been instituted, the court or judge may, with the consent of
the protection officer who made the seizure, order the vessel
or goods to be returned to the person from whom they were
seized upon the giving to Her Majesty of security by bond,
with two sureties, in an amount and form satisfactory to the
Minister."
Thus, an order of a court or judge, which might be thought
beneficial to the subject, is made to depend upon the giving of
consent by the fisheries protection officer who effected seizure.
The Committee regards it as objectionable in principle that the
jurisdiction of a court and of Her Majesty's judges should be
dependent upon the discretionary decision of an investigative
and administrative officer, especially the very officer who,
having effected seizure, initiated that exercise of jurisdiction
and may well appear to have an interest in the hearing at the
conclusion of which an Order may be made. The Committee
notes that a similar consent of an officer is not required under
section 58(7) of the Fisheries Act.
The Committee's concern was made known to the Designated Instruments Officer at the Department of the Environment in June, 1975, but to date the Committee has had no
response.
Criterion No. 5(b)-makes the rights and liberties of the
subject dependent on administrative discretion rather
than on the judicial process.
1. The Committee draws attention, in this context also, to its
comments infra, section T on the granting of powers in discretionary form.
2. SOR/72-263, Sale of Postage Stamps Regulations
Section 14 of these Regulations gives to any Postmaster an
unfettered power to cancel any licence at any time issued
under the Regulations. While the Committee is exercised by
the authority for the sub-delegating of such power to Postmasters, it is more concerned by the fact that no grounds or
criteria are spelled out as justifying cancellation and by the
lack of any provision for a hearing or any opportunity for the
licensee to be heard or of any obligation to assign a cause for
cancellation. Even if it should be that, contrary to the view of
the advisers to the Privy Council Office, an action for review
of the decision to cancel a licence will lie under section 28 of
the Federal Court Act in the event that the rules of natural
justice are ignored, the Committee feels that the subject
should not necessarily be forced to litigation. Given the uncertainty which seems to surround the availability of jurisdiction
under section 28, the Committee considers that the requirements of natural justice should be included in the regulations,
not only to protect the subject but also to ensure jurisdiction in
the Federal Court under section 28 of the Federal Court Act.
To the extent that the decision to cancel is a purely administrative one, thus precluding review under Section 28, the
elemental safeguards of natural justice are the more necessary.

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Criterion No. 6-purports to have retroactive effect where the
enabling statute confers no express authority so to provide
or, where such authority is so provided, the retroactive
effect appears to be oppressive, harsh or unnecessary.
1. SOR/74-259, Meat Inspection Regulations
Section 3(2) of these Regulations provided that section 3(1),
which had the effect of increasing meat inspection fees in
registered establishments, should come into force on April 1,
1974. However, the Regulations themselves were not made
until April 23, 1974 and not registered until April 24, 1974,
being published in the Gazette on the 8th of May in the same
year. There is no authority in the Meat Ispection Act for the
making of any retroactive Regulations or the increasing of fees
retroactively. The Department of Agriculture replied to the
Committee's expression of concern, explaining the delays that
had occurred and assuring the Committee that the Departmental Legal Officers had already expressed their view that
the increase in fees did not take effect until April 23, 1974 and
that this conclusion had been made known to the departmental
officers concerned in the implementation of the Regulations.
2. SOR/72-329, Science Education Sets Regulations
The above Regulations were made pursuant to the Hazardous Products Act. Section 3(1) of the Regulations was
expressed to commence on the lst of April 1972. Yet the
Regulations were not made until the 24th of August, registered on the 28th of August and published on the 13th of
September 1972. The Department of Consumer and Corporate
Affairs conceded that section 3(1) of the Regulations was
retroactive and advised that neither the officials of the Department nor the draftsmen of the Regulations intended this result.
The Department further advised that no prosecution under the
section had taken place and gave as its opinion that, since the
supply of chemistry sets the importation of which predates
1972 was diminishing, it was unlikely that a prosecution would
arise. The Department's Legal Officers had advised the officials concerned that should a violation arise concerning such a
chemistry set they were not to consider prosecution. In this
instance the Committee did not regard such advice to the
departmental officials as sufficient and bas requested that the
purported retroactivity of section 3(1) be removed by an
amendment to the Regulations, in order to obviate any possibility of prosecution and any detriment to the rights of the
subject.
Criterion No. 7-appears for any reason to infringe the rule of
law or the rules of natural justice.
1. The Committee refers to its comments infra section S, on
the powers of entry and of inspection of officers of agricultural
and commodity boards.
2. SOR/76-181, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission
Rules
Rule 13(2) is so drafted as to give the Commission a
discretion to give or to refrain from giving reasons for an
Order. The Commission has advised the Committee that such

a result was not intended and that reasons will always be
given. What was intended was to acquire the power to make an
Order, with the reasons to be published subsequently, except in
the case of a consent Order. A provision that reasons would
always be given was omitted from the Rules in the drafting
stage. Steps are being taken to give effect to the Commission's
intentions.
3. SOR/72-466, Hatchery Regulations
Sections 5 and 6 of these Regulations deal with the issuing
of permits, without which it is unlawful to conduct hatcheries.
Section 5 requires that an application for a permit be made to
the District Supervisor who reports to the Minister on the
acceptability of the proposed hatchery. Under section 6 the
Minister has a complete power to grant or to withhold a
licence notwithstanding the content of the District Supervisor's
report. However, should an unfavourable report be submitted
to the Minister, there is no requirement that the applicant be
so informed, or that he be given an opportunity to be heard in
rebuttal.
The Department of Agriculture advised the Committee that
it is the invariable practice of Regional Directors to discuss
any inadequacies in an applicant's facilities before a report is
submitted to the Minister. The Department has, however,
acknowledged that such processes of consultation and advice
to applicants should be regularized and coupled with a right to
be heard in any applicant who considers the Regional Director
to be wrong in his assessment.
4. The Committee bas under continuing study SOR/75-196,
Public Service Inquiry Regulations, which pose certain problems of procedural safeguards for public servants who have
been suspended by the Governor in Council "in the interest of
the safety or security of Canada or any state allied or associated with Canada" pursuant to section 7(7) of the Financial
Administration Act. Not least amongst these problems is the
right of the public servant to know the case against him.
Criterion No. 8-provides without good and sufficient reason
that it shall come into force before registration by the
Clerk of the Privy Council.
While the Committee has attempted to ascertain the reasons
why certain Regulations should come into force before being
registered, it has not been successful. This matter is discussed
in section E, paragraphs 33, 34 and 35 infra. Consequently,
the Committee is unable to say whether any regulations have
come into force before registration without good and sufficient
reason therefor.
The
ments,
before
section

Committee has noted instances of statutory instrunot being regulations, coming into force many months
their registration, and this matter is also discussed in
E, paragraph 24 infra.

Criterion No. 9-in the absence of express authority to that
effect in the enabling statute or prerogative, appears to
amount to the exercise of a substantive legislative power
properly the subject of direct parliamentary enactment,

SENATÉ DEBATES

and not merely to the formulation of subordinate provisions of a technical or administrative character properly
the subject of delegated legislation.
1. The Committee wishes to refer to section K infra on the
making of subordinate legislation under Votes in Appropriation Act and Items in the Estimates.
2. SOR/73-153, Trade Mark Rules, amendment
This amendment added a new Rule 12 to the Regulations.
The old Rule 12 forbade the Registrar to furnish any information the giving of which required him to search his records or
to express any opinion which concerned the interpretation of
the Act or the Rules or the registrability of any trade marks
not the subject of a pending application for registration.
Parliament had itself provided for the opening of the Register
in limited circumstances in section 28.
The new Rule 12 gives to the Registrar a discretion to
furnish the information or express the opinions he was previously forbidden to furnish or express if in his discretion he
considers this course to be in the public interest.
The Committee is still pursuing the vires of this new Rule
and the desirability and scope of the discretion now given to
the Registrar, but wishes now to report that it considers that
the circumstances in which the Register should be open and
opinions expressed as to the interpretation of the Act, the
Rules or the registrability of trademarks should be specified by
Parliament, as it already has in some degree in section 28 of
the Act, and not by subordinate legislation.
3. SOR/75-558, National Energy Board Part VI Regulations,
amendment
Section 17 of the National Energy Board Act reads:
"(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Board may review,
rescind, change, alter or vary any order or decision made by
it, or may re-hear any application before deciding it.
(2) The Board may change, alter, or vary a certificate or
licence issued by it but no such change, alteration or variation is effective until approved by the Governor in Council."
Section 10 of the Regulations previously read simply:
"10. Every licence shall state
(a) in the case of gas, the total quantity of gas that may be
exported or of gas that may be imported thereunder, and the
maximum quantities for any daily, monthly, annual or other
appropriate period, and
(b) in the case of electrical power and electrical energy, the
quantities in terms of kilowatts and kilowatthours that may
be exported thereunder, the quantities if any that may be
imported as an offset to the export, and the maximum
quantities for any daily, monthly, annual or other appropriate period with respect to both exports and imports."
Section 10 was then amended to read as follows:
"10.(1) Subject to subsection (2), every licence shall state
(a) in the case of gas, the total quantity of gas that may be
exported or of gas that may be imported thereunder, and the

February 3, 1977

maximum quantities for any daily, monthly, annual or other
appropriate period, and
(b) in the case of electrical power and electrical energy, the
quantities in terms of kilowatts and kilowatthours that may
be exported thereunder, the quantities if any that may be
imported as an offset to the export, and the maximum
quantities for any daily, monthly, annual or other appropriate period with respect to both exports and imports.
(2) Every licence for the exportation of gas is subject to
the condition that where the Board has, pursuant to subsection 17(2) of the Act, varied the quantity of gas stated in the
licence that may be exported thereunder the licensee will,
notwithstanding the quantity stated in the licence, export no
greater quantity of gas than that specified in the order of the
Board that varies the licence."
Counsel to the National Energy Board explained to the Committee the need for the amendment embodied in SOR/75-558
as flowing from the desire of the Board to reduce licensed
quotas for the export of natural gas should such reductions
appear to the Board to be in the public interest. It has been
argued forcefully by some lawyers for licencees that a reduction in a gas export quota is not a change, alteration or
variation of a licence which can be effected simply under
section 17(2) but rather a partial suspension or cancellation of
a licence which can only be effected under section 84(1) of the
Act for violation of a term or condition of the licence, with the
attendant safeguards to the licensee of notice and an opportunity to be heard. In order, therefore, to allow for an unchallengeable reduction in a licensed quota it was decided to
proceed by making every licence subject to the condition that
if a change, alteration or variation were effected under section
17(2) of the Act it would be obeyed, notwithstanding the fact
that if such a condition did not form part of the licence it
might be possible to challenge the change as ultra vires section
17(2) of the Act and as not conforming to the grounds and
procedural requirements for a suspension or cancellation specified in section 84 of the National Energy Board Act. Left at
that, there would arise a situation in which new licences would
be made subject to this condition but old licences would not,
for otherwise the new section 10(2) of the Regulations would
be being given a retroactive operation for which there is no
warrant. However, this obstacle in the Board's path is overcome by section 82(3) of the Act itself which permits the new
section 10(2) of the Regulations to attach to licences both old
and new, for it reads:
"(3) Every licence issued under this Part is subject to the
condition that the person to whom it is issued will comply
with the provisions of this Act and regulations as in force at
the date of the issue thereof and as subsequently enacted,
made or amended and will comply with every order made
under the authority of this Act."
By a process analogous to pulling itself up by its own bootstraps, the object of the Board has been achieved by subordinate legislation. Such an interference with established rights
ought to be carried out under explicit statutory enactment.

4. SI/75-50, Representational Gifts Remission Order
This Order provides that "in recognition of international
comity and practice that Heads of State, Heads of Government, Ministerial representatives of Government and Members of Parliament exchange gifts during official visits" customs duty, sales tax and excise tax shall be remitted on gifts
received by the Prime Minister, Ministers and Members of
Parliament on official visits to other countries or presented by
visiting foreign donors in Canada. The enabling power is
section 17 of the Financial Administration Act which empowers the Governor in Council "whenever he considers it in the
public interest" to remit "any tax, fee or penalty". The
Committee has commented on Remission Orders made under
this section infra, section P. In this instance, the Committee
considers the Order as one not concerned with administrative
detail but constituting a substantive departure from established taxation law, incorporating into the law of Canada an
aspect of "international comity and practice" and creating a
class of privileged persons marked otherwise than by the
conferring of titles or orders. As such, it seems appropriate for
legislative action by Parliament.
Criterion No. 10-without express provision to the effect
having been made in the enabling statute or prerogative,
imposes a fine, imprisonment or other penalty, or shifts
the onus of proof of innocence to the person accused of an
offence.
The Committee has not had occasion to invoke this
criterion.
Criterion No. 1 1-imposes a charge on the public revenues or
contains provisions requiring payment to be made to the
Crown or to any other authority in consideration of any
license or service to be rendered, or prescribes the amount
of any such charge or payment, without express authority
to that effect having been provided in the enabling statute
or prerogative.
1. SOR/74-98, Seaway Regulations
Section 75(2) of these Regulations provided for the imposition of a surcharge when a toll account was not paid within
fourteen days of the date shown on the account. It appeared to
the Committee that neither section 20 of the St. Lawrence
Seaway Authority Act, pursuant to which the Regulations
were made, nor section 16 of the same Act relating to the
establishment of tolls, conferred any authority for the imposing of such a surcharge or penalty. The remedy for an unpaid
account provided for by the Act is detention and ultimately the
sale of the ship and the cargo. After several exchanges of
correspondence with the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority,
which was acting in order to provide for uniformity with the
equivalent American regulations, the Authority agreed to
delete the surcharge provision, and such deletion was effected
by SOR/76-225.
2. SOR/76-121, Olympic Stamp Draw Regulations
These Regulations, made under section 190(l)(a) of the
Criminal Code, permitted the Postmaster General to conduct a

draw in the nature of a lottery amongst persons who affixed
Olympic stamps to an entry card. The Regulations provided
for prizes but there was no authority for the Postmaster
General to expend public moneys upon such prizes. This was
pointed out to the Designated Instruments Officer at the Post
Office. Subsequently, by Order in Council P.C. No. 1976-1042
of 5th May 1976, which has not been registered and published
as a statutory instrument or regulation, the Governor in Council, pursuant to section 52 of the Financial Administration Act,
directed the Postmaster General to transfer public property, in
the form of money, to prize winners. While section 52 provides
that no transfer of public property shall be made to any
person, except "on the direction of the Governor in Council or
in accordance with regulations of the Governor in Council
the Committee entertained some doubt as to whether
....
section 52 is anything more than a procedural requirement
which only arises after actual authority exists for the transfer
of the property. However, the Committee is now satisfied that
section 52 authorizes Order in Council P.C. No. 1976-1042
and awaits only confirmation of a valid parliamentary appropriation covering expenditure by the Post Office on the airline
tickets purchased as prizes.
Criterion No. 12-is not in conformity with the Canadian Bill
of Rights.
SOR/75-525, Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Regulations,
amendment
The only occasion on which the Committee has invoked this
Criterion was a recent amendment to the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries Regulations, SOR/75-525. The amendment inserted
into the Regulations a new section 17(1.1) which provides for
forfeiture of fishing gear or fish, without conviction of any
offence having been entered, in circumstances where the ownership of the gear or fish, having been seized pursuant to other
provisions of the Regulations, can not at the time of seizure be
ascertained by the seizing officer. This provision must have
been thought necessary since the Fisheries Protection Officer
could logically believe on reasonable grounds that fish had
been caught contrary to the Regulations, or that gear had been
used in connection with the commission of an offence under
the Act or the Regulations, thus justifying seizure, without his
being able at the moment of seizure to identify the owner or
owners of the gear or the fish, who might be then charged and
convicted.
This provision was inserted in the Regulations by way of
exception to section 17(1) which provides for forfeiture only
after conviction of an offence. The Committee formed the
tentative view that forfeiture of goods to Her Majesty without
conviction was ultra vires the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
Convention Act and contrary to the Canadian Bill of Rights,
section 1(a), in particular "the right of the individual to
enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof
except by due process of law". The Committee does not believe
that seizure upon "reasonable grounds of belief" and subsequent forfeiture without conviction accords with reasonably
accepted notions of "due process of law". This view was made

324

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

known to the Ministry of State (Fisheries and Marine) by
letter of 24 March 1976. Despite a subsequent reminder the
Ministry bas yet to reply to the Committee's request for an
explanation of this provision.
Criterion No. 13-is unclear in its meaning or otherwise
defective in its drafting.
1. SOR/75-493 and SOR/75-552, Atlantic Crab Fishery
Regulations, amendments
In examining the above regulations it appeared to the
Committee that subsections (1) and (2) of section 13 as
contained in SOR/75-493 were inconsistent. While subsection
(1) permitted the fishing for, retaining, buying, selling and
having in possession, and thus by implication the catching of a
snow crab, in waters adjacent to the coast of Newfoundland,
that is 3 3/4 inches or more in width, subsection (2) commanded the immediate return to the water of any snow crab
caught in the waters adjacent to the coast of Newfoundland. It
would be impossible to obey subsection (2) and have the
benefit of subsection (1).
The Committee noted that section 13 was amended by
SOR/75-552 by deleting the words "caught in the waters
adjacent to the coast of Newfoundland", thus making the
section of general application. Consequently, the words "in the
waters referred to in subsection (1)" should have been deleted
from subsection (2), for there were then no waters mentioned
in subsection (1) to which reference can be made. Even if the
words "in the waters referred to in subsection (1)" were
deleted the inconsistency between subsections (1) and (2)
would remain, for subsection (2) would read:
"(2) Any snow crab or any soft-shelled crab caught shall
be returned to the waters immediately."
The Committee wondered if this subsection should not read:
(2) Any person catching a soft-shelled crab or a snow
crab of less than three and three-quarters inches in width
shall return the same to the water immediately.
or words to the like effect.
The Committee has not received a reply to its observations
from the Ministry of State (Fisheries and Marine), but the
Regulations were revoked by SOR/76-359 which made an
entirely new set of Regulations in which the inconsistencies
noted by the Committee were avoided.
2. The Committee considers it to be especially important to
insist on clear drafting when offences are created. In two sets
of fisheries regulations the Committee has objected to similar
provisions making it an offence to fish for certain species, to
catch and retain them or to have them in possession, without
using clear terms to say so. The first example is found in
section 12(1) of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Regulations
(SOR/74-59 and SOR/74-549) which states that "no person
fishing . . . shall fish for, catch or retain any sea scallops". The

words of section 12(1) suggest that catching sea scallops is as
much an offence as fishing for them. This wording contradicts
section 12(3) which contemplates the return to the waters of

February 3,1977
1977
Februarv 3.

the undersized scallops caught. The Committee then suggested
that the following drafting be adopted for section 12(1):
"No person fishing in . . . shall fish for, or catch and retain

any sea scallops."
The Department of the Environment followed the Committee's
suggestions in its drafting of the new section 11(1) of the
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Regulations (SOR/75-99) which
added to the proscription of fishing for haddock in certain
areas a prohibition on catching and retaining haddock in
excess of certain quantities. The Department bas not yet
amended section 12 of the same Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
Regulations in the manner recommended by the Committee.
Another example of this type of offence was found in the
Quebec Fishery Regulations (SOR/75-420 as amended) where
section 11(1) provides that "no person shall catch, take, or
have in his possession an anadromous salmon of less than
twelve inches .. . ". Section 30(1) of these regulations affords
the possibility to any person who has caught or taken a fish
contrary to the Act or Regulations to return it alive to the
waters. In order to reconcile section 11(1) with the meaning of
section 30(1), the Committee suggested that the drafting be
changed in the following way:
"no person shall catch or take and retain, or have in his
possession . . . "

The Committee has been particularly exercised by these
regulatory provisions because it would appear that as a result
of The Queen v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.-(4) catching or having
in possession pursuant to fishery regulation is an offence of
strict liability of which mens rea is not an essential ingredient.
It is, therefore, very important that the drafting of this type of
offence be precise, because the subject should be able in
reading the regulations to know precisely if it is an absolute
offence to fish for a prohibited species, or merely to catch it, or
to catch it and retain it or to have it in possession. In the
context of the New Atlantic Crab Fishery Regulations SOR/76-359, the Committee has asked the Department of the
Environment why a standard formula for offences can not be
used.
3. SOR/75-472, Petroleum Administration Act, Part I
Regulations
Section 4 of these Regulations stipulates that the return of
information required under section 13(1) of the Petroleum
Administration Act "shall be in the form set out in the
Schedule to the Regulations". Section 5 of the Regulations
lists certain specific items of information which must be
included in the return. However, the form of return prescribed
in the schedule does not contain any space in which the
information required by section 5 can be put.
4. SOR/76-80, Gasoline Excise Tax Refund Regulations
Section 4 of these Regulations provides that every application for a refund, in the form set out in the Schedule to the
Regulations, shall shew one of five numbers issued by the
Department of National Revenue (Taxation or Customs and
Excise). Section 5 in the English text provides that "every

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

application shall shew the same number on each claim submitted". From a reading of the French text and of the Regulations as a whole, the Committee concluded that what was
meant was: "Every application submitted by the same applicant shall shew the same number, as determined under section
4 ... ". The word "claim" did not appear in the enabling
power or elsewhere in the Regulations and its use served only
to confuse. The Department of National Revenue (Customs
and Excise) has agreed to redraw section 5 as suggested by the
Committee.
5. SOR/74-605, Urban Development and Transportation
Plans Regulations
Section 3 of these Regulations reads as follows:
"3. (1) The part of the costs that may be included in
calculating the amount of any payment authorized pursuant
to subsection 3(3) of the Act are those costs that are, in the
opinion of the Minister of Transport, in the case of a
transportation plan, or the Minister of State for Urban
Affairs, in the case of an urban development plan, incremental to the normal operating costs incurred in the preparation
of the plan by the recipient of the payment.
(2) Any interest on funds borrowed in respect of the
preparation of a plan shall not be included in calculating the
incremental costs referred to in subsection (1)."
The formula for determining the costs that may form the
basis of a payment is expressed to be "those costs ... incremental to the normal operating costs incurred in the preparation of the plan by the recipient of the payment". It is easy to
envisage what "costs incremental to the normal operating costs
of the recipient" would be. But it is difficult to comprehend
what are "normal operating costs incurred in the preparation
of the plan." Taken literally that would restrict the relevant
costs to those which are truly exceptional. At first sight this
might be thought to include public relations work and so on.
But then that would not be a cost incurred in the preparation
of the plan.
It is possible that what was meant was:
(a) those costs incurred in the preparation of the plan which
are in addition to the normal operating costs of the recipient
of the payment.
or somewhat differently expressed
(b) those costs that are incurred in the preparation of the
plans by the recipient and are incremental to its normal
operating costs.
Under either (a) or (b) the costs are all those not normally
borne by the recipient as part of carrying on its usual activities. Thus the recipient would not be able to apportion to the
cost of preparing the plan its usual and continuing expenses for
rent, secretaries, typewriters, draughtsmen, coloured inks, etc.
but could only charge costs specially incurred for the projects,
e.g. special staff hired, space rented, supplies purchased, etc.
But whatever is meant it can be argued that it can not be
"costs incremental to normal operating costs incurred in the
preparation of the plan" if the preparation of the plan is not

normal but rather extraordinary and the costs of preparing one
cannot therefore be normal operating costs.
The section as it now stands gives the Minister the power,
rather the discretion, to determine what are "incremental
costs" and hence the costs to be refunded to the recipient.
Section 3(3) of the Act empowers the Minister to pay "part of
the cost" and presumably the regulations "in that behalf" were
to specify what that part of the cost was to be, subject to the
50% ceiling in subsection (4). By giving the Minister the power
to form an opinion as to what is incremental cost the Governor
in Council has in effect delegated to the Minister the power to
determine the "part of the cost" which is to be paid. Admittedly whatever formula is set for determining the part of the cost
to be paid someone must do the sums to produce the amount of
refund. Yet the combination of the vague formula of incremental cost-the Committee can foresee the disagreement
over apportioning heating bills when the planners work later
than anyone else-and the Minister's unfettered discretion to
determine its amount means that the purpose of subsection
3(3) bas been entirely subverted. Parliament might just as well
have enacted:
3. Subject to subsection (4) and to such regulations as
may be made by the Governor in Council, the Minister may
authorize the payment out of moneys appropriated by Parliament therefor of such part as he considers reasonable of
the cost of preparing such one or more transportation plans,
in respect of a transportation study area, as he considers
desirable for the transportation study area.
The Ministry of State for Urban Affairs advised the Committee that there did appear to be ambiguity in the words of
section 3(1) of the Regulations and that the two alternative
meanings suggested by the Committee were being followed by
the Ministry. The Ministry wished to have more time and
experience in operating these new regulations before deciding
which interpretation it wished to adopt. Similarly, the Ministry wanted the advantage of practical experience before limiting ministerial discretion. These practical considerations were
acceptable to the Committee in April 1975. The Committee
considers that the Ministry should now be in a position to
clarify these Regulations as it understands that eight schemes
for relocation of railway undertakings are now in effect.
However, the Director of Legal Services for the Ministry of
State has advised the Committee that "experience to date does
not warrant or justify putting forth changes to the Regulations
at this time". The only crumb offered is that the Committee's
comments will "be kept on file and, at such time as it is
considered that amendments are warranted, will be given due
consideration by this Department and by the Department of
Transport". Meanwhile, the Minister's discretion continues
unchecked.
Criterion No. 14-for any other reason required elucidation as
to its form or purport.
1. The Committee has, under this criterion, consistently
called attention to the granting in subordinate legislation of

SENATE DEBATES

discretionary decision-making powers. The Committee draws
attention to its remarks in section T infra.
2. SOR/75-413, Fishing Vessels Insurance Regulations
Section 27 of these Regulations deals with the return of
premium paid in excess of the amount that is required by the
Regulations and of a premium paid where "the Minister is of
the opinion that the purpose for which the premium was paid
has not been and cannot be fulfilled under these Regulations".
Yet, in these circumstances the Minister is given a discretion
to return the excess amount of the premium, or not to return
it! This appeared to the Committee to call for an explanation
which bas not been forthcoming.
3. SOR/75-67, Unemployment Insurance Regulations amendment, amending section 145(9) of the principal Regulations, as
amended by SOR/72-221
This amendment provides that for certain purposes of the
Act, a claimant fails to prove that he is available for work and
unable to obtain suitable employment on each working day in
a period "if he fails to prove that during that period he made
reasonable and customary efforts to obtain employment".
The Committee wished to be informed as to how this test
was applied and what criteria existed as to its use.
The Unemployment Insurance Commission made available
to the Committee a copy of that part of its Guidelines which
relates to the conduct of the Active Job Search Programme
and explained the claimant's right of appeal to a Board of
Referees and to an Umpire, who is a judge of the Federal
Court of Canada. Upon further enquiry, the Commission
advised that decisions of Umpires are automatically examined
as a basis for changes in the Guidelines. With these answers
the Committee felt justified in concluding that there were
adequate safeguards for claimants. The position of Departmental Guidelines is commented upon in section E infra.
12. The Committee wishes to emphasize that in scrutinizing
statutory instruments it is not limited in terms of its criteria,
which have been approved by both Houses, to question of
vires, lawfulness or simple invalidity through non-compliance
with procedural requirements, conditions precedent or matters
of form. To take but one stark example, the Committee is not
bound by what is sometimes said to be the ratio of In Re
Gray-(5) and other cases arising under the War Measures
Act in both World Wars "that the Governor in Council may
under a general (regulatory) power legislate inconsistently
with any existing statute and also take away a right acquired
under a statute."-(6) Any statutory instrument found to be
inconsistent with an existing statute or which took away a
right acquired under a statute (or another statutory instrument) would be scrutinized most rigorously by the Committee
under criteria 4, 7 and 9.
13. The Committee's concern does not extend to the policy
contained in or carried into force by statutory instruments.
Nonetheless, in applying criterion 4, "unusual or unexpected
use of enabling power", the Committee often desires to be

February 3, 1977

informed of the reason for a particular statutory instrument
and the manner in which it is implemented. The explanations
offered by departments have on several occasions indicated
that what was involved was not an unusual or unexpected use
of the enabling power in carrying out a policy but rather the
matter of policy itself, with which the Committee has no
concern unless it contravenes one of the criteria for scrutiny.
C.-THE SUBORDINATE NATURE OF STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
14. With the exception of statutory instruments made under
the Royal Prerogative, which are original or primary legislation no less so than are statutes, all statutory instruments
subject to the Committee's scrutiny fall into that class known
as subordinate or delegated legislation. The Committee wishes
to emphasize at the outset that subordinate legislation is, and
must be regarded as being, subordinate, for otherwise Parliamentary supremacy will have been abandoned. The Committee
can make this point no more clearly than did the Committee
on Ministers' Powers (Donoughmore Committee) in 1932:
"The power to legisla'te, when delegated by Parliament,
differs from Parliament's own power to legislate. Parliament
is supreme and its power to legislate is therefore unlimited.
It can do the greatest things; it can do the smallest. It can
make general laws ... it can make a particular exception
out of them in favour of a particular individual. It can
provide ... for the payment of old age pensions to all who
fulfill the statutory conditions; it can also provide-and has
in fact provided-for boiling the Bishop of Rochester's cook
to death. But any power delegated by Parliament is necessarily a subordinate power, because it is limited by the terms
of the enactment whereby it is delegated."-(7)
As will become apparent from this Report, the Committee has
come upon many instances of denial of this basic proposition
that delegated legislation is necessarily subordinate. There
seems to be an unwillingness to understand that a delegate
simply can not do everything that Parliament could have donc
had it chosen to legislate in extenso.
15. The claim to give subordinate legislation a non-subordinate status is well illustrated by three recurring issues that
have confronted the Committee: the claim to a power to
dispense with regulations in favour of particular individuals,
the claim to an unfettered power to sub-delegate the rule-making power conferred by Parliament and the claim to a plenitude of legislative power whenever the enabling authority
confers power to make regulations "respecting" a specified
subject matter. Each of these issues receives a separate
treatment.
16. The Committee cannot accept that the actual decisions,
or dicta, in In Re Gray,-(8) the Chemicals Reference-(9)
or other cases arising under so exceptional a statute as the
War Measures Act are any guide to the true nature of
subordinate legislation or to the principles of construction and
interpretation to be placed on other statutes and the enabling

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

sections contained within them in normal times of external
peace.
D.-AVAILABILITY OF SUBORDINATE
LEGISLATION TO THE PUBLIC IN
COMPREHENSIBLE FORM
17. It is, perhaps, not surprising that in Canada, which has
made so late a start upon the scrutiny of subordinate legislation, there persists the view that statutory instruments need
not be made generally available and need not be put in as
simple, comprehensible and explicable form as is possible. This
view rests on the assumption that ordinary folk will not
concern themselves with statutory instruments and that those
affected by them, or who need for their own protection to take
account of them, lawyers, businessmen, fishermen, farmers
and so on will take thought for themselves and make it their
own business to find out what the law is, througþ lawyers,
trade associations, commercial services and the like. While the
Committee acknowledges that this may well be the case, the
premisses of the argument are wrong. If once admitted, the
conclusion must also follow that the statutes need never be
revised, consolidated or published in compendious form,
because those affectéd will themselves do all the necessary
research and piecing together of amendments. And, however
effective the commercial services may be, there is something
fundamentally amiss when even officers of Government themselves depend on an outside commercial service for a consolidation of their own regulations.

directed to people and not to lawyers and officials only. The
Committee feels strongly about its philosophy in this matter
and trusts that the greater readiness recently shown by the
officers of the Privy Council will lead to a dramatic improvement in the ease with which statutory instruments may be
understood and in the information about the subordinate
legislation and the enabling power which they disclose.

E.-DEFECTS IN THE STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
ACT, PRINCIPALLY THE DEFINITION OF A
STATUTORY INSTRUMENT
21. The Committee wishes to place before both Houses the
problems and difficulties which it has encountered as flowing
from the text of the Statutory Instruments Act itself. Some of
these problems are more serious than others, but by far the
most important and difficult is the very definition of a statutory instrument which the Committee has found incomprehensible and unworkable, and productive of inconsistency in
approach even by the Legal Advisers to the Privy Council
Office with whose approach to the definition the Committee
can not agree. Nevertheless, it is the Legal Advisers who are
the persons who actually apply the definition and whose views
are, therefore, complied with by Departments of State and
regulation-making authorities.
22. Before this, and other problems, can be understood the
general structure of the Statutory Instruments Act must be
appreciated. The Act gives a definition of a statutory instrument and provides that all statutory instruments, except those
which are lawfully kept secret-(9a) shall stand permanently
18. The Cornmittee believes that the law is directed to all referred to any Committee of the House of Commons, of the
Her Majesty's subjects. This is as true of subordinate legisla- Senate or of both Houses of Parliament that may be estabtion as it is of statute law. It is as true of statutory instruments lished for the purpose of reviewing and scrutinizing statutory
as it is of the Acts under which they are made. This being so, instruments".-(10) From amongst this class of statutory
statutory instruments should be as intelligible, as explicable
instruments the Act defines a narrower class called "regulaand as little mysterious as man can devise.
tions", not to be confused with the word "regulation" as
defined in the Interpretation Act. It is only a regulation as
19. Statutory instruments pose quite serious problems for
defined in the Statutory Instruments Act which must under
the fulfillment of the Committee's views. First, they are not
self-contained, as is a statute, and refer at least to the enabling that Act be scrutinized in draft by the Legal Advisers to the
Act and often to other documents as well. Secondly, there is a Privy Council Office, be registered and published in the
great number of them, large and small, and certainly far more Canada Gazette Part Il within certain time limits prescribed
than there are statutes. Thirdly, many of them are frequently by the Act. A statutory instrument which is not a regulation
amended so that over time a multiplicity of amendments need not be registered and need not be published unless
registration and/or publication is specifically provided for in
collect around a single statutory instrument. Subsequent
re-amendment and further re-amendment of the initial amend- one of three ways:

prescribed by regulation under section 27(h) of the Statutory Instruments Act.
23. The classes of documents which must appear in the
Gazette are defined by section 11(3) of the Statutory Instruments Regulations as:
"(a) orders made by the Governor in Council under the
Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act;
(b) orders made by the Governor in Council whereby any
member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada is designated to act as Minister for the purposes of any Act of
Parliament;
(c) proclamations; and
(d) orders made under section 17 of the Financial Administration Act that are of continuing effect or apply to more
than one person or body."
It is not at all clear which documents from these classes are
statutory instruments and the Legal Advisers to the Privy
Council Office have declined to identify those which they
consider to be statutory instruments. The Committee has never
been told which types of statutory instruments the Clerk of the
Privy Council has decided should be published in the public
interest. The Committee bas only been furnished with a list of
those individual statutory instruments that have been so
published.
24. It is unfortunately the case that a mere statutory
instrument which is to be published in the Gazette need not be
registered and published within any time limits. The Committee bas seen instances of Proclamations published months, and
in one instance eleven months,-( 11) after they were issued.
By operation of section 6 of the Interpretation Act, as amended by the Statutory Instruments Act, it would seem that a
statutory instrument not being a regulation comes into force
"upon the expiration of the day immediately before the day"
on which it was made, unless some other day is specified for
entry into force. Thus, every statutory instrument which is not
a regulation that is registered and published will corne into
force before registration and publication, except in the inconceivable case in which it is made, registered and published all
in the one day. The Committee can not regard as satisfactory a
law which on the one hand treats some statutory instruments
as sufficiently important to be registered and published, yet
allows them to corne into force perhaps months beforehand
when they are made. The Committee regards as highly desirable a general rule that no subordinate legislation should corne
into effect until registered and published. This general rule
applies neither to regulations nor to mere statutory instruments under the Statutory Instruments Act.
25. The Committee is faced, then, with a situation in which
undoubtedly many statutory instruments are "issued, made or
established", to use the language of the Act, but are not
published in the Canada Gazette or in some other central
location, and are nowhere registered. This makes a mockery of
the permanent reference of all statutory instruments to the
Committee under section 26 of the Statutory Instruments Act.
If the Committee does not know of statutory instruments, and

February

3,Februarv
1977

1977

has no means of knowledge of their existence, it can not
scrutinize them. The consequence of this state of affairs is that
while the Committee bas the jurisdiction under section 26 of
the Statutory Instruments Act and the references of the two
Houses to scrutinize all but the "secret" statutory instruments,
it bas access only to those which are regulations (but not secret
regulations) and to those statutory instruments which happen
to be published in the Gazette, an event over which the
Committee, of course, bas no control. The Committee and its
counsel occasionally stumble across other statutory instruments, and yet others are volunteered for scrutiny by Departments and governmental agencies, notably the Department of
National Defence.
26. The Committee must report that in the absence of any
legal requirement that all statutory instruments be either
centrally registered and published or sent to the Committee by
those who make them, the Committee is not able effectively to
carry out the functions assigned to it by statute and by the two
Houses.
27. The Committee has had neither the time nor the
resources to step into the twilight world of unpublished statutory instruments. Consequently, it has the opportunity to
scrutinize only those which corne to its attention either by
being volunteered, as is the case of the statutory instruments of
the Department of National Defence, or by chance. The
Directives of the Commissioner of Penitentiaries are a special
case. They are unpublished, but have been made available to
the Committee which considers them to be not only statutory
instruments but regulations (Vide paragraphs 38-40 infra). A
special study of these Directives bas been commissioned by the
Committee from the John Howard Society of Ontario.
28. The Committee also wishes it to be noted that its
scrutiny is ex post facto only. Until a statutory instrument has
been "issued, made or established" the Committee is not
seized of it. Only regulations, and not other statutory instruments, are subject to a statutorily prescribed procedure for
transmission in draft for scrutiny by the Crown's lawyers
before making, registration and publication. While a regulation is thus scrutinized twice, by the Legal Advisers to the
Privy Council Office before, and by the Committee after, it is
made, a mere statutory instrument may never be checked,
examined or scrutinized by anyone. It will not be seen by the
Legal Advisers to the Privy Council Office and it will only
corne before the Committee if it is published in the Gazette or
by chance.
29. It may be noted in passing that the criteria by which the
Legal Advisers to the Privy Council Office scrutinize draft
regulations are set out in section 3(2) of the Act as follows:
"(a) it is authorized by the statute pursuant to which it is to
be made;
(b) it does not constitute an unusual or unexpected use of
the authority pursuant to which it is to be made;
(c) it does not trespass unduly on existing rights and freedoms and is not, in any case, inconsistent with the purposes
and provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights; and

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

(d) the form and draftsmanship of the proposed regulation
are in accordance with established standards."
It will be readily seen that these criteria are both less numerous and more restricted than those used by the Committee for
the subsequent scrutiny of the same regulations after they have
been made (and almost invariably after they have already
entered into effect).
30. The problem caused by the silence of the Statutory
Instruments Act as to how statutory instruments, which are
not regulations or are not published in the Canada Gazette,
are to become known to the Committee would be serious
enough if the Committee, on learning of the existence of a
document, could determine readily whether it were a statutory
instrument or not. But this the Committee can not do and the
problem is accordingly critical. The definition of a statutory
instrument provided in the Act is incomprebensible. The Committee has devoted a great amount of time and effort to trying
to glean from the words of section 2(1)(d) of the Statutory
Instruments Act a clear meaning and a clear definition of a
statutory instrument. The effort has been wasted and legislative action is necessary.
31. For expository purposes it is true that a statutory
instrument may be taken as meaning a document which
embodies subordinate legislation authorized by statute or a
rule made in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. It is
equally true that, if a statute is the ultimate authority for a
document, that document is potentially a statutory instrument.
But the Committee needs to know with precision whether a
document is a statutory instrument, for if it is not it has no
business considering it. And if it is no one can attempt to deny
or to thwart the Committee's scrutiny. Unfortunately, the
definition of a statutory instrument is so hedged about with
exceptions, at one and the same time explicit in nature but
obscure in meaning, and with qualifications direct and indirect, and is so flawed with a triple negative that it is useless.
32. Section 2(l)(d) of the Statutory Instruments Act reads
as follows:
"(d) "statutory instrument" means any rule, order, regulation, ordinance, direction, form, tariff of costs or fees, letters
patent, commission, warrant, proclamation, by-law, resolution or other instrument issued, made or established
(i) in the execution of a- power conferred by or under an
Act of Parliament, by or under which such instrument is
expressly authorized to be issued, made or established
otherwise than by the conferring on any person or body of
powers or functions in relation to a matter to which such
instrument relates, or
(ii) by or under the authority of the Governor in Council,
otherwise than in the execution of a power conferred by or
under an Act of Parliament,
but does not include
(iii) any such instrument issued, made or established by a
corporation incorporated by or under an Act of Parliament unless

(A) the instrument is a regulation and the corporation
by which it is made is one that is ultimately accountable, through a Minister, to Parliament for the conduct
of its affairs, or
(B) the instrument is one for the contravention of which
a penalty, fine or imprisonment is prescribed by or
under an Act of Parliament,
(iv) any such instrument issued, made or established by a
judicial or quasi-judicial body, unless the instrument is a
rule, order or regulation governing the practice or procedure in proceedings before a judicial or quasi-judicial
body established by or under an Act of Parliament,
(v) any such instrument in respect of which, or in respect
of the production or other disclosure of which, any privilege exists by law or whose contents are limited to advice
or information intended only for use or assistance in the
making of a decision or the determination of policy, or in
the ascertainment of any matter necessarily incidental
thereto, or
(vi) an ordinance of the Yukon Territory or the Northwest Territories or any instrument issued, made or established thereunder."
The Committee's main concern has been with paragraph (i)
but it must also note that it can give no clear meaning to the
words following the words "exists by law" in sub-paragraph
(v), a matter to which this Report will return.
33. Turning to sub-paragraph (i) of section 2(l)(d) these
words have been interpreted by the Legal Advisers to the Privy
Council Office, a section of the Department of Justice, as
meaning:
(i) No instrument can be a statutory instrument unless the
enabling power under which it is made expressly names a
type of document in the form of which the instrument is to
be issued. This has come to be known to the Committee as
the magic formula approach for unless an enabling power
reads that the Governor in Council (Minister, Commission,
etc.) may "by Order", "by rule", "by regulation", "by
warrant", "by tariff" and so on, there can be no statutory
instrument. This interpretation would remove from the class
of statutory instruments, and hence from the Committee's
scrutiny, instruments made under enabling powers now in
very common use, for example: ". . . according to terms and
conditions as the Governor in Council may prescribe ... ."
". . . the Minister may prescribe . . . ", "... the Board may

regulate ... and may fix, impose and collect ....
(ii) No instrument can be a statutory instrument unless it is
a document which falls within the class common to the types
of document catalogued in the opening words of section
2(1)(d). The words "or other instrument" are to be construed as limited to the class indicated by the preceding
types of documents. The Legal Advisers have been unable or
unwilling to indicate what that class is. Hence, it is not
possible to be sure when, in their eyes, any document, whose
title is not specifically covered in the opening words of
section 2(1)(d), is utterly excluded from the class of statu-

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
tory instruments from the outset without need of referring to
the balance of the definition.
It is probably the case that an enabling power which authorized the Governor in Council "by statutory instrument to
prescribe terms and conditions" would not, when exercised
produce a document which was a statutory instrument in the
eyes of the Department of Justice. And why? Because the
name "statutory instrument" does not appear in the catalogue which forms the opening words of paragraph (d) of
section 2(1) and because there is no provision that "statutory instrument" includes any instrument described as a
statutory instrument in any Act of Parliament. There is,
however, in section 2(l)(b) a provision that "regulation"
includes any instrument described as a regulation in any Act
of Parliament.
(iii) No instrument which confers upon another person the
power, or purported power, to make delegated legislation or
to act in some other way is a statutory instrument. This
particular interpretation is not, however, consistently followed by the Crown, for some conferrals of authority are
regarded as statutory instruments and regulations by the
Privy Council Office, for example, Orders made under
section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act
empowering Commodity Boards to regulate commodities in
inter-provincial trade and to raise levies on such
commodities.
34. The Committee does not accept the validity or legal
force of the foregoing interpretations of section 2(l)(d) for the
reasons set out in some detail in Appendix I to this Report.
More importantly, however, the Committee regards such distinctions and exclusions as inimical to Parliamentary scrutiny
of delegated legislation. Consequently, the Committee can not
consider a lengthy debate with the Legal Advisers to the Privy
Council Office over the true interpretation of the present
statutory definition as productive of anything but more delay
and confusion. The proper course is to amend the Statutory
Instruments Act to afford a clear definition of a statutory
instrument as a piece of subordinate legislation, with any
exceptions, which will be the exceptions to Parliamentary
scrutiny, being specifically and clearly enumerated.
35. Before the nature of any such new definition can be
dealt with, several further problems flowing from the present
Statutory Instruments Act must be noticed. As has been
pointed out in paragraph 22, supra, the Act draws a distinction
between a regulation and a statutory instrument, the former
being a species of the latter. While a piece of legislation made
under the Royal Prerogative, which is in no sense subordinate
but rather original legislation, is a statutory instrument, it can
not be a regulation, and, therefore, will not necessarily be
registered or published. This is altogether unsatisfactory. The
Royal Prerogative consists of those powers which the Common
Law gives to the Crown. Amongst these Prerogative powers
are those which relate to the Royal authority and rules having
the force of law may be made under those powers within limits
set by the Common Law, for example, rules relating to the

February 3,1977
February 3, 1977

issuing of passports. Where the matter within the royal authority is made the subject of statute, for example, the recruitment
regulation of the civil service, Prerogative lapses to the extent
that the subject matter is covered by statute. Thus, if a
Passports Act were to be passed, the issuing of passports would
cease to be a Prerogative matter and any regulations made
under such a Passports Act would be regulations within the
Statutory Instruments Act, whereas the current Passport
Regulations now made under the Prerogative, are not regulations within the Statutory Instruments Act and need not be
registered and published, although they have been as
SOR/73-36.
The only statutory instrument which can be a regulation is
one which
"(i) is made in the exercise of a legislative power conferred
by or under an Act of Parliament, or
(ii) for the contravention of which a penalty, fine or imprisonment is prescribed by or under an Act of Parliament."(12)
This definition too has caused the Committee trouble for,
while it has so far proved easy enough to determine whether a
"penalty, fine or imprisonment" is prescribed, the Committee
has not been able to arrive at any clear meaning for the words
"made in the exercise of a legislative power". (The Committee
notes, however, that there may be difficulty in determining
whether forfeiture of goods to the Crown, for example, is a
"penalty" in terms of section 2(1)(b).) There appears to be a
strand of thought that a statutory instrument has been made in
the exercise of a legislative power if it is "legislative in effect".
Yet this advances the matter but little and it is equally
difficult to ascribe a specific meaning to the newer phrase as it
is to the statutory one. In any concrete case it can, of course,
be very difficult to decide whether an instrument is "legislative
in effect". The Legal Advisers to the Privy Council Office
appear to have concluded that at least the following types of
statutory instruments are not legislative in effect and, in
consequence, are not regulations, since no penalties, fines or
imprisonment are prescribed for their contravention:
(a) Regional Development Incentives Designated Regions
Orders, made under section 3 of the Regional Development
Incentives Act (However, Special Areas Orders, made under
section 6 of the Department of Regional Economic Expansion Act, which is identical in its substantive terms to
section 3 of the Regional Development Incentives Act, are
regarded as regulations.)
(b) Designated Areas Orders made pursuant to section
34.1(l)(a)(ii) of the National Housing Act as amended by
21-22 Eliz. Il cap. 18, section 12.
(c) Proclamations issued pursuant to section 98(1) of the
Indian Act proclaiming section 98(2) of the Act in force in
specified Indian Reserves. (But compare proclamations
made under section 4(2) of the same Act exempting Indian
lands from portions of the Act, which are regarded as
regulations.)

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

(d) Directives of the Commissioner of Penitentiaries (But
compare Standing Orders of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police which are regulations. These two sets of statutory
instruments are considered further infra paragraphs 38-40).
36. The words "made in the exercise of a legislative power"
or "legislative in effect" take on a more serious dimension
when they are applied to statutory instruments which are
issued in the form of rules the primary purpose of which is to
direct servants of the rule maker in the execution of their
duties. Such rules may take the form of Guidelines, Circulars,
Directives or Manuals. The official view, both at the time of
the MacGuigan Report and now, is that such documents do
not constitute legal rules, but merely instructions to the staff,
for the breach of which staff members may, of course, be
subject to disciplinary proceedings within the service in which
they are employed. The fact that such Directives or Guidelines
affect also non-employees, for example inmates in the case of
Directives of the Commissioner of Penitentiaries or would-be
immigrants in the case of Immigration Guidelines, seems to be
ignored.
As the Statutory Instruments Act now stands, a set of
Departmental Guidelines, Circulars, Directives, etc. will be
regarded by the Privy Council Office as being a statutory
instrument if the enabling Act says that such documents under
their respective proper titles may or shall be issued (e.g.
Directives of the Commissioner of Penitentiaries, Standing
Orders of the R.C.M.P. Commissioner) but not otherwise.
They will not be regarded as being regulations because they
are considered to have no legislative effect (i.e., they do not
constitute legal rules but simply instructions to the staff); and
because they have no legisiative effect they cannot be said to
have been made in the exercise of a legislative power.
37. The Committee is not persuaded that the test of whether
or not some document has been made in the exercise of a
legislative power is necessarily that it has "legisiative effect",
whatever that phrase may mean. Nor is it persuaded that the
fact that a document is in form, or in substance, an instruction
to staff or to employees, means that no legal rules are made. It
occurs to the Committee that an instruction which, if obeyed,
is applied to the subject, or which, if breached, may lead to
disciplinary proceedings against the member of the staff disobeying it, is just as much a legal rule as is a provision in the
Race Track Supervision Regulations-(13) directed to jockey
clubs.
38. Putting the foregoing factors into a specific context, the
Committee believes that the Directives of the Commissioner of
Penitentiaries constitute a statutory instrument and a regulation, and as a regulation the Directives, and each amendment
to them, should be transmitted in draft to the Legal Advisers
to the Privy Council Office, registered and published in the
Gazette, unless properly exempted under section 27 of the
Statutory Instruments Act by an amendment to the Statutory
Instruments Regulations. The Committee holds this belief for
the following reasons:

(1) The enabling power in section 29(3) of the Penitentiaries
Act is identical in terms to section 21(2) of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Act which empowers the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to make
"standing orders". Those Standing Orders are universally
acknowledged, by the Commissioner, the Legal Adviser to
the Privy Council Office and the Department of Justice to
be regulations within the meaning of section 2(l)(b) of the
Statutory Instruments Act. It is truc that the Commissioner's Standing Orders are at present exempted from registration and publication by the Statutory Instruments Regulations, but that exempt status has been voluntarily
surrendered by the Commissioner and Standing Orders will
in the near future be dealt with fully as regulations under
the Statutory Instruments Act, which necessarily means
that they will be public documents unreservedly open to the
public.
There is no dispute that, even on the very restrictive interpretation of section 2(l)(d)(i) of the Statutory Instruments
Act adopted by the Legal Advisers to the Privy Council
Office, the Commissioner's Directives are statutory instruments. Section 2(l)(b)(ii) of the Statutory Instruments Act
provides that "'regulation' means a statutory instrument
... (ii) for the contravention of which a penalty, fine or
imprisonment is prescribed by or under an Act of Parliament". Section 2.29(h) and (n) of the Penitentiary Service
Regulations, made under section 29(1) of the Penitentiaries
Act, provide that every inmate commits a disciplinary
offence who
"(h) wilfully disobeys or fails to obey any regulation or
rule governing the conduct of inmates;
(n) contravenes any rule, regulation or directive made
under the Act."
Section 2.28 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations provides a code of penalties for the punishment of inmates
convicted of disciplinary offences. Consequently, the test in
section 2(1)(b)(ii) of the Statutory Instruments Act is
satisfied.
(3) The Directives are made in the exercise of a legislative
power conferred under an Act of Parliament (section 29(3)
of the Penitentiaries Act) and are, consequently, regulations
within the meaning of section 2(1)(b)(i) of the Statutory
Instruments Act. The Committee considers the Directives to
be as legislative in effect-the only test yet suggested to it
for giving a meaning to the phrase "made in the exercise of
a legislative power"-as the Regulations, and is confirmed
in this view by the knowledge that provisions have been
taken out of the Regulations in recent years only to be then
included in the Directives. The Committee is aware of the
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v.Institutional Head of Beaver Creek Correctional Camp, ex parte
MacCaud (1969) 1 O.R. 373, but considers it irrelevant to
the determination of whether instruments in general, or the
Commissioner's Directives in particular, are "regulations"

332
332

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

within the meaning of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1972.
The reasoning of the Court of Appeal as to the person to
whom a penitentiary employee owes the duty of adhering to
the Directives, whether the inmate or the Commissioner,
and as to the absence of any effect of an institutional head's
disciplinary actions upon the rights of an inmate as a person
or upon his statutory rights as an inmate, being directed as
such reasoning was to the issue of whether certiorari would
go against the institutional head, is not germane to the
interpretation of section 2(I)(d) or (b) of the Statutory
Instruments Act.
39. The Committee has made its views known at length to
the Penitentiary Service which has affirmed its position that
the Commissioner's Directives are not regulations. The Committee understands that after the passing of the Statutory
Instruments Act the Department of Justice gave a "ruling"
that Commissioner's Directives were statutory instruments but
not regulations. It is this ruling to which the Commissioner of
Penitentiaries has adhered. The Committee observes that a
so-called "ruling" of the Department of Justice is simply a
legal opinion and is not a determination of any issue and, of
course, binds neither the courts nor Parliament.
40. The Penitentiary Service has referred the Committee to
a more recent case which concerns the status of Commissioner's Directives for the purpose of appeals under section 28 of
the Federal Court Act: Martineau and Butters v. The Matsqui
Institution Inmate Disciplinary Board.-(14) There is nothing
in the majority judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal
which indicates that the nature of Directives as instructions to
penitentiary staff is relevant to the provisions of the Statutory
Instruments Act, but again only to whether in exercising a
disciplinary function, said to be an administrative one, there
was in the circumstances a duty to act quasi-judicially.
Although the Court of Appeal rejected an application for
review under section 28 of the Federal Court Act, it did say, in
the context of decisions taken under Commissioner's Directive
213:
"... any such decision that operates to affect the rights of
an individual must be a bona fide exercise of the powers
vested in the Penitentiary authorities, and anything donc
otherwise would have no validity by virtue of the governing
statute and regulations."
The Commissioner's Directive 213 was made by the Commissioner pursuant to statutory authority, binds the staff of the
penitentiaries and affects the lives of inmates, and the powers
conferred under it must be exercised bona fide. It strikes the
Committee as strange that whether that bona fide exercise
should be carried out quasi-judicially or not should be thought
to determine whether or not the statutory power under which
the Directive is made is a "legislative power" for the purposes
of the Statutory Instruments Act.
41. Other features of the elaborate definition of a statutory
instrument have been the occasion for remark. The effect of
sub-paragraph (iv) is that Criminal Appeal Rules made under

February 3, 1977
Februarv 3. 1977

the Criminal Code by provincial Supreme Courts are not
statutory instruments, but those made by the Courts of Appeal
for the Yukon and Northwest Territories are both statutory
instruments and regulations because those courts, although a
Provincial Court of Appeal, are vested with jurisdiction by a
statute of the Parliament of Canada.
42. Sub-paragraph (v) has assumed importance because of
the vexed matter of Departmental Guidelines and Manuals,
notably those of the Department of Manpower and Immigration. Sub-paragraph (v) excludes from the definition of a
statutory instrument any instrument "whose contents are limited to advice or information intended only for use or assistance in the making of a decision or the determination of
policy, or in the ascertainment of any matter necessarily
incidental thereto". The Committee has not been able to form
any definite view as to the meaning of these words and has
come across no case in which an attempt has been made to
exclude an instrument from the definition of a statutory
instrument in reliance on this sub-paragraph. The Committee
considers, without in any way being definite, that this provision might be thought to extend to the exclusion of Taxation
Interpretation Bulletins and Departmental Procedure Manuals
which contain no rules or substantive provisions other than
those already contained in some statutory instrument. It has
been a matter of some surprise, therefore, that the Committee
has been met with the argument that Departmental Guidelines
are excluded altogether from the definition of a statutory
instrument, without need of reliance on the exclusion under
paragraph (v). And why? Because the Guidelines have not
been expressly authorized to be issued, made or established
under that name. As appears from Appendix 1, the Committee
believes this to be an altogether erroneous test. The Committee
considers that any Guideline or Manual which contains substantive rules not contained elsewhere in statutory instruments
should be considered a statutory instrument and be subject to
Parliamentary scrutiny and should not be excluded whether by
the internal qualifications of the general definition of a statutory instrument, or by any express exclusion.
43. While some Departments, for example, the Departments
of Regional Economic Expansion and National Revenue (Customs and Excise), have freely made their Guidelines available
to the Committee, at least for the purpose of the Committee
informing itself of the type of contents of such documents, the
Department of Manpower and Immigration has refused to
make available its Manual or Guidelines for Immigration
Officers. Unless the Committee sees such a document it can
not begin to assess whether the document is a statutory
instrument on the present definition. The Statutory Instruments Act is clearly defective in that any Department can
claim a document is not a statutory instrument and refuse to
produce it. There must be some mechanism provided within
the Act itself for a conclusive determination as to whether any
particular document is a statutory instrument. The Committee
notes that the British legislation provides for a Statutory
Instruments Reference Committee for just this purpose.

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

44. Although the Committee has not seen the Immigration
Guidelines, it has been given to understand by some who have
seen portions of them that they do contain substantive rules,
for example, a definition of the crime of moral turpitude, the
commission of which is grounds for exclusion from Canada.
Such rules should not be contained in secret documents. The
Committee is also concerned about the application of section
58 of the Immigration Act to the Immigration Guidelines.
"58. The Minister may make regulations, not inconsistent
with this Act, respecting ... the duties and obligations of
immigration officers and the methods and procedure for
carrying out such duties and obligations whether in Canada
or elsewhere."
If indeed the Guidelines do relate to the duties and obligations
of immigration officers and the manner in which they carry
them out, the Committee can not conceive that the Department can render them other than regulations and statutory
instruments by insisting on calling them Guidelines and denying any connection with section 58 of the Immigration Act.
Until the Immigration Bill introduced in the present Session
of Parliament is passed and the Regulations under it have been
made and published the Committee will not be able to determine whether the practice of issuing and using secret Guidelines will continue or whether what is now thought to be
contained in Guidelines will appear in the Regulations pursuant to the enabling powers contained in clause 115 of the Bill
45. It is appropriate to summarize the defects in the present
Statutory Instruments Act.
(i) Despite the widespread belief to the contrary, there is no
system "whereby all orders that have legislative effect are
tabled here in Parliament, are automatically referred to the
standing joint committee and are also published so the
public can know what is being done".-(15) There is a
system only for regulations and not for all statutory instruments, many of which are effectively hidden, are unpublished and are unknown even to the Parliamentary Committee to which they stand permanently referred.
(ii) The definition of a statutory instrument is obscure.
(iii) The definition of a "regulation" in terms of the exercise
of a legislative power conferred by or under an Act of
Parliament is equally obscure.
(iv) There is no provision for a body to give a definitive
ruling on whether or not a document is a statutory instrument. There is a procedure by which the Department of
Justice can determine whether or not a statutory instrument
is a regulation, but this is open to the objection that the
Parliamentary scrutiny committee is cut off from the
decision.
46. What courses of reform of the Statutory Instruments
Act are open?
One course would be to tinker with the present definition of
a statutory instrument by attempting to clarify the wording of
sub-paragraphs (i) and (v) of Section 2(1)(d) of the Statutory
Instruments Act, and to give some particularity to the phrase

"made in the exercise of a legislative power". The Committee
does not conceive of such an undertaking being a success. The
several parts of the present definition, whatever they may
mean, are so intertwined that to meddle with small portions
may well lead only to more problems or to the need for further
clarifying amendments. Moreover, there would still remain the
problem of the opening words of the definition, the catalogue
of types of document which are said to be capable of being a
statutory instrument. It is not proper, in the Committee's view,
to tic the definition to any particular names or types of
document.
A variant of this first course would be to abandon the text of
the present definition but to retain its concept. The task would
then be to isolate precisely the documents or classes of documents one wishes to sec subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and
those which one does not, drawing a definition of "statutory
instrument" which will include the former but exclude the
latter. While this may be logically possible, it would be an
exercise difficult in the extreme and almost certain to involve
unforeseen omissions and to cause confusion. The present
section 2(1)(d) of the Statutory Instruments Act stands as an
object lesson in this regard.
A second course would be to leave to the Queen-in-Parliament, in enacting any statute which confers any power of
subordinate law making, the function of specifying whether or
not the result of that law making will be subject to scrutiny.
This is the approach of the United Kingdom Statutory Instruments Act as regards post-1947 legislation. If Parliament says
the subordinate law making function is to be exercised "by
statutory instrument" then parliamentary scrutiny of the
subordinate legislation will follow. If Parliament omits the
formula "by statutory instrument" then the subordinate legislation, while still remaining subordinate and open to attack in
the courts, in appropriate circumstances, as ultra vires, would
be removed from scrutiny. If this approach were to be adopted
there would still be a serious problem in classifying the subordinate legislation which is already in existence and that which
will be made in future under existing statutes in which, of
course, the formula "by statutory instrument" does not appear.
That this problem can be faced is evidenced by the United
Kingdom legislation which dealt squarely with it. Yet, given
the confusion caused by the existing section 2(1)(d) of the
Statutory Instruments Act, it could not serve the purpose and
would in any event have to be amended. Given that need, it
might well be considered better to scrap the present scheme of
definitions entirely and to use a different approach. (A
detailed summary of the British definition appears in Appendix I.)
The third course, and the course which the Committee
broadly favours, is to proceed along the lines originally recommended by the MacGuigan Committee and to have one class
of document, broadly defined. This would remove the distinction between "regulations" and "statutory instruments"; it
would subject all documents of the class to uniform procedures
as to registration, publication and restriction on retroactive

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
effect; it would prevent the issue of whether or not a document
is subject to Parliamentary scrutiny being thought to depend
upon the use of a magic formula in an enabling Act whereby
the particular name of the class or type which was to be issued
was preceded by the preposition "by"; it would preclude the
existence of a class of instruments, the number of which may
be untold, which are unpublished and unregistered.
47. The MacGuigan Committee recommended-(16) the
following definition of "regulation", the only classification of
documents proposed, viz:
"'regulation' means
(i) a rule, order, regulation, directive, by-law, proclamation, or any other document made in the exercise of a
legislative power conferred by or under an Act of
Parliament;
(ii) a rule, order, regulation, directive, by-law, proclamation or any other document made in the exercise of a
legislative power conferred by or under the prerogative
rights of the Crown and having force of law;
(iii) a rule, order, regulation, directive, by-law, proclamation or any other document made in the exercise of a
legislative power coming within sub-paragraphs (i) and
(ii) and which has been subdelegated;
(iv) a rule, order, regulation, directive, by-law, proclamation or any other document for the contravention of which
a penalty or fine or imprisonment is prescribed by or
under an Act of Parliament;
but does not include a rule, order, regulation, directive, or
by-law or any other document of a legislative character of a
corporation incorporated by or under an Act of Parliament,
which is not a Crown Corporation, unless such a rule, order,
regulation, by-law or document comes within sub-paragraph
(iv)."
The Committee observed:
"This definition casts the net as widely as is reasonably
possible. All exercises of subordinate law-making power are
covered (except those of private corporations) and, so that
the matter is put beyond doubt, all regulations, etc. for the
contravention of which penalties are prescribed, are also
covered."
The Committee further noted that its suggested definition
would bring within its sweep many departmental guidelines
and directives. Whether or not this would always be the case
the Committee recommended that all such departmental directives and guidelines be published and subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. Although narrower than the word "regulation"
as defined in the Interpretation Act, (paragraph 49 infra and
Appendix 1) it might have included Departmental Guidelines
and Circulars to the extent that they embodied substantive or
procedural rules, for such rules can only be issued by warrant
either of statute, or of the Prerogative as limited by statute
and as defined by the common law. Neither the Crown nor its
responsible advisers, either collectively or individually, have
the power to make any rule otherwise than they are empowered either by statute or by the Prerogative, and no new

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

offence can be created under the latter. (The Case of the
Proclamations, 1610).-(16A)
This definition would, however, still be bedevilled by the use
of the phrase "made in the exercise of a legislative power" and
the distinction thereby imported, by the Crown's advisers,
between rules of law binding the Crown's subjects and rules
binding only the Crown's servants or agents. This distinction
has been adverted to above. If it were maintained it might well
mean that the MacGuigan definition would not include
Departmental Guidelines, Circulars and Directives.
48. The Committee concludes, therefore, that the solution is
to take the sum of law making, and of rule making, exercised
by the Crown and its agencies and by any other delegate or
sub-delegate of Parliament, whether made pursuant to a statute or to the Prerogative, and to declare the whole, in principle, subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. This would seem to be
in keeping with constitutional principle and the desire of
Parliament to exercise some supervision over the Crown's
subordinate and prerogative law making activities. If then it
were desired to exclude any documents or classes of documents
from scrutiny, those documents or classes would have to be
defined, and, since they would be exceptions, they would be
narrowly construed, any ambiguity being resolved in favour of
scrutiny and against exclusion. If need be, a statutory direction
to this effect could be included in the legislation.
49. The execution of this plan would appear to be in
conformity with the thrust of the Interpretation Act, which
defines an "enactment" as "an Act or regulation or any
portion of an Act or regulation" and a "regulation" as
including
"an order, regulation, Order in Council, order prescribing
regulations, rule, rule of court, form, tariff of costs or fees,
letters patent, commission, warrant, proclamation, by-law,
resolution or other instrument issued, made or established
(a) in the execution of a power conferred by or under the
authority of an Act, or
(b) by or under the authority of the Governor in
Council."
The Committee is aware that at the time the Statutory
Instruments Bill was being considered in the Commons there
were suggestions that, if the Bill were to prove successful after
enactment, consideration would be given to amending the
definitions of "enactment" and "regulation" in the Interpretation Act to accord with the definitions contained in Clause 2 of
the Statutory Instruments Act. The Committee is, of course,
now suggesting that the reverse pattern of amendment should
be considered.
50. The Committee's proposal is predicated upon certain
principles, some at least of which might not be regarded as
non-controversial. It is only proper, therefore, that those principles should be stated.
(i) The Crown can only make rules, even rules binding its
own servants, by dint of statutory authority or the Prerogative, including the prerogative right to operate the Civil

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Service in tbe absence of any controlling legisiation, provided ail statutes and the common law are observed.
(ii) Ministers of the Crown possess no greater law or rule
rnaking functions tban tbe Crown itself possesses, unless a
power to rnake law or rules is specifically conferred upon a
Minister eo nommne by statute.
(iii) Consequently, even ministerial guidelines or instructions are as important, frorn tbe point of view of Parliarnentary scrutiny of tbe Crown's law and rule rnaking functions,
as Orders in Council, ministerial regulations and the rest.
(iv) The Committee desires that, in principle, ail subordinate law and rules made by the Crown and by tbose put in
autbority under tbe Crown, or by any otber delegate or
sub-delegate of Parliament, sbould be subject to Parliarnentary supervision, unless specifically excluded.
(y) Any exceptions fxom sucb supervision sbould be made
explicitly and be justified on some cornpelling grounds. (For
examples of what may be considered as justifiable exclusion
on such grounds see section 21 of the Statutory Instruments
Regulations (reproduced as Appendix Il to this Report).
(vi) Ail subordinate laws and rules sbould, unless again
there are compelling reasons to tbe contrary, be registered
centrally and publisbed.
(vii) AIl subordinate Iaws and rules should, unless compelling reasons to tbe contrary are made out and exceptions are
specifically provided for, be subject to tbe sarne general and
statutory rules governing registration, publication, the time
limits in wbicb botb must take place, and tbe possibility of
retroactive effect.
5 1. As a final quirk of tbe Statutory Instruments Act, tbere
stands tbe definition of a "regulation-making autbority" wbich
is stated in section 2(1 )(c) of tbe Act to mean:
"'any autbority authorized to mnake regulations and, with
reference to any particular regulation or proposed regulation, means the authority that made or proposes to make tbe
regulation."
Tbis clearly means tbat in respect of regulations wbicb are
autborized to be made by the Governor in Council, tbe regulation-making authority is tbe Governor in Council botb in
respect of regulations he bas made and proposes to make, as
for instance under tbe Motor Vebîcle Safety Act, wbich
provides for proposais for regulations to be publisbed so that
interested groups may make representations. Oniy after tbose
representations bave been considered rnay tbe regulations
tbernselves be made.
Section 3(l) of tbe Statutory Instruments Act, bowever,
provides that wbere a "regulation-making autbority" proposes
to make a regulation it shahl cause to be forwarded to tbe
Clerk of tbe Privy Council tbree copies of the proposed
regulation in botb officiaI languages". It is plainiy nonsense to
interpret tbis as meaning that tbe Governor in Council shall
forward three copies to bis Clerk. And in fact tbe section is flot
interpreted or applied in tbat way at ail. It is tbe Department
of State or otber governrnental agency, upon wbose bebaîf a
Member of tbe Privy Council will recommend the regulations

to the Governor in Council, whicb is considered to be the
regulation-rnaking authority and which sends in three copies of
its "proposed regulations" for scrutiny by the Legal Advisers
to the Privy Council Office.
52. Turning next to section 9(2) of the Statutory Instrumnents Act, the phrase 'regulation-making authority" is used
again, this tirne in the context of tbe coming into force of
regulations (not statutory instruments). Section 9(l) provides
for an exception to the rule that a regulation shall not corne
into force on a day earlier than the day on which it is
registered. It may do so if it expressly states that it cornes into
force on a day earlier than tbe day of registration and if it is
registered within seven days after it is rnade (usually the date
of the passing of the requisite Order in Council). Subsection
9(2) provides that if tbis exception is rnade use of "the
regulation-making autbority shall advise the Cierk of tbe Privy
Council in writing of tbe reasons wby it is flot practical for the
regulation to corne into force on tbe day on which it is
registered". Again, it would seem nonsensical to suggest that
the Governor in Council should so advise bis own servant, the
Clerk.
In applying section 9(2) it bas likewise been assurned in
practice that the "regu lation-rmaki ng autbority", in th4 case of
a regulation made by tbe Governor in Council on the recornrnendation of a Minister of tbe Crown, is tbat Minister's
Department or Ministry, tbat is to say, tbe Departrnent of
Ministry wbicb proposed tbe draft regulation wbicb, after
scrutiny by the Legal Advisers to tbe Privy Council Office,
becarne tbe basis of tbe recomrncndation to His Excellency in
Council. To construe tbe provision otberwise would lead to the
absurd resuit tbat tbe Governor in Council rnust advise bis
own servant, the Clerk, in writing as to tbe reasons why it was
not practical for tbe regulation to corne into force on the day
on wbicb it is registered, knowledge of which reasons would in
any event be peculiar to the Ministry or Departrnent concerned and be unknown to His Excellency in Council unless he
were advised of them. Again, tbis is reflected in actual practice
and the Assistant Clerk of the Privy Council always dernands
reasons from Departments and authorities whicb bave inserted
effective dates in regulations earlier than the day on wbich
registration can he accornplished. Tbe Comrnittee understands
that tbe Assistant Clerk is often dissatisfied witb the reasons
given and strikes out the earlier effective date before tbe draft
regulation is submitted to tbe Council.
53. Tbe Comrnittee considers that it sbould be entitled to
know wby any particular regulation bad to corne into force
before it was registered. This is important as it is an exception
to a fundamental rule wbicb itself is not above criticisrn in that
it causes regulations to corne into force before tbey are publisbed. However, refuge bas been taken in tbe definition of
"regulation-making autbority", and tbe information bas either
been given in tbe rnost general and tberefore uninformative
terrns, or refused on tbe ground tbat the Governor in Council
can flot be required to give reasons for causing a regulation to
come into effect before registration.

SENATE DEBATES

54. The Committee considers that the words "regulationmaking authority" should be re-defined to make clear that in
respect of regulations made by the Governor in Council they
mean the Department, Ministry or other body which recommends the draft Order to the Governor in Council. It will be
necessary also to provide that reasons furnished under section
9(2) should be made available to the Committee, for otherwise
as included in a submission to the Governor in Council they
could be regarded as a secret matter within the confidence of
the Privy Council. The amendment would also remove the
Clerk of the Council from the untenable and improper position
of requiring written reasons from the Council. The Committee
understands that this approach is not now opposed in principle
by the Privy Council Office.
55. It was only to be expected that in the drafting of the bill
for an Act which marked an entirely new departure in Canadian law, there would be at lcast one omission. Section 32 of the
Statutory Instruments Act provided that any regulation made
before the passing of the Act, which was not published in the
Canada Gazette and which is of a type which would not be
exempted from publication if made after the commencement
of the Act, would cease to have effect on Ist January 1973
unless transmitted to the Clerk of the Privy Council, who was
then bound to register it. There is, however, no provision in
section 32 requiring the publication of such regulations when
registered. The Committee can not believe that this omission
was other than accidental.
One of the largest single groups of regulations required to be
registered, but not published, under section 32, consists of the
Regulations of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The
Cornnissioner has volunteered the Regulations for publication
but they have not appeared in the Canada Gazette.
When once a new consolidation of regulations appears the
problem will disappear. Yet the consolidation may be delayed
and there may well be statutory instruments registered under
section 32 which will not be included in the consolidation.
Therefore, the Committee believes that all the statutory instruments registered under section 32 should now be published
and, if legislative authority is necessary, the Statutory Instruments Act should be amended accordingly.
F.-MATTERS RELATING TO THE FORM OF
STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
56. The Committee has consistently maintained from its
inception that the enabling authority for subordinate legislation should be clearly and adequately identified to the end that
ordinary folk may know whence comes the power to make the
manifold rules which affect them. It is not enough that the
identification of enabling authority should be a skill known
only to competent lawyers versed in both the ways of the
Canada Gazette and of the hundreds of enabling statutes.
Similarly, the Committee has not thought it unreasonable that
departments of state and regulation-making authorities which
must surely be presumed to know the precise authority on
which they rely, and its actual place of publication, should

February 3,

1977

disclose this information on the face of regulations and other
statutory instruments as they appear in public form, whether
in the Canada Gazette Part Il or in office copies available in
some limited number of cases through the successors of the
Government of Canada Bookstores.
57. Consequently, the Committee has insisted on the recital
of the precise section or sections of enabling statutes which are
relied upon for the authority to make a particular regulation or
statutory instrument. This requirement extends to reciting the
substantive provisions of statutes which are utilized under
cover of such general enabling powers as "...

may make

regulations prescribing anything which by this Act may be
prescribed". It also includes the identification of chains of
authority as where the Treasury Board is authorized by or
under section 5(2) of the Financial Administration Act to act
in the stead of the Governor in Council for the purpose of
making regulations under the several Superannuation Acts or
under such provisions of any other Acts as specified by the
Governor in Council which relate to matters specified in
section 5(1) of the Financial Administration Act.
58. The Committee is happy to report that clear identification of relevant sections of enabling statutes is now all but
universally made by all departments and authorities. The
Committee regrets that the Honourable the Treasury Board
has adopted the new practice only intermittently.
59. The Committee has also required the disclosure of both
primary and intermediate enabling authority. The Aeronautics
Act, section 6(2), for example empowers the Governor in
Council to approve of regulations made by the Minister
authorizing the Minister to make Orders or directions with
respect to such matters coming within section 6 as the regulations may prescribe. This power has been exercised in section
104 of the Air Regulations. The Committee's view is that both
the enabling section in the Act (section 6) and the enabling
section of the Air Regulations (section 104) must be recited in
any Order made by the Minister. This requirement is now
almost always met by departments and other authorities
60. In other matters relating to the form of statutory
instruments the Committee has not been successful in achieving improvements. The form of a statutory instrument is not at
present prescribed or regulated except in the case of those
instruments which take the form of Orders in Council, which
include the bulk of the "regulations" as defined in the Statutory Instruments Act. The Clerk of the Privy Council has laid
down guidelines for the form of recommendations to the
Governor in Council. In addition, the officers of the Privy
Council Office responsible for Part Il of the Canada Gazette
follow certain rules which affect the format of statutory
instruments as published in the Gazette as also the information
which those instruments disclose about the authority for their
making, the prior state of the principal instrument about to be
amended, and the place of publication of any other instrument
referred to in the new instrument. The Legal Advisers to the
Privy Council Office, who are officers of the Department of
Justice, do not see themselves as having the power to force

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

changes as to form on either departments or the Privy Council
Office. It is said that the actual form of the content of an
instrument is beyond the Legal Advisers' purview, and that the
form is often settled after the draft of the contents has been
scrutinized by them. The Committee, however, cognizant of
the great influence, if not power, of the Department of Justice
in ail matters pertaining to statutory instruments, is not convinced that the further changes it desires could not readily be
brought about if the Department so wished. Certainly it is
clear that with respect to statutory instruments made by Order
in Council the Clerk of the Privy Council can insist on changes
in format, including the disclosure of the information just
mentioned.
61. The Committee considers the present position deficient
in several respects. The first relates to the giving of references,
either by footnotes or direct mention in the text, to ail the
enabling authority, and to ail instruments mentioned in a
statutory instrument. The Committee believes that the most
convenient method is the use of the footnote to show the place
and date of publication and the registration number, if one
exists. The former Registrar of Statutory Instruments at the
Privy Council Office undertook to provide footnote references
only for those instruments which can not be traced by reference to the Index to Part Il of the Canada Gazette. (These are
usually Orders in Council which were not regarded as regulations under the old Regulations Act or have not been regarded
as statutory instruments after 1972 under the Statutory
Instruments Act). The Committee does not accept that the
subject must have access to and know how to use the Index to
Part Il of the Canada Gazette before he can ascertain the
reference to another instrument mentioned in a statutory
instrument. This knowledge is peculiarly within the competence of the departmental officiais who draft statutory instruments and of the officers of the Registry of Statutory Instruments who are expert in the use of the Index. Consequently,
the Committee believes that the trifling expense involved
should be incurred so that footnote references are given for the
Ontario Milk Order, for example, which is the intermediate
enabling authority for numerous regulations made ultimately
under the Agricultural Products Marketing Act. The newly
appointed Assistant Clerk of the Privy Council (Orders in
Council) and Registrar have agreed to review their Office's
position.

337

Committee wishes statutory instruments, on their face, to be as
comprehensible and self-contained and to reveal as much
information about themselves as is possible. The governing
consideration in the Committee's view is not whether a lawyer,
or one well versed in the art of statutory instruments, will find
ail the relevant material he needs in the several indices and
parts of the Gazette, but whether the layman will be able to
identify not only ail the relevant documents but their place of
publication also.
63. The Principal Legal Adviser to the Privy Council Office
has offered to suggest to the Registrar of Statutory Instruments that when next the guidelines for submission of recommendations to the Governor in Council are revised he might
insert a provision that reference be given to any statute which
amends an enabling power and which is subsequent to the then
latest Index to Part Ill of the Gazette. The Committee can not
regard this proposal as acceptable. First, it is merely an offer
to suggest. Secondly, the guidelines, even if amended as suggested, relate only to Orders in Council and not to any other
statutory instruments. Thirdly, it is still predicated upon the
availabiity of the Index to Part III of the Canada Gazette to
ordinary folk and the assumption that they will know how to
use it. The Committee can not accept either assumption and
notes the difficulties its own counsel have faced from time to
time in procuring copies on a regular basis of the Canada
Gazettes, whether Parts Il or III, and the relevant indices.

64. In conformity with its view that a published statutory
instrument should be as complete in its form as possible the
Committee has requested that a different method be adopted
of referring to the existing text of a statutory instrument in an
amending instrument. The present practice is to give a footnote reference to the registration date and place of publication
of the original statutory instrument and of the last amendment, whether or not that last amendment is relevant to that
part of the statutory instrument to be amended. The problem
posed, even to experienced legal practitioners and government
officers, in ascertaining the present text of any statutory
instrument, or of any part of it, can be immense as the last
consolidation of the Regulations was in 1955 and even statutory instruments made well after that date may have been
amended many times. The former Registrar of Statutory
Instruments advised the Committee that it is up to the subject,
in attempting to identify the present text of say section 4 of a
the Committee believes that where an en- particular instrument which is now to be amended to have

consideration. The representations) citing expense and shortage of labour.
not regard legal sufficiency as the relevant

SENATE DEBATES
65. The Committee finds this position totally unacceptable.
Its view, put simply, is that the footnotes to an amending
statutory instrument should disclose ail the relevant amendments to the statutory instrument as originally made. Yet, only
amendments relevant to the text now to be amended should be
cited. If the last was in 1971, it should be the last one referred
to. If the particular text is being amended for the first time,
there should be no reference to amendments and the footnote
to the words "as amended" should so state. Consequently,
where there is a reference in an instrument to an earlier
instrument which has been amended by one or more other
instruments, the words "as amended" should be used as at
present and there should be a footnote to those words on the
following lines:
(i) If aIl the amendments are relevant to the matters dealt
with in the new instrument, then they are aIl to be mentioned in the footnote
(ii) If not ail of them are so relevant, then the footnote
should read: "The relevant amending (regulation(s))
(instrument(s)) is(are) . . . "
(iii) If there is no relevant amendment, the footnote should
read:
"The amending (regulations) (statutory instruments) are
not relevant to the subject matter of this Order, regulation . . .

OR
"There is no amendment which relates expressly to the
subject matter of this regulation."
To give an illustration in an hypothetical case, if it were
proposed to amend section 3 of the Swine Fever Control
Regulations, the amending regulation might read, in part:
"... the Swine Fever Control Regulations--(), as amended-(2). . . "
(1) C 1955, 1216.
(2) The relevant amending regulations are SOR/67-237,
SOR/72-417 and SOR/75-616
66. Again the Commitee believes that the subject should not
be forced to juggle with indices and with numerous amendments, in some instances running literally into hundreds. The
knowledge of the relevant amendment(s) must exist, otherwise
departments would not know what they were amending and
how the projected amendment would alter the law. This
knowledge may not now be shared with the Registrar or the
Privy Council Office, but the Committee can not see why
departments and other regulation-making authorities should
not be required to divulge it to the Registrar who could then
insert the requisite footnotes at the added expense of a little
more type-setting. The Committtee is anxious to enlist the
co-operation of the Privy Council Office and realizes that the
information it wishes to be given does not lie within the power
of that Office, but of departments and authorities which
should provide it when the draft Orders are forwarded for
transmission to Council or when other statutory instruments
are transmitted for registration. The Committee appreciates
the fact that the present Registrar and Assistant Clerk of the

February 3, 1977

Council are anxious to co-operate with the Committee and are
reviewing their Office's position.
67. The Committee has also pressed upon the Privy Council
Office its view that statutory instruments, and especially
amending instruments, should be accompanied by Explanatory
Notes. Such a Note is particularly desirable when, although
the instrument may appear to be self-explanatory, the Note
might help to avoid the necessity for reference to other instruments as, for example, when another instrument is being
amended, and the effect of the previous instrument or the
effect of the amendment, or both, are not apparent from the
text. In such a case the Explanatory Note should describe the
subject matter dealt with by the provisions amended in such a
way as to indicate the point of the amendment. The Committee realizes that Explanatory Notes could not be argumentative, and could never seek to explain or to justify policy or,
above aIl, purport to construe the law. But they could be used
with great effect to describe simply what is to be done in a
purely informative way. The object should be to help the
reader who, the Committee again emphasizes, may not be an
experienced civil servant or lawyer, to appreciate the object of
the new subordinate legislation without unnecessary difficulty
or research. The full effect of a legislative instrument often
cannot be grasped without careful study. It is not always easy
to see from the instrument itself whether it is of sufficient
importance or interest to make such a study desirable. The
Explanatory Note would guide the reader on that point. The
test to be applied should be the point of view of a reader who is
not familiar with the existing law on the subject, rather than
that of the official administering the law. The Explanatory
Note could also be used to indicate if an instrument is to have
retroactive effect and the authority in the enabling statute for
such retroactive operation. Without such authority, the validity of the provision will be in doubt and that point at least could
be removed from the areas an interested reader must research.
68. Explanatory Notes of the type desired are published in
the United Kingdom. They are made available to the Senate
Committee on Regulations and Ordinances of the Commonwealth of Australia, but are not published. The Committee is
aware that at least the rudiments of the material necessary for
the drafting of Explanatory Notes are already required to be
submitted in recommendations to the Governor in Council for
statutory instruments made by that authority. The explanatory
material now contained in recommendations to the Governor
in Council has been withheld from the Committee on the
grounds that it lies within the confidence of the Privy Council.
The Committee can not see why the information should not be
made public and the requirements extended to aIl statutory
instruments, whether made by the Governor in Council or not.
Again, the information lies peculiarly within the power of
departments and authorities who propose statutory instruments to the Governor in Council and the Privy Council Office
could not itself prepare the desired Explanatory Notes. However, it could be made a requirement that every recommendation to the Governor in Council should be accompanied by just

February 3, 1977

Februarv

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

such an Explanatory Note as the Committee desires. The
requirement of the provision of an Explanatory Note should
also be extended to all statutory instruments registered by the
Privy Council Office.
69. The Committee understands that in the near future,
perhaps even in 1977, a new Consolidation of the Regulations
of Canada will appear, the first for over twenty years. The
Committee believes that, even if its recommendations can not
be implemented immediately because of administrative difficulty in dealing with so many existing amendments to statutory instruments, the issuing of the Consolidation provides a
golden opportunity to introduce new ideas in dealing with the
form and style of the new and amending instruments made
after the date of the Consolidation. The Committee would
regard the neglecting of that opportunity as a cause for grave
concern. Yet a reasonable delay in implementing the Committee's suggestions will allow the Privy Council Office the time
and the opportunity to undertake what will be a formidable
task in explaining the new requirements to officers in departments and authorities who are, quite naturally, used to the
present arrangements.
G.-THE WITHIHOLDING OF INFORMATION FROM
THE COMMITTEE
70. The Committee, having considered a particular statutory
instrument and concluded that it is questionable as apparently
infringing any one or more of the criteria, feels obliged to
afford to any department or regulation-making authority concerned in the making or implementation of the instrument the
opportunity of furnishing an oral or written explanation in the
light of which the Committee may well realize that its concerns were groundless, or may suggest to the department or
authority that the instrument be amended, or report that the
special attention of the Houses should be drawn to the instrument. The Committee considers that natural justice, not to
mention common sense, dictates such a course of action.
71. Anxious though the Committee has been to elicit departmental and officiai explanations of the text or the manner of
operation of instruments, it has in many instances been thwarted in this essential step in its proceedings. Almost all Designated Instruments Officers who are also legal officers are in
fact officers of the Department of Justice and feel constrained,
by the expressed views of the Deputy Minister of Justice, to
refuse to afford to the Committee any explanation or information which they consider would involve them in the expression
of legal opinions. The position taken by these officers, governing themselves by their Deputy Minister's views later supported by the present Minister of Justice, seriously hampers the
Committee in any consideration of the vires of any instrument
and severely restricts or impedes scrutiny in any case in which
any legal matter arises for consideration. These other cases
include those in which the Committee regards some of the
wording of an instrument as ambiguous, or obscure, or as
conveying a meaning at odds with the intent of Parliament in

the enabling Act, or with the balance of the instrument.
Instruments suffering from such apparent defects can not be
assessed properly if departments refuse to give a view as to the
meaning of the words-something they must have formed in
any event in order to administer the instrument--or refuse
even to say whether in their' view the wording is clear and
unambiguous, for particular reasons, or obscure and in need of
justification. The Committee does not accept that criterion 13
approved by both Houses is to be ignored and that questionable wording is to stand until some hapless litigant becomes
the cause of a judicial interpretation of the wording.
72. The problem of the withholding of "legal opinions"
arises in a particularly acute form when the Committee asks
for a particular instrument to be produced for its scrutiny only
to be told that the instrument is not a statutory instrument.
When the Committee asks why the instrument is not a statutory instrument it is merely told either that to say why would
be the expression of a legal opinion or that the Department of
Justice has given an opinion on the matter which can not be
divulged.
73. The Committee wishes to emphasize that in asking for
explanations which may involve the expression of legal reasoning and conclusions it is not seeking to invade the Crown's
confidence or to cause untold difficulty. On the contrary, the
Committee merely wishes to afford to departments the opportunity of showing that the Committee is wrong in its tentative
invocation of one or more of its criteria in relation to a
particular instrument. It simply wishes to give departments the
right to demonstrate that a particular instrument is not a
statutory instrument. And all by reasoned argument, and not
by mere assertion or reliance on a secret opinion given by some
officer of the Department of Justice at some point in the past.
74. It is to be noted that the difficulties encountered by the
Committee have not arisen where the Designated Instruments
Officer is a departmental officiai and not an officer of the
Department of Justice. To date, complete explanations, including legal reasoning, have been forthcoming from these departmental officers who apparently obtain the legal portion of their
explanations from the Department of Justice officers in their
departments. The Committee is aware, however, that at any
time such legal explanations might become inaccessible, either
to the departmental Instruments Officer, or to the Committee.
75. The Committee has enquired into the practice of scrutiny committees in the United Kingdom and in the Commonwealth of Australia. While appreciating that overseas practice
is not a sure guide in a Canadian parliamentary setting, the
Committee notes that statements of legal reasons and, on
occasion, even opinions of the law officers are made available
in both the United Kingdom and Australia by Departments
and authorities responsible for statutory instruments or regulations questioned by the scrutiny committees.
76. The impasse reached by November 1976 can best be
explained in point form.
A.-Instruments the Committee sees

340

SENATE DEBATES

(i) The Committee could simply take its own Counsel's
opinion as to vires, drafting or any other legal point, and, if
it concurred, report accordingly to the two Houses, if it
considered any provision ultra vires, obscure, ambiguous,
etc. without even asking the opinion of the legal officers in
the departments or authorities. The Committee considers
this course inadvisable and likely to involve it in reporting
matters to the Houses which turn out to be quite proper,
since neither the Committee's members nor its counsel are
infallible. The Committee would then appear foolish and
would in short measure become either discredited, or
over-cautious.
(ii) The Committee could ask for the opinion of outside
counsel. This course would be expensive and would get the
Committee very little further ahead, if at aIl. Faced with the
opinion of the Committee and its counsel, even fortified by a
concurring opinion from outside counsel, the Department of
Justice officers could still refuse to explain anything leaving
the Committee to report to the Houses as above, the Government continuing to abide by the Department of Justice's
view. The same result would, of course, follow if opinions
were sought from the Law Clerks to the two Houses.
(iii) If the Committee makes a series of reports on cases it
sees as being infringements of one of the criteria and in
which some legal point is involved, it will produce a great
deal of paper, and demand a great deal of parliamentary
time. If it submits a single report detailing a long list of
questionable instruments, a great deal of harm to the public
interest may take place while the list is accumulating. And
even if the parliamentary time is made available for dealing
with a large report, instance by instance, the Government
may stili simply assert that the Department of Justice
advises, for reasons unspecified, that the Committee's objections are unfounded.
B. Instruments the Committee does not see
(i) These are of two kinds: unpublished statutory instruments (or those published but unknown to the Committee)
and documents which the Department of Justice considers
are not statutory instruments and hence beyond the Committee's purview.
(ii) To any of the unpublished statutory instruments or to
any that are published but in forms and places other than
the Canada Gazette, and which actually get before the
Committee, the points made under A, above, apply.
(iii) The most serious problem, however, is to get the
documents where the Committee's right of scrutiny is denied
by the Government on the ground that they are not statutory instruments. The Committee may want to see these
documents, in order to decide whether, in its opinion, they
are statutory instruments.
(iv) It requests production. The legal officer of the department or authority refuses. The Committee asks why. He
says that the document is not a statutory instrument, but
that he can not demonstrate this or give the reasons for his
assertion because to do so would be to give a "legal opin-

February 3, 1977

ion", that is to say, the application of section 2(1)(d) of the
Statutory Instruments Act to the document in question. Or,
alternatively, he may say that the Department of Justice has
given an opinion, which the Committee may not see, that
the document in question is not a statutory instrument.
(v) The Committee asks why it may not see the Department
of Justice's opinion, or why the officer may not show that
the document lies outside the scope of section 2(1 )(d) of the
Statutory Instruments Act. The officer refers to the Deputy
Minister of Justice's views on the role of the Department of
Justice which preclude the divulging of such information to
the Committee.
(vi) The Committee, not being able to see the document for
itself and being given no reasons, is utterly thwarted. Reference to outside counsel or to the Law Clerks is useless
because the Department of Justice must surely not afford to
them what it has withheld from the Committee.
(vii) A report to the two Houses is impracticable on a
document the Committee has not seen and in respect of
which the Government relies on an undisclosed opinion of
the Department of Justice.
77. The Committee had by November 1976 reached the
position in which its scrutiny of a number of documents(16B) which appeared to it as questionable in some one or
more particulars, or as possibly constituting statutory instruments, was hampered by the actions of officers of the Department of Justice in declining to afford to the Committee what
they considered to be "legal opinions" in response to requests
by the Committee for information and reasons. In two
instances-Immigration Guidelines and Divisional Instructions and Standing Orders of the Penitentiary Service-the
Committee had been informed that these classes of documents
were not statutory instruments, but had not seen the documents in question and could form no opinion as to their status
for the purposes of the Statutory Instruments Act.
78. The Committee formed the view that ail Instruments
Officers who are officers of the Department of Justice should
be replaced by departmental officers. The Committee regards
it as essential that it be given complete explanations, including
detailed reasons to support the position taken by the Department as to why any particular document is not a statutory
instrument, that ail documents the legal status of which is in
doubt be produced to the Committee and that either the
Committee itself, or some other body patterned on the Statutory Instruments Reference Committee at Westminster, be
empowered to issue a definitive ruling as to whether any
particular document or class of document is or is not a
statutory instrument or statutory instruments.
79. The Minister of Justice and his Deputy Minister
appeared before the Committee on 18th November 1976.
Members of the Committee were at pains to make clear that
they were not seeking the release of confidential legal opinions
already given by Department of Justice officers, but rather the
Committee wanted to be told the reasons which lay behind any
assertion that a statutory instrument was intra vires, proper or

February 3, 1977

DEBATES
Februry 3,1977SENATE

clear and unambiguous in the same way that lawyers on behaif
of their clients give grounds or reasons to support legai positions taken by their clients. The Minister undertook to bave
the existing instances of refusais of information by legal
officers reviewed by a senior officer of the Department of
Justice. The resuits of that review have in part been given to
the Committee which bas them under advisement as at the
date of this Report.
80. By letter addressed to the Committee's Joint Chairmen
on i 3th January 1977 the Minister of Justice wrote:
"In discussing this matter with yourseives and the Committee, my mind bas generaiiy focussed on the narrow issue of
the tabiing of legai advice given by my Department to the
Government. But my officiais and I have considered more
generaiiy some of the difficuities whicb I understand the
Committee is experiencing and as a resuit I have recommended to my coileagues in Cabinet a system which 1
believe is practicai anld wiii resuit in the Committee obtaining more compiete information when it bas questions reiated
to statutory instruments.
I have proposed that departments and agencies nominate a
senior off iciai, perbaps at the deputy-minister level, to whom
request for expianations concerning statutory instruments
would be directed. This officiai wouid then provide the
requested expianations having regard to the department's
poiicy and legai position. Naturaiiy, in many cases there wiii
be consultation between the department concerned and the
Department of Justice. It must, however, be understood that
the expianations provided, including any expianation as to
the iegaiity of the instrument, wouid be the soie responsibiiity of the responding department and that legai advice given
to those departments by the Department of Justice wiii not
be disciosed. It is my hope that this system wiii provide for
responses that wiIi aiiow the Committee to perform its
important function, whiie preserving the confidentiaiity of
iawyer-ciient communications. This proposai bas now been
approved by my coileagues and steps are being taken to have
it impiemented in the very near future." (16C)
This wouid be a substantiai improvement on the position
faced by the Committee in the past. The Committee trusts
that, as a resuit of the foregoing proposais, its difficuities in
eiiciting reasons to support the positions taken by Departments
wiii now disappear.
H.-SUB-DELEGATION 0F RULE-MAKING POWER
81. The principle of delegatus non potest delegare (a delegate cannot delegate) is fundamentai to our iaw. It was with
surprise that the Committee discovered that sub-deiegation of
ruie-making power was achieved by statutory instrument and
that the Department of Justice considered the practice quite
proper even in the absence of statutory provision authorizing a
delegate to sub-deiegate his ruie-making power.
82. The Department of Justice's view bas been expressed by
Professor Elmer Driedger, Q.C., sometime Deputy Minister of

80003-23

Justice, in several of bis works-(17) wbich have been of great
assistance to the Committee and its counsel.
"The resuit wouid appear to be that there is no ruie or
presumption for or against sub-deiegation, and that in each
case it is a question of interpretation of the language of the
particular statute."-( 18)
The Committee bas no quarrel with the latter part of this
statement if it means that sub-delegation is permissible if and
only if the enabiing act authorizes it expressiy or by necessary
intendment. The Committee can not accept, however, that
there is no presumption against sub-delegation of rule-making
power for it can not accept that the one authority reiied on,
The Chemicais Reference, (19) is not confined to its own
particuiar facts, in its own particuiar and exceptionai time and
circumstances and under its own exceptional statute, the War
Measures Act. Tbe Committee is satisfied by reference to
Attorney Generai for Canada v. Brent-(20) and other relevant cases and authorities-(21) that the law is flot neutrai on
the matter of sub-delegation, but that on the contrary it is only
lawful if, and is therefore presumed to be uniawful uniess, the
enabiing statute authorizes it expressly or by necessary intendment. The Committee cites as an example of necessary intendment the Canada Labour Standards Reguiations-Ž(22), section 19(5), wbicb sub-delegate power to the Minister to act by
Ministerial Order. Tbe authority for the sub-deiegation, while
not express, flows from the conjoint operation of sections 58,
59.1(1)(d) and 74 of the Canada Labour Code. Such inferred
powers to sub-delegate are to be deprecated and the Committee believes that such powers shouid be conferred expressly in
enabling Acts.
83. The Committee realizes that this issue may one day
come before the courts once again, but whatever the outcome
of that litigation may be, the Committee wili continue to
scrutinize all sub-delegatîons of rule-making power in statutory instruments, not oniy to ensure that any sucb are intra
vires the enabling statutes but aiso to ensure that they do not
amount to an unusual or unexpected use of the subordinate
iaw making power conferred by Parliament, or otherwise
infringe any other of the Committee's criteria.
84. The Committee is aware that it is aiso considered in
some quarters tbat an enabling power cast in terms of subject
matter and introduced by the words "respecting", "in respect
of", "in relation to" carnies with it the power to sub-delegate.
"The distinction between purposes or subjects, on the one
hand, and specific powers on the other, is also relevant in
relation to sub-deiegation. For example, if a minister had
power to make reguiations respecting tariffs and touls he
could probably authorize some other person to fix a tariff or
toil; such a regulation wouid ciearly be one respecting tariffs
or touls. But if the minister's authority is to make regulations
prescribing tariffs and tolls then the minister must himself
prescribe, because he is the only one who possesses the
power. A reguiation purporting to confer this power on
another is not a regulation prescribing tariffs and touls."-(23)

SENATE DEBATES

The Committee can not accept this ascription of such power to
the word "respecting" or to enabling powers cast in terms of
subjects and purposes. The Committee notes that it was precisely such a subject power introduced by the word "respecting" which the Supreme Court of Canada held in Attorney
General for Canada v. Brent gave the Governor in Council no
power to sub-delegate power to a Special Inquiry Officer.
Further, the Committee views the attempt to give to a delegate
under an enabling power cast in terms of subject matter an
automatic right to sub-delegate as simply another attempt to
subvert the most fundamental proposition of all, namely that
subordinate legislation is subordinate. The delegate of lawmaking power, whether he be a Minister, a Commissioner or
the Governor General in Council, is a subordinate law-making
authority and is not in the same position with respect to the
subject matter named as is Parliament.
I. THE LANGUAGE OF DELEGATION
85. It is a principle of our constitution that whatever laws
are passed by Parliament are binding, as the law of the land.
But it is also a principle of our constitution that no one may be
deprived of his liberty or of his rights except in due course of
law. In the absence of a common law or a statutory authority,
a subject can not be deprived of rights by an executive act of
the Governor in Council and if the Governor in Council claims
to have made a regulation entitling himself or some other
subordinate, for example a Minister or a Regional Director, to
interfere with that subject's rights, the Courts will in turn
interfere to stop the Minister, the Governor in Council or the
Regional Director, unless he can show by what authority,
statutory or otherwise, he has made the regulation in question.
The Committee is, therefore, of the view that in order to
safeguard the second of the principles just mentioned, the
precise limits of the law-making power which Parliament
intends to confer on the Governor in Council or on any other
delegate should always be defined in clear language by the
statute which confers it.
86. It is unfortunately the case that many statutes of
Canada do not on their face define clearly the extent of
subordinate law-making power. And the problem is compounded by the views held by the Crown's lawyers and the parliamentary draftsmen of the effect of certain words or formulae
when used in sections in Acts conferring subordinate law-making power.
87. The Crown's views were last put publicly in a submission
by the Privy Council Office to the Special Committee on
Statutory Instruments-(24) (the MacGuigan Committee).
Those views are so important as to justify their quotation in
extenso. (In the quotation which follows, "r.m.a" means regulation making authority)
"1. Forms of Grant
There are three distinct major forms:
(1) Power to make a particular regulation as described in
the Act;

February 3, 1977

(2) Power to make regulations for a specified purpose;
(3) Power to make regulations in relation to a
subject-matter.
Forms 2 and 3 are recognized (with slight difference in
name only) in the Nolan case (P.C.). Form 1 is added to
complete the picture.
There may also be combinations and fusions of these
three distinct forms.
2. Particular Regulation
This is a power to make a regulation the nature and
content of which is described in considerable detail by
Parliament itself. Thus, a regulation "to prohibit the import
of used automobiles" leaves virtually no elbow room. The
r.m.a., and only he, can do just that; nothing more.
The characteristics of this form of power are that in the
normal case it is tightly limited and the terms of the
regulation are predictable. There can seldom be any
surprises.
The Public Service Superannuation Act is a good example
of powers of this class.
3. Specified Purposes
In this form the power given is to make regulations for the
attainment of certain objectives or purposes. This is considerably wider than Form 1. The extent of the power depends
on the statement of purposes.
The purposes may be governed by the "intent of the Act".
Thus, the power may be to make regulations "for carrying
the purposes and provisions of this Act into effect", or it
may be for certain stated purposes that are clearly ancillary
or subordinate to the "intent of the Act" as revealed by the
other provisions inthe Act. In both these cases, there is a
degree of legislative control, enforceable by the courts. The
courts can ascertain the "intention of Parliament" from the
terms of the Act as a whole, and can say whether the
regulation is or is not for the stated purpose. Also, if the
purposes of the Act a, a whole govern, the nature and kind
of regulations that may be made can be envisaged.
The purposes, however, may be stated independently,
outside the umbrella of the Act as a whole. Thus, a singlesection statute could empower a r.m.a. to make regulations
"for promoting the economic welfare of Canada". Or, in an
Act with broad purposes (e.g. emergency powers) a statement of purposes might have no discernible verbal relationship to any other provision of the Act. Powers of this kind
can be extremely broad-the broader the purpose the greater the power. With a wide purpose, it is very difficult to say
that a regulation is clearly outside the purposes, and it is
difficult to imagine what kind of a regulation might be
made. Hence, there is little legislative or judicial control.
4. Specified Subject-matter
Power to make regulations may be in the form of power to
make regulations in relation to a stated subject-matter. This
is the broadest form, because a relationship to a general

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

subject can easily be manufactured. Note that sections 91
and 92 of the B.N.A. Act take this form.
The characteristics of this form are that there is virtually
no limitation on the power by the terms (purposes, intent,
etc.) of the Act itself, but only by the words conferring the
power. Since "relationships" can be almost anything, it is
also difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy the
range of regulations that might be made. Again, the broader
the subject, the greater the power.
The courts do have control, for they can say that a
particular regulation is not in relation to the stated subject,
but the broader the subject or the more general the words
describing the subject, the more difficult it becomes for the
courts to strike down a regulation.
Two statutes illustrate how powerful these two forms,
purposes and subjects, can be. The War Measures Act
(purposes) and the Fisheries Act (subject).
5. Judicial Control
In all three forms, the courts do have a degree of ultimate
control. They can say that a regulation is not
(1) of the kind described-class 1
(2) for the purposes described-class 2
(3) in relation to the subject described--class 3.
This power may be seriously eroded or even taken away
by the familiar phrase "as he deems necessary, desirable,
expedient, etc." Thus, where power is conferred to make
regulations.
(1) "prescribing such fees as he considers necessary"
(class 1),
(2) "as he deems necessary for the purpose of" (class 2),
or
(3) "as he deems to be in relation to" (class 3),
the courts have little more than a theoretical power to strike
down. (For example, War Measures Act-Chemicals Reference). The test whether the regulation falls within the Act is
thus converted from objective to subjective.

regulation-making power, including an unfettered power to
sub-delegate the rule-making power conferred, and the power
to dispense from the regulations, when made, in favour of
particular individuals. This is to set up the delegate as the
equivalent of and with the same power as Parliament itself. It
is to lose sight of the fact that the delegate is a subordinate
law-making body and that delegated legislation is subordinate
law. Only in the most extreme cases and under the most ample
enabling powers conceivable can Parliament be considered to
have given over to its delegate its whole power with respect to
a stated subject matter, subject only to the recall of that power
into its own hands at its will. This the Committee conceives is
the rationale of the decision in the Chemicals Reference,
arising under the War Measures Act, the case apparently
relied upon for the great power of the word "respecting". If
enabling powers cast in terms of subject matter are given the
power, scope and amplitude contended for, delegated legislation bas ceased to be subordinate.
90. For the same reasons, the Committee regards the purported analogy between enabling powers cast in terms of
subject matter and the terms of section 91 and 92 of the
British North America Act as false. This view bas been put
most strongly by Professor Driedger:
"Power to make regulations may be conferred by reference
to subject-matter rather than purpose, as, for example,
respecting aérial navigation. Here again, depending on the
scope of the subject, there could be a wide power. So long as
the regulation is in relation to the prescribed subject it is
valid. A sub-delegating regulation would therefore be valid
if it can be said to be in relation to the subject. Federal and
Provincial statutes in Canada, although not in the category
of subordinate legislation, are enacted under constitutional
power to make laws "in relation to matters coming within"
enumerated classes of subjects, and it is well established that
these powers are full powers to make any laws on any
matter coming within an enumerated subject."-(25)

6. Sub-delegation
Whether a r.m.a. can delegate to another r.m.a. is largely
a matter of construction. There is probably no valid argument against sub-delegation in Forms 2 and 3. A delegating
regulation can be said to be for the purpose, or in relation to
a subject, specified in the Act."
88. The views just quoted have been presented a trifle more
elaborately but to the same effect by Professor Driedger in his
famous works "Subordinate Legislation", "The Construction
of Statutes", "The Composition of Legislation" and "Legislative Forms and Precedents".

There can be no analogy or equivalence between the conferring
of legislative powers upon the Parliament of Canada and the
Legislatures of the provinces-"authority as plenary and
ample within the limits prescribed by (section 91 and) section
92 as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power
possessed and could bestow"-(26)-and the conferring of
powers to be exercised by delegation from the Parliament of
Canada for the making of subordinate legislation. The scope of
the delegation must be determined by the enabling Act as a
whole and there can be no presumption that the conferring of a
delegated power to legislate with respect to a subject matter
gives the delegate, high or low, plenary power to act in all
respects as Parliament itself could do.

89. The Committee has come to the conclusion that it can
not agree with the views of the Privy Council Office. It is the
Crown's claim, to put matters bluntly, that an enabling power
cast in terms of subject matter, and most commonly introduced by the word "respecting", imports the widest possible

91. The Committee is well aware of the entrenched position
of the word "respecting" and its equivalents in the language of
delegation. Because the Committee can not agree with the
effect claimed for it, or with the reasons advanced for that

80003-24'/

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
effect, it wishes to place on record its total opposition to the
continued use of subject related enabling clauses as long as the
Department of Justice persists in its present views that they
permit both sub-delegation of rule-making power and dispensations from statutory instruments in favour of individuals.
This position has been made known to the Legal Advisers to
the Privy Council Office and through them to the Assistant
Deputy Minister of Justice (Legislative Programming).
92. The Committee is not so sanguine as to expect that the
action it bas taken will be sufficient to resolve the matter. The
support of the two Houses is necessary to put an end to a
construction of an enabling power, and to a practice, which is
inimical to their rights and subversive of Parliament's
supremacy. Such a form of enabling power is not in use in the
United Kingdom and overseas experience in coping with it can
not be called upon. The responsibility for safeguarding Parliament's rights, therefore, falls squarely on the Parliament itself.
93. The Committee has encountered statutory instruments
made under enabling powers which are drawn in such a way as
virtually to exclude the possibility of objection and effective
scrutiny. Section 4 of the Electricity Inspection Act and
Section 3(c) of the Gas Inspection Act empower the Governor
in Council to make regulations necessary for giving effect to
the provisions of the statute and for "declaring its true intent
and meaning in all cases of doubt". Apart from the blanket
legislative power thus conferred, which is limited by specific
following clauses in the case of the Gas Inspection Act, and
may be limited to purely administrative matters as suggested
by Professor Driedger,-(27) these enabling powers give to the
Governor in Council the power to declare the meaning of t'he
statute, the function of the judiciary within our constitutional
system. While the regulations-(28) made under these powers
are in the Committee's views unobjectionable, it feels obliged
to report to the two Houses enabling powers of such a nature.
94. Similar objectionable and all-encompassing enabling
powers are to be found in section 11 of the Fisheries Prices
Support Act; section 12 of the Dominion Water Power Act
(which also empowers the Governor in Council by regulation
"to meet any cases that arise, and for which no provision is
made in this Act"); section 7(3) of the Canada Pension Plan
Act (". . . to make such other regulations to provide for the

manner in which the provisions of this Act shall apply with
respect thereto, and to adapt the provisions of this Act with
respect thereto, as appear to the Governor in Council necessary to give effect to the regulations made under this section";
section 277 of the Customs Act.
95. The Committee believes that the precise limits of the
law-making power which Parliament intends to confer on a
delegate should always be expressly defined in clear language
by the statute which confers it: when discretion is conferred,
its limits should be defined with equal clarity. No statute
should enable a delegate to declare the true intent of Parliament or the scope and nature of the delegation of law-making
power.

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

J.-THE PRETENDED POWER OF DISPENSING WITH
REGULATIONS IN FAVOUR OF INDIVIDUALS
96. It was with surprise that the Committee discovered that
regulations are made by Parliament's delegates purporting to
dispense with existing regulations in favour of individuals and
in particular circumstances, without any power in that behalf
having been conferred by Parliament. The Committee has also
encountered cases in which the delegate of Parliament's
powers has purported to confer upon a sub-delegate the power
to dispense from the regulations made by the delegate. The
Committee expresses its disagreement with such practices
which it conceives to be both illegal and subversive of constitutional government.
97. Parliament can, of course, by express provision grant to
a delegate the power to dispense from legislation, whether
primary or subordinate. Thus, by section (6)g of the Whaling
Covention Act the Governor in Council is authorized to dispense from the provisions of the Act and the Whaling Regulations in favour of Indians and Eskimos and that power bas
been exercised quite properly in making section 4 of the
Whaling Regulations.-(29) Other statutory provisions which
permit of dispensations by delegates from subordinate legislation include section 482(1) of the Canada Shipping Act, and
section 14(1) of the Aeronautics Act.
98. While Parliament can assuredly grant to its delegate
power to dispense from the subordinate legislation he makes,
the Committee feels it imperative to set down what is both the
corollary and a fundamental constitutional principle, secured
by the Revolutionary Settlement, namely that a delegate
empowered to make subordinate law bas no power to dispense
from the law he makes in individual instances unless that
power bas been granted to him expressly. To admit of any
other principle is both to allow the delegate to rise above his
subordinate status-to deny the essential proposition that
subordinate law is subordinate, and to allow the delegate to
arrogate to himself the status of Parliament-and to seek to
undo one essential feature of the Revolutionary Settlement,
embodied in the Bill of Rights, 1689.
99. Three examples will suffice to make the Committee's
point.
(i) SOR/74-157, Long Lake Area, Ontario Proclaimed
Exempt from Sections 19 and 20 of the Navigable Waters
Protection Act
Section 21 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act reads as
follows:
"21. The Governor in Council, when it is shown to his
satisfaction that the public interest would not be injuriously
affected thereby, may, from time to time, by proclamation,
declare any rivers, streams or waters referred to in sections
19 and 20, or any part or parts thereof, exempt in whole or
in part from the operation of those sections, and may, from
time to time, revoke such proclamations."
The sections from which exemption may be granted forbid the
throwing or depositing etc. of sawdust, lumber wastes, stones,

SENATE DEBATES

gravel, cinders, ashes and so on into navigable waters or waters
which flow into navigable waters. From time to time private
enterprises and official bodies, e.g. Hydro authorities, apply
for an exemption in respect of a particular body of water.
Section 21 provides for exemption in whole or in part for "any
rivers, streams or waters ... or any part or parts thereof . . . "
and does not provide for an exemption in favour of a particular
applicant. If a body of water is exempted then any one can
dump the wastes referred to in sections 19 and 20 into the
exempted waters. The words "in whole or in part" would refer
to sections 19 and 20 and hence to the categories of waste.
In this instance Denison Mines Ltd. applied to dispose of
tailings in Long Lake area. The proclamation purports to
exempt the "Long Lake area" from the operation of sections
19 and 20 with respect to the disposal of tailings by Denison
Mines Ltd. This is objectionable on two grounds. First, the
exemption can, under section 21, not be limited to Denison
Mines Ltd.: anyone must be permitted to dispose of tailings. It
is noteworthy that none of the previous exemptions granted
under section 21 have purported to limit the exemption to a
particular applicant or "depositor"-(30) Secondly, the section speaks specifically of declaring exempt "any rivers,
streams or waters ... or any part or parts thereor', yet this
proclamation purports to apply not to any rivers, streams,
waters or defined parts of them but to an area shown on
Department of Transport map. Again, previous proclamations
under this section have delineated the exempted waters with
great particularity.
The Committee has concluded that this Proclamation is
ultra vires as a purported dispensation from the Navigable
Waters Protection Act in favour of Denison Mines Limited, no
statutory authority for such a dispensation existing. The Committee also considers the Proclamation not in conformity with
the enabling power in that it does not declare any specific
rivers, streams, or waters, or any part or parts thereof, as
exempt from the operation of sections 19 and 20 of the
enabling Act. The Department of Transport has twice been
advised of the Committee's position but has to date merely
indicated that it "has taken into advisement the comments
made by the Committee" and that no further such exemptions
have been granted.
(ii) SOR/74-29, Special Parole Regulations No. 1, 1973
The relevant enabling power, section 9(a) of the Parole Act,
empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations prescribing "the portion of the terms of imprisonment that
inmates shall serve before parole may be granted". Since the
word "portion" is singular, and not plural, and the words
"terms" and "inmates" are plural, this power extends only to
setting general rules applicable to all inmates, that is to say to
promulgating portions of terms which will be of general
application amongst inmates. Consequently, there is no power
to set a portion of a term for a particular inmate or to provide
by regulation that notwithstanding the Parole Regulations a
particular inmate may be paroled before the term of imprisonment applicable to him under the Regulations has expired.

The Special Parole Regulations No. 1, 1973, which are the
first and only such regulations to have been made, purported
to dispense from section 2 of the Parole Regulations in favour
of one Jacques LeBlanc, permitting his parole after a term of
imprisonment not of ten but of "five years minus the time
spent in custody from the day be was arrested and taken into
custody ...

to the day ...

sentence was imposed". The Legal

Adviser to the National Parole Board, who is not an officer of
the Department of Justice, made freely available to the Committee all the background material to this matter, from which
it appeared that this extraordinary course was adopted on the
suggestion of one of the Legal Advisers to the Privy Council
Office, who himself drafted the Special Regulations. It
appeared that M. LeBlanc was convicted of complicity to
commit murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment while
those who were convicted of the murder itself, being juveniles,
were sentenced to eighteen months in the Mt. St. Antoine
Institution for Boys. The Quebec Court of Appeal, while
rejecting M. LeBlanc's appeal, recommended that some action
be taken by other authorities in light of the disparity between
the sentences. The Associate Deputy Minister of Justice for
Quebec made representations to the National Parole Board,
which recommended to the Solicitor General that an exception
be made to subsection 4 of section 2 of the Parole Regulations
in M. LeBlanc's favour. That exception was duly purported to
be made by SOR/74-29.
The Committee was unable to see this course of proceeding
as anything but an unlawful dispensation from the Parole
Regulations since the Parole Act confers no power of dispensation on anyone and section 9(a) itself authorizes only general
rules and not particular rules applying to individual inmates.
The Committee is not, of course, unmindful of the hardship
which it was sought to avert by making these Special Parole
Regulations, but considers that the proper course-and a
course possibly more beneficial to M. LeBlanc-would have
been, and still is, an exercise of the Royal Prerogative of
Mercy. (The Committee understands that M. LeBlanc, while
originally on day parole, is still on full parole.) These views
were pointed out to the National Parole Board which advised
the Committee that it considered itself bound "by the procedure recommended to it and by the acceptance of that procedure by the Governor in Council". It was, of course, precisely
that procedure and its consequent acceptance by the Governor
in Council which the Committee objected to as amounting to
an illegal act of dispensing with the law in favour of M.
LeBlanc.
The Committee realizes that what is now critical is not the
illegality of the manner in which M. LeBlanc was released
from custody in 1973 but the gaining of an assurance that no
further Special Parole Regulations will be made reducing the
portions of terms of imprisonment that must be served by
particular inmates before they may be granted parole. The
Committee notes that the proposed section 9 of the Parole Act,
contained in clause 22 of the Bill for a Criminal Law Amendment Act (No. 1) 1976 introduced in the last Session, repro-

346

SENATE DEBATES

duced the present phrase-"portion of the terms of imprisonment"-and that, even if that Bill is reintroduced and carried,
precisely the same situation could arise in the future under the
same statutory provision as applied in the case of M. LeBlanc.
(iii) SOR/73-439, Section 1 of Schedule A to the Steamship
Machinery Construction Regulations, amendment
Section 1 of Schedule A to this amending regulation purports to give the Board of Steamship Inspection a power to
dispense in individual cases with the properties of steel laid
down in the balance of the Schedule as being of general
application. In doing so, it simply echoes section 4(1) of the
principal Regulations which, being made in 1955,-(31) lie
beyond the Committee's reference. When advised of the Committee's concern at the granting by the Governor in Council to
the Board of a power to dispense with a part of the regulations
made by the Governor in Council, the Ministry of Transport
replied that the power to grant a dispensation to the Board was
conferred upon the Governor in Council by section 400(l)(b)
of the Canada Shipping Act which reads:
"The Governor in Council may make regulations respecting
the construction of machinery."
The Committee was told that the power to dispense flowed
from the word "respecting". This the Committee can not
accept, for reasons discussed at length in Appendix III.
The Committee is more than ever convinced that the word
"respecting" and subject-matter enabling clauses have been
given an interpretation by the Department of Justice wholly
erroneous and dangerous. The Committee wishes to adopt the
words of Chillingworth:
"He that would usurp an absolute lordship over any people,
need not put himself to the trouble of abrogating or disannulling the laws made to maintain the common liberty, for
he may frustrate their intent, and compass his design as
well, if he can get the power and authority to interpret them
as he pleases, and to have his interpretation stand for laws."
100. Because of the tenacity with which the belief is held in
the Department of Justice that such dispensations as have been
described are lawful, the Committee has felt obliged to canvass
this issue fully in Appendix III the more so since the power is
being widely used (168 instances have come to the Committee's notice) and a great deal of ingenuity and mental effort
appears to have been devoted to justifying this pretended
power. The arguments in favour of its existence are diverse
and each might have been addressed acceptably to the Court
of King's Bench in the time of Charles I. They all, however,
accord with the discredited reasoning of Lord Chief Justice
Herbert in Godden v. Hales (1686).-(32)
"There is no law whatsoever but may be dispensed with by
the supreme law-giver; as the laws of God may be dispensed
with by God himself; as it appears by God's command to
Abraham, to offer up his son Isaac: so likewise the law of
man may be dispensed with by the legislator, for a law may
either be too wide or too narrow, and there may be many
cases which may be out of the conveniences which did
induce the law to be made; for it is impossible for the wisest

February 3, 1977

lawmaker to foresee all the cases that may be, or are to be
remedied, and therefore there must be a power somewhere,
able to dispense with these laws."
Just as that polluter of the temple of justice, in his desire to
facilitate administrative convenience, confused God's Regent
with God himself, so too the Department of Justice appears to
confuse a delegate or sub-delegate of Parliament with the
supreme law giver.
101. In case it might be thought that it has become unduly
excited about a trifle which facilitates the administration of
the realm the Committee wishes it to be recalled that it was
just such a facilitation of policy which cost James Il his
throne. And it was just such an insistence on supra-legal
powers which in some small measure led to the execution of his
father. The Committee believes that the laws are to be obeyed
by all. The nature of a dispensation is to favour some, to set
some at liberty from the obligations or restrictions of the law,
but to leave others under those same obligations and restrictions, and in many instances liable to penalty if they transgress. Once given or assumed a power of dispensation knows
no limit in time, number or reason.
If it is desired to have a power to exempt in hard cases,
Parliament must be asked to grant it. Livy wrote:
"The laws alone are they that always speak with all persons,
high or low, in one and the same impartial voice. The law
knows no favourites."
It is to be regretted that certain laws of Canada appear
otherwise, and in contradiction of Aristotle's precept:
"That the law is a mind without affection; that is, it binds
all alike, and dispenses with none; the greatest flies are no
more able to break through the cobwebs than the smaller."
102. Should there persist in any quarter the view that the
dispensing power exists, the Committee conceives as the most
expeditious remedy the passage of a Bill for a Dispensing
Power (Abolition) Declaratory Act.
103. As a final point, the Committee wishes to note the
extraordinary nature of the constantly appearing "Immigration Special Relief Regulations" which purport, under sections
57 and 27(3) of the Immigration Act, to dispense with certain
requirements of the Immigration Regulations in favour of
named individuals. The number of persons so exempted runs
into hundreds, even thousands, every year. The Committee
rejects the argument that a power to exempt categories of
persons from the Regulations extends to exempting individuals. Moreover, it is not convinced that there is power under the
Act to exempt categories of individuals. It was on this point
that the Committee was first refused a "legal opinion" by a
Designated Instruments Officer who was an officer of the
Department of Justice serving as Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Manpower and Immigration.
On humanitarian grounds there may be need of a power to
waive certain immigration requirements in individual cases.
The proper course is to take this power by statute and this is
the course the Committee has urged upon the Department of

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Manpower and Immigration and upon the Joint Parliamentary
Committee on Immigration. On an initial reading of the
proposed new Immigration Bill (1976) now before Parliament-and recognizing that it has no direct mandate to debate
that Bill in detail at this particular stage-the Committee
cannot find in that Bill any explicit power to waive immigration requirements on humanitarian grounds in individual cases,
otherwise than by Ministerial permit.

the Crown's eyes to bring the terms and conditions, when
made and set in writing, within the compass of the Statutory
Instruments Act. While not accepting that a magic formula is
necessary to constitute delegated legislation a statutory instrument, the Committee has naturally represented to those in
authority that the jurisdictional problem would be better
avoided altogether by conferring the subordinate law-making
power in terms which the Government itself acknowledges will,
when the power is exercised, produce a statutory instrument.

K.-ENABLING POWERS IN APPROPRIATION ACTS

108. The Committee has also objected to a refinement of the
formula mentioned in the preceding paragraph: "subject to
terms and conditions approved by the Governor in Council".
This particular form of enabling power has all the defects
already described but also is completely lacking in specificity
as to whom the power is given. Who is it who is to set or make
the terms and conditions which His Excellency in Council may
approve? The Crown's legal advisers appear to maintain that
under this particular formula no more is meant than that the
Governor in Council will set the conditions. The Committee is,
understandably, not very sanguine about general understandings as to the result of particular statutory formulae aid is of
the view that every enabling power should specify Parliagtent's
delegate with precision, along with any conditions precedent to
the use of the power or procedural requirements Parliament
sees fit to provide. All should be clear and admit of no
argument.

104. In the review of statutory instruments the Committee
has been struck by the number of instances of the use of Votes
in Appropriation Acts as vehicles for the conferring of subordinate law-making powers, usually upon the Governor in Council. From 1st January 1972 to 30th June 1976 at least one
hundred and four items çf delegated legislation have to the
knowledge of the Committee, been made pursuant to Votes.
(The task of adding up the number is not easy since spent
regulations are removed from the Index to Part Il of the
Canada Gazette at the end of each calendar year in which
their effect became spent.) The Committee fears that many,
many more examples exist which have not been classed by the
Crown's legal advisers as statutory instruments and of the
existence of which the Committee has neither knowledge nor
the means of knowledge.
105. The type of power to which the Committee is referring
arises when moneys are voted by Parliament to be disbursed
for a stated purpose but all the rules governing that expenditure, the determination of eligible recipients and so on, are left
to be made by a subordinate authority. Parliament simply
hands a sum of money to a subordinate with authority to spend
it for a particular purpose, often vaguely stated, as that
authority sees fit. The authority then makes a set of rules,
often very elaborate, governing the expenditure of the money
and, in effect, defining the purpose and objects of Parliament's
bounty. Often the financial basis which gives the legal justification for the use of a Vote in an Appropriation Act is a
fiction since the money voted is only one dollar.
106. At first, though disquieted by the extent of the granting
of enabling powers in Votes, and those in distressingly vague
and all-encompassing terms, the Committee did not take a
stand against this means of providing for delegated legislation.
Rather, the Committee concerned itself with remarking upon
clear abuses of the practice and in drawing its objections to the
attention of the Legal Advisers to the Privy Council Office and
of the President of the Privy Council.
107. The first of these abuses was the frequent drawing of
the enabling power in terms which, in the view of the Crown,
would exclude the delegated legislation from the definition of a
"statutory instrument" and hence from Parliamentary scrutiny. The phrase frequently encountered was "... subject to
terms and conditions prescribed by the Governor in Council
This phrase lacks any magic formula, such as "pre....
scribed by regulation" or "prescribed by order", necessary in

109. The third abuse to which the Committee has objected
is the "filling up" and extension of old Votes, and old enabling
powers, under a series of Votes commencing at some point in
the intermediate or distant past which are then amplified in
scope or altered in some one or more particulars by succeeding
Votes. These successive Votes are often expressed "to extend
the purpose" of an earlier Vote and the extensions in some
instances are but barely related to the particular objects of the
original Vote. The combination of the accumulation of extensions and the extreme generality of language in which almost
all enabling powers in Votes are expressed renders the task of
the Standing Joint Committee so difficult as to negate any
effective scrutiny. To the extent that scrutiny is rendered
ineffective, Parliament's control of the purse is subverted. The
Committee bas seen instances of deplorable vagueness and
uncertainty as to the truc extent of enabling power arising
from such constant tinkering. Moreover, the Committee concludes that this practice shows that normal, substantive legislation is necessary to cover the particular subject matter dealt
with by the series of Votes. To take but one example, the
Committee cannot sec why the medical fringe benefits of
public servants could not be settled by statute and regulation
in the ordinary way, instead of under a series of Votes commencing in 1960.-(33) This abuse amounts to an infringement of criterion 9 and the Committee considers that much of
what appears in Votes to be dealt with by delegated legislation
should be the subject of open and notorious legislation.
110. In delving into the intricacies of enabling powers under
Votes, the Committee soon discovered that the enabling

SENATE DEBATES

powers were often not found in the Votes themselves, but in
Items in the Estimates to which individual Votes related.
Again, to take one example, the Committee had occasion to
consider two amendments to the Shipbuilding Temporary
Assistance Programme Regulations.-(34) The enabling authority for the principal Regulations-(35) and the subsequent
amendments was recited as being the Appropriation Act No.
3, 1970. A perusal of the Votes for the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, on the recommendation of whose
Minister the amendments were made, revealed nothing which
appeared to relate to temporary assistance for the shipbuilding
industry. Upon enquiry of the Department, the Committee was
informed that the authority lay in Vote 5 and "the item
entitled 'Capital subsidies for the construction of commercial
and fishing vessels in accordance with regulations of the
Governor in Council' which is listed in the details of the
Printed Estimates 1970-71 related to that Vote". Vote 5 of the
Appropriation Act No. 3, 1970 reads as follows:
"Trade-Industrial-The grants listed in the Estimates and
contributions and to increase to $150,000,000 the commitments during the current and subsequent fiscal years for
payments to develop and sustain the technological capability
of Canadian defence industry, and to increase to $60,000,000 the commitments during the current and subsequent
fiscal years for payments to advance the technological capability of Canadian manufacturing industry by supporting
projectsdevelopment
selected civil (non-defence)
$88,888,500"
Apart from the fact that there did not appear to be any
necessary connection between capital subsidies for the building
of commercial and fishing vessels on the one hand and the
terms of Vote 5, the Committee was struck by the fact that by
the conjunction of Votes and Estimates in this fashion moneys
appropriated by Parliament for what appear to be fairly
closely defined purposes may be spent by the Crown on
virtually any object it pleases, thus subverting Parliament's
control of the purse and destroying the appropriation system in
all but name.
111. As a further example of the uncontrolled power being
granted to the Crown by way of delegated legislation under
Appropriation Acts the Committee notes Vote I0b of the
Department of Manpower and Immigration in Appropriation
Act No. 2, 1973:
... to extend the purposes of Manpower and Immigration
Vote 10, Appropriation Act No. 3, 1972, to authorize
special travel payments to or in respect of persons, in
accordance with regulations made by the Governor in Council, to enable such persons to avail themselves of the services
provided by the Department of Manpower and Immigration-$L."
This Vote has been used to make a Manpower Mobility
Regulations, amendment,-(36) permitting the making of
travel grants to those who journey to take up seasonal agricultural work. But it could be used to make regulations relating to
anything the department pleases.

February 3, 1977

112. The Committee notes that power to make subordinate
legislation is not granted in Votes in Appropriation Acts in the
United Kingdom or in the Commonwealth of Australia and
has concluded that it should place on record its opposition, as a
matter of principle, to the making of delegated legislation
under Votes in Appropriation Acts, whether under substantive
or "dollar" Votes or under Votes used in conjunction with
items listed in the Estimates. The Committee has made this
position known to the Auditor General, the President of the
Privy Council, the President of the Honourable the Treasury
Board and the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and
has invited each to place his observations on the problems and
practices now reported before the Committee. The Auditor
General has replied in terms which confirm the Committee in
its disquiet.
113. The Committee endorses the views of the Auditor
General. If enabling powers to make statutory instruments are
to continue to be granted in Appropriation Acts, the vote texts
should be specific and unequivocal, and contain all the wording having legislative effect, with none being contained in the
Estimates. Legislating by means of dollar Votes and altering
the purpose of previous Votes by a number of successive Votes
are practices with which the Committee does not agree.
L.-SCRUTINY OF ENABLING POWERS
114. The Committee recommends that enabling clauses in
Bills should be scrutinized with particular care to ensure that
the problems pointed out in the several preceding sections of
this Report are found and analyzed while the Bills are before
Parliament. Such studies of enabling clauses could be carried
out by the appropriate Standing Committees or could be
added to the reference of the Standing Joint Committee on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments.
M.

THE TEXT OF INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO
AMENDMENT

115. Ascertaining the text of a statutory instrument which
has been amended is not an easy task, yet it is a task which has
faced the Committee and its counsel frequently and which has
been carried out in many cases only with the utmost difficulty.
How much more difficult must the same task be for ordinary
citizens lacking expertise and ready access to the necessary
documentation!
116. Since the last Consolidation of the Regulations of
Canada appeared in 1955, there is only one laborious means of
ascertaining the present state of a regulation or other statutory
instrument. One must refer to the enabling Act in the Index to
Part Il of the Canada Gazette to find listed thereunder the
particular regulation and all its subsequent amendments. Each
such amendment must then be looked at individually and
fitted into the original text, as if it were all one giant jig-saw
puzzle. The whole process is made worse by the apparent
unwillingness of some Departments and of the Privy Council
Office to cause heavily amended regulations to be revoked and

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

remade in new and complete form in a single regulation. The
Committee bas urged this course, but to no avail. The Committce considers that, if a process of constant amendment is
likely to continue, as appears to be the case with regulations
made under section 34 of the Fisheries Act, the regulations
should be revoked and remade in consolidated form at regular
intervals, perhaps annually. The Committee cannot see that
there can be any more work involved, or more expense, in
processing an Order in Council for a fresh set of consolidated
regulations than in processing an Order in Council for a
further amending regulation. The consolidated text must be
known to the Department or it would be unable to administer
its own regulations. The Committee is concerned to see that
the consolidated text is made known as simply and directly and
intelligibly as possible to ail citizens. The Committee cannot
believe that those affected by regulations, however skilful they
may be in keeping up to date with amendments, would not find
it simpler to cope with a fresh set of regulations than with, say,
the sixteenth amendment to an existing regulation which
amends a subsection of the regulations already twice amended.
The effectiveness of much amended regulations, other than as
traps for the unwary, is much to be doubted.
117. The Committee understands that a new Consolidation
of the Regulations will appear, possibly as early as mid-1977.
While this is naturally to be welcomed, concern must be
expressed as to the means of keeping abreast of the flood of
amendments which will follow. The Committee is of the view
that after 1977 revocation and re-issuing of amended regulations should be the course followed so that ordinary folk will
not be forced to study an ever-increasing accumulation of
individual amendments. There appears to the Committee to be
nothing in Part Il of the Statute Revision Act-(37) which
requires that the next Consolidation of the Regulations must
be kept up to date by the looseleaf method of revision in
respect of all "regulations, statutory instruments or documents
that, in the opinion of the Commission, are of continuing effect
or apply to more than one person or body . . . "

118. It is perhaps appropriate to observe that when the new
Consolidation appears, it is estimated that the Committee wili
be faced with upwards of ten thousand pages of text of
statutory instruments to scrutinize. So great an undertaking,
while new and amending instruments will continue to be made,
can only be undertaken slowly and in stages.
N.-DEPARTURE FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE
STATUTES
119. One of the Committee's concerns bas been the equivalence in meaning of the French and English texts of statutory
instruments. In looking at the texts of instruments with this in
mind, the Committee has noted many instances in which
statutory language bas been reproduced faithfully in the English text but has been subject to "improvement" in the French
text. The Committee formed and bas adhered to the view that
where phrases which appear in an enabling Act are used in
statutory instruments made under that Act, such phrases

80003-24

should be reproduced without modification. Consequently, the
Committee disagrees with the practice, no doubt well meaning,
of translators and draftsmen of statutory instruments in seeking to improve upon the English or French used in the statutes
of Canada.
120. The Committee is aware, however, that there are
deficiencies and errors in the language of the statutes. While
attention seems more commonly drawn to problems in the
French texts, the English texts are not without their blemishes.
The proper course is not to improve upon the language Parliament bas seen fit to use when drafting statutory instruments, a
process to which there would be no limit, but to alter the
language of the statutes. The Committee notes that the Statute Law Revision Commissioners have been empowered to
prepare draft consolidations and revisions of statutes on this
basis and, further, that the projected periodical Statute Law
Revision (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bills provide a further
vehicle for improving the quality of language of the statutes.
121. The Committee bas, accordingly, insisted that
"improvements" on statutory language in statutory instruments be revoked and replaced by the language of the enabling
Acts. In cases where there would clearly seem to be a different
or new shade of meaning arising from the abandonment of the
statutory language, the Committee has requested immediate
amendment of the offending statutory instrument. In other
cases the Committee bas been willing to let the language stand
until the instrument in which it appears is next amended.
O.-SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS PRECEDENT
122. Where authority to make the instrument depends,
under the enabling Act, upon the fulfilment of some condition
precedent which can be recited as a statement of fact, the
fulfilment of that condition should normally be recited in the
preamble. Examples are, that a certain notice or proposai has
been published as required, or that the Governor in Council is
satisfied that, or that certain bodies have been consulted as
required by statute. Agreement has been reached with the
Legal Advisers to the Privy Council Office that such material
will appear in the recitals contained in the preamble to statutory instruments which are published in Part Il of the Canada
Gazette. Of course, the Committee has no means of seeing
that this eminently sensible requirement is met in the case of
statutory instruments that are not subject to the pre-registration scrutiny of the Legal Advisers to the Privy Council Office.
Such instruments are unlikely, under the present Statutory
Instruments Act, to come to the Committee's attention.
P.-IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENTS BY STATUTORY INSTRUMENTREMISSION ORDERS UNDER SECTION 17 OF THE
FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT
123. The Committee has noted severai instances of the
implementation of an international agreement by regulation or
other statutory instrument made under a statute which does

SENATE DEBATES

pot show in any way Parliament's intention to make the
content of the particular international agreement part of
Canadian national law. The Committee will keep this practice
under continuing study and review, reporting to the two
Houses at a later date should it consider that step necessary.
124. The Committee is aware that the practice referred to is
a longstanding one and is often effected by the issuing of a
Remission Order under section 17 of the Financial Administration Act. It is known that it is the Crown's view that
Remission Orders are not statutory instruments but those of
general application are published under SI numbers in Part Il
of the Canada Gazette as documents of public interest only.
The Committee does not accept that Remission Orders are not
statutory instruments simply because the magic formula "by
order" is not found in the text of section 17 of the Financial
Administration Act. Remission of taxes, fees and penalties is
made by Order in Council and the Committee regards each
such Remission Order as a statutory instrument, although it is
aware that it sees only those few published in the Canada
Gazette Part IL.The Committee is of the view that if any class
of Remission Order is to be excluded from the definition of a
statutory instrument, the Statutory Instruments Act should be
amended so to provide. Similarly, if any Remission Orders,
while being statutory instruments, are to be excluded from
scrutiny by the Committee, the Statutory Instruments Act or
the regulations made under section 27 of that Act should so
provide.
125. The Committee is also concerned with the frequency
and nature of the use of Remission Orders under section 17 of
the Financial Administration Act to grant remissions of customs duty, excise and other taxes to individuals and classes of
persons. What appears to the Committee to be a power
intended for use in exceptional cases where the public interest
so dictates, has become routinely used for the implementation
of governmental policies. The fact that the Governor in Council considers it in the public interest to remit the particular tax,
fee or penalty involved is not now even recited in the preamble
to a Remission Order.

Q.-AMENDMENT

OF THE STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS REGULATIONS

126. The Statutory Instruments Regulations have been
thrice amended since they were first made on 9th November
1971. When considering the last of these amendments, the
Committee concluded that, since it was peculiarly concerned
with and affected by amendments to these Regulations, it
would be desirable if further amendments were not made
without prior consultation with the Committee. The Committee realized that it had no right to be consulted and that the
Crown in Council could make regulations as it saw fit, leaving
the Committee to protest about the amendments after they
were made, should it feel so disposed. Nonetheless, the Committee thought that it would be sensible if it were consulted

February 3, 1977

about proposed Statutory Instruments Regulations before they
were made. The Committee's views were put to the President
of the Privy Council, who replied:
"If by consultations are meant a formal process whereby
proposed amendments to the Statutory Instruments Regulations would be subject to prior approval or rejection by the
Committee, the Government would be unable to agree since
we do not feel that we can avoid acceptance of our final
responsibility, bestowed by Parliament, for the content of
these regulations by sharing on a formal basis the duty of
defining them. If on the other hand, consultations refer to
informal discussions with the Co-Chairmen, the Government would indeed be pleased to consider carefully their
comments on existing or future regulations and any recommendations for amendments which the Committee may care,
to put forward."
The Joint Chairman, Senator Forsey, responded to the President's letter, in part as follows:
"I'm afraid I must have expressed myself obscurely. Of
course nobody with any knowledge of constitutional practice
would expect that proposed amendments to the Statutory
Instruments Regulations should be subject to prior approval
by the Committee. All that anybody had in mind was what
you suggest at the end of your letter: that you might
consider suggestions that the Committee might see fit to
offer. This, I assume, would mean that when the Government was contemplating changes (at any rate changes of
any importance), it would let us know so that we could offer
any suggestions we had when they would be of most use."
R.-LEGISLATION BY REFERENCE
127. The incorporation into statutory instruments of external documents, for example standards of the Canadian Standards Association, is acceptable provided a fixed text is incorporated and not a text as amended from time to time by an
outside body. The Committee insists that any such amendment
be considered by Parliament's delegate and, if thought desirable, incorporated by positive amendment to the statutory
instrument into which the original standard, document and so
on was incorporated. To allow automatic amendment is to
permit some one other than Parliament's delegate to make
subordinate legislation and to acquiesce in the amendment of a
statutory instrument, and hence the making of a new statutory
instrument, outside the procedures prescribed by the Statutory
Instruments Act.
Where subordinate legislation by incorporating or referring
to external documents occurs, the Committee calls for the
incorporation of a reference to a fixed text or for an undertaking that no amendment to the external document will be
regarded as incorporated into the statutory instrument which
contains the subordinate legislation, any amendment which it
is desired to include in the statutory instrument being the
subject of specific amending action.

S.-POWERS OF OFFICERS OF AGRICULTURAL
AGENCIES
The Committee has viewed with the gravest concern
128.
regulations made under the authority of the Agricultural
Products Marketing and Farm Products Marketing Agencies
Acts which empower officials to enter premises and to demand
information from primary producers. The Committee is aware
of the wide powers granted to inspectors under section 35 of
the Farm Products Marketing Act and under the several
provincial Acts utilized by Commodity Boards authorized to
regulate interprovincial and export trade by Orders made
under section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act.
The Committee believes that it is imperative for the preservation of the liberties of the subject that the regulations made
under both Acts go not one jot beyond the powers given by the
Farm Products Marketing Act and the provincial marketing
Acts and that the procedures adopted in the regulations be
such as scrupulously respect the rights of the subject and the
basic presumptions of the common law.
129. Typical of the provisions objected to under the Farm
Products Marketing Agencies Act was section 7 of the Canadian Turkey Licensing Regulations-(38) which provided that:
"Every licence shall be issued subject to the following
conditions:
(a) the licensee shall provide to the Agency such reports
and information as the Agency may from time to time
require;
(b) the licensee shall permit the Agency, its employees
and agents to inspect the licensee's premises and records;
(c) the licensee shall at all times during the term of the
licence comply with orders and regulations of the
Agency."
The information that might be required was not defined in
terms of the marketing of turkeys in interprovincial and export
trade and could have included even the licensee's income tax
records. Moreover, the activity of inspection was not confined
to that carried out by properly appointed inspectors and in
accordance with section 35(1) of the Act. Section 7 of the
Regulations has since been amended-(39) to remove these
objectionable features.
130. An example of the provisions objected to by the
Committee under the Agricultural Products Marketing Act is
provided by the Saskatchewan Hog Information (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations,-(40) section 5 of which reads:
"5. (1) Any member or authorized representative of the
Commission may, at any reasonable time, inspect any place
or premises used for the marketing of hogs.
(2) Every person in possession or control of any place or
premises referred to in subsection (1) shall
(a) permit any member or authorized representative of
the Commission to inspect such place or premises; and
(b) furnish any member or authorized representative of
the Commission with such information in respect of the
marketing of hogs as he may reasonably require."

80003-23'/2

Here, the powers of inspection have been granted without any
requirement that the inspecting officer show his authority and
establish his indentity. Nor is any attempt made to define
"reasonable time". Under section 5(2)(b) a person in possession or control of any place or premises used for the marketing
of hogs must "furnish such information in respect of the
marketing of hogs as (the inspecting officer) may reasonably
require". This provision would enable the inspector to arrogate
to himself far more power than is enjoyed by a peace officer
and to destroy the inspected person's'basic right not to incriminate himself. A person who, in the maintenance of his basic
liberty, defied an order to furnish information would be liable
under section 4(1) of the Act to a fine not exceeding $500, to
imprisonment for a term of up to three months, or to both.
131. The Committee wishes to acknowledge the handsome
co-operation of the Department of Agriculture in removing the
objectionable features from so many regulations relating to
agricultural marketing. The Committee trusts that the safeguards thus afforded to primary producers will serve as an
example for similar subordinate legislation in the future, and
that the wide and unchallengeable powers of entry given to
various authorities in many sectors of the economy will not be
uncritically accepted simply because they have become
common.
T.-DISCRETIONARY ADMINISTRATIVE
DECISIONS, THE RULES OF NATURAL JUSTICE
AND A RIGHT OF APPEAL
132. Two issues which have been of concern to the Committee are the right of appeal from a decision taken under
delegated legislation, which decision is prejudicial to a subject,
and the conferring of discretions on Ministers, officers or
boards to take or not to take some action at their discretion.
These two matters, although theoretically separate, become
intermeshed and together raise also the effectiveness of section
28 of the Federal Court Act.-(41)
133. The Committee always looks closely at provisions
empowering a Minister, officer or Board to take a decision at
his or its discretion. Discretions are often conferred obliquely
by the use of the word "may" or such phrases as "to his
satisfaction" or "in his opinion". The Committee considers
that as a general rule subordinate legislation should set some
objective criteria governing the administrative decisions to be
taken and that where tests are set for eligibility or as prerequisites for some action to be taken, such tests should be cast in
objective and not in subjective terms. The objective test and
the setting of objective criteria will permit an aggrieved person
to take legal action where the tests or criteria have been
improperly applied. Where subjective tests are employed, and
phrases such as "where in his opinion such and such circumstances exist," virtually unchallengeable discretion is imported.
Short of being able to conclude that the officer has governed
the exercise of his discretion by totally extraneous considerations, a court cannot interfere, for to do so would be to
substitute its opinion for that of the officer.

352

SENATE DEBATES

134. The Committee is aware that the granting of subjective
discretionary powers in the regulations of Canada is common.
The Committee is also aware that some Departments of State
can make out a plausible case for many discretions or subjectively worded tests taken individually. Yet, the Committee is
convinced that what is really involved is a cast of mind and the
frequent occurrence of such provisions is not a good reason for
continuing and perpetuating their use. An answer from a
government department that the purposes of a particular set of
regulations would not be furthered by the substitution of an
objective for a subjective test is unacceptable.
135. In some instances, the Committee has been made
aware that the enabling legislation is itself replete with discretionary powers and subjectively worded tests. Such an enabling
act is the Department of Regional Economic Expansion Act.
The Committee believes that if discretions are to be granted
the enabling legislation is the proper vehicle. Subordinate
legislation should preclude the possibility of discriminatory
treatment of persons, and matters that are included in substantive legislation are not necessarily appropriate to subordinate
legislation.
136. It often happens that statutory instruments govern the
granting, suspension, and revocation of permits and licences,
sometimes by one official acting after receipt of a report from
another official. The Committee considers that, in general, any
person aggrieved by a refusal to grant a licence or permit, or
by a suspension, cancellation or revocation, should have a right
to be heard in objection, a right to be given reasons and a right
to be apprised of any adverse material in any report submitted
to the determining official. These safeguards have been considered as basic and essential in natural justice since the
Franks Committee Report, 1957,-(42) and have been given
expression in Ontario in the Statutory Powers Procedure
Act-(43) and the Judicial Review Procedure Act-(44).
Even in situations in which an appeal is provided for, or review
may be available under section 28 of the Federal Court Act, or
action under section 18 of the same Act is possible, the
Committee believes that subordinate legislation should provide
for the rights mentioned, as those aggrieved should not necessarily be forced to litigation. When they are, they should not
be disadvantaged by knowing nothing of the case against them.
137. The Committee is, in any event, far from clear as to the
situations in which an application will be entertained under
section 28 of the Federal Court Act for the review of any
decision to suspend, cancel or revoke or refuse a licence or
permit. Section 28 permits an application to review and set
aside a decision or order, "other than a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a
judicial or quasi-judicial basis . . . ". The meaning of this
exclusion is far from clear and the decisions on it do not
constitute a clear guide. The Committee cannot readily form a
coherent principle out of Howarth v. The National Parole
Board-(45) Lazarov v. Secretary of State-(46) and
unreported decisions to which it has been referred by Designated Instruments Officers. When the existence of a right to

February 3S11977

review under section 28 in any set of circumstances is uncertain, the Committee is all the more convinced that an
aggrieved person should not be forced to rely on it in the
absence of rights to be told the case against him, to be heard
and to be given reasons reserved to him in subordinate
legislation.
138. The effectiveness of action under section 28 is made
even more doubtful when the powers to grant, suspend, review,
revoke, etc. are given in discretionary and subjective terms.
Provisions so expressed as to allow an officer to act according
to his opinion or satisfaction of facts would seem, on the face
of it, to put the decision taken beyond challenge, because an
aggrieved person would, even after establishing that the officer
had a duty to act quasi-judicially and had failed to do so, still
have to abide by the officer's opinion when he decided the
issue again. The Committee believes that administrative decisions which can greatly affect the rights, liberties and livelihood of individuals ought not to be put beyond legal challenge
by the use of discretionary tests, and that the rules of natural
justice should be included in grants of power to take such
decisions, thus affording individuals initial safeguards and
ensuring a right to review under section 28 of the Federal
Court Act where the duty to act quasi-judicially, so created,
has been disobeyed.
U.-EXEMPTIONS FROM CIVIL LIABILITY
139. The Committee has encountered twelve regulations(47) which attempt to exempt the National Harbours Board
from all civil liability for the acts or omissions of itself, its
employees and its agents in certain circumstances which vary
from regulation to regulation. The Committee raised the question of whether these regulations were ultra vires section
14(î)(e) of the National Harbours Board Act. A lengthy and
reasoned reply bas been received on this point from counsel to
the National Harbours Board, which the Committee has under
advisement. Beyond the question of vires, the Committee
deplores attempts to exempt agencies by regulation from the
legal consequences of their acts or defaults. They are an undue
infringement of the rights and liberties of the citizen.
Although it was common, and even thought acceptable, some
decades ago to confer immunity of this nature upon statutory
bodies, it is now regarded as not in accordance with accepted
standards. The Committee notes that the Senate Committee
on Regulations and Ordinances of the Commonwealth of
Australia has, with success, taken a similar stand-(48)
against such exemption provisions.
V.-STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS MADE UNDER
THE INCOME TAX ACT
140. Regulations of great length and complexity are made
under the Income Tax Act. These have to date been given only
a cursory examination by the Committee which is sensible of
the fact that a thorough study would pre-empt its time and
energies and those of its counsel. Aware that those affected by
the Income Tax Act are often well organized and well repre-

in other statutory instruments should be included within the
definition of a statutory instrument and be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. This inclusion should extend to Guidelines, Directives, etc. which constitute instructions to staff

non-staff members or where the breach of the rules can lead
to disciplinary action against the staff member committing
the breach.
10. Where any statutory instrument is to come into force
before registration and publication, the reasons therefor
should be provided to the Standing Joint Committee on
Regulations and Other Statutory Instruments.
I1. Should the distinction between "regulations" and "other
statutory instruments" be retained, the words "regulationmaking authority" in the Statutory Instruments Act should
be re-defined to make clear that in respect of regulations
made by the Governor in Council by Order in Council they
mean the Department, Ministry or other body which recommends the draft Order to the Governor in Council.
12. Section 32 of the Statutory Instruments Act should be
amended to require the publication of the regulations that
have been registered under that section.
F. MATTERS RELATING TO THE FORM OF STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
(Paragraphs 56-69)
1. Both the enabling authority for subordinate legislation
and other documents or statutory instruments referred to
within the body of a statutory instrument should be clearly
and adequately identified with the actual place of publication being disclosed.
2. The references to intermediate enabling authority, not
being statutes, and to all instruments mentioned within a
statutory instrument, should be given by a footnote showing
the place and date of publication, and registration number if
one exists. The giving of footnote references should not be
confined to instruments the details of whose registration and
publication can not be traced through Part Il of the Canada
Gazette.
3. When a statutory enabling power has been amended since
the last Revision of the Statutes of Canada, the preamble to
a statutory instrument made in reliance on that power
should recite not only the relevant section number or numbers and the name of the Act but also the reference to any
amending statute which has amended the enabling power.
4. The footnotes to an amending statutory instrument should
disclose all the prior amendments relevant to the provision
or provisions of the statutory instrument now to be
amended.
5. Statutory instruments should be accompanied by
Explanatory Notes. This is especially to be desired in the
case of amending statutory instruments. An Explanatory
Note should describe the subject matter dealt with in such a
way as to indicate the point of the statutory instrument in a
purely informative way without entering into justification,
argumentation or construction of the law.

G. THE WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION FROM
THE COMMITTEE
(Paragraphs 70-80)
Those Departments of State and Authorities which make,
or propose to the Governor in Council the making of,
subordinate legislation should explain to the Committee, if
called upon, how it is that a particular piece of subordinate
legislation does not infringe one or more of the criteria for
scrutiny. An explanation should include legal reasons where
such are called for as where the Committee has questioned
the vires of a statutory instrument, the interpretation of
some apparently obscure or ambiguous provision, or the
status of a document as being or not being a statutory
instrument.
H. SUB-DELEGATION OF RULE-MAKING POWER
(Paragraphs 81-84)
If it is desired or thought necessary to give to a delegate
of Parliament power to sub-delegate rule-making power, the
power should and must be conferred expressly by the enabling statute.
I. THE LANGUAGE OF DELEGATION
(Paragraphs 85-95)
1. The precise limits of subordinate law-making power
should always be defined in clear language in the enabling
statute.
2. Enabling powers cast in terms of subject matter, and
commonly introduced by the word "respecting" should not
be included in enabling statutes whilstever the view is held
by the Crown that such powers permit both sub-delegation
of rule-making power and a power of dispensation in favour
of individuals.
3. No enabling power should confer upon Parliament's
delegate the authority to determine or to declare the scope
of his own delegated power or the true intention of the
enabling statute.
J. THE PRETENDED POWER OF DISPENSING WITH
REGULATIONS IN FAVOUR OF INDIVIDUALS
(Paragraphs 96-103)
The pretended power of dispensing with the provisions of
subordinate legislation in favour of individuals under colour
of enacting further subordinate legislation, being illegal
unless expressly authorized by the enabling statute, should
be abandoned forthwith.
K. ENABLING POWERS IN APPROPRIATION ACTS
(Paragraphs 104-113)
1. The practice of using Votes, whether substantive or dollar
Votes, and Items in the Estimates as vehicles for the conferring of enabling powers should come to an end. Subordinate
legislation should be made under enabling authority contained in ordinary statutes.
2. Even if the practice is not terminated immediately, the
following particular abuses should stop, viz:

Feruarv 3. 1977E

SENATE DEBATES

(a) the conferring of subordinate law-making power in
Votes and Items in terms which, in the view of the Crown,
excludes the subordinate legislation, when made, from the
definition of a "statutory instrument", and thus from
Parliamentary scrutiny;
(b) the conferring of subordinate law-making power by use
of the words "subject to terms and conditions approved by
the Governor in Council";
(c) the extension and amplification of the purposes of old
votes by a series of subsequent Votes.
L. SCRUTINY OF ENABLING POWERS
(Paragraph 114)
Enabling clauses in Bills should be scrutinized while the
Bills are before Parliament by the appropriate Standing
Committees or by the Standing Joint Committee on Regulations and Other Statutory Instruments.
M. THE TEXT OF INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO
AMENDMENT
(Paragraphs 115-118)
Statutory instruments that have been much amended
should be revoked and remade in complete form. An instrument in respect of which a process of constant amendment is
forseeable should be revoked and remade in consolidated
form at regular intervals, perhaps annually.
P. IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS BY STATUTORY INSTRUMENT-REMISSION ORDERS UNDER SECTION 17 OF THE
FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT
(Paragraphs 123-125)
Remission Orders made pursuant to section 17 of the
Financial Administration Act should be regarded as subordinate legislation and as subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.
The exclusion of any class of such Orders from scrutiny
should occur only if expressly provided for in the Statutory
Instruments Act.
S. POWERS OF OFFICERS OF AGRICULTURAL
AGENCIES
(Paragraphs 128-131)
1. Rights of entry, powers of inspection and of seizure and
the power to demand or take information should be confined
exactly within the limits provided for in enabling legislation.
2. The wide and unchallengeable powers of entry now being
given in enabling Acts should not be uncritically accepted
simply because they have become common.

should be cast in objective and not in subjective terms.
Tests, prerequisites or criteria dependent upon the formation
of opinions or the satisfaction of individuals should be
avoided.
3. The granting of discretionary powers is properly the
subject of a statute and not of subordinate law.
4. Any person aggrieved by a refusal to grant a licence or
permit, or by a suspension, cancellation or revocation of a
licence or permit, pursuant to subordinate legislation, should
be accorded in the subordinate legislation itself a right to be
heard in objection, a right to be given reasons and a right to
be apprised of any adverse material in any report submitted
to the determining official. These rights should be accorded
even where a right of appeal might exist, for the subject
should not be forced unnecessarily to litigation, and their
presence will assist in guaranteeing jurisdiction in the Federal Court under section 28 of the Federal Court Act.
U. EXEMPTIONS FROM CIVIL LIABILITY
(Paragraph 139)
Subordinate legislation should not attempt to exempt
governmental agencies from the legal consequences of their
acts or defaults or of those of their employees in either tort
or contract.
V. STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS MADE UNDER THE
INCOME TAX ACT
(Paragraphs 140-141)
The status of the National Revenue Department's Interpretation Bulletins and Information Circulars, and their
equivalents in other Departments of State and agencies,
must be carefully examined when the definition of a statutory instrument is amended.
W. AFFIRMATION AND DISALLOWANCE OF STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS BY THE HOUSES OF
PARLIAMENT
(Paragraph 142)
1. Greater use should be made of affirmative and negative
resolution procedures in the drafting of Bills.
2. A complete code governing both affirmative and negative
resolutions should be adopted either by the amendment of
section 28A of the Interpretation Act or by the adoption by
the two Houses of Standing Orders (preferably identical)
setting out in detail the procedures to be followed in the two
Houses.

T. DISCRETIONARY ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,
THE RULES OF NATURAL JUSTICE AND A RIGHT
OF APPEAL
(Paragraphs 132-138)
1. As a general rule, subordinate legislation should set
objective criteria governing the taking of decisions provided
for in that legislation.
2. Where tests are set for eligibility or as prerequisites to the
taking of some action under subordinate legislation, the tests

APPENDIX I-DETAILED CONSIDERATION OF THE
PRESENT DEFINITION OF A STATUTORY
INSTRUMENT
I
In order to put the matter in a perspective which is both
rational and historical, even if not one entirely in pari materia
(in analogous cases), it is as weil to look at the law before
January 1, 1972 when the Statutory Instruments Act came

SENATE DEBATES
into force, together with proposals for change, as also at the
definition of a statutory instrument under the United Kingdom
legislation, a definition which, so it appears, has not been
without its effect locally.
The old Regulations Act, R.S.C. 1952 C. 235, for all the
criticism levelled at it by the MacGuigan Committee-(49)
had at least the virtue of containing a fairly simple, even if not
a broadly encompassing, definition of "regulation", the then
term of art, the phrase "statutory instrument" being nowhere
used. A "regulation", so the Act ran, meant:
"a rule, order, regulation or by-law or proclamation,
(i) made, in the exercise of a legislative power conferred
by or under an Act of Parliament, by the Governor in
Council, the Treasury Board, a Minister of the Crown, or
a board, commission, corporation or other body or person
that is an agent or servant of Her Majesty in right of
Canada; or
(ii) for the contravention of which" (even if not made in
the exercise of a legislative power by any of the designated persons or bodies) "a penalty or fine or imprisonment is prescribed by or under an Act of Parliament."
Four exceptions were specified, two of which have been continued in the present Statutory Instruments Act as exceptions
to the definition of a statutory instrument (section 2(l)(d)(iii)
and (vi). The third exception, relating to the status of rules of
courts, has been continued in modified form, and the fourth"an order or decision of a judicial tribunal"-has been included within the third.
The MacGuigan Committee noted the potential restrictiveness of the test "made, in the exercise of a legislative power",
as also the fact that in its view prerogative orders of a
legislative character should be classified as delegated legislation in the negative sense that Parliament, by not abolishing
the Prerogative, had permitted the making of law under it.
Whatever may be thought of so Whiggish a view of the
Prerogative, section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Statutory Instruments
Act does at least make one thing clear, namely, that any rule,
etc. made by virtue of the Prerogative by the Governor in
Council is a statutory instrument.
Continuing in force during the era of the old Regulations
Act (which ceased to have effect on December 31, 1971), and
to the present day is the definition of "regulation" contained in
the Interpretation Act. That Act defines an enactment as
"an Act or regulation or any portion of an Act or
regulation."
and a regulation as including
"an order, regulation, order-in-council, order prescribing
regulations, rule, rule of court, form, tariff of costs or fees,
letters patent, commission, warrant, proclamation, by-law,
resolution or other instrument issued, made or established
(a) in the execution of a power conferred by or under the
authority of an Act, or
(b) by or under the authority of the Governor in
Council."

February 3, 1977

While the catalogue of types of instrument is not identical with
the opening words of section 2(1)(d)(i) of the Statutory
Instruments Act, it is substantially similar and paragraphs (a)
and (b) above are identical with section 2(l)(d)(i) and section
2(l)(d)(ii) with the limiting words excluded. The genesis of
the definition of statutory instrument in the definition of
"regulation" adopted in the Interpretation Act in 1967-1968
C. 7 is readily apparent. The examination of this definition
also confirms the view that all the words in section 2(1)(d)(i)
of the Statutory Instruments Act following "in the execution
of a power conferred by or under the authority of an Act of
Parliament" constitute a single limitation, a point whose significance will become apparent infra.
The overall picture then is this:
(a) For the purposes of the Interpretation Act there is a
definition of "regulation" which is considerably wider than
that of "statutory instrument" in the Statutory Instruments
Act. This wide definition is of importance in section 6 and 7
of the Interpretation Act concerning commencement, repeal
and the making of regulations before an Act comes into
force. Since the word "enactment" includes "regulation" the
wide definition is also of importance in every provision of
the Interpretation Act which refers to "enactment".
(b) There is a definition of "statutory instrument" in section
2(l)(d)(i) of the Statutory Instruments Act which is of
importance primarily in delimiting the scope of parliamentary scrutiny, since the Act does not lay down any regime
governing the registration and publication of statutory
instruments as such. There are the further points that (i) a
statutory instrument that is not published in the Canada
Gazette may, perhaps, not be judicially noticed (section 23)
and (ii) the right of public access under section 24 extends
only to statutory instruments as defined in the Statutory
Instruments Act. Only some statutory instruments must be
registered. Vide section 6.
(c) There is a species of statutory instrument known as a
regulation, as defined by the Statutory Instruments Act, to
which special rules as to registration and publication attach.
The overall result can best be shown by the use of the
diagrams at the end of this Appendix
Turning to the United Kingdom legislation one finds that
there is but one class of documents, that of "statutory instruments". There is no sub-class of "regulation" to which any
special rules apply. However, the class statutory instrument is
not as wide as the class regulation proposed by the MacGuigan
Committee for adoption in Canada. The United Kingdom
legislation also distinguishes between Acts passed before and
those passed after the commencement of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1946 (lst January 1948). In the case of the latter a
statutory instrument is defined in this wise:
"Where ... power to make, confirm or approve orders,
rules, regulations or other subordinate legislation is conferred on His Majesty in Council or on any Minister of the
Crown, then if the power is expressed

SENATE DEBATES

February 3, 1977

(a) in the case of a power conferred on His Majesty, to be
exercisable by Order in Council:
(b) in the case of a power conferred on a Minister of the
Crown to be exercisable by statutory instrument;
any document by which that power is exercised shall be
known as a 'statutory instrument' and the provisions of this
Act shall apply thereto accordingly."
An example of the type of legislative drafting envisaged in the
above provision is found in section 8(1) of the Statutory
Instruments Act itself which reads:
"8(1) The Treasury may, with the concurrence of the
Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons, by statutory instrument, make regulations for the
purposes of this Act, and such regulations . . . "
It will be seen that the question of whether a document is, or is
not a statutory instrument, depends on the express style of
making declared by Parliament; that is to say, whether by
Order in Council or by statutory instrument, and not upon the
use of a formula "make regulations", "make orders", "make
rules", etc. It can be seen, too, that if the Minister proceeds by
statutory instrument the document he makes ("any document") is a statutory instrument even if, in the case, for
example, of section 8(1) of the $tatutory Instruments Act the
section were to read: "may .. . by statutory instrument pre-

scribe .. .". This point may be 'strimmarized by saying that a
document made in the exercise of a power conferred by an Act
of Parliament is a statutory instrument if it is made by a
Minister and the Act provides that the power is exercisable by
statutory instrument, or if it is made by Her Majesty and is an
Order in Council.
As to enabling Acts passed before the commencement of the
Statutory Instruments Act, whether or not delegated legislation made under them are statutory instruments depends upon
whether a power to make a statutory rule within the meaning
of the Rules Publication Act 1893 was conferred on the body
making the legislation. If such power had been conferred any
document by which it is exercised is a statutory instrument,
unless otherwise expressly provided in the Statutory Instruments Regulations. Under the Rules Publication Act statutory
rules means rules, regulations or bye-laws made under an Act
of Parliament by, amongst others, Her Majesty in Council, the
judicial Committee, the Treasury, the Lord Chancellor of
Great Britain, or the Lord Lieutenant or Lord Chancellor of
Ireland, or a Secretary of State, the Admiralty, the Board of
Trade, the Local Government Board for England or Ireland,
the Chief Secretary for Ireland, or any other Government
Department.
II
The Committee's unsuccessful attempts to grapple with the
definition of a statutory instrument led it to ask the Department of Justice for its view of its meaning. A reply dated June
13, 1975, was received from Mr. H. McIntosh, Q.C., Director,
Legal Services, Privy Council Office, in the following terms:

Mr. Ross (Principal Legal Adviser to the Privy Council
Office) has referred to me your letter of May 21st, informing him that it was felt that the work of the Committee
would be greatly helped if he could put in writing the
interpretation the Privy Council Office gives to a "statutory
instrument" as defined in the Statutory Instruments Act.
As I read the proceedings of the Committee, the main
difficulty with the definition and the one on which it would
like our views is as to the meaning of the words "by or under
which such instrument is expressly authorized to be issued,
made or established" in subparagraph (i). It is our reading
of these words that in order for an instrument to be a
statutory instrument, the enactment pursuant to which the
instrument is made must expressly authorize its issuance,
making or establishment. For example, a provision of an Act
may provide that the Governor in Council may by order
exempt persons from the application of the Act. In our view,
the resulting order would be a statutory instrument because
it would be an order made in the exercise of a power
conferred by or under an Act of Parliament "under which
such instrument (i.e., the order) is expressly authorized to
be made". If the enactment had provided the Governor in
Council may exempt persons from the application of the
Act, then the resulting instrument of exemption would not,
in our view, be a statutory instrument because no instrument
is expressly authorized to be issued, made or established.
The distinction is perhaps a fine one but it is, I suggest, one
borne out by the words of the Act. We can think of no other
construction to give to these words and, as you know, there
is a presumption in the construction of statutes that Parliament intends meaning to be given to all words in a statute.
In the case of the Nova Scotia Egg Order, the Commodity Board is authorized to make orders fixing, imposing and
collecting levies and charges from persons in Nova Scotia
who are engaged in the marketing of eggs. An order made
by the Commodity Board would therefore, for the reasons
mentioned above, be a statutory instrument as that term is
defined in the Act. It was also our view that the order being
made in the exercise of a legislative power conferred by the
Act would be a regulation as that term is defined in the
Statutory Instruments Act.
I hope that this explanation will be of assistance to you
and to members of the Committee and if I can be of any
further assistance in this regard, please let me know.
Yours truly,
H. McIntosh,
Director, Legal Services.
Section 2(l)(d)(i), which lies at the root of the problem
reads:
"in the execution of a power conferred by or under an Act of
Parliament, by or under which such instrument is expressly
authorized to be issued, made or established otherwise than
by the conferring on any person or body of powers or
functions in relation-to a matter to which such instrument
relates;"

SENATE DEBATES

In his letter of 13th June 1975, Mr. Mclntosh deals with the
words "...

by or under which such instrument is expressly

authorized to be issued, made or established .. . ". The result
of the view taken as to the meaning of those words can be seen
in both the second and third paragraph of his letter and is
illustrated further by examples of regulations, other statutory
instruments and documents not being statutory instruments
furnished for the Committee's meetings of 3rd, 10th and 17th
July 1975 and now reproduced in Issues 34, 35 and 36 of the
Committee's Proceedings.
Mr. Mclntosh subsequently
appeared before the Committee on 30th October 1975 and as a
result it became clear that the Crown's position on the interpretation of section 2(1)(d)(i) was to the following effect,
namely:
(i) That an instrument is not expressly authorized to be
issued, made or established unless it is authorized to be
issued, made or established under the name or title of a
class of instruments of which the particular instrument is
one, i.e., an instrument is not a statutory instrument
unless issued, made or established under an enabling
power containing a magic formula consisting of the preposition "by" immediately followed by an abstract noun
which is the name of a class of instruments;
(ii) That an instrument issued, made or established in the
execution of a magic formula will not be a statutory
instrument, notwithstanding the magic formula, if its
effect is to confer power on another person or body to do
some further act or to make rules (On 30th October Mr.
Mclntosh was led to concede that this exclusion did not
accord with the Privy Council Office's practice of regarding as statutory instruments Orders, issued by the Governor in Council under section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act, which confer on Marketing Boards
powers of regulation and of imposition of levies and
charges. Subsequently, in conversation with the Committee's counsel, Mr. Mclntosh adhered to his interpretation
and opined that the Privy Council Office had erred in
regarding such Orders as statutory instruments. That they
would thereby be removed from scrutiny was not regarded
as of great consequence since they were formal documents. However, the Committee can not see that any
good can be regarded as coming from removing documents from scrutiny. And it would say that the scrutiny of
the regulations actually made by the Marketing Boards in
the execution of the powers given to them by the Orders
in question would be made impossible in terms of criteria
1,4, 6 and 11 unless the Orders are treated as regulations
or as documents which should in the public interest be
published in the Gazette under an SI number.);
(iii) That a document is not an instrument within the
opening words of section 2(1)(d) unless
(a) it is a document referred to in the magic formula in
the particular enabling power in question; and
(b) it is one of the types of documents listed in the
opening words of section 2(1)(d) or is an "other instrument", that phrase being interpreted by the eiusdem

February 3, 1977

generis rule. No common characteristic has been specified and without it the eiusdem generis rule cannot be
applied.
The following points can be made about the interpretation
adopted by the Privy Council Office.
1. The result is absurd and produces quite arbitrary results
as between documents having precisely the same legal effect
and made under the same enabling statute, for example,
Levies Orders made under the Agricultural Products Marketing Act, section 2(2). Levies Orders will be either regulations or documents not being statutory instruments at all
depending on whether or not the intermediate enabling
authority (e.g. a Milk Order) reads ".. . may by order fix,
impose and collect . . . " or ". . . may fix, impose and collect

. .. ". Any interpretation which produces so absurd a result,
especially under a piece of legislation, such as the Statutory
Instruments Act, designed to enact a grand plan for the
registration and scrutiny of statutory instruments, can only
be accepted if it stands forth clearly from the very language
of the Act. Such is certainly not the case with section
2 (1 )(d) (i).
2. It can be accounted a strained interpretation as can be
seen by testing it in the context of section 17 of the
Financial Administration Act, which has become very familiar to the Committee. Section 17 empowers the Governor in
Council to remit a tax in these words:
"The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the
Treasury Board, whenever he considers it in the public
interest, may remit any tax, fee or penalty."
Section 17 does not read: "The Governor in Council ...
may by order remit ... ". Hence, in the Privy Council
Office's view Remission Orders under section 17 cannot be
statutory instruments. Yet, the Governor in Council can
only act lawfully through the means permitted by the constitution or by statute, and that means is the Order in Council.
If then an Order in Council is made and issued exempting X
from some tax, how can it be said that the Order was not
expressly authorized to be made and issued? The Committee
notes that some Remission Orders, but by no means all, are
published in the Canada Gazette Part Il as a matter of
public interest.
3. If the intention of Parliament had been that suggested by
the Legal Advisers to the Privy Council Office one would
have expected to find some clear and additional words, or a
definition of statutory instrument couched in terms which
defined it in terms of the particular type of instrument to be
made, established or issued, e.g.:
"...

by or under which such instrument is by that name

expressly authorized to be issued, made or established."
OR
...

by or under which such instrument is expressed to be

issued, made or established in that manner and form . . . "
4. It may be thought that what Parliament was intending to
do was to introduce in a compendious and more general
form of words a test along the lines of the United Kingdom

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

test for post 1948 statutory instruments. Indeed, this view
bas been exprcssed. But such a view of Parliament's intention can not be sustained on the text of section 2(i)(d) of
the Statutory Instruments Act. The British legisiation proceeds in an altogether different manner and deals primarily
not witb documents as does our Act ("any rule, order,
regulation, ordinance," etc. etc.) but with power to make
subordinate legislation and the manner of the exercise of
that power. Hence, it is logical for that legislation to speak
of a power bcing autborized to be exerciscd by Order in
Council or by statutory instrument. If the power is to be
exercised by statutory instrument, then no matter what titie
is given to a document made in the exercise of that power, it
will be a statutory instrument. In other words for enabling
legislation after 1948 Parliament settles definitional issues
in advance by conferring a power to make subordinate
legisiation to be exercised by statutory instrument (the usual
course) or by deliberately withholding that manner of
making subordinate' legislation by omitting the words "by
statutory instrument" from the legislation.
Our legisiation, bcing cast in entirely different terms, and
starting not from the manner in which a power to make
subordinate legisiation is to be exercised but rather froni a
différent point altogether-an apparently ail encompassing
description of the possible documents by which subordinate
legisiation migbt be made--cannot be interpreted by analogy with the United Kingdom Act.
Any such anaiogy is faulty on the furthcr ground that
whcreas the United Kingdom legisiation is framcd in terms
of an advance legisiative determination that a power is to be
exercised by statutory instrument, the very thing sougbt to
be defincd, the Privy Council Office definition is based on
the view that our legisiation is framcd on a legislative
determination that a power is to bcecxercised by a document
by title, be it any titie at aIl, which is but one example of
what is being sought to be dcfined.
The important point to grasp, bowever, is that the definitions in the United Kingdom Act and in the Canadian
Statutory Instruments Act are not at ail comparable, for the
former begins with a description of the manner in whicb
Parliament bas ordained that power be excrcised whereas
the latter proceeds by describing documents as members of
the class "statutory instruments".
5. The Privy Council Office definition leaves altogether out
of account the rcmainîng words of section 2(l)(d)(i):
',... otherwise than by tbe conferring on any person or
body of powers or functions in relation to a matter to
wbich such instrument relates."
It may wcll be that faced witb such a concatenation of
words, those in autbority bave concluded that the phrase as
such is mcaningless and bave, therefore, decided to ignore it.
However, as Mr. Mclntosh bimself points out, tbere is a
presumption or canon of interpretation tbat Parliament does
not act in vain and some meaning must be given to these
vexed words.

Clauses introduced by the word "otherwise" are usually
limiting or excluding clauses, an example of which clearly
appears in section 2(1)(d)(ii)
any rule, order, etc. issued, made or established
....
(ii) by or under the autbority of the Governor in
Council otbcrwise than in the execution of a power
conferred by or under an Act of Parliament."
The 'otherwise" clause here excludes from the totality of
documents issued, made or established by the Governor in
Council aIl those issued, made or estahlished pursuant to
statutes. Since the Governor in Council may act only pursuant to statute or the common law, wbicb is to say the Royal
prerogative, the subtraction leaves ail documents issued,
made or established pursuant to the Prerogative by the
Governor in Council. (Any that may lawfully be issued,
made or established by tbe Crown atone are flot statutory
instruments.) Whether or not it would have been simpler
and more direct to have drafted section 2(i)(d)(ii) in terms
of
"by or under the authority of the Governor in Council in
exercise of the Royal Prerogative"
the use of the "otberwise" clause here does demonstrate that
section 2(l)(d)(i) relates to the class "documents issued,
made or established pursuant to statute", a class fFqni which
some documents are to be excluded in terms of the "otherwise" clause. Just wbat documents are to be excluded? On
the Privy Council Office interpretation the answer would be
ail documents issued, made or established pursuant to statutc. That is to say,. section 2(i)(d)(i) would effectively
produce a result of zero. This conclusion is reached in the
following manner:
(a) The Privy Council Office view of the opening words of
section 2(i)(d)(i) (those immediately preceding the "otherwise" clause) has already excluded ail documents
issued, made or established under powers which do not
name the type of document to be issued, made or established. That is, the class has already been confined to
instruments issued, made or established under a specific
title or namne, c.g. "by order", "make regulations", "by
rule", "by warrant", "by by-law" and so on.
(b) Now that class is to be cut down furthcr by the
"1otberwise" clause. Consider again a Levies Order made
under an enabling Order made pursuant to section 2(2) of
the Agricultural Products Marketing Act, which Levies
may by Order, fix, impose and
Order does read .....
coliect . . . ". This would bc a statutory instrument in the
Privy Council Office's view. But is not the Milk Board, as
well as being a body issuing "Orders", also a body on
whicb have been conferred powers or funictions in relation
to milk levies-their amount, manner of collection, etclevies whicb constitute matters to whicb the orders relate?
The answer must bc in the affirmative with the result that
even Orders made pursuant to the power "by Order, fix,
impose and coliect levies", will not be statutory
instruments.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
This reductio ad absurdum demonstrates first, that the
"otherwise" clause in section 2(l)(d)(i) cannot be ignored,
and, secondly, that once it is brought into operation its
effect in combination with the interpretation given by the
Privy Council Office to the preceding words of section
2(l)(d)(i) is to vacate altogether the class of statutory
instruments made pursuant to statute. In other words, one
would exclude first all those instruments not made pursuant
to powers which name the title of the document and,
secondly, all those which are made by a body on which has
been conferred powers or functions in relation to the subject
matter of the instrument.
Although it was doubted supra, Mr. Mclntosh's view could
possibly be supportable if the "otherwise" clause were not
there. However, it is there on the stairs and all the wishing
in the world will not remove it.
6. The use of the eiusdem generis rule in interpreting the
words "otherwise instrument" at the close of the catalogue
which opens section 2(1) is totally unsatisfactory. No
common characteristic has been put forward. The only
possible meaning to give to "other document" is any document issued pursuant to statutory or prerogative authority in
which is exercised a subordinate law making function. The
words cannot be construed in any other light, since if they
are interpreted eiusdem generis with the preceding catalogue of documents the only common feature of all the
documents listed is that they habitually are the means of
exercising a subordinate law making power. Similarly, if the
words "other instrument" are read noscitur a sociis with the
words that precede them, an identical conclusion flows.
III
The Committee takes the view that while the wording of
section 2(1)(d)(i) of the Statutory Instruments Act is obscure,
the Privy Council Office's interpretation of it is quixotic in
operation and subversive of the Committee's functions and is
an unwarranted attempt so narrowly to confine the Committee's jurisdiction as to hamstring it. Unlike the President of the
Privy Council-(50), the Committee does not think that it is
to be expected that there should be difficulty in defining a
statutory instrument.
The crux of the matter lies in the words of section 2(1 )(d)(i)
which read
". . . , by or under which (power) such instrument is expressly authorized to be issued, made or established otherwise
than by the conferring on any person or body of powers or
functions in relation to a matter to which such instrument
relates . . . "

Because of the absurd results which flow from splitting this
phrase into two tests, producing, as was shewn in 11(5) supra, a
class of zero, it must follow that, notwithstanding the normal
use of an "otherwise" clause as exemplified in section
2(1)(d)(ii) as an independent limiting clause, in this one
instance at least, the "otherwise" clause cannot stand

February 3, 1977
Februarv 3. 1977

independently of the words which precede it and that the
entire phrase must be read as a single test or description of the
type of statutory power which, if exercised to make an instrument, will render that instrument a "statutory instrument". In
other words, not all instruments made in pursuance of a
statutory power are statutory instruments. Perhaps the word
"document" should be used as being more neutral than
"instrument" and less perplexing. The mysterious words of
section 2(1)(d)(i) are consequently, intended to cut down the
class of documents (i.e. the class of rules, orders, regulations,
ordinances, directions, tariffs of costs of fees, letters patent,
commissions, warrants, proclamations, by-laws, resolutions or
other instruments) which can be statutory instruments to form
a new class which may be further limited and cut down by the
terms of section 2(l)(d)(iii)-(vi).
What documents then are excluded by these mysterious
words? This question should more properly be put: What
documents made, etc. in pursuance of which statutory powers
are excluded? It cannot be that what was sought to be
excluded were documents of an administrative or executive,
that is to say, a non-legislative character, for the distinction
between documents made in the exercise of a legislative power
and those not is the crux of the distinction between a statutory
instrument and the species, regulations, a distinction so clearly
drawn in section 2(l)(d)(i) of the Act. Similarly, executive
acts of the Governor in Council pursuant to the Prerogative
are statutory instruments by force of sec. 2(l)(d)(ii) of the
Act. Nor can it be that the exclusion extends to working
papers, or the giving of advice in any written forms, for these
are expressly excluded from the definition by sec. 2(l)(d)(v).
The conclusion must be that the exclusion in sec. 2(l)(d)(i)
relates to documents made pursuant to some part of the
powers conferred by statute to make non-legislative type documents. It cannot relate, as has been pointed out, to all documents containing non-legislative matter, but it does not follow
from that conclusion that all documents made pursuant to
statute but not in the exercise of a legislative power are
statutory instruments. That is to say, all statutory instruments
of a legislative character are regulations but not all instruments of a non-legislative character need be accounted statutory instruments.
Instruments or documents made pursuant to statute but of a
non-legislative character take many forms and include everything from permits to sell postage stamps issued under the Post
Office Act and Regulations to forms of contract drawn up by
the Department of Supply and Services. Obviously, it cannot
have been within the contemplation or intention of Parliament
that such administrative documents be statutory instruments
and subject to scrutiny. Such instruments, even if expressly
authorized to be issued ("the Minister may grant permits")
are clearly instruments relating to a matter in respect of which
powers or functions have been conferred on a person or body.
Consider also the statutory provisions by which Departments of State or Ministries are established. Of course,
Departments can be set up under the Prerogative but the

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

legislative course is now followed. The statutory provisions are
contained in individual statutes or in the Government Organization Act R.S.C. 2nd Suppl. C. 14. They proceed by legislating that there shall be a Department or Ministry of X over
which the Minister of X shall preside. The powers and functions of the Minister are then set forth in compendious form.
Consider:
External Affairs Act, section 4
"The Minister, as head of the Department, bas the conduct of ail officiai communications between the Government
of Canada and the government of any other country in
connection with the external affairs of Canada, and is
charged with such other duties as may be assigned to the
Department by order of the Governor in Council in relation
to such external affairs, or to the conduct and management
of international negotiations so far as they may appertain to
the Government of Canada."
and Government Organization Act, sections 5 and 6
"5. The duties, powers and functions of the Minister of
the Environment extend to and include ail matters over
which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction, not by law
assigned to any other department, branch or agency of the
Government of Canada, relating to
(a) sea coast and inland fisheries;
(b) renewable resources, including
(i) the forest resources of Canada,
(ii) migratory birds, and
iii) other non-domestic flora and fauna;
(c) water;
(d) meteorology;
(e) the protection and enhancement of the quality of the
natural environment, including water, air and soit quality;
(f) technical surveys within the meaning of the Resources
and Technical Surveys Act relating to any matter described
in paragraphs (a) to (e); and
(g) notwithstanding paragraph 5(f) of the Department of
National Health and Welfare Act, the enforcement of any
rules or regulations made by the International Joint Commission, promulgated pursuant to the treaty between the
United States of America and His Majesty, King Edward
VII, relating to boundary waters and questions arising between the United States and Canada, so far as they relate to
pollution control.
"6. The Minister of the Environment, in exercising his
powers and carrying out his duties and functions under
section 5, shall
(a) initiate, recommend and undertake programs, and coordinate programs of the Government of Canada, that are
designed to promote the establishment or adoption of objectives or standards relating to environmental quality, or to
control pollution; and
(b) promote and encourage the institution of practices and
conduct leading to the better protection and enhancement of
environmental quality, and cooperate with provincial gov-

ernments or agencies thereof, or any bodies, organizations or
persons, in any programs having similar objects."
If some limitation did not appear in sec. 2(1)(d)(i) every
document signed by or issued under the authority of the
Ministers as to the operation and management of the Departments of External Affairs and the Environment respectively,
would be statutory instruments a result which follows from
their powers being conferred by statute, and not by the exercise of the Prerogative. Similarly, "officiai communications
between the Government of Canada and any other country
. . . " if in writing would be statutory instruments if sec.
2(l)(d)(i) read simply ". . . or other instrument issued, made

or established (i) in the execution of a power conferred by or
under an Act of Parliament". And on the Privy Council
Office's interpretation of the limiting words in sec. 2(1)(d)(i)
such "officiai communications" would still seem to be statutory instruments because the Minister has the power to conduct ail "officiai communications" (including those in writing)
by name pursuant to section 4 of the External Affairs Act.
(Written officiai communications may not, however, be
regarded as an "instrument".)
Thus, it would appear that the limiting words of sec.
2(1)(d)(i) of the Statutory Instruments Act must relate to the
mode of administration of a Department or regulation making
authority, to the documents which relate to the manner of
proceeding and to the result of proceeding, to everything from
an instruction as to feeding the departmental cat to the actual
permit (document) issued to an applicant to empower him to
become a supplicant for some further governmental boon.
The foregoing analysis is meant as simply as is possible to
show first, that the Privy Council Office interpretation of
section 2(l)(d)(i) is completely unsatisfactory from the point
of view of parliamentary scrutiny and, secondly, that another
interpretation is possible of the admittedly obscure text of
section 2(1)(d)(i). That other interpretation is simply that the
limiting words, comprising one test and not two, exclude
documents of an administrative kind, for example, organizational memoranda within Departments, and documents that
are the end result of the administrative process such as permits, and administrative decisions taken in respect of individuai cases, ail of which may be open to review in the courts in
appropriate circumstances.
To summarize the Committee's position:
1. It considers that section 2(1)(d)(i) of the Statutory Instruments Act is not as narrowly confined in its application to
documents issued pursuant to statutory authority as the opinion of the Department of Justice would have it. In particular,
it considers that section 2(1)(d)(i) does not exclude instruments made under statutory grants of subordinate law making
power which do not contain a magic formula such as "by
order", "by regulations", "by tariff", etc. That is to say, it
does include instruments made under statutory powers which
authorize their issuing, making or establishment whether by
proper title or in general terms by conferring subordinate law

SENATE DEBATES

making power without specifying the name of the document in
which that exercise of subordinate law making power is to be
embodied. Thus section 2(l)(d)(i) includes Remission Orders
made pursuant to section 17 of the Financial Administration
Act and instruments issued under powers which authorize the
prescribing of terms and conditions. What is important is what
is issued, made or established and whether it is issued, made or
established pursuant to statutory authority, not whether it is
by specific title ordered or authorized to be issued, etc.
2. By "other instrument" the Committee understands any
document issued pursuant to statutory authority in which is
exercised a subordinate law making function.
3. Section 2(1)(d)(i) when read together as a piece does
exclude from the definition of a statutory instrument those
Departmental Guidelines or Instructions or Manuals which are
not made in the execution of, or pursuant to, any express
statutory authority in that behalf, but under the general
statutory power conferred on a Minister of the Crown under a
particular statute, or the Government Organization Act, to
have the administration of a Department of State, and which
do not contain substantive rules (not already included in some
other statutory instrument) which may affect the subject. The
Committee is also of the view that many such Guidelines,
Manuals, or Instructions are likely in any particular case, to be
excluded from the definition of a statutory instrument by the
terms of section 2(l)(d)(v) (second branch) as documents
"whose contents are limited to advice or information intended
only for use or assistance in the making of a decision . . . ".
Whether or not they are excluded on this ground also would
vary from case to case as the document in question did or did
not contain more than advice or information and as the effect
of ignoring its terms would or would not lead to disciplinary
proceedings against the officer so ignoring its terms.

However, the Committee is firmly convinced that any
Guideline, Instruction or Manual or Directive which actually
lays down rules not contained in some other statutory instrument which are to be or could be applied to subjects, whether
or not the failure to apply those rules would lead only to
disciplinary proceedings against the officer ignoring its terms,
is not excluded but is a statutory instrument.
4. The Committee is not satisfied that the Immigration Guidelines and Manuals, discussed more fully in the body of this
Report at paragraphs 42-44, fall within the class of documents
excluded by section 2(l)(d)(i) and/or section 2(l)(d)(v). The
Committee considers that the Guidelines and Manuals could
be considered to be made pursuant to the powers expressly
conferred on the Minister by section 58 of the Immigration
Act to make
"....regulations not inconsistent with this Act, respecting
... the duties and obligations of Immigration Officers and
the methods and procedure for carrying out such duties and
obligations whether in Canada or elsewhere."
For the purposes of determining whether or not the Immigration Guidelines and Manuals are the regulations referred to in

February 3, 1977

that section, the title given to them by the Department, and
the authority or status claimed for them by the Department of
Manpower and Immigration, or by the Department of Justice
are, without more, irrelevant. It would certainly be odd if a
regulation is valid, even if the authority for it is misrecited, so
long as there is statutory authority, but, on the other hand, by
the mere ascription of a title a document could be removed
from the authority of section 58 of the Immigration Act.
However, the Committee has not been vouchsafed either a
perusal of the Guidelines or the detailed reasons which are said
to govern their not being statutory instruments and is unable
to give an opinion as to whether the Guidelines now in
existence do or do not fall within section 58 of the Immigration
Act, or do or do not lay down any rules applicable to subjects
or immigrants.

IV
The Department of Justice has adopted a particular and
certain interpretation of section 2(l)(d)(i) and is now, after a
certain initial hesitancy and inconsistency in practice, enforcing that definition amongst the divers agencies and authorities
who make, or who propose the making of, subordinate legislation pursuant to Acts of the Parliament of Canada. The
Committee disagrees with that interpretation. It realizes that,
although the attribution of the true meaning of section
2(l)(d)(i) is a matter for the courts, litigation in which the
issue will arise for adjudication is not likely to occur. Consequently, the Committee can see no virtue in discussing the
definition of a statutory instrument further with the Department of Justice. While reiterating its opinion that the interpretation of section 2(l)(d)(i) adopted by the Department of
Justice is misconceived, it can see no good purpose in contesting it further. It will be applied, as interpreted by the Department of Justice, until it is changed. The inconsistencies in
practice which the Committee has noted from time to time will
diminish and any new inconsistencies noted will simply lead to
the exclusion in section 2(l)(d)(i) being more widely construed
and applied. The Committee can see no course other than the
amendment of section 2(l)(d) of the Statutory Instruments
Act.
The Committee concludes, therefore, that the exclusion of
the types of documents from its scrutiny that flows from the
Department of Justice's interpretation of the definition of a
statutory instrument does not accord with the concept of
parliamentary control of subordinate legislation. The Committee appreciates that it would be helpful to Senators and
Members of the Commons if it were to say precisely what
documents or classes of documents are not statutory instruments in the eyes of the Department of Justice. However, it
can not do so. It is simply impossible to categorize the documents excluded from the definition of "statutory instrument"
without an exhaustive study of the enabling powers in all the
statutes of Canada. While those enabling powers have been

February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

catalogued, first by M"1 H. Immarigeon for the MacGuigan
Committee and latterly by the Law Reform Commission, they
have never been examined as to the application of section
2(1)(d)(i) of the Statutory Instruments Act. Your Committee
simply lacks the time and resources to do so.
All your Committee is able to say is that any document
produced other than under an enabling power containing a
magic formula will not be regarded as a statutory instrument;
that any document by which one subordinate confers power to
act or to make rules upon another subordinate will not be
regarded as a statutory instrument; and that some documents
will not be regarded as being instruments and, therefore,
cannot be statutory instruments.
The Committee believes that it can logically report to the
Senate and to the House of Commons that section 2(l)(d)(i) is
unsatisfactory and that amendments to the Statutory Instruments Act are desirable whether or not the Committee or the
two Houses of Parliament accepts as legally correct the interpretation placed on section 2(1)(d)(i) by the Department of
Justice and whether or not the Houses consider the alternative
construction of the Committee as in any way compelling.
The Committee is further of the opinion that it is necessary
that the power be given to some body to issue a binding
determination as to whether any particular document is a
statutory instrument, as does the Statutory Instruments Reference Committee at Westminster. This matter should also be
made the subject of legislative amendment.
To conclude this survey of the definition of a statutory
instrument, the Committee wishes to record just one example
of the arbitrary and quixotic effects of the Department of
Justice's definition. Section 25(l)(b) of the Canadian Wheat
Board Act, as amended by 21 Eliz. Il C. 16, section 3,
provides:
"25. (1) The Board shall undertake the marketing of
wheat produced in the designated area in interprovincial and
export trade and for such purposes shall
(b) pay to producers selling and delivering wheat produced in the designated area to the Board, at the time of
delivery or at any time thereafter as may be agreed upon,
a sum-certain per bushel basis in storage Thunder Bay or
Vancouver to be fixed from time to time
(i) by regulation of the Governor in Council in respect
of wheat of a base grade to be prescribed in those
regulations, and
(ii) by the Board, with the approval of the Governor in
Council, in respect of each other grade of wheat."
Orders in Council making the regulations referred to in section
25(l)(b)(i) are statutory instruments and regulations and are
registered and published in the Canada Gazette Part II, and
scrutinized by the Committee.
Neither the document of the Board fixing prices under
25(l)(b)(ii), nor the Order in Council granting the approval of
the Governor in Council to the prices fixed by the Board is
considered to be a statutory instrument, and need not be

registered anywhere, or published. And it is not. It is the
Committee's understanding that the Board makes known its
prices by copies sent to those concerned. Both powers are
invoked at least once a year. How different the results!

APPENDIX III

AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRETENDED POWER OF
DISPENSING WITH THE LAW
In the times of the Plantagenet, Lancastrian, Yorkist, Tudor
and Stuart dynasties the legislative authority of Parliament
was subject to the exercise of the dispensing and suspending
powers of the Crown. The dispensing power was frequently
used and accomplished the exemption of particular persons,
under special circumstances, from the operation of penal laws,
being in effect an anticipatory exercise of the undoubted right
of the Sovereign to pardon individual offenders. The suspending power was employed openly only during the later part of
the seventeenth century temporarily to suspend the entire
operation of any one or more statutes, notably those directed
against Papists and Dissenters.
The dispensing power was expressed in a form of words
derived from the practice of the Papacy, commencing in the
reign of Innocent III, in issuing bulls non obstante any law to
the contrary and in dispensing with the canons in favour of
individuals. Pope Martin V, for example, granted a dispensation to a man who married his own sister.-(51) Henry 111 is
generally considered-(52) to have been the first King to
make use of the non obstante clause and its use became
commonplace, especially in issuing licences authorizing the
gift of land to the Church non obstante the Statute of Mortmain.-(53)
.
The Commons disliked the dispensing power but would
occasionally grant it expressly either for general use or for use
only between sessions of Parliament as with the "sufferance"
granted with respect to the Statute of Provisors in 1391 which
was later enlarged into a "full power and authority to modify
the said statute".-(54) On other occasions it appears that by
statute Parliament specifically excluded the dispensing power
and prospectively forbade pardons. Nevertheless, the Crown
continued to claim and to exercise a prerogative power of
dispensing.
During the reign of Henry VII the idea became accepted
that the king could not dispense with penalties for an act
which was malum in se, but that he could do so with respect to
an act which was malum prohibitum, that is an act forbidden
solely by statute.
The power of the king to dispense with any law, and not
simply with penal laws, on the grounds of public necessity was
expressly stated by the majority in Rex v. Hampden (1637),
and most notably by Vernon, J. It was, however, James Il who
erected the use of the dispensing power into an engine of policy
and administration and it was inevitable that the power would
fall with him upon his abdication. It had been true, until the
time of James Il and despite the dicta in Rex v. Hampden,
that the doctrine of the dispensing power was received with
very important qualifications:
(a) the King could not dispense with the common law;
(b) the King could not dispense with a statute which prohibited what was malum in se;

February 3, 1977
February 3, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

(c) Even malum prohibitum was not deemed universally
dispensible. Some judges held that there could be no dispensation from an express or absolute prohibition, but only
from ones sub modo.
(d) No-one contended that a dispensation could diminish or
prejudice the property or private rights of a subject.
(e) Dispensations could not be general
James II, having procured the sanction of a judicial opinion
to a dispensation with the Test Act in favour of Sir Edward
Hales,-(55) proceeded to a suspension of the principal laws
for the support of the Established Church, thus bringing about
his own flight and abdication producing in turn the Declaration of Rights and the Bill of Rights, 1689.-(56)
The recitals to the Bill of Rights included the following
clauses:
"Whereas the late King James Il by the assistance of
diverse evil councellors, judges, and ministers imployed by
him, did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant
religion and the lawes and liberties of this kingdome:
1. By assumeing and exerciseing a power of dispensing with
and suspending of lawes and the execution of lawes
without consent of Parlyament.
And therefore the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and
Commons pursuant to their respective letters and elections
being now assembled in a full and free representative of this
nation taking into their most serious consideration the best
meanes for attaining the ends aforesaid doe in the first place
(as their auncestors in like case have usually done) for the
vindicating and asserting their auntient rights and liberties,
declare(d):
1. That the pretended power of suspending of laws by regall
authoritie without consent of Parlyament is illegall
2. that the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the
execution of laws by regall authoritie as it hath beene
assumed and exercised of late is illegall ...
These recitals and declarations receive statutory force from
words near the end of the statute:
"All of which their Majestyes are contended and pleased
shall be declared enacted and established by authority of
this present Parlyament and shall stand remaine and be the
law of this Realme for ever. And the same are by their said
Majestyes by and with the advice and Consent of the Lords
Spirituall and Temporall and Commons in Parlyament
assembled and by the Authority of the same declared enacted and established accordingly."
The statutory character of the Bill of Rights was declared by
the first Act of the following session, 2 William and Mary c.l.
The Lords were unwilling absolutely to condemn the dispensing power, and inserted the qualifying words "as it hath
been assumed and exercised of late". But by section XII of the
Bill of Rights the dispensing power was abolished absolutely,
except in such cases as should be specially provided for by a

bill to be passed during the then current session. No such bill
was, however, passed.
"XII And bee it further declared and enacted by the
Authoritie aforesaid, that from and after this present session
of Parlyament noe dispensation by non obstante of or to any
statute or any part thereof shall be allowed but that the
same shall be held void and of noe effect except a dispensation be allowed of in such statute and except in such cases as
shall be specially provided for by one or more bill or bills to
be passed during this present session of Parlyament."
It is true that in the Case of Eton College-(57) the words
"as it hath been assumed and exercised of late" were to save
the validity of old dispensations. But even if those qualifying
words be taken as a parliamentary view that some sort of
dispensing power did exist at common law, it is well settled
that the courts are not bound by mere legislative assumptions
as to the law. "The rule is that Parliament does not alter the
law merely by betraying an erroneous opinion of it."-(58)
The Case of Eton College could if necessary be supported on
the basis that the qualifying words in the Bill of Rights
actually operated to give to some or all old dispensations a
validity which they would otherwise have lacked. Despite the
contrast between Parliament's unqualified condemnation of
the suspending power and its qualified condemnation of the
dispensing power, it would be open to the courts to hold that,
at common law, both were equally abuses, and that, rightly
understood, the common law admitted neither dispensing
power nor suspending power.
In any event, section XII makes clear that for the future
there was to be no dispensing power save under statutory
authority. No such bill as contemplated ever having been
carried, the only source for a dispensing power can lie in the
terms of particular statutes which, as has been noted in
paragraph 97 of this Report occasionally do grant such a
power.
The application of the Bill of Rights throughout Canada is
universally accepted-(59) admits of no doubt and need not be
considered.
It has to be observed at once that the dispensing power had
been used in connection with statutes and that the substantive
provisions of section XII of the Bill of Rights speaks only of
statutes, no mention being made of delegated legislation
which, though not unknown (Vide Statute of Proclamations 31
Hen. VIII C.8 1539), was not common. The outlawing of the
dispensing power in clause 2 of what is commonly known as
the Declaration of Rights, reproduced in the preamble to the
Bill of Rights, refers to "laws" and not to statutes, but is
qualified by the words "as it hath beene assumed and exercised of late .... ". It would be possible, therefore, to put
forward the argument that it remains lawful for the Crown to
dispense with delegated legislation except in the classes of case
in which James II exercised the power. It is submitted that
such an argument can be safely set aside and the illegality of
the dispensing power extends not only to dispensing with
statutes, but also to dispensing with laws, however made. This

SENATE DEBATES

is so for several reasons. First, the qualifying words "as it hath
beene assumed and exercised of late" have been construed as
being for the purpose of saving the validity of old dispensations
granted before the evil events of the reign of James II: Re
Case of Eton College (1815). Secondly, subordinate legislation, if validly made, has the full force and effect of a
statute,-(60) Dale's Case,-(61) Kruse v. Johnson,-(62)
Institute of Patent Agents v. Lockwood,-(63) Reference Re
Japanese Canadians,-(64) and it would be absurd to suggest
that, although having the full force and effect of a statute
delegated legislation is different in quality in being subject to a
royal or other power of dispensation. Thirdly, the members of
the Convention and of the first Parliament of William and
Mary were necessarily legislating within the frame of reference of their own time in which law was almost always made
by statute, and indeed, of a time in which Parliament legislated with a particularity and attention to detail which today
would be regarded as picayune. The words of section XII of
the Bill of Rights cannot, therefore be confined narrowly to
statutes strictu sensu but extend to legislation made by or
under the authority of a statute. Wherefore, the principle can
be asserted that the Bill of Rights abolished entirely the
Crown's right to dispense with laws in advance (as distinct
from the right to pardon those who offend against laws) and
that any dispensation, to be lawful, must be referable to an
enabling power within a statute. Thus, it is that, as bas been
seen, some statutes do expressly provide that there shall be a
dispensing power in connection with the provisions of the
respective statutes, the regulations made under them or both.
Canada Shipping Act, section 482(1)
"Notwithstanding anything in this part, the Minister, on the
recommendation of the Chairman of the Board of Steamship Inspection, may relieve any Canadian ship or the owner
of any such ship from compliance with any of the provisions
of this Part or regulations made thereunder relating to
steamship inspection .. . in any specific case of emergency

where the Minister may deem it necessary or advisable in
the public interest . . . "
Aeronautics Act, section 14(1)
"The Commission may make regulations
(g) excluding from the operation of the whole or any
portion of this Part or any regulation, order or direction
made or issued pursuant thereto, any air carrier or commercial air service or class or group of air carriers or
commercial air services."
How then can a power to dispense with subordinate legislation bc thought to exist?
The first argument that is put is that because Parliament
can dispense with the laws it makes, and can enact sections
which read "notwithstanding any law, or any section of this or
any other Act . . . " so too can the Governor in Council (or the
Minister, Regional Director, etc.) dispense from the laws he
makes. This is once again to assert that the delegate is in the
same position as is Parliament, to assert that subordinate law

February 3, 1977

is not truly subordinate at all. It is to give to the delegate all
the powers that Parliament has. This is nonsense. The Queen
in Parliament is sovereign. The Governor in Council, Ministers, Boards etc. are not, and can only make law within the
confines of the authority delegated to them. That authority
will not include a power to dispense from the subordinate laws
made unless it is expressly conferred. This is, the Committee
notes, the position accepted by all in the United Kingdom
where no dispensations from subordinate legislation can occur
unless expressly authorized by the enabling Act. It is also the
position which obtained under the most famous enabling Act
of all time the infamous Statute of Proclamations, 31 Henry
VIII cap. 8, repealed by 1 Edward VI, cap. 6. The complete
law making power was given into the royal hands, to the King
in his Council, and yet it was thought necessary by that most
puissant Prince, who drafted the Bill in his own hand, expressly to provide for a dispensing power. If so mighty a monarch
more than a century before the Bill of Rights thought it
necessary to take a dispensing power along with Parliament's
delegated law making power, how much more necessary must
an express dispensing power be to a delegate of Parliament's
sovereign authority today? To remove all doubt, the Committee notes the text of the substantive portion of the Statute of
Proclamations:
"Therefore it is enacted, that always the king, for the time
being, with the advice of his council . .. or the greater
number of them, may set forth at all times by authority of
this act, his proclamations, under such penalties, and of such
sort as to his highness and his council, or the more part of
them shall seem requisite. And that the same shall be
obeyed, as though they were made by act of parliament,
unless the king's highness dispense with them under his
great seal."
It is in the light of this true position of a delegate of
Parliament that section 26(4) of the Interpretation Act must
be construed:
"When a power is conferred to make regulations, the power
shall be construed as including a power, exercisable in the
like manner, and subject to the like consent and conditions,
if any, to repeal, amend or vary the regulations and (to)
make others."
Given the fundamental constitutional presumption against a
power of dispensation this provision cannot amount to a blanket power to any and every delegate of a subordinate law
making function to grant dispensations under cover of making
"Variation Orders", as has been sought to be donc in the case
of licences granted under the Public Lands Leasing and Licensing and Public Lands Mineral Regulations and the Canada
Oil and Gas Land Regulations. The words "amend" or "vary"
will not extend to permit dispensations from a general rule in
favour of individuals in particular circumstances. Such a
power must be sought in each case in the enabling statute
under which the delegation of rule making power is conferred.
No delegate, without express authority from Parliament, can
be in any better position than the successors of James Il. Laws

February 3,1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

cannot be dispensed with by the authority of delegates when
they cannot be by royal authority.
A second argument is that the only dispensing power outlawed by the Bill of Rights is that exercised in a fashion
strictly analogous to the manner in which King James Il
proceeded. That is to say, that the only dispensation forbidden
is that made by someone other than the person who made the
law. James Il purported to dispense with laws made by
Parliament by Letters Patent under his Great Seal. Therefore,
a Minister or a Regional Director can not dispense with laws
made by the Governor in Council in exercise of powers delegated by Parliament. (The Committee notes in passing that
the power purportedly given to the Board of Steamship Inspection under section 1 of Schedule A to the Steamship Machinery Construction Regulations-(65) takes just this outlawed form.) This argument would leave a Minister or the
Governor in Council free to dispense from the regulations he
himself makes, but suffers from the same defects of arrogation
of 1343 non-subordinate'status as were outlined in the preceding paragraph. Moreover, it ignores the effect of section XII of
the Bill of Rights which must be taken to have outlawed any
dispensation unless provided for in the enabling Act.
The final argument that bas been addressed in support of
the dispensing power is the claim that it is automatically
conferred upon a delegate by the enabling Act itself, whenever
the enabling power is cast in terms of a subject-matter, and
commonly introduced by the word "respecting". This was the
formula used in drafting section 400(1)(b) of the Canada
Shipping Act.
"The Governor in Council may make regulations respecting
the construction of machinery."
It was this provision which was relied upon in giving a power
of dispensation to the Board of Steamship Inspection. The
Committee was told by the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of
Transport:
"It has generally been assumed that the use of the word
'respecting' is wide enough to allow the Board to exempt
from or dispense with any general requirement of the Regulations. In support of this assumption, the writings of Mr.
(sic) Driedger are relied on, in particular the book "The
Composition of Legislation", page 149."
The Committee can only reiterate that such a theory places
the Governor in Council, or other subordinate, in exactly the
same position as Parliament and asserts that be can do anything Parliament might do. This view of "respecting" ignores
the consequences of the Bill of Rights and the fact that any
delegate's powers, including those of the Governor in Council,
are subordinate and their limits will be construed in the light
of basic constitutional principles, one of which is that the
dispensing power is illegal unless expressly granted. Reference
to page 149 of the "Composition of Legislation" brings forward once more the argument by analogy to sections 91 and
92 of the British North America Act. As was mentioned in
paragraph 90 of this Report this analogy is false.

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE OF MINISTERS OF FINANCE, OTTAWA FEBRUARY 1-2 1977
DECONTROL AND POST-CONTROL--NOTES FOR REMARKS BY FINANCE MINISTER DONALD S. MACDONALD

I now propose to set out the present stage of our thinking on
the process of decontrol and the post-control period, and to
invite you to express your present views. My remarks can be
grouped under three headings: first, the factors influencing the
nature and timing of decontrol; second, the methods of decontrol; and third, the nature of the post-control arrangements.

tions could raise prices in order to restore eroded profit
margins. These dangers and the fact that the recent improvement in inflationary expectations may still be quite fragile
argue strongly for the continuation of controls and for phasing
them out over a period of time so as to spread out any wage
and price bulge that might take place.

Factors Influencing the Nature and Timing of Decontrol
First, the economic situation throughout 1977 and into 1978
looks relatively favourable for exit from the controls program.
Rates of price and wage increase have already come down
substantially and are expected, on balance, to show some
continued tendency towards moderation. Given the prospect of
subdued economic growth, we are not likely to encounter
demand pressures which might lead to an outburst of price
increases if controls were removed. Further, because of its
inherently flexible nature, the controls program does not
appear to have led as yet to widespread distortions in wage and
price structures which could also trigger a wage and price
bulge. Consequently, the economic situation would appear to
give us a green light for decontrol.
The second factor that must be considered is the state of
expectations. It gives us a more ambiguous signal. On the one
hand, there has been a significant change in inflationary
expectations since October, 1975. The average Canadian no
longer expects the wage he receives or the prices he pays to
rise at double digit rates. The newspapers are not filled
anymore with stories of stratospheric wage increases inviting
emulation. One consumer survey showed that in September,
1976, only 29 per cent of the respondents thought that prices
would rise faster over the next few months, compared to 47 per
cent in September, 1975. The decline in inflationary expectations stems from the better price performance recently experienced, and the commitment of most of our governments to
the Anti-Inflation Program.
On the other hand, there is a danger that a renewed
outbreak of inflationary expectations could be triggered by any
bulge in costs and prices that might occur once controls are
lifted. "AIB clauses" in wage contracts, which provide for
increases or contract re-openings when controls come off,
could result in some large wage increases and in a spate of
re-openings of collective agreements. Some workers could get
carried away by a desire to recapture wage increases rolled
back by the AIB. This is a particular danger in sheltered
economic sectors, particularly in public and para-public
employment. Another round of leapfrogging could ensue.
Where market conditions or market power permits, corpora-

The third factor is business confidence. Corporations are
finding the prices and profits regulations administered by the
AIB to be burdensome, and there is cause for concern that
firms may be holding back on new investment projects. There
are evidently a number of factors at work, including the rather
slow growth rates here and elsewhere, the high costs of new
capital investments and the difficulty of equity financing,
excess capacity and political uncertainties. But the existence of
controls, and in particular, the apprehension that they may
remain in effect for a long time, is an added handicap. This
can be more easily relieved than the other factors. Traditionally, business investment has always been especially important in the cyclical expansion of the economy, but that stimulus has been very much subdued in the present recovery. The
sooner the economy can be decontrolled and the timetable for
decontrol can be announced, the more likely it is that business
investment will follow its traditional pattern and that growth
will be maintained at a reasonable rate.
Fourth. A significant benefit which can be derived from the
development of an orderly program for decontrol and the
necessary post-control arrangements can be a renewed basis
for constructive co-operation with organized labour. One
aspect would be renewed participation by labour in the work of
important boards and councils.
Fifth. I should note the problems that will crop up as the
expiry date of the legislation nears. As the Anti-Inflation
Program moves into its third year and as its expiry date comes
closer, the enforcement of controls will become increasingly
difficult. Some will attempt to evade the spirit of controls by
back-end loading their collective agreements so that the largest
increases in compensation will come at the end of their contracts rather than at the beginning as is typically the case;
others will refuse to enter into multi-year contracts. At some
point, negotiations will effectively cease. The problem of "AIB
clauses" in collective agreements will also become more acute.
Corporations will be able to side-step around the prices and
profits regulations by accounting devices, re-assigning sales
contracts, or even by withholding supplies from the market to
minimize realizing apparent excess revenue. These are all
problems to be considered.

SENATE DEBATES

Methods of Decontrol
Against that background, I would like to review the options
for the decontrol process which I have discussed with many
informal groups across the country, and which I touched upon
at our last meeting.
One way of terminating controls is simply to announce that
as of a certain date controls are no longer in effect. Thereafter,
the AIB and the Administrator would simply cease making
compensation rulings and would ignore pending cases. The
prices and profits regulations would be lifted as of the last
completed compliance period or quarter prior to the announcement date. This method bas the advantage of being simple and
quick. Depending upon the chosen date, it would reinstate
unfettered collective bargaining more quickly than any other
method. It might also bolster business confidence. However,
this method also bas some drawbacks. Unless expectations
have been clearly turned around, and a greater sense of
moderation and responsibility established, the sudden and
complete lifting of controls could easily result in a large wage
and price bulge, with renewed problems of inflation and even
more unemployment. Moreover, it has serious inequities.
Those who had delayed filing or who had not yet been dealt
with by the AIB would escape controls, whereas those who had
settled within the guidelines or had been rolled back by the
AIB would be locked in, to the extent contracts were amended.
An alternative strategy would be to follow a phased decontrol. One method would be to reduce the size of the controlled
sector in stages, either by periodically raising the size limit of
firms subject to controls or alternatively by decontrolling firms
one industry at a time. This gradualist approach would minimize the risk of a wage and price bulge. A fundamental
question to consider would be whether the early release of
firms or sectors would be conditional upon commitments by
both employers and employees to continue to comply voluntarily with the over-all spirit of the Anti-Inflation Program and
its guidelines.
Decontrol on the basis of firm size would be administratively easy, and would be consistent with the original design of
the program. However, it would call for essentially arbitrary
distinctions among business firms. The impact of both wage
and profit margin restraints appears to be greater for smaller
firms. The competitive relationship between small uncontrolled
firms and large controlled firms in the same industry can be
distorted. Further, certain industries are composed largely of
smaller firms and, thus, decontrol by firm size would imply a
form of decontrol by industry that might not be otherwise
desirable. Decontrol on the basis of firm size does not appear
to be an attractive sectoral approach.
Decontrolling firms one industry at a time would permit the
process to take account of the market conditions affecting
different industries and of the relationships between the performance of industries and the problems of inflation. This
approach would have to recognize the fact that most large
Canadian firms operate in several industries. As weil, the
structure of unionization does not line up neatly with that of
business and this would make it difficult to remove controls on
compensation at the same time as those on prices and profits.
In decontrolling one industry at a time, attention would have
to be paid to those who remain under control.

A third option would involve releasing groups from control
at times determined by the expiry date of their contracts as
regards compensation, and their fiscal years as regards prices
and profits. Compensation plans, whether under collective
agreements or unilateral, that succeed plans terminating on or
after a specifically chosen decontrol date, would be free of
mandatory controls. Plans that succeed plans terminating
before that date would be subject to mandatory controls even
though the plan might not be settied and reported to the AIB
until after that date. It would be necessary to stipulate that
every successor plan be of at least one year's duration to
prevent action to terminate plans on or shortly after that date.
Under this approach, therefore, the mandatory controls
would come off particular groups of employees over a period of
time depending on the dates on which agreements terminate,
just as the first application of controls to groups depended on
the date on which new agreements were reached.
Similarly, the present structure of controls over prices and
profits would be lifted from firms at the end of their fiscal
years which had commenced before the decontrol date. It
would perhaps be necessary to continue controls for some firms
for a period beyond the end of that fiscal year in order to
achieve a better synchronization of decontrol over prices and
profits and decontrol on compensation. In any event, it would
be necessary to provide for continuing control over firms which
had excess revenue in their last fiscal year, until it was marked
off.
Of course there may be other options which should be
explored. But whatever approach is finally selected, the choice
of a decontrol date will be of great importance.
In this discussion, I have concentrated on compensation and
prices and profits. Other elements of controls would be eased
or lifted in appropriate stages or at an appropriate point in
time. Rental control of course, is in your jurisdiction.
Nature of the Post-Control Arrangements
May I now turn to the nature of the post-control arrangements. Their satisfactory resolution is in some sense a precondition for decontrol. The progress we have achieved so far will
indeed be short-lived if we find ourselves faced again with the
same dilemmas which confronted us before controls were
introduced.
Some of the issues that must be addressed in formulating an
answer to this question are: (1) a monitoring agency and
guidelines; (2) public sector compensation; (3) private sector
labour-management relations; and (4) general economic
consultations.
The AIB will be in existence during the period of decontrol
and will be in a position to monitor developments as controls
are removed. When its legal basis disappears with the expiry of
the legislation, we believe that it would be desirable to establish a successor agency. There are indications that this would
have some support in the community.
Such an agency would monitor wage and price developments
in the post-control period, would assist in the process of public
understanding and could express views on whether particular
wage settlements and price decisions were reasonable as well

372

SENATE DEBATES

as on the more general tendencies of costs and prices. The
agency might also direct attention to sectors in the economy
where large increases reflect institutional or other causes that
might be corrected.
While it would be possible for the agency to give advice or
express public disapproval of behaviour which it regarded as
clearly unreasonable in the absence of guidelines, this role
could be much more effective if guidelines existed. On the
other hand, there is the danger that the guideline, which would
be intended to be an average, might become a minimum.
Moreover, there is the danger that the guidelines would be
ignored, and the agency would lose credibility.
The agency must have the power to require submission of
information. Indeed we place great value on maintaining the
body of knowledge which the AIB has built up. If the agency
were to be vested with no other powers, it could be established
under the Inquiries Act, although there may be considerable
advantage in enacting special legislation. I think that it would
be desirable to have agreement between ourselves on its role,
and your participation in nominating members would be
invaluable.
At the present time, I would not contemplate vesting any
sanctions other than exposure to public opinion either in the
agency or in the government. The question of sanctions might
be examined further, but continued mandatory power would
hardly be viewed as consistent with decontrol and would raise
major questions of an economic, organizational and constitutional nature.
The role and nature of the Council on Wage and Price
Stability in the United States might be noted as an example of
one approach that could be taken. The primary responsibility
of the Council is to monitor and analyze trends in wages, costs,
productivity, and prices in both the public and private sectors
of the economy. The Council has no mandatory powers.
The second issue relates to the public sector. A critical
component of post-control arrangements will be the ability to
offer reasonably convincing assurance that compensation in
the public sector will not contribute to a new inflationary
spiral, once the AIB controls are removed.
For much of the private sector, it will be argued, market
forces will exert a discipline on the setting of prices and
incomes. Because this factor does not apply directly in the
public sector, it has been widely suggested that a form of
controls should remain in force for the public sector after they
have been lifted from the private sector. This would undoubtedly raise major difficulties. Nevertheless, there is a need to
consider carefully whether some form of continuing restraint
should be established, particularly with regard to the public
sector.
Should the rate of some public sector compensation increases return to those found shortly before the AIB was established, governments might well be concerned about their ability
to pay and about the demonstration effect that excessive
increases can have.
In all instances, compensation decisions are decisively affected by the quality of compensation information. The Treasury
Board has commenced consultations with its provincial counterparts on this important matter.

February

1977

Februarv 3, 1977

The interdependence of compensation decisions by the federal, provincial and municipal governments points to the need
for co-ordinated action to harmonize basic approaches.
The Treasury Board Secretariat and the Anti-Inflation
Board are now exploring in a preliminary way the means such
co-operation and co-ordination between levels of government
might take, including mechanisms, if any, that might be
established to sustain such co-ordination.
They are exploring whether there is any consensus on the
need for coordinated action. They will also explore whether
there is a basis for some common commitment to follow
certain general principles in implementing compensation
policy. Such principles could include, among others, comparability of total compensation with the private sector where
appropriate and feasible, subject to some overriding limit in
the event of clearly excessive settlements. Any such action, of
course, implies the willingness to accept strikes even in "essential services" if it proves impossible to obtain settlement consistent with such principles.
In addition to the possible commitments of governments to
follows common principles, public sector wages and prices
could be subject to monitoring and comment by any "successor
agency".
For a successor agency to play such a role, it would, of
course, be necessary to have rather full participation of provincial governments.
The third issue relates more generally to labour-management relations. The government will be pressing forward with
new initiatives in connection with the structure of labour
legislation, the practices of mediation, conciliation and arbitration, and other issues in this general area where close federalprovincial co-operation is essential. In particular, we think that
the development of an improved framework of relationships in
the construction industry can make important contribution to
the success of the post-control policies.
Finally, since the publication of The Way Ahead, there has
been some discussion of possible mechanisms for consultation
on general economic issues with individuals and groups outside
government. Such consultations could provide the required
public understanding of economic realities on which effective
guidelines have to be based, and assist in resolving the structural issues which will influence the performance of the Canadian economy. Meetings with business groups have already
occurred and a meeting with the CLC was held on Monday. In
discussions thus far, there has been substantial resistance to
any mechanism that might be interpreted as a tripartite council with executive power. The possibility has been raised of a
role for a parliamentary committee to provide a general forum
for discussion of The Way Ahead and a continuing forum for
public discussion of economic issues and prospects. The possibility that a reconstituted Economic Council in Canada might
serve as a basis for the continuing forum has also been
broached.
It is evident that we still have some way to go before we
arrive at any definitive conclusions on how and when to get out
of controls and what is to replace them. I would, thus, be most
happy to hear any views you might have on these important
topics.

THE ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OUTLOOKSUMMARY OF REMARKS BY FINANCE MINISTER
DONALD S. MACDONALD
The Economy
Fifteen months after the launching of the anti-inflation
program we have more than met the first-year target for
reducing inflation, but we have fallen somewhat short of our
goals for growth of production and employment.
Abroad, moderate rather than strong growth is anticipated
in 1977 for industrial countries. Economic stimulation is
planned in the United States; Japan and Germany are in position
to undertake similar measures. Such action will strengthen
Canada's prospects.
Economic growth in Canada is expected to be moderate in
1977-probably picking up as the year progresses. Exports
and consumer spending will lead the expansion; the restraint
on government spending will hold back over-all growth.
Private forecasts df real growth in 1977, assuming no policy
change, range between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. The first
figure is unduly pessimistic, the latter hardly satisfactory.
A variety of measures sustained the Canadian economy
through the recent world recession and continue to operate. In
particular, indexing of taxes and welfare payments provides
automatically the adjustments to inflation which are requiring
specific action in the United States and other countries. In

80003-25

view of the immediate requirement to deal with unemployment, direct measures have been announced to help quickly in
areas and among groups where the problem is most serious.
We may see a mixed pattern of speedup and slowdown in
the inflation rate over the next few months. But a continuing
slowdown of cost increases, particularly wage increases, will
maintain the underlying momentum toward lower inflation
rates.
The Fiscal Situation
The combined federal and provincial deficit, which has
occurred largely as a result of recession and tax cuts, will show
a small rise this year from the 1975-76 level of $6 billion. In
the absence of new policy measures, declines in deficits could
be expected in 1977-78.
With an outlook of weak growth in production and employment, there is an obvious case for measures of economic
stimulus. But measures must be within the limits imposed on
governments by their existing cash requirements and consistent with the current thrust of policy.
Priorities proposed in choosing measures are to encourage
investment, to promote further improvement in the balance of
payments deficit, to generate downward pressures on prices
and to relieve areas and sectors of high unemployment.
The federal government is actively examining further measures it can take, and a federal budget is anticipated earlier
than usual this year.

that the senators who are absent are attending to their other
duties in committee.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

e

(2010)

Senator Molson: It is perfectly true that when Senator Cook
made his excellent speech last week the chamber was partially

February 8, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

empty. But it is equally true that a committee had obtained
leave from the Senate on the previous day to meet during the
sitting of the Senate. Therefore, it is a matter of record that
the chamber was not empty because senators were not engaged
in their duties to the Senate.
I do not ask that the press report all these matters, but I do
suggest that it is not the best part of wisdom, nor does it
perform any useful public service, to report, as was the case
here, that the chamber was two-thirds empty. The senators
who had left were present for a vote a matter of 15 or 20
minutes before, when attendance in the chamber is recorded as
61. It was very easily ascertainable that senators were called to
committee rooms of this building.
One can question the purpose. Is it just to pick on the
Senate, or to attempt to destroy it? Whatever the objective, I
say the press is doing a very poor job in reporting in that
fashion.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I believe Senator
Molson's intervention at this time to be most appropriate. The
fact that there was a one-third attendance in this chamber for
an individual senator's initiative is a tribute to the quality of
Senator Cook's speech.
As anyone with some experience in the other bouse is
aware-and I invite other honourable senators who have
served in the other place to confirm this-that house is fortunate to have 25 of its members in their places when a private
member's motion, bill or resolution is under discussion. That
fact, apparently, was overlooked by those in a position to
inform the public.
I wish to assure honourable senators that the Senate is
cognizant of its responsibility to participate in the national
dialogue on the subject of national unity, and it is my hope
that in the very near future a full debate will be held here on
that subject. Without question, many honourable senators will
wish to participate, and I hope that Senator Cook will again
contribute in the magnificent way he did the other day.
Senator Ewasew: Honourable senators, I wish to add to this
discussion because I happen to be one of the senators first
mentioned in the newspaper-and so soon after my recent
appointment. It was a bell of a way to start. However, I find
that the Canadian Press did have the courtesy to call a certain
senator to find out why, as if they were, as they say in French,
"l'œilde Dieu"-the eye of God-watching you.
The fact remains that I had to absent myself because I had
to meet a minister in charge of cultural affairs concerning a
certain trip to Edmonton relative to the unity of this country.
Unfortunately, it happened to be at the time when my colleague was making his speech and stating, from a Newfoundland point of view, certain costs to Quebec in the event of
separation. But there is nothing in that damned articleexcuse my expression-that would indicate that a senator does
anything else but sit on his south end right here, with his north
end you know where, regardless of the fact that he has
devoted-as I have done-several weekends attending multicultural events in the interests of a united Canada.

80003-25/

I am really disappointed. As a new senator I am shocked
that such reporting is so devoid of accuracy. I gave a speech
today on the function of the Senate to a gathering of American
and Canadian Kiwanians in Montreal. I did a tremendous
amount of research, which took me a couple of weeks. I am so
proud to say that I am member of the Senate. I had no idea
how much work goes on behind the scenes, not necessarily just
in committee but in attending weekend functions and spelling
out to those concerned the problems of Quebec today. My
having to depart from the Senate chamber was because of a
meeting I was having with a minister of cultural affairs
relevant to certain planned trips to western Canada, and not,
as implied, simply to absent myself from the Senate. I compliment all senators here, and say to them, "Good job done,
ladies and gentlemen, and never mind the bloody media."
As far as I am concerned, there are certain other aspects of
the media that are subject to question. For example, when they
happened to mention Senator Rizzuto on my left, Senator Jean
Marchand somewhere down there to my right, and myself, I
did not believe for one moment-I am not that naive-that
they were trying to embarrass me-although they did in fact
because I had numerous phone calls regarding the report. No,
they were not trying to embarrass me, but obviously the Prime
Minister of this country. As to that, let me honestly say that
whether the Prime Minister is of my political affiliation or not,
in these trying circumstances I would be tremendously loyal to
him. To anyone, including the Canadian Press reporter, who
would attempt to be "l'oeil de Dieu", and who would try to
embarrass him, let me say that this form of reporting arouses
my Ukrainian Canadian animosity right down to the pit of my
guts, and I say to them very frankly, "Look out in the future to
make sure you report not just part of the picture, but the
complete picture without exception."
Senator Grosart: I wonder if I could ask the Leader of the
Government how many committees now have permission to sit
while the Senate is sitting. How many committees at any time
have that permission?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, there are extenuating circumstances which do arise from time to time.
Senator Grosart: I am not asking about that.
Senator Perrault: No, and I am not attempting to evade the
honourable senator's question, either.
Senator Flynn: Not tonight!
Senator Perrault: There are approximately four committees
which, from time to time, find it necessary to meet while the
Senate is sitting, but I understand that in the present case
there is a witness, a minister, who has made it clear that he
must appear tomorrow because he has no other time available.
It was, I think, a decision of the committee that they must
meet him.
Senator Grosart: On that, honourable senators, I must say
there was a time when I used to object to any committee's
being given permission to meet while the Senate is sitting. On
a recent occasion I. advised the chairman of one committee of

SENATE DEBATES
which I am a member to ask for such permission. He did not
really need it, but I said, "Get permission. Everybody else is
doiçg it. Why not?"
We have heard some criticism of the press here because of a
certain newspaper report. I think we should be a little realistic
and admit that, whether there are committees meeting or not,
on almost any day this Senate clears out about an hour after
the sitting commences. This is a fact. I have sat here on many
occasions and taken a count when there were no committees
sitting, and there was hardly a quorum present.
Let us not be too self-righteous about this. If we are not
prepared to stay here to the end of the sitting-and there can
be very good reasons why we cannot-let us not blame the
press all the time for calling the attention of the public to the
fact that there are vacant seats. There are vacant seats in the
other place as well. I think we are getting too self-righteous
about this.
Senator Perrault: I want to make it clear that the government is not blaming the press for anything. However, the
government does want to make it clear that the degree of
dedication which senators bring to their responsibilities in this
chamber is fully on a par with that displayed by those who
serve in any other legislature in this country. There is an
immense amount of work which goes on behind the scenes.
One of the most constructive reports in some time on the
work of the Senate appeared in the Vancouver Sun a few
months ago. It was written by the parliamentary press gallery
correspondent, Mr. John Sawatsky. He commented on the
attendance record in this chamber, and compared it to that of
the House of Commons. That report was an excellent and
constructive piece of writing, and one of the main patagraphs
was to the effect that the author was surprised at the amount
of time that senators spend in serving the Canadian people. He
suggested that our efforts are fully comparable with those put
forth in the other chamber. This is a point that must be made.

LABOUR
WORKER REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF
CORPORATIONS-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, a question was
asked by Honourable Senator Austin on February 1 regarding
worker representation on boards of directors of corporations.
He asked whether this matter had been discussed between
members of the government and the Canadian Labour Con-

February 8, 1977

gress at recent meetings, specifically one that had been held
earlier that week.
The question of worker representation on boards of directors
was not raised at the Monday meeting between ministers and
executive officers of the C.L.C. The meeting was basically
concerned with a review of the economy and the issue of exit
from controls.
The Leader of the Government is aware of a report by
Charles Connaghan, commissioned by the Department of
Labour, which provides a critical examination of labour relations in West Germany with suggestions for improving
Canadian labour-management relationships based on the West
German experience. This report and similar reports are being
used as background information in the continuing dialogue
between government, business and labour, aimed at improving
industrial relations.
The Leader of the Government is aware that the Report of
the Committee of Inquiry on Industrial Democracy-the Bullock Report-has recently been presented to the U.K. Parliament by the Secretary of State for Trade.
CONFEDERATION
NEWSPAPER REPORT-QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, before the Orders of
the Day are called, I rise on a question of privilege. In the
Montreal Star of February 3, there appeared a report of a
speech which I had given in London, Ontario, the day before,
to the Canadian Club there. The report says in part-this is
the part to which I take exceptionLiberal Senator Eugene Forsey says negotiations between
Quebec and the federal government on the issue of
Quebec separation should be carried out before a referendum is held by the parti Québécois.
That statement is wholly false. I made no statement even
vaguely resembling anything like that. Everything that I said
on the subject of negotiations made it perfectly clear to anyone
who was not stone deaf, or lacking in the upper storey, that
what I was talking about was the problems that would arise in
negotiations which might take place if Mr. Lévesque got a
substantial majority for separation in his plebiscite. At no time
have I ever, in public or in private, or even in thought,
committed such a folly, such an idiocy, such a lunacy, as is
reported in that statement.
Senator Flynn: You were very badly treated by the press.
EXCISE TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 3, the debate
on the motion of Senator Barrow for second reading of Bill
C-21, to amend the Excise Tax Act.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, we had a short,
but very excellent explanation of this bill by Senator Barrow
on Thursday, and I would have to say once again he did his

February 8, 1977

SENATE DEBA TES
SENATE DEBATES

best with what, if not a bad bill, is certainly not a good bill. I
say that because in the first place this is another of these
mini-omnibus bills we have, and I would hope that somehow
those who have the responsibility for introducing legislation
into this Parliament would find a way to separate diverse items
in which the government seeks amendments to bills, into
separate bills.
This tendency to throw everything into the hopper at any
given time is certainly anything but the most logical way to
present legislation to the house. This particular bill has been
described and characterized by those who sponsor it, the
government and others, as one whose main thrust is energy
conservation. Yet, we find in this bill all sorts of minor
housekeeping items which have nothing to do with energy
conservation.
I say that because surely the time has come when it is
possible to separate the basic content of a bill such as this into
separate bills. It will be said immediately that it is very
difficult to get a lot of bills through the House of Commons.
That, of course, is the responsibility of the government. However, I would suggest that in this particular case the very
different items of amendment to the Excise Tax Act should
have been contained in separate bills. I will say no more on
that at the moment.
My second criticism of this bill is that it is an ad hoc
approach to a problem; it is ill-thought out, with conclusions
arrived at without any prior consultation whatsoever with the
persons, particularly the industries, most concerned. In the
conservation area its main thrust is, first of all, to provide
certain measures to deter the wasteful consumption of energy,
and, secondly, to exempt certain commodities from excise tax.
However, we immediately find ourselves in a position where
the sponsor of the bill (Senator Barrow), and the minister in
the other place, say, "Sorry, but we did not really check this
out." For example, the sponsor, speaking of one of the major
attempts to conserve energy-the decision to add an excise tax
of $100 on air conditioners used in automobilesSenator Flynn: The best joke I have heard in years.
Senator Grosart: He said the government has now been
persuaded that perhaps they were wrong. The same comment
applies to the reduction of the weight exemptions, which the
sponsor of the bill told us:
-resulted from extensive discussions between representatives of the automobile industry and government officials.
As a result of these discussions, the government has been
persuaded that an alternative form of tax, based on fuel
consumption rather than weight, should receiveAnd I emphasize this:
-in-depth analysis.
One would really have to ask why the in-depth analysis did not
take place before this completely defective legislation was
introduced.
Senator Barrow, quite properly, made the statement that
there is no doubt whatsoever that the air conditioner in an

automobile is a heavy user of energy, and therefore something
must be done about it. Two points arise in connection with
that. The first is that it is certainly not proven that an air
conditioner involves a greater use of energy than existing
alternatives. There is clear evidence adduced by the automobile industry that an automobile driven with the windows open
to avoid excessive heat in certain circumstances actually uses
more energy than an automobile driven with the windows
closed and an air conditioner working. I do not intend to say
which is right, but there is no clear evidence that the government is right in this, so the government plans to conduct an
in-depth analysis after the legislation is presented to
Parliament.
a

(2030)

The second point is that the government says, "It is a
dreadful, improper use of energy to have an air conditioner in
an automobile, and we must do something about it." What do
they do? They say, "Well, if you wish to continue this improper use, to continue to be a polluter, then you must pay a
hundred bucks." Where is the rationale of saying that if a
person is rich enough to afford $100, he can continue to
pollute? Surely, if the pollution, and the consumption of
energy, caused by air conditioners in automobiles is as great as
the government tells us it is, then they should prohibit them;
not make it possible for someone who is rich enough to pay
$100 to continue polluting.
Here we have a bill which says, "For a hundred bucks you
can obtain a licence to continue doing something that, in the
view of the government, is not in the public interest." I just do
not understand this approach to a problem such as this.
Then we have the question, into which I will not go in great
detail, of the small manufacturers' exemptions. Senator
Barrow gave us an explanation of that. This, again, is something that has not been thought out. The government has not
the faintest idea whether it is doing the right thing, so much so
that Senator Barrow assured us-and I thank him for assuring
us, except that it is a small compensation for a bad bill-that
the minister is aware of the concerns voiced in this area, and is
giving them careful consideration. Surely, he should have
given them careful consideration before bringing forward these
addenda items in this bill.
It is true, honourable senators, that this bill had very quick
passage in the other place. It was introduced, and was referred
to a committee of the whole. There was not very much
discussion. Some of the points I have mentioned were raised;
others were not. However, we are certainly once again faced
with this type of quick, ad hoc approach to a problem without
the kind of in-depth analysis which we are now promised being
given to it.
I am not taking a position for one minute that the points I
have raised are factual, one way or the other, but we are faced
with the government's asking us to pass this legislation, and
saying, "We are not sure; we did not even think about it. Since
first reading was given to the bill certain facts have been
brought to our attention, and we will now give them an
in-depth analysis." Is this the way to legislate in the face of a

SENATE DEBATES
very important problem? The conservation of energy is an
important problem.
Senator Barrow told us, and quite properly, that the thinking of the government with respect to this is based on the
results of a survey, and a paper which is alleged to state the
energy policy of the Government of Canada. I have read that
document and can only conclude that the Government of
Canada bas no energy policy.
Those who understand this problem will have to determine
the legitimate rate of increase in energy use in Canada. There
are some informed economists, and others, who say that to
solve this problem the rate of increase should be zero. The
government has no policy in this respect other than what it
calls "targeting"-picking out items here and there, such as
air conditioners in automobiles. My suspicion is that someone
saw this as a source of extra revenue. There is no evidence
whatsoever that this additional tax will be a deterrent. Can
anyone believe that an individual who bas made the decision to
purchase an automobile with an air conditioning unit will be
deterred by this tax of $100? That will simply not deter people
from continuing that use of energy, or pollution, or whatever
problem it presents.
To my mind, this is not the type of legislation which will
attract any respect for the thinking behind it. It is an ad hoc,
badly conceived, badly presented piece of legislation. There are
features that can be commended, such as the attempt to get rid
of some of the red tape in respect of the excise tax for small
businesses. Instead of small businesses now having to apply for
a rebate, they are given some consideration whereby they can
avoid some of the red tape.
This bill represents, to my memory, the first piece of legislation to come before this chamber that shows a conscious
appreciation by the government, or by the bureaucracy upon
whom it depends for advice, that red tape places a major
constraint on productivity in Canada. The government has
been told that on many occasions, but this is the first time I
have seen an effort to get rid of some of the red tape.
There is not much more I can say about the bill. It is not the
kind of bill that indicates to me that those who are charged
with the responsibility of solving these very serious problems,
particularly the problem of energy conservation, are attacking
them in the proper way. These are some of the major problems
facing the Canadian economy today.
Senator Hicks: May I address a brief question to the
honourable senator?
In his remarks he continually referred to air conditioners in
automobiles as being not only users of energy but a source of
pollution. Has he any evidence whatsoever that air conditioners in automobiles contribute to pollution of any kind of our
environment?
Senator Flynn: They result in greater gasoline consumption.
Senator Hicks: That is not pollution.
Senator Grosart: No, I have no evidence, except, of course,
that the use of energy is in itself a form of pollution. If we use
energy, then we are polluting the human environment by using

February 8, 1977

something that should not be used in terms of the whole
problem of the ecology of the environment. That is the way in
which I used that phrase.
Senator Hicks: That is a complete misuse of the term
"pollution".
Senator Grosart: The honourable senator says it is a complete misuse of the term "pollution." It is very interesting that
he should say that. "Pollution" is an understandable English
word. One can pollute the atmosphere in many ways. One can
pollute the atmosphere by breathing or by not breathing. One
can say that the whole concept of pollutionSenator Hicks: Are we to have a law against breathing, too?
Senator Grosart: -is merely the relation of the use of the
environment to the human demands upon that environment.
I will not argue the point. It is enough to say, as far as I am
concerned, that it has not been proved that an air conditioning
unit in an automobile is necessarily a very high user of energy
in comparison to its alternatives. That is enough. If the
honourable senator objects to my using the term "pollution,"
then that again is just a matter of definition.
e

(2040)

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I should like to pursue
this question for a moment-and I am not speaking of that
raised by Senator Hicks because he might appear before the
committee in due course, and give his expert advice on whether
when you use more gas you pollute more. I think be would
prove the contrary. What I want to say is supportive of what
Senator Grosart said about the imposition of the tax on air
conditioners. I wonder if in committee tomorrow, if not
tonight, the sponsor of the bill would be able to tell us what
revenue the government expected from this tax. If I remember
correctly, when the budget was tabled quite a substantial sum
was mentioned as being derived from this new tax.
Secondly, I would like to know if that amount was calculated on the number of air conditioners sold in the previous year,
or if a reduction was contemplated.
Thirdly, in view of the fact that we have had close to one
year's experience, I would like to know how much the government has collected up to now, and whether the revenue would
indicate that there has been a smaller number of air conditioners sold since the introduction of the budget. I think that
information would be interesting, because we can then consider whether the decision of the government was really wise or
stupid.
Senator McElinan: Honourable senators, may I address a
question to Senator Grosart? In view of his references to
breathing and pollution, would he suggest that we breathe less
or that we should tax breathing?
Senator Grosart: Having in mind the tremendous search by
the present government for tax sources, regardless of the sense
or sensibility of them, I would not be the least bit surprised if
we were faced at some time with a tax on breathing.

(2050)

Some people may wonder why it is that it is only now, after
something like two and a half years, if my memory serves, that
we are bringing forward this substantive report. Some people
may say, "You have this immense document which is very
hard for people to follow because of its size. Why in the world
couldn't you bring these things forward sooner?" Well, there
are a variety of reasons for that. Some of them will appear in
what I have to say later. One reason is that we had the most
extraordinary housekeeping difficulties: getting our arrangements made; getting a quorum in the first place; getting the
money that was required; getting the equipment that was
required; it was a gargantuan task.
I wish that I had kept a record of the amount of time that I
spent on the telephone, writing letters and interviewing officials to get the things that we required. Some of the
housekeeping difficulties were utterly fantastic. We had great
difficulty, for example, and I believe we are still having some
difficulty, in getting copies of certain parts of the Canada
Gazette. I think that copies which come to me go on or are
passed on by my secretary to counsel for the committee.
We had difficulty in the first place in getting copies of the
Revised Statutes of Canada. We had difficulty after difficulty
after difficulty. We had delay after delay after delay. This
went on through a considerable part of our proceedings.
Another feature of the thing was that while some departments were extremely good and very cooperative, answered our
questions very fully and with reasonable promptitude, others
were extraordinarily slow and others were evasive, while others
were really obstructive. I shall come to the particular department which was notably obstructive before I am finished.
Some, of course, simply treated us with a majestic and impenetrable silence.
Senator Flynn: Name it right away.
Senator Forsey: No, no, no. I want to preserve the suspense.
I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is a reader of thrillers,
and it would be a shame to have the clue to the thing presented
to him too soon.
Senator Benidickson: Do it in serial form.
Senator Forsey: I want to emphasize the vital importance of
this committee. Somebody said to me the other day, when I
was being interviewed on the air about it, "Why in the world is
it that aIl this stuff that you have brought out, these horrendous revelations of illegalities, flagrant illegalities, why have
they not been discovered sooner? Why haven't members of the
Senate and House of Commons got on to them sooner?" Weil,
I think the answer is that the volume of the material is so
enormous and the time which is available even to members of
this house, let alone to members of the House of Commons, for
scrutinizing this vast mass of documents is so small, that it is
really impossible to do the job unless you have a committee
which is specifically dedicated to this particular job and which

February 8, 1977

is provided with the kind of distinguished counsel which we
have.
We get enormous masses of stuff. Usually at each meeting
we have a pile of documents, oh, six or eight inches high. Some
of these are quite inoffensive. They are scrutinized, of course,
first by our counsel who draw our attention to anything which
they think is open to objection on any of the grounds listed in
our 14 criteria, criteria, I may add, which were adopted of
course by both houses. Sometimes, of course, members of the
committee spot something which has escaped the eagle eye of
counsel, but, in general, we find ourselves faced with a fair
number of documents, sometimes very complicated indeed,
each one very complicated indeed, a fair number of documents
on which our counsel have careful and sometimes elaborate
and prolonged memoranda for us. And it is by no means easy
to do this task, even though we ordinarily meet once a week
while the two houses are sitting and once a month during any
recess.
It is a job which is completely beyond any ordinary private
member of either house, and I do not mean by "ordinary"
ordinary in intellectual capacity, but any member of either
house who has not an enormous battery of counsel, research
assistants and so forth at his disposal. It is a specialized job, a
very highly specialized job. The law involved is a very highly
specialized branch of law.
And so, as we did not want to do a scamped job and we
wanted to be fair to the regulation-making authorities, even
where it took a long time to get replies from them, we
proceeded with due deliberation and did not try to jump the
gun on anybody or come before either house with a premature
report on particular instruments which we thought were defective or objectionable; and especially we did not want to come
before the houses and find that somebody would say, "Well, if
you had given us a little more time, we could have explained
that to your satisfaction and you would not be taking up the
time of the house with this superfluous dissertation on something we could have made plain to you if we had just been
given a very little more time."
I particularly hope that ail the lawyers in the house will read
this report very carefully, because there are parts of it which I
think will tell more to the eye of the lawyer than they will to
the eye of the non-lawyer. There are certain parts of it which I
myself find it rather difficult to follow as precisely and as
thoroughly as I should wish, simply because I have not had the
legal training. I therefore hope that this discussion which I am
initiating tonight will not suffer the sad fate of the discussion
which I tried to initiate on the proposais for patriation of the
Constitution last session, when I made my speech and hoped
that that would stir others better informed than myself and
more competent; and my speech sank like a stone into a barrel
of tar and just slowly disappeared without producing one
single whisper or squeak from any other member of this house;
although one particular member learned in the law had said to
me beforehand that there was a very serious point which ought

was a great pity that nobody had got up and made this point
thoroughly. And I said, "Well, really, senator, you know, there
is one person who might have done it. He is sitting opposite me
at this table, and I thought you were going to do it and I was
highly disappointed that you did not."
Well, I hope the members of the legal profession in this
house on this occasion will read the report carefully and give
us the benefit of their views.
I venture to think that this kind of report, which after all is
really an attempt to vindicate the liberties of the subject, to
vindicate the rights of the ordinary citizen, is something to
which the Senate should give very special attention. I do not
think that perhaps people in the country at large realize how
much we do in the way of protecting the interests of the
ordinary citizen, and we do it in committee after committee
after committee, tidying up untidy legislation, clarifying
obscure legislation and making sure to a considerable degree
that the ordinary citizen is not put to a lot of needless expense
and trouble simple because of the obscurity or untidiness of
legislation which comes before us. And the subordinate legislation which now reaches into every nook and cranny of the
citizen's life is fully as important in many instances as the
substantive legislation enacted by Parliament itself. As we all
know, Parliament nowadays in many matters can simply pass
an act which is a sort of framework, and the details of the
affair and the carrying out of the thing must be looked after
by regulations or statutory instruments of some kind. And if
you look at the list even of the ones which are cited in this
report, you will see that they are of extraordinary range and
extraordinary depth and extraordinary volume and that they
touch on one issue after another of really primary importance.

I think that one of the things we can do in this bouse, where
we have perhaps rather more time, rather less pressure upon
us, and rather less tendency to become partisan, is to consider
carefully reports of this kind, carefully and critically, not
necessarily simply with profound admiration or genuflection
before the wisdom of the committee, or its counsel, or its
chairmen, or anybody else, but critically, carefully, so that we
can make sure that the citizen is adequately protected against
abuses of this enormous mass of subordinate legislation.
The task which this committee is performing is a new one in
Canada. It has not been done here before, at least in the
Parliament of Canada. There have been some committees-I
think they are still in their very early stages-in some provincial legislatures. Work of this sort has been done by a committee or committees in the United Kingdom for a very long time,
I think since about 1932. Work has been done in Australia,
certainly, for some considerable time. About New Zealand I
can't speak with the same assurance. But in Canada this is
something new, and this, of course, means that the committee's task is perhaps more formidable than if we had been at it
for a long time and if everybody in the departments, for
example, and on the various boards and commissions had been
accustomed to the thing. At present they regard us as a
novelty. Some of them, I suspect, regard us as an obnoxious

80003-26

novelty. Some of them wish we would just go away. But a
novelty we are and they are not accustomed to us, and
accordingly sometimes I think they treat us with less seriousness than I think the matter deserves.
I want to say just a word about the criteria which we
followed. I want to make two things very clear. One is that we
are not concerned solely with the vires of the instruments
which come before us. That is an important point. We want to
be sure that these powers in subordinate legislation are used
within the confines of the enabling sections of legislation which
empower the various authorities to make the regulations or
statutory instruments.
This is terribly important and has been a very large part of
our work. Over and over and over again we have been obliged
to question the vires of instruments which come before us.
Over and over and over again they have appeared to us to be
wholly illegal, beyond the powers of regulation-making authority. Sometimes the authority has been able to convince us that,
in fact, they are intra vires, within its powers, but in a great
many cases they have not been able to convince us, and in a
great many other cases they have replied with something that I
shall come to in more detail later, what I call the recorded
message.
When we say, "Now why do you think this is within your
powers? We don't think it is. It doesn't appear to us to follow
the terms of section so and so under which it purports to be
passed." In a great many cases we have had the reply, "The
answer to this question would involve a legal opinion which, as
you know, I ai not allowed to give." We had that so often
that I came to call it the recorded message. In one letter we
actually had it five times over. We had five questions, "Why
do you think this is intra vires? We don't think it is." "That
would require the giving of legal opinion which, as you know, I
am not allowed to give; that would require the giving of legal
opinion which, as you know, I am not allowed to give"; and so
on.
Now we seem to be within sight-I dare not say more-of
some amelioration of the situation. You will find something in
the report on that.
I hope that we are going to get better results. I hope that the
measures which the Minister of Justice is proposing will give
us better results. But this has been one thing that has held us
up and made it very difficult, because nearly all the instruments officers in the various departments are employees of the
Department of Justice. There are few who aren't. From them
we have had excellent cooperation. But the ones who are
employees of the Department of Justice, relying on a letter
from the deputy minister, which is part of our records-I am
not revealing anything secret-relying on a letter from the
deputy minister, which for obscurity and ambiguity is perhaps
as great a masterpiece as even the late Mr. Mackenzie King
was ever able to achieve, relying on this letter from the deputy
minister, have come out with "We can't answer that; we are
bound; we are employees of the Department of Justice; we
cannot give you a legal opinion." We have said, "Well, we
don't want the text of a legal opinion."

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Flynn: Ask Senator Langlois. Senator Langlois was
always able to get an opinion from the Department of Justice
on the constitutionality or verity of any bill. He should be able
to help you.
Senator Forsey: We have had it in Committees of this
house. I have listened to it myself. Anyway, this is what we
got: "Oh no, we can't do that. If the department wants to give
you the substance of this"-If you ask for an explanation, they
say, "Oh yes, if the receiving department which bas got the
thing wants to give you the substance, that is all right. But, of
course, there is the confidentiality." Then comes another cloud
of verbiage which I for one found myself completely unable to
understand, the substance of which really boiled down, as far
as I could make out, to a version of "Hang your clothes on a
hickory limb but don't go near the water."
For a long time we were held up on this kind of thing. We
discussed it with the minister, we discussed it with the deputy
minister, we went over and over the thing, and we "ever more
came out by that same door wherein we went." Well, now we
have at last got something which looks as if it might possiblyand I am qualifying it very carefully-might possibly get over
the worst of the difficulties we have had in this regard.
But we are not solely concerned, although we are very much
concerned, with the question of vires. We are very much
concerned with a variety of other matters such as the comprehensibility, the clarity, of the subordinate legislation, the
instruments which come before us. We think they ought to be
as comprehensible as possible to the ordinary citizen, that it
should not be necessary for him to hire high-powered legal
talent to find out what the things mean. We think they should
be free of contradictions, which they are not always. We think
they should follow the language of the act and not simply
change the wording, which they sometimes do, at the whim of
expert translators, for whom we have the greatest possible
respect but who, after all, are not entitled to change the words
of acts of Parliament.
We are also concerned, of course, with whether the subordinate legislation makes an undue or unexpected use of the
powers granted by Parliament-something which may be intra
vires, within the powers granted, but something which we
suspect may not really have been intended by Parliament. We
feel at liberty to draw the attention of both houses to that kind
of thing.
We are not concerned with policy. If it's a matter of
government policy, even if some of us are not enthusiastic
about the policy, that in this committee is not our affair. That
is perfectly clear. But we are concerned both with the vires and
with matters like undue trespassing upon the liberties of the
subject, retroactive legislation, where there is no provision in
the statute for retroactivity, and so forth and so on.
The next point I want to make is that one of our difficulties
has been the extraordinary obscurity and arbitrariness of the
definition of the statutory instrument contained in the Statutory Instruments Act, section 2(1)(d).

February 8, 1977

We have not yet been able to find any lawyer who can give
us a clear interpretation of that, and it is absolutely vital
because it is the means by which the officials have attempted
to prevent us from seeing various documents which we think
we are entitled to see. They say "No, no, that is not a statutory
instrument." "Well, why not?" "Because section 2(1)(d) of
the act says thus and so thus and so" at infinite length and
with infinite involutions and convolutions.
We took the matter up with the Department of Justice, and
we got a reply, or several replies, from the legal adviser to the
Privy Council Office. As you will see, if you look at one of the
appendices to the report, it is a reply which is not only
incomprehensible but which is self-contradictory, and which
leaves the committee very seriously hampered in its efforts to
examine many documents which we are quite persuaded it was
the intention of Parliament we should have the right to
scrutinize.
We see no solution to that problem except a redrafting of
the definition section. There are various things you could do to
tinker with it, but none of them would be satisfactory. What
we ought to have is a simple definition with clearly expressed
exceptions. There are certain documents which certainly we
ought not to see-ones dealing with national security and that
kind of thing. It is perfectly easy to draw up a list of these
exceptions, but to make sure by the definition that otherwise
all subordinate legislation comes before this committee.
What we find now is that in the opinion of the legal advisers
of the Privy Council Office there must be certain magic
phrases in the legislation if the thing is to be called a statutory
instrument.. So if the legislation says, "The Governor in Council may by order," ah, that's a statutory instrument; but if it
says, "The Governor in Council may do," without the words
"by order" or by "by warrant" or by this, by that or by the
other thing, that is not a statutory instrument. The magic
phrase is not in there. Of course, in many instances, we find
that things which even the Privy Council Office and the
Department of Justice admit to be statutory instruments never
get to us at all, because they are not necessarily published.
There is a whole maze of difficulties there. In some instances
we have come across what are undoubtedly and admittedly,
even in the eyes of the Department of Justice, statutory
instruments, simply because, when we have been inquiring
about one thing of one department, another department has
said, "Oh yes. Well, these are just like what they have in such
and such a department." And they say, "Oh yes. Yes. We have
some. Would you like to see them?" But they have never been
published. We stumble, as our counsel said, as the report says,
across some of these things. We come across them by accident,
and the fact that you have this magic formula which must be
invoked to give us jurisdiction means that you have two
sections of the same act, one of which puts in the magic
formula, and the other of which doesn't, and you have a pair of
instruments which are identical in terms, but one of which is a
statutory instrument, and the other is not. One has been
brought in under the magic formula and the other has not.
And you have a tissue of inconsistencies which make it

extraordinarily difficuit for us to do our work. Tbe only way
out of tbis is ta get a firm, clear, brief definition witb firm,
clear, specific exceptions of a kind wbicb ail of us would admit
to be necessary.
a (211)
Now, the next tbing we bave run into is a great deal of
sub-delegation. Even I, witb my lack of legal training, bave
long been aware of the maxim, "Delegatus non potest delegare, " or wbatever tbe proper Latin phrase is.
Senator Flynn: We get the gist of it.
Senator Forsey: 1 bow to tbe classicists, and especially the
civil iaw iawyers bere. But we aIl know wbat tbat means, I
bope. A delegate cannot delegate. If a power is given by
Parliament to, tbe Governor in Council, the Governor in Council in our judgment bas no rigbt and no power to, say, "Te
inspector of the tiddly-winks factory, or the groom of the
backstairs, shaîl make regulations." If tbe power is given to the
Governor in Council to make regulations, tbe Governor in
Council must make tbe regulations, and tbere sbould be no
sub-deiegation. The documents wbicb come before us, bowever, are full of sub-delegations, and the usual excuse given for
tbem is tbat our statutes are replete witb the word, "respecting." "The Governor in Council--or tbe board, or tbe commission-may make regulations respecting," sucb and sucb, and
the Department of Justice takes the line tbat tbat is like "in
relation to" in the British North America Act. But our repiy
is, "Tbat pbrase in tbe British Nortb America Act appiies to
Parliament or to the legislatures of tbe provinces, sovereign in
their spberes as tbis Parliament is sovereign witbin its spbere,
and it does not apply to subordinate legislation." Subordinate
Iegislation is subordinate, and a regulation-making autbority
bas no right to assume that bie bas tbe samne plenary powers as
Parliament.
We aIl, if we bave any acquaintance witb constitutional law
at all, wiii recali tbe dictum of tbe judicial committee in
Hodge vs. The Queen tbat the provincial legislatures and, of
course, the Parliament of Canada, witbin tbe limits of subject
and area prescribed by the British Nortb America Act, enjoy
autbority "as plenary and as ample as tbe Imperiai Parliament
in tbe plenitude of its power possessed and could bestow." The
delegates of Parliament, bowever, do not enjoy autbority as
plenary and as ample as the Imperial Parliament in the
plenitude of its power possessed and couid bestow, thougb
many of the officiais act as if tbey did, and tbey insist that
tbey bave this rigbt. Tbe word "respecting" does not occur in
United Kingdom statutes. Tbis is a tbing of our own invention
bere in Canada, and our committee feels that it is bigbiy
undesirable that tbis word sbould continue to, be employed in
aur statutes, as long as tbe Department of Justice takes this
bigb-banded attitude tbat a mere officiai can assume tbe
powers tbat bave been granted by Parliament ta the Governor
in Council or to a specific board or commission.
Now I come to one of tbe real gems of aur experience.
Before 1 was ever in bigh school I learned that the dispensing
power-the power to dispense witb tbe provisions of a lawbad been made illegal by the Bill of Rigbts of 1689. I learned

80003-26'/2

that one of the tbings tbat cost James Il bis tbrone was that bie
assumed the power to dispense witb laws and to make exceptions from tbe laws for particular persons or particular groups.
1 know 1I larned this before 1 went to bigb scbool because 1
remember the book I read it in, and I have neyer Iooked at that
book since 1 went to bigh scbool. Nonetheless, a very bigh
personage indeed, in a letter submitted to the committee,
described what we were saying about tbe dispensing power as
".a novel legal tbeory." Novel! It bas been a part of the
constitutional law for nearly 300 years. Wben we drew attention to tbe fact tbat tbey were trying to exercise tbis dispensing
power, trying to mount tbe tbrone wbicb James Il bad been
obliged to vacate, we got tbe most extraordinary series of
replies. For the benefit, bowever, perbaps, of tbose wbo may
flot be aware of quite wbat tbe dispensing power involves, 1
bad better give examples.
In tbe Parole Act, tbere is a provision tbat tbe parole board
may exempt any class or category of persons from certain
provisions. Tbat is perfectiy clear. We ail sec tbat. But Io and
beboid, wbat comes before us but speciai parole board order
No. 1. "Jacques Leblanc is bereby exempt from tbe provisions-" of sucb and sucb. We said, "But you can't do this.
Jacques Leblanc is not a category or ciass of persons." I
suppose anybody from Moncton migbt have said, "Oh, well, bie
is, because bis name is legion." As somebody said to, me once,
"Les Leblanc sont une tribu." But in tbis case it was a
particular Jacques Leblanc, and it was a bard case. We alI
know tbat hard cases make bad law, but bere was an instance.
He was a bard case. He had been involved in a murder witb
several juveniles wbo bad got ratber ligbt sentences, but bie got
a sentence that the authorities considered ratber disproportionate. Tbey said, "Poor fellow, be's getting the sbort end of tbe
stick," so tbey passed this special order exempting bim.
We said, "But if you want to do this you bave a perfectly
recognized legal way of doing it. You can exercise the royal
prerogative of mercy and commute bis sentence. You can give
bim a pardon. You can give bim a conditional pardon. You
can do a variety of tbings that are perfectiy legal, but you
cannet do tbîs." "Wby not?" "Because it's the dispensing
power." Tbey said, "Well, wbat's that?" So our counsel said to
them, "It's sometbing tbat was made unlawful by the Bill of
Rigbts of 1689."
Tbereupon be got a series of teiepbone cails from legal
officer after legal officer in various departments saying,
"Wbat's tbis? We've looked in Mr. Diefenbaker's Bill of
Rigbts, and we can't find it." Our counsel said, ratber disgustedly, "No, it's not in Mr. Diefenbaker's Bill of Rigbts." Tbey
said, "Well, wbere is it? Is it in the American Bill of Rigbts?"
We said, "No, its not in tbe American Bill of Rigbts." "Weli,"
tbey said, "wbat is it?" We said, "It's the Bill of Rigbts tbat
foliowed the glorious revolution of 1688." "Weli," tbey said,
"'wbat revolution was tbat?" Our counsel tben read tbem a
iittle lecture in constitutional law and constitutional bistory.
One wonders wbcre tbese people went to get tbeir constitutionai law. One is inciined to suspect that in Canadian law scbools
now, too often, constitutional law means simpiy the division of

SENATE DEBATES
powers between the Dominion and the provinces, and just
neglects the whole English seventeenth century, which established the rights of Parliament as against the arbitrary powers
of the Crown.
However, our counsel, as I say, read them a little lecture,
and then some of the legal officers came back with this: "The
Bill of Rights of 1689 is no part of the law of Canada." When
I heard this reported to me over the telephone I nearly hit the
ceiling. I said, "What nonsense. Of course it's part of the law
of Canada."
Well, our counsel argued with them and after awhile they
climbed half way down. They said, "All right. We can't
dispense with the provisions of a statute, but we can dispense
with the provisions of a validly enacted instrument or regulations." We said, "No, you can't. There's plenty of jurisprudence to show that subordinate legislation is just as much law
as the substantive legislation by virtue of which it is passed.
You cannot dispense."
We have another example of this-another beautiful and
flagrant example. I think it is in sections 19 and 20 of the
Navigable Waters Protection Act, where there is a provision
that, I think, the Governor in Council may exempt any stream,
lake, river or body of water from certain prohibitions of
dumping refuse. Well, that is perfectly clear. That's all right. I
think the provision for exempting rivers, lakes, streams or
bodies of water is in section 21. The provisions about dumping,
which are otherwise mandatory, are in the two preceding
sections.
What do we get but a regulation or instrument of some
kind-I've forgotten just what now-saying, "Denison Mines
Limited is hereby exempted from the provisions regarding
dumping of waste in the area shown on the attached map of
the Department of Transport." Well, we said, "Look: you can't
do this. In the first place, Denison Mines Limited is not a
river, lake, stream or body of water. In the second place, the
exemption which is provided for is an exemption for anybody
dumping things in a particular river, lake, stream or body of
water. And in every previous order of this kind the river, lake,
stream or body of water has been defined with great particularity. Not just 'take a look at the attached map.' So a
valid order could say anybody can now dump this refuse,
anybody at all. But a valid order cannot say Denison Mines
Limited. This is completely ultra vires. This is an exercise in
dispensing power which cost James Il his throne." We have
not yet, I think, convinced these gentry, these "latter day
Stuarts," as one constitutional law professor called them-we
have not yet convinced them that they do not possess the
power to dispense with the provisions of valid subordinate
legislation. We are still fighting that one, and we intend to go
on fighting it, if it takes all summer, as a celebrated American
general said, and, indeed, from past experience, I fear it may
take several summers, and that eventually I may leave this
place simply by the operation of natural circumstances, at the
age of 75, finding that the battle is still only partly won. I do
not like to be pessimistic, but after some of the experiences we
have had, I am not at all optimistic.

February 8, 1977

* (2120)

The next point I want to draw attention to, I shall simply
mention and leave it to honourable senators well acquainted
with the situation to deal with at some length, as they see fit.
That is the practice of enacting substantive legislation by
appropriation acts, sometimes by $1 items, of which we have
made many complaints in this house, and the series of subordinate-pieces of subordinate legislation which often follow
from that, where it requires the industry and ingenuity of
really a battery of lawyers, you might say, to find out where
the authority for a particular order or an instrument comes
from. You trace it back, you find it is the appropriation act of
a certain year which refers to a previous appropriation act,
which refers to another one, which refers to another one, such
and such a vote in an appropriation act, eight or ten years
back, perhaps, and you look in the vote and you cannot find it,
and you ask the department and they say, "Oh, it is in the
estimates." Not even in the vote. But you have to look in the
estimates, and sometimes the things they do in this way are
far-fetched beyond description. There are some specific examples of it in the report. I shan't enter into that because it is a
matter which lawyers would be able to handle much better
than I. It is extremely complex. It would take a long time, and
we have reported our opinion that this is an improper way of
providing for subordinate legislation. That is perhaps hardly
more that an echo, a resounding echo of much that has been
said on this subject in this house.
Then there is a final section in our report which I think is
exceedingly important, Section W. In Great Britain, as honourable senators, most of you, at all events, probably know, in
a great many instances, when subordinate legislation is enacted, there is provision that it shall not come into force without
an affirmative vote in the House of Commons within a certain
period of time, or that it shall go out of effect if there is a
negative vote in the House of Commons within a certain
period of time. So that this gives Parliament a certain chance
to see that the thing either never goes into effect if it is
improper in any way, or objectionable in the opinion of
Parliament, or that if it has gone into effect, it goes out of
effect promptly, if Parliament considers that it should not
remain in effect. We have nothing of that sort here, except, I
think, in about eleven statutes and we are convinced that it
would be desirable to have this much more general in Canadian statutes. At present we never see these things until after
they have gone into effect, sometimes long after they have
gone into effect, and sometimes, even when they have gone
into effect, we never see them at all because they are not
published, and there is no requirement that they should be
published, and sometimes they are published only if the Clerk
of the Privy Council is of opinion that in the public interest
this document, though perhaps not a statutory instrument,
ought to be published. This is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and
we think that one way of getting over this difficulty and giving
Parliament more control over subordinate legislation would be
to follow the British practice, perhaps not in every instance,
but in many instances, giving Parliament a chance to look at

February 8, 1977

the thing before it goes into effect, or look at it immediately
after it goes into effect, and stop it.
Now I want to say just one main thing further, and that is
that, as honourable senators will already have gathered from
some of my earlier comments, this committee bas uncovered
some glaring illegalities, things that I wouldn't have believed
were possible if I hadn't actually seen them in front of me.
Sometimes I felt almost as if I could not believe my eyes, that
the thing I was looking at could not be possible, that it was a
hallucination; as one of Wodehouse's characters said, "one of
those things, chaps, that begin with 'H' ". But we had some
perfectly beautiful glaring illegalities.
* (2130)

sheet because we have acted illegally and I ask the house to
pass an act of indemnity indemnifying Dr. Drummond Shields
against the consequences of having broken a certain act of
Parliament." Of course, he got his act of indemnity.
There is no question that an act of indemnity here would go
through like winking. But apparently the government wants to
put it in one of these omnibus bills covering ail sorts of
amendments, and it is not coming forward. AIl the Public
Service Commission is prepared to do is to say, "Look, we will
now make these appointments under section 39 of the act"
which means that in future they could make appointments of
this sort quite legally; they did not use section 39 before-"We
hope this will be satisfactory." When it came up to the
committee I said, "As far as I am concerned it is not satisfactory at ail, because this has no effect upon the illegal regulations that have been promulgated before, clearly, a great many
of them. This defect cannot be cured except by a retroactive
act of indemnity by Parliament, and there is no sign of that
yet."

One of them is still under discussion, and that is section 7(2)
of the Public Service Regulations. I shall not go into the
details, although I can do so if necessary, or somebody else can
take it up, somebody learned in the law. What it amounts to is
this, that we got a certain amendment, a new subsection (2) of
section 7 of the regulations brought before us; we examined it
and arrived at the conclusion that it was beyond the powers of

before the House of Commons and said, "I appear in a white still shuffling their feet on that one, if I remember.

SENATE DEBATES
Now comes the real gem of the collection. Back in 1974and I have got the exact reference here-it was necessary in an
emergency to dispose quickly of certain feed grain. They set up
a committee to do this. They did not pass, but they should
have passed, regulations providing for the establishment of the
committee. Instead they just set up the committee, and the
committee made rules and disposed of the grain. One year and
twelve days afterwards, regulations were passed providing for
the setting up of the committee-one year and twelve days
after! The committee had had no legal existence at ail when it
was set up, and it had proceeded to act without any legal
warrant whatsoever to dispose of feed grain before it had any
legal existence. We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw
this.
Senator Benidickson: Did the Auditor General note that
one?
Senator Forsey: I don't know whether he noted it or not.
Anyway, there it is. If you want the reference you can find it
in our proceedings, number 67, page 30, April 8, 1976.
When we addressed remonstrances to the official concerned
he said, "Oh, but there was an emergency. We had to do this,"
he explained. We said, "Yes, it was an emergency. But what
passes our comprehension is, if they could find the people to sit
on the committee-and they evidently did-and the committee
could meet, which it did, and take certain action, which it did,
why on earth could they not have drawn up the document
providing for its existence? Why on earth did they have to wait
a year and twelve days to draw up the document which made
this whole thing legal, which of course is not retroactive?"
This kind of thing simply sends the shudders down one's
spine. One wonders if one is living in a country governed by
the rule of law, or whether these "latter-day Stuarts" to quote
that phrase again, have not simply arrogated to themselves
powers which really even the Crown never possessed, or has
not possessed for many centuries. This is the kind of thing that
I find really frightening.
I don't know that there is any ill intent in these things. I
think in most cases the people concerned are perfectly honest
and decent people. In some instances they pass regulations
which do not provide for any hearing for an aggrieved party,
or don't provide for any right of appeal, and sometimes they
say to us, "Weil, we have never had any difficulty. We have
never had anybody complain of our decisions. True, we have
arbitrary power, but we have never had a complaint so we
don't need to worry about it." This is simply not good enough.
We have therefore drawn up a long series of recommendations, which come at the conclusion of our report, which are
intended to deal with these problems we have encountered, and
very serious problems I think. In most cases I suspect the
officiais are just people who have no knowledge of basic
constitutional law and no sense of the place of law in society.
They are efficient technicians; they want to get the job done.
They see something that urgently requires to be done and they
have never heard, or never paid any attention to, St. Paul's
exhortation, "Let ail things be done decently and in order."

February 8, 1977

When you get things done indecently and in disorder, even
admirable things done illegally, you are opening the door to
tyranny; you are opening the door to the return of something
like a Stuart despotism; worse however, because it is by a
myriad of minor officiais in many instances, or sometimes
major officials.

I conclude by saying that I think the Senate has a special
responsibility in this to look after the public interest and to
look after the interest of the ordinary citizen. At some point in
her reign, I cannot say exactly when, the first Queen Elizabeth
addressed her judges in terms which I shall quote in a moment
and which I think can be applied to members of this house:
Have a care over my people. You have my people-do
you that which I ought to do. They are my people. Every
man oppresseth them and spoileth them without mercy;
they cannot revenge their quarrel, nor help themselves.
See unto them, see unto them, for they are my charge. I
charge you, even as God hath charged me.
Senator Goldenberg: Will the honourable senator allow a
question? Am I right in concluding that what the committee is
complaining of-and I am aware of some of the complaintshas been going on for many years and is not a matter of
merely recent history? Am I right in that?
Senator Forsey: Yes, Senator Goldenberg, although on this
we are to some extent surmising, because our jurisdiction, as
honourable senators are aware, begins with January 1, 1972.
Orders and regulations and instruments which were passed
before that, we have no jurisdiction over, but in a good many
instances we have strong suspicions that this has been going on
for some time, and in the case of that Public Service Regulation 7(2) it is perfectly plain on the confession of the commission that it has been going on for some time. It is hoped that
within a few months there will be issued a new consolidation of
the regulations. I think it will involve some 10,000 regulations,
or some large number like that, and then, ail those things
having been, as it were, re-passed, they will come within our
purview and the imagination boggles at the task which the
committee counsel and the committee will have in examining
these regulations. But I greatly fear that they will show that,
in fact, some of these practices have been going on for some
considerable time.
Senator Lang: I wonder if I might ask the honourable
senator a question? There is possibly a second line of defence
against these latter-day Stuarts, and that is recourse to the
courts. In the course of the deliberations of the committee, did
you find any instances in which those affected by regulatory
powers had challenged their vires through recourse to the
courts?
Senator Forsey: I do not recall any, honourable senator. I
know of cases in which it has been done, but I do not think
they came before us. I speak subject to correction and other
members of the committee may remember some cases, but we
did not have very many. But one of the points we make in the
report very strongly is that it should not be necessary for the

February 8, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

citizen to have to go to the courts, sometimes with great
difficulty and at great expense, simply because of defects in
statutory instruments, simply because of their obscurity or
their ambiguity or because there is no provision for a proper
hearing or for an appeal. In some instances in the present state
of some of these cases of subordinate legislation the recourse to
the Federal Court under, I think it is, section 28 of the Federal
Court Act would be perhaps very difficult. Indeed, one point
we make is that the citizen ought not to be obliged to go to the
courts in order to get his rights. They should be safeguarded as
far as possible in the drafting of the legislation itself.
I know, however, that there have been cases in which people
who have been illegally dismissed, for example, have gone to
the courts and have won their cases. I happen to have as my
lawyer Mr. Maurice Wright, Q.C., who is also the lawyer for
the Canadian Labour Congress, and be has given me cases
within his own experience which amply support the kind of
thing we have run into. For instance, there was one case of a
man in the Northwest Territories who had a probationary
period of six months, and at the end of eight months be was
dismissed. So he went to, I suppose, his union in the Public
Service. Anyway, the case came to Mr. Wright and he took it
to the courts and he won his case and won costs, which were
considerable, by the way, as the Department of Justice insisted
on the case being heard in Vancouver on the ground that it
had sevéral witnesses to call in Vancouver. It called exactly
one. He won his case and the argument put forward there by
the Public Service authorities was: "Well, our right to dismiss
him is based on . . ." I think it was Bulletin No. 12. "Well, let
us sec Bulletin No. 12," said the court. So they produced
Bulletin No. 12 and it turned out that they had no more power
to pass Bulletin No. 12 than I have. It was just totally illegal.
So the gentleman was restored to his position.
Then, of course, there was the case of Mr. Rudnicki, with
which everyone, I hope, is familiar-a lamentable exhibition,
incidentally. Then there was a further case, where a gentleman
applied-and this also came to the courts; Mr. Wright took
this and won it-a gentleman applied for a position in accountancy in one of the departments; in National Revenue, I
believe. There was a competition and he won the competition
and was streets, miles ahead of everybody else. He got the job
and after he had been there a certain length of time-this may
have been where Bulletin No. 12 came in; I have forgotten
now. They are, perhaps, mingled in my head. Anyway, he got
the job and after a few months there was a competition for a
better job, for which he felt he was qualified and he put in an
application for it. They said; "Oh, no; you cannot do that,
because you have to be a fuli year in the job before you can
apply for another one." Yes; that is where Bulletin No. 12
came in; I have forgotten what they invoked in the other case.
"Who says so?" The answer was: "Bulletin No. 12 says so." It
turned out that Bulletin No. 12 was not worth the paper it was
written on; it was completely ultra vires; it had no legal basis
whatsoever. What they did, however, was to take the man who
had come in second in the previous competition, who was way,
way behind the previous man and plunk him into the job. So

3U

this case also was taken to the courts and was also won by Mr.
Wright, with costs.
In one of these cases there was a very curious sequel. The
court said, "This man is entitled to certain money" and the
government would not pay him. So Mr. Wright had to go back
to the Federal Court and say, "What about this? We thought
we had got this." In fact, when he made his application, Mr.
Justice Heald, I think it was, said to him, "Mr. Wright, I
cannot understand this; I thought this court had already
pronounced on this case." "Yes, my Lord," said Mr. Wright,
"you are being asked to sit in appeal on your own judgment."
They got the money eventually, but it took two cases in the
court, and we do not feel that this kind of thing should go on;
that these people should be able to play ducks and drakes with
employees of the public on the basis of something they
dreamed up out of their own inner consciousness, which has no
legal basis whatever.
Let us by ail means provide for recourse to the courts; that
is indispensable. But let us also provide for proper procedures
under legislation and under subordinate legislation so that the
citizen will not be obliged to have recourse to the courts at
great difficulty and expense when he should not be.
Senator Robichaud: May I ask a question of my esteemed
colleague and friend, Senator Forsey? Before I frame my
question, I would like to congratulate him on a report extremely well done, and his report tonight on the report. If there are
ambiguities, anomalies, grey areas in the report itself, there
certainly were none in the remarks made by Senator Forsey
tonight.
There was something, though, that puzzled me a little. I
understood at the outset of his remarks that the committee
almost condemns the practice of a government's passing legislation that would have retroactive effect, although I understand that that was routine under a government in the province
of Quebec prior to 1960. I disagree with that policy myself, of
passing retroactive legislation. However, during the course of
his remarks under one point he said that something had been
done by the government illegally over a number of years, and
be intended to introduce legislation himself to correct a situation that was illegal which would involve, of course, passing
legislation which would have retroactive effect. How do we
reconcile the two? I am simply asking for clarification.
* (2150)

Senator Forsey: I think the reconciliation can be achieved
simply by my making clear what I was saying. I probably
hurried too quickly over this. When I talked about retroactive
effect being one of the things that we examined by our criteria,
I was talking about subordinate legislation. We look at a
particular piece of subordinate legislation, a particular instrument, to see whether it has retroactive effect and, if so,
whether Parliament has provided for retroactive effect. If
Parliament has provided for it, that is fine; we have nothing
further to say, because our Parliament, unlike American legislatures, has the power to pass laws having retroactive effect,
and this is, on occasion, very necessary, though it should be
used, of course, with discretion. But subordinate legislation, we

SENATE DEBATES
contend, should not have retroactive effect unless Parliament
has specifically provided for it. If Parliament says that the
Governor in Council shall have power to make regulations
having retroactive effect to such and such a date, fine; we have
nothing to say about that. Parliament has decided, and it is not
our business to comment on Parliament's decision. But if
Parliament merely says that the Governor in Council may
make regulations, and there is nothing about retroactive effect,
and then we find that a regulation purports to have retroactive
effect, we say, "Here, you can't do that; you have not got the
power to do that. That is ultra vires." On the other hand,
when it comes to a piece of subordinate legislation which is
clearly ultra vires which Parliament never gave the commission power to pass, to adopt, then we say the only way out of
this is a retroactive act of indemnity validating retroactively
the illegal acts which took place. I think there is a difference
there. The power to pass retroactive legislation, the power of
Parliament or a legislature to pass retroactive legislation, is
undoubted, and it is not the affair of this committee at all. If
such a piece of legislation comes before us in this Chamber, we
may say, "We think this is an inappropriate instance of using
this power," but it is a perfectly valid thing. But if you get a
piece of subordinate legislation which purports to be retroactive when in fact Parliament has given no power for such
retroactive instrument, then we object, we take objection. I do
not think there is any inconsistency between these two positions. I expressed myself probably in too summary a fashion in
my first reference to it. I think that is what gave rise to the
misgivings which, very naturally, occurred to the honourable
Senator Robichaud.
Senator Benidickson: Honourable senators, could 1, too, ask
a question? First, I should like, without repetition, to join in
the compliments extended by Senator Robichaud to the joint
chairman of the committee.
Senator Forsey drew particular attention to paragraph "W"
appearing at page 291 of the Minutes of the Proceedings of
the Senate of Thursday last, which relates to paragraph 142 of
the report. That paragraph deals with the recommendation
that we in Canada should use more the British practice of
making both affirmative and negative resolutions. I have in
mind the Canada Gazette. I do not believe Senator Forsey
made reference to this particular publication, a publication
upon which a number of us rely from time to time for notice of
some of these regulations and statutory instruments.
Could you briefly explain to us the function of the Canada
Gazette in respect of those matters on which it does inform
members of Parliament and in what instances certain statutory
instruments are not brought to our notice in a publication of
this authority?
Senator Forsey: To give a very shortened and sketchy
answer to that-I think there is something in the report
specifically dealing with it-the substance of the thing is this,
that not all statutory instruments are required to be published.
Some of them get published in one part of the Canada Gazette
and some in another part of the Canada Gazette. Sometimes,
if you want to find out exactly where they came from or what

February 8, 1977

they mean, or what they are amending, you are told, "Well,
look up the index in the Canada Gazette," and the experience
of our counsel is that in many instances it is extremely difficult
to find in the Canada Gazette what you are looking for.
Sometimes it just isn't there, and sometimes it is exceedingly
hard to find.
It is quite true that a large number of statutory instruments,
the majority of them, I think, are published in the Canada
Gazette. Some are simply not published, and we discover them
only by accident, quite apart from the ones which we are told
we cannot see because, in the opinion of the law officers, they
are not statutory instruments. One of our recommendations,
by the way, is that there should be some body set up here, such
as the Statutory Instruments Reference Committee in the
United Kingdom, which shall have power to say what is and
what is not a statutory instrument, because now, of a great
many things, like the special immigration guidelines, for example, we are told, "You can't see them. They are not a statutory
instrument. You have no right to see them."
We strongly suspect that they are a statutory instrument
and that we ought to see them, but we have no means of
getting at them unless the Department of Manpower and
Immigration graciously permits us to see them, which it will
not do. These are things which, in our judgment, from what we
have heard of them, and especially from members of the
committee who have had immigration cases in the courts,
these are things which may have a very profound effect upon
the rights and liberties of the subject, upon the conduct of the
immigration officers, and upon the rights of bona fide immigrants coming into Canada. There are many things like this
where it really depends upon the goodwill of the department
whether we see them or whether we don't, and if we cannot see
them, how can we tell whether they are, in our opinion,
statutory instruments or whether they are not? We are not
even saying that we should have the last word about it, but we
do say that we think we should look at them, and we say there
sbould be some body like the Statutory Instruments Reference
Committee in the United Kingdom set up by Parliament which
can pronounce, "This is a statutory instrument; that is not.
You see this; you don't see that." But this is one of our great
difficulties. There are a whole host of what we suspect, at
least, to be statutory instruments which we cannot see, and
there are lots of others which are there but which are not
required to be published and which we see only by the grace of
God or by some accident, or because somebody, as I said
earlier, in a certain department says, "Oh yes; yes, yes, yes, we
have some like that. Oh, would you like to see them?-Here
they are." And another department, "Oh no; no, no, you
cannot see that. That is not a statutory instrument. None of
your business. Keep out."
Senator Rowe: Honourable senators, it occurred to me that
the Joint Committee on Regulations and other Statutory
Instruments involves the law and the Constitution perhaps
more than any other committee of the Senate. Are copies of
the reports of this committee routinely sent to the deans of law

February 8, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

schools, for example, across Canada, and to legal bodies of one
kind or another that exist?
Senator Forsey: I do flot know how many of them get copies
of the reports. 1 think most of the university libraries get these
things. I have had correspondence from them. 1 don't know
how many deans of Iaw sehools get them. 1 can assure you that
1 personally arn going to see to it that a number of professors
of constitutional law and a number of other legal luminaries
get copies of this report, if I have to send them out addressing
the envelopes with my own hand, because 1 think it is highly
necessary that this kind of thing should be brought to the
attention of these people and that they should realize that

there is a great deal more to constitutional Iaw than simply the
division of powers between the dominion and the provinces.
There is apparently a state of blissful innocence reigning in
many bigh quarters on what the basic constitutional Iaw of this
country is.
Senator Rowe: When you attend to the distribution of this
report to these various bodies, 1 suggest that you include with
it a copy of your speech this evening.
Senator Forsey: I arn grateful for that kind word.
Senator Grosart: Ten o'clock.
On motion of Senator Godfrey, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

CANADA-VENEZUELA RELATIONS

CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAY LINE IN VENEZUELA-QUESTION

[Translation]
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, before putting my
question to the Leader of the Government, I would like to say

that I was given the opportunity on Sunday and today to
accompany the delegation from Venezuela and I found this a
most pleasant experience.
It was pointed out that our visitors and ourselves had broken
the ice in Quebec City last Monday aboard the ice-breaker of
the Department of Transport and since then, the atmosphere
has been gradually warming up.
* (1410)

[English]
The presence amongst us today of a distinguished delegation
of parliamentarians from Venezuela prompts me to ask of the
Leader of the Government 'if he has anything to report on the
present negotiations between Venezuela and Canada concerning the building in that country of a railway line for which we
would also provide the rolling stock. I would hope that he has
only pleasant news.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, Canada and
Venezuela have enjoyed a long and friendly association in
matters cultural and economic. The Venezuelan government is
at the present time reviewing a number of proposals with
respect to the construction of that important railway in
Venezuela. Canada remains hopeful that favourable consideration may be given to the Canadian bid. We feel confident,
however, that negotiations will continue in the friendly context
of Canada-Venezuela relations, and we are very optimistic
about the future.
TRANSSHIPMENTS OF OIL
PACIFIC COAST PORTS-PUBLIC HEARINGS-QUESTION
ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have the reply to a
question asked by Senator Austin on Thursday, February 3,
concerning the transshipments of oil. The question, if I may
review it briefly, was with respect to the transshipments of oil
from the Alaska port of Valdez either to the British Columbia
port of Kitimat or to the British Columbia port of Vancouver.
The honourable senator asked:
-whether the government has yet decided to hold hearings with respect to the environmental aspects of oil
transshipments by tanker and, specifically, whether the
government intends to appoint a commissioner under the
Inquiries Act to hold those hearings so that those communities along the British Columbia coast which might be
affected may have the opportunity of putting their views
forward and, as well, hear expert opinions on the matter
in public.

February 9, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

The facilities for the navigation of tankers and the question
of the off-loading of oil, the transshipment of oil from the port
of Valdez to a Canadian port is presently the subject of
discussion between the Department of Transport and the
Department of Fisheries and the Environment. The government favours public hearings to make sure that all the facts
are on record. Discussions are now proceeding between the
departments as to what the parameters of these public hearings will be. The government is in the process of seeking out
experts and advisers who can undertake and direct these
hearings. It is hoped that the hearings can commence as
quickly as possible.
Senator Austin: I should like to ask the government leader
whether the hearings to which he is referring dre to be
hearings by public servants or hearings by someone appointed
from outside the public service.
Senator Perrault: The indication at the present time is that
a person of eminent qualifications from outside the public
service and outside thé arena of Parliament, outside the political arena, will head this inquiry. However, it still remains to be
established whether this will be an informal inquiry under the
direction of such a person or whether it will be a more formal
inquiry at which major briefs will be invited and considered.
Senator Austin: Will the terms of reference of the inquiry to
which the leader is referring cover navigational problems and
problems involving the nature and character of the ships to be
allowed into British Columbia ports, as well as questions
relating to the possibility of environmental danger or disaster
in the event of spillage?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, it is expected that
all these important concerns will be part of the terms of
reference of the inquiry.
CANADA-UNITED STATES RELATIONS
AGENDA FOR DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN PRESIDENT OF UNITED
STATES AND PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA AT WASHINGTON-QUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, i wonder if the Leader
of the Government has had an opportunity to convey to the
Prime Minister Senator Austin's request with regard to the
topics that should be discussed when the Prime Minister visits
the President of the United States. The leader's intervention
would not have been necessary except that Senator Austin no
longer holds the position he used to hold and hence can't speak
to the Prime Minister as easily as he used to.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, as I pledged at the
time of the question, I have acted to communicate to the Prime
Minister's Office the concern and proposals expressed by
Senator Austin, who bas never had any difficulty at all in
communicating in his own right with any office in Ottawa.
Senator Flynn: I suppose he considers that the Leader of the
Government is in a better position than be, and I wanted to be
sure of that.

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I feel Senator
Austin was merely seeking additional allies to reinforce his
very logical and constructive proposal. I suggest that the
Leader of the Opposition may wish to add his support by also
writing a letter.
Senator Flynn: Writing letters is not very efficient, I have
found.
Senator Austin: Honourable senators, to satisfy Senator
Flynn, I would say that in the old days I did not want the
subject matter of my comments to be made known, but today,
somehow, I seem to want that.
WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION ASSEMBLY
TWENTY-SECOND SESSION, PARIS, FRANCE-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Jack Austin rose pursuant to notice of December 13,
1976:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
second part of the Twenty-Second Session of the Western
European Union Assembly, held in Paris, France, from
29th November to 2nd December, 1976, and in particular
to the discussions and proceedings of the Session and the
participation therein of the delegation from Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I had the great privilege of
representing the Senate of Canada as a parliamentary observer
at the second part of the Twenty-Second Ordinary Session of
the Western European Union Assembly, held at the Palais
d'Iena in Paris, France, from November 29 to December 2,
1976. The Canadian delegation of three included the Honourable Stanley Haidasz and Mr. Frank Oberle representing the
other place.
On December 2 last, Senator Bélisle reported to this chamber on his attendance at the first part of the Twenty-Second
Ordinary Session of the Western European Union Assembly
which was held in mid-June, 1976. He has provided this
chamber with a detailed and useful background on the origins
and present nature of the Western European Union Assembly,
and accordingly it will not be necessary for me to cover those
matters again. It will suffice for me to remind honourable
senators that the Western European Union Assembly is composed of parliamentarians from Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg
and the United Kingdom. There are 89 representatives from
these seven countries, and parliamentary observers are invited
and traditionally present from other so-called "western"
countries.
It is important that honourable senators understand what
the Western European Union Assembly is not. It is not a
meeting of governments in the sense of ministers. It is not a
meeting of governments in the sense of an ambassadorial
meeting. It is not a meeting of high, middle or low level civil
servants representing their governments and countries. The
Western European Union Assembly is a meeting of parliamentarians representing themselves and their respective political

SENATE DEBATES
parties wherever those parties might be in the spectrum. The
responsibility for remarks made at the Assembly meetings
remains that of the individual parliamentarian, and is not
attributable to views expressed on behalf of his country.
* (1420)

As this was the first meeting of parliamentarians from many
countries which I had' attended, I found the experience of
watching that interplay both facinating and valuable. While I
have attended many international meetings as a senior civil
servant representing the official views of my government, I had
never before had the opportunity of watching an international
group of parliamentarians discuss issues which their various
countries held in common-although, of course, the views
expressed by parliamentarians, whether from the same country
or different countries, are rarely held in common.
The enormous value of the Assembly, to my mind, is in the
experience of comparative parliamentary practices. These parliamentarians, coming as they do from quite different legislative experiences, are learning to work together in what for each
of them is a brand new parliamentary process. Out of it,
unquestionably, will come important contributions to the practices and procedures of a parliament representing some future
"United States of Europe."
A further advantage is that these parliamentarians get to
know one another, thereby giving each the opportunity to
establish relationships which will allow, at the parliamentary
level, for discussion of European affairs. The consequence of
this development for European stability and economic growth
should not be over-emphasized or under-appreciated. The process of constructing a more coherent European community is
anything but easy; there will be many disagreements and
fallings-out. But, as European parliamentarians gain greater
insight into one another's problems, as they develop the habit
of seeking a consensus representing a more European rather
than national outlook, the benefits for the citizens of Europe
and, indeed, for al] nations adhering to and advocating western
values will be enormous.
As Senator Bélisle mentioned in his earlier report, the
Western European Union Assembly, under what is known as
the Modified Brussels Treaty of 1954, has a particular responsibility assigned to it respecting the defence of Western
Europe. The Assembly was born in the tensions of the post-war
world. While it has no executive power over defence matters, it
does have the power of review in respect of the state of
German rearmament, the state of the presence of foreign
troops in Germany and, in general, the relationship between
the non-Communist and the Communist nations of Europe. It
is, in fact, an international parliamentary assembly with
competence in defence matters, and flowing out of this area of
jurisdiction the Assembly sees as its responsibility the examination of a number of collateral issues to Western European
defence, which is illustrated by the agenda for the second part
of the Twenty-Second Ordinary Session. That agenda covered
discussions on European union, Western Europe's policy
towards Mediterranean problems, European security and EastWest relations, anti-submarine warfare, European oceano-

February 9, 1977

graphie activities, European energy supplies, and relations
with European parliaments.
I found both the addresses and the ensuing discussions on
many of these items both instructive and fascinating. While I
do not intend to go into great detail at this time,, I would be
pleased to provide those honourable senators interested with
copies of the documents, reports, and other materials, which I
brought back from Paris. For the general interest of honourable senators, I shall touch on the highlights of the discussions.
Among the central concerns of the parliamentarians present
was the subject of a future Western European union. The
aspirations of some of the parliamentarians involved a restructuring of such organizations as the Council of Europe and the
European Economic Community, all to be absorbed into a
European parliament.
There was a good deal of discussion concerning the decision
of the European Council, under the Treaty of Rome, that its
nine member countries should hold elections for the establishment of a European parliament.
The major event towards Western European union in 1976
was a report to the Council of Nine by the Belgian Prime
Minister, Leo Tindemans, on the future of European union.
The only real decision taken pursuant to the Tindemans report
was that taken on September 20, 1976, when the ministers
representing the common market countries decided to establish
an elected European parliament by universal suffrage. Much
of the discussion concerning this item related to the difficulties
of direct elections in various of the member countries. In
addition, there was disappointment expressed on many occasions during the meeting of the Assembly over the fact that no
practical steps had been taken toward Western European
union. Many were concerned that the Tindemans report
would, in large part, be shelved rather than debated and given
serious consideration. A further concern expressed related to
the future of the Western European Union Assembly which,
under the Tindemans report, would be phased out, with its
responsibilities passing to the European parliament.
It is clear that progress towards greater cohesion in political
and defence fields in Western Europe has largely been limited.
European parliamentarians recognized that the economic difficulties of 1974, 1975 and 1976 in Europe, brought about by
the energy crisis and problems of financing world trade, were
largely responsible for slowing down the European Community's progress. For example, in the early 1970s there seemed to
be some prospect of economic and monetary union, but the
energy crisis did much to distort the relationship of European
currencies one to the other, and has left little current optimism
for even the working of the so-called currencies "snake"-that
is, the relationship of European currencies to the Deutschmark-and no optimism at all at the present time for overall
monetary union. Settlements in many other aspects of the
European economy, particularly in the agricultural sector,
have been disturbed by gyrations in the rates of various
European currencies. Accordingly, the general feeling was that
the state of lack of progress towards European union was not
brought about by ill will towards the concept, but by real

February 9, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

problems encountered in the economic and political situation
in Europe and the world.
With respect to the European parliament, there were very
difficult decisions to make regarding the number of seats that
each country should have, and how those constituencies would
be described. Questions as to whether, in the first instance,
those European parliamentarians would be elected by their
national assemblies, and questions as to whether those European parliamentarians could also be national parliamentarians,
were raised, and, of course, questions about the actual electoral procedure and the procedure to be adopted within the
European parliament. The settlement of many of these questions has been left to discussions during this year and next year
and ultimately, if not settled, to the European parliament
itself.
It should be remembered that the establishment of the
European parliament requires ratification by the legislatures
of each of the nine countries. Some European parliamentarians
feared that there might be problems in their own parliaments
in gaining such approval. Many fear that their own national
assemblies would reqtlire greater and more detailed knowledge
of the degree to which they were expected to confer any
national legislative competence on the European parliament. I
think we can expect to hear much from Europe in the next
several months on this question of the possible encroachment
of the proposed European parliament on the national prerogatives of the legislatures of the countries to be represented.
The members of the Western European Union Assembly in
general believe that the role of the Assembly will continue for
the time being. The European parliament, when it is formed,
will represent the electorate of its various countries, but the
Western European Union Assembly will continue as a forum
for discussion among parliamentarians of the national legislative assemblies in Europe, and will continue with its specific
authority to deal with matters of European defence.
The continuity of the Western European Union Assembly,
in the minds of its members, appears to be based on the belief
that no European parliament will be given responsibility over
Europe's defence for a long time to come, and that the
establishment of a common foreign policy is a precondition for
the establishment of a common defence policy in Europe.
Bearing in mind the economic rivalries which exist in any
important political sector-for example, energy-a common
foreign policy as such seems a long way off indeed. Therefore,
I believe the Western European Union Assembly will pursue
its present activities until such time as a European union
actually exists in the fields of economic and general political
policy including foreign policy.
Let me draw from this discussion on Western European
union and its problems some lessons for Canada. There are
some in this country who are arguing for a very different kind
of political process for Canadians. They point to the European
Common Market as something desirable, as something attractive, as something effective. They say Canada would be better
governed, bearing in mind its regional differences and its
economic and political rivalries, if we were a common market

in which decision-making would be undertaken by negotiation
amongst its various constituent parts and not through a unified
national parliamentary process.
* (1430)

Honourable senators, none of such arguments about a
common market for Canadians in substitution to our Confederation have ever had appeal to me, but as I sat in the Western
European Union Assembly I found myself wishing that any
who entertain such notions seriously could be present to see the
lack of coherence, lack of cohesion, lack of direction and
enormous loss there from much that is currently the state of
the political and economic process in Europe.
Let me be absolutely clear that the Treaty of Rome and the
European Common Market which flows from it are an enormous advance over what existed before. I totally subscribe to
the development of common political, economic and social
institutions in Europe. But let us realize our great fortune in
that we are, in political, economic and social terms, where
western European countries and their peoples aspire to be but
realize they will not be for yet a long time to come. They are in
the process of creating institutions of common interest, of
common decision-making, which in their very existence here in
Canada we take for granted. They have no way of agreeing on
a common foreign policy; we do. They have no way of agreeing
on a common monetary policy; we do. They have no way of
agreeing on matters of trade interest to the Union as a whole;
we do. They have no way of pursuing common policies to
develop their agricultural policy, their industrial community or
their financial institutions; I hope we do.
Our common method is the Parliament of Canada. It is the
House of Commons and the Senate which represent all of the
people and all the regions of this country. Granted, there are
times, many times, when we do not discharge our responsibilities to the Canadian people as effectively as we should or as we
would like to. However, Canadians through their Parliament
have a say in their common destiny, and have a collective
security arrangement in an economic and social policy as good
as that which exists in any country in the world.
Honourable senators know that much of the difficulty which
faces our national unity is based on the distances between our
various communities in this large country, and in the size and
nature of our population. But in spite of all the constraints
which the Canadian nation suffers, we have in Canada a
success story as a nation which I would exchange with none
other in the world. If Europe and its member nations should
ever come together in a confederation which works as well as
Canada's, then Europe will, as a single entity, be one of the
great communities of the world. That possibility I would
welcome, confirming as it would the enormous values which
civilization, as it has developed in Europe and is practised
throughout the free world, has conferred on those who live
within its boundaries and will confer, I believe, on the world in
general. I am speaking of values related to the worth of the
individual, and the rights of the individual in society.
Honourable senators, with your leave I should like to continue my address on the Western European Union Assembly

the Senate to certain fundamental problems which preoccupy
Canadians; namely, problems of labour relations in the country and certain related problems of economic order.
Motion agreed to.

SENATE DEBATES
TRANSPORTATION
USER-PAY POLICY--QUESTION

Senator Bonnell: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the Leader of the Government. I read in
the local newspaper of Prince Edward Island, the Charlottetown Guardian of February 8, 1977, that the Minister of
Transport, Otto Lang, had stated that the user-pay policy is
now a thing of the past and that it is government policy now
that that shall not be the policy of transport any more in
Canada.
I also read in the paper that the Minister of Transport is
prepared to make an amendment to the transportation bill
before the house, stating that regional developments shall take
priority over economic viability in transportation matters in
Canada.
Could the Leader of the Government table for us the written
statement, if there is such a statement, or confirm the statement to us in this bouse, if it was a verbal statement, so that
we can know for sure that, indeed, that will be the policy of the
Government of Canada in the future? We in Atlantic Canada
were most upset over the old policy, which somehow or other
had become construed to mean that everybody paid the full
cost for transportation, and apparently that is no longer the
policy of the Government of Canada.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I will act immediately to determine the nature of the comment attributed to the
minister. I shall, therefore, take the question as notice, in the
hope that further detailed information can be provided.

February 10, 1977

In any event, the department indicated that it was attempting to determine whether it was right when it decided to
impose such taxes. Apparently, both taxes were the result of
brainwaves on the part of people who had no real knowledge of
the facts. It seems obvious that the taxes were designed more
to convince people that they should try to save fuel rather than
to accomplish any real and worthwhile saving.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

EXCISE TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD READING

Senator Barrow moved the third reading of Bill C-21, to
amend the Excise Tax Act.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I just have one
or two words to say. This bill was before the committee
yesterday, and I think the record should show that, generally
speaking, the members of the committee were not impressed
with the evidence that the proposed taxes on cars with air
conditioners would, as a device to save energy, in fact accomplish that purpose. The point was made that air conditioners in
cars were not really the cause of that much fuel consumption,
especially as opposed to the consumption of fuel by air conditioners in buildings with sealed windows. In fact, I think the
suggestion was that there could be a saving of fuel if windows
were kept open during certain months of the year instead of
being sealed for 12 months of the year. Senator Manning also
indicated, and it was not refuted, that this tax, in addition to
being not particularly efficient, is blatantly discriminating. It
would be equally inefficient, I suggest, for taxes on cars to
vary directly with the weight of those cars.

EFFECT ON DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CANADA-MOTION TO
REFER SUBJECT MATTER TO TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Bonnell, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Norrie, that the subject matter of the inquiry of the
Honourable Senator Bonnell calling the attention of the
Senate to transportation in Canada, whether by land, by
air or by sea, especially as it affects the different regions
of Canada, be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.-(HonourableSenator
Petten).
Senator Petten: Honourable senators, I yield to Senator
Rowe.
Hon. Frederick William Rowe: Honourable senators,
recently we were informed by the Government of Canada that
it was its intention to set up a royal commission to study
transportation problems in Newfoundland. What I have to say
today, very briefly, I hope, will have a bearing on the studies
that that commission will undertake. A few years ago a royal
commission was set up by the government of the day to study
transportation in ail of Canada. The report of that commission, named after its chairman, is known as the Report of the
MacPherson Royal Commission on Transportation.

February 10, 1977
Februarv 10, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

I should give the house a little background information on
that commission. It was appointed in 1959 on the recommendation of the then Prime Minister, the Right Honourable John
G. Diefenbaker. The commissioners were Murdoch A. MacPherson-who became chairman when Mr. McTague, gave up
the chairmanship because of ill health-Mr. A. Herbert
Anscomb, Mr. Archibald H. Balch, Mr. René Gobeil, Mr.
Howard Mann, Mr. Arnold Platt, and, as I indicated earlier,
Mr. Charles T. McTague. That commission brought in its
report in three stages and in three volumes, and it is to Volume
II that I would draw your attention. It was tabled in the House
of Commons on January 23, 1962.
a

(1420)

The men who made up that commission comprised a distinguished group of Canadians. They came from various walks of
life and from different professions. They had one thing in
common, for which I was thankful, and that is that none of
them was a Newfoundlander. I do not say that critically, but
when they brought in this report I was then Minister of
Highways for Newfoundland, and, like many other Newfoundlanders, I was happy that no Newfoundlander was on that
commission, because it might have been argued that he had
influenced the commission in its findings, which were not only
of great interest to Newfoundland but also of great significance-at least, we hoped.
I wish to take a few minutes to read some short extracts
from the report of the MacPherson Royal Commission on
Transportation. They decided, in their wisdom, to devote a
special section to the needs and problems of Newfoundland.
The following are some extracts from the report:
The Commission has examined the transportation problems of the island portion of Newfoundland with great
interest. Because of its geographical position and stage of
economic development, it has peculiar transportation
needs unlike the other settled parts of Canada.
A few pages further on in the report that view is repeated.
They reiterate the fact quite often. Obviously, they were
anxious to impress on the rest of Canada, and on the Government of Canada, the view which those six men, none of them
Newfoundlanders, had arrived at after studying exhaustively,
over a period of several years, transportation all over Canada.
Having traversed Newfoundland and studied it at first hand,
they repeated their conclusion. Here is another quotation:
The situation in Newfoundland is a special case distinct
from the rest of Canada.
There are no two ways about that. There is no way that
anyone can avoid understanding the point they are making.
The report continues:
Furthermore, despite the progress that has been
madeSenators will recall that we had become a province in 1949
and they were writing this in 1961.
-the lack of adequate inland transportation continues to
result in inadequate resource development and costly and
unsatisfactory distribution of supplies.

They made a point along the way, to which I shall refer later.
At the time of union, the federal government agreed to
maintain an all-year transportation linkI emphasize their words.
-an all-year transportation link between North Sydney
and Port aux Basques.
In another part of the report, speaking of Newfoundland, they
say:
Because of the lower level of the economy as compared
with the rest of Canada, and because of its geography,
transportation costs are high and the people concerned
cannot yet assume the full cost of moving goods from the
mainland to the Island.
Further on:
The situation in Newfoundland is such that it may
prove necessary in the short run to limit competition, to
favour by subsidization or special treatment one mode
against anotherAnd note this, honourable senators:
and to do other things that would be totally unacceptable
in other parts of Canada.
Further on:
In summary the movement of goods from mainland
Canada to Newfoundland will have to be subsidized for
the foreseeable future.
I would judge from that that when Mr. Lang spoke about the
user paying it he either had not read or had forgotten this
statement in the MacPherson report.
Because of this, the Government should use its broad
powers to see that insofar as possible all goods are moved
at the lowest possible cost.
That is, all goods to Newfoundland. In another part of the
report:
No part of Canada has prospered until it had good
transportation facilities.
The commissioners, not talking about Newfoundland, went on:
The history of Canada is replete with examples of massive
public spending on transport facilities such as canals,
railways and more recently highways and airports. Indeed
the dollar value of such investment continues to rise.
There is no question that the economy of Newfoundland
cannot develop at a satisfactory pace without more transportation facilities.
I am getting towards the end of my quotations from the
MacPherson report. Another one reads:
A highway network of the size necessary is beyond the
present resources of Canadians in Newfoundland. The
situation calls for assistance by the federal government,
and there are enough precedents for such a program.
Public works to stimulate the economy of a province or an
area have been a continuing part of national policy in
Canada. For example, assistance in constructing power

SENATE DEBATES
plants and irrigation systems as weil as transportation
facilities in all parts of Canada can be cited.
Then they come back to this point again:
What canals and locks did for the economy of the central
provinces, what the trans-continental railways did for the
prairies, highways can do for Newfoundland.
We are convinced that such a program is in the national interest. It would stimulate the economy of the Island
with attendant benefits to the rest of Canada. All this
could be accomplished in a comparatively short time.
These are the findings with respect to Newfoundland of the
MacPherson Commission set up by the Diefenbaker government in 1969.
I am glad, as a Newfoundlander and a Canadian, that the
present federal government has decided to set up a special
commission to study transportation problems in Newfoundland, because in many respects things have gone from bad to
worse since the MacPherson Commission made its report in
1961.
After refreshing our minds on this report, the question that
obviously comes to mind is: Did the Canadian government
implement the report? The answer is an unqualified "No." We
started building the trans-Canada highway in 1950. We were
building it on that Procrustean bed formula that I have talked
about here before, on a 50-50 basis, in spite of the fact-and I
am going to repeat this argument-that I demonstrated to the
complete satisfaction of the then Minister of Public Works,
now our colleague Senator Walker, and to the satisfaction of
apparently everybody else who studied the paper I submitted
here in Ottawa, that the burden of building the trans-Canada
highway was sixteen times heavier on the average Newfoundlander, on the 50-50 basis, than it was on the average citizen of
Saskatchewan.
*

(1430)

Eventually it became apparent that Newfoundland and certain other provinces were building their share of the highway,
not in a substandard way but to the minimum standards
permitted under the agreement rather than to the maximum
standards. There was, of course, a very significant difference
between the standards as to width of highways, width of
shoulders, climbing lanes, curves, grades, thickness of pavement, and so on. When that situation became apparent, it also
became obvious that with the fantastic increase in highway
traffic that was taking place, parts of the highway would
virtually disintegrate within a few years. At that time the
Government of Canada came into the picture again and
enabled Newfoundland, New Brunswick and other parts of
Canada to complete their sections of the highway on the basis
of a 90-10 formula. With that, Newfoundland, in common
with other parts of Canada, was enabled to complete the
highway within a reasonable length of time. Without that
assistance we would have dragged on almost indefinitely.
There was no way that we in Newfoundland-and I think the
sane is truc of two or three other provinces-could have
completed the highway to maximum standards within a

February 10, 1977

reasonable time without having to deprive other public services-such as health, education, welfare and so on-of the
money that they needed to maintain acceptable standards.
While the Diefenbaker government, which was in power at
the time, did not implement this particular recommendation of
the first royal commission report, it did introduce other measures, notably the Roads to Resources program, which were
highly acceptable. My point, however, is that the MacPherson
commission, over and over again, said that Newfoundland
required special treatment in addition to any national program, whether it be the 90-10 formula, Roads to Resources, or
anything else, in view of the tremendous number of obstacles
and problems the province faced and having regard for its
population. The DREE program was of some help subsequently, and is so at this moment, in coping with some of those
problems.
In general, I think I can say that Air Canada has given a
fairly good service to Newfoundland. I know there is room for
some criticism there but, in general, the Air Canada service,
since we became part of Canada-and indeed before that
time-has been reasonably acceptable.
Now I come to the CNR. Under the terms of union the
Government of Canada took on certain responsibilities in
respect of Newfoundland. As far as transportation and related
responsibilities were concerned, it made use of the crown
corporation which we know as Canadian National Railways.
The CNR became the means whereby the Government of
Canada fulfilled its obligations under the terms of union.
What were these terms of union? The ones with which I am
concerned are brief, but remember, honourable senators, we
need to remind ourselves that this is not just any simple little
agreement. This is the Constitution of Canada; this is part of
the British North America Act. This was an agreement
entered into freely by two independent sovereign countries, one
very big and one very small, but each a dominion within the
British Commowealth, each one enjoying the same rights and
prerogatives. It was not something which one big country,
Canada, gave to some other little territory; it was an agreement between two sovereign countries.
My first quotation is as follows:
At the date of Union . . . Canada will take over ...

(a) the Newfoundland Railway, including steamship and
other marine services.
That is it; that is all it says about it. It is simplicity itself. "At
the date of Union, Canada will take over the Newfoundland
Railway."
Also, "At the date of Union, Canada will take over the
Newfoundland Hotel"-again, simplicity itself. There are no
qualifications. There is nothing about it at all, except that
Canada will take over the Newfoundland Hotel.
Why was not more spelled out? I will tell you why more was
not spelled out. One of the men who negotiated that agreement
was a man who within the year became the Prime Minister of
Canada, the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent. With him
was one of the ablest ministers, in my judgment, that Canada

February 10, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

has ever had, the late Honourable Brooke Claxton. There were
also others. However, Mr. St. Laurent said over and over
subsequently-I am paraphrasing now-"You do not have to
spell out these details on either side. Where there is goodwill,
honesty and integrity all the spelling out of details in the world
is needless." So it is as simple as that-"Canada will take over
the Newfoundland Railway; Canada will take over the Newfoundland Hotel."
Then we have clause 32 of the Terms of Union, which is the
schedule to the British North America Act, 1949, and thus
part of the Constitution of Canada, as follows:
(1) Canada will maintain in accordance with the traffic
offering a freight and passenger steamship service between North Sydney and Port aux BasquesThat is it.
The Government of Canada in its wisdom decided-and it
did not have to do this-to entrust this responsibility to the
CNR. I wish to go .on record now as saying that in some
respects the record of'the CNR in providing service to Newfoundland has been a good one. In other respects it has been
abysmally and abominably bad, bordering on neglect and
arrogance very often.
By the way, that railway was started in 1881, and was built
as a narrow gauge railway. Everyone has heard the jokes told
about the "Newfie Bullet", and so on. It was a prodigious
effort by 150,000 people in 1881 to build that railway across a
trackless wilderness in a great semi-circle, crossing almost
every brook and river in Newfoundland, going uphill and
downhill and across muskeg and bog-as bad as anything to
be found anywhere in North America. They built those 600
miles of railway, of course, mostly by pick and shovel. It was a
narrow gauge railway, for the very obvious reason that they
could not afford to build a wide gauge one. That railway
served Newfoundland, but it never made any money. When'it
was built no one expected it to ever make any money. One
would have had to be off his head to talk about a railway
across Newfoundland, an unpopulated, desolate wilderness,
making profits. That railway was built to serve the people and,
of course, to open up the interior and make further development possible. It was built basically for the same reason that
the railway was built across the Prairies and out to British
Columbia.
0

(1440)

At the time of union, in 1949 and 1950, we urged-and
there were some in Ottawa who also urged-the Government
of Canada, through the CNR, to turn that narrow gauge
railway into a wide gauge railway. It would have cost money,
of course, but it could have been done at an acceptable cost. In
the process they could have eliminated many of the curves and
grades which could not be eliminated in the 1880s and 1890s,
when that railway was built almost by hand. Some thought
was given to that idea, but the CNR fought it.
One of the men who recommended that that changeover to a
wide gauge railway not be considered by the Government of
Canada, and that the CNR not be ordered to do it-I shall not

name him; he is now dead, and was a man for whom I had the
greatest respect-told me after he had resigned from his
position that if he could have had his day over again be would
have recommended that a wide gauge railway be built across
Newfoundland in 1950.
Over the years the CNR has downgraded the railway service
in Newfoundland. It inherited a trans-insular passenger service
from St. John's to Port aux Basques. It was not a good service,
but it was certainly better than nothing. It was a Pullman
overnight service, complete with dining cars and so on. Almost
from the beginning the CNR started to downgrade that service, and eventually more and more people ceased using it.
Given the choice between driving my car and taking the train,
I must admit that sometimes I did cross Newfoundland on the
gravel road. At other times, as did others who were engaged in
public life, I made use of small aircraft or whatever other
means of transportation I could get. Then the CNR had the
nerve to say that there was no need to improve the service
because people were not using it.
That reminds me of a classic incident which occurred in a
district I represented at one time in northern Newfoundland. I
went to the CNR and asked them to include a certain community in the coastal service. They told me, right here in Ottawa,
"We cannot include it in the coastal service because there is no
wharf in that community." So I went to the Depmartment of
Public Works and asked, "Why don't you put a wharf in that
community?" I was told, "There is no need to put a wharf in
that community because the coastal steamer does not call
there."
Later on, in place of the railway passenger service it had
inherited in 1949, the CNR substituted a bus service. That bus
service is, and has been, unacceptable to the people in Newfoundland. I shall not go into any detail, but it is totally
unacceptable. This has been said in the House of Commons,
and it has been said elsewhere. I think this is one of the
reasons why the present government has decided to set up a
royal commission in Newfoundland.
Most honourable senators, I am sure, have stayed at the
Newfoundland Hotel. It is not a very big hotel. I am told it has
no more than 140 rooms. Obviously, I never stayed there much
but I am told it is a fairly good hotel. In the 1950s that hotel
had the highest occupancy rate in Canada of all the CN hotels
and in second place was the Chateau Laurier. I do not know if
this maintained throughout this period, but certainly for several years the only two hotels operated by the CNR and showing
a profit were the Hotel Newfoundland and the Chateau
Laurier.
That hotel in St. John's was constantly fully booked. Hundreds of times somebody coming to St. John's from my
district-a businessman, a doctor or some other personwould call and say, "In God's name, get me some place to
stay." I would ask the hotel, "When can you give Mr. Jones a
room? He wants to come in for a week." The usual reply was,
"I am sorry. We cannot give him anything now. I don't see
that we are going to have anything for weeks to come." This
went on and on.

SENATE DEBATES
Across Canada there were scores of national organizations
of one kind or another wanting to hold their conventions in
Newfoundland. Again and again they were told there was no
accommodation, and they gave up the idea. I would say that
from 1949 until the early 1960s, not one national organization,
big or small, held its annual or periodical convention in
Newfoundland, and that was because there was no accommodation. Many times it was pointed out to the CNR that there
was no accommodation for people-not even for Newfoundlanders, let alone visitors. When asked, "Why don't you
enlarge? Why don't you double the size of the hotel?" they
said, "We will think about it." They did nothing about it.
Over the years, the Government of Newfoundland went to
every hotel chain in Canada and Europe and drew their
attention to the possibilities in Newfoundland. I am sure some
honourable senators will not believe what I am going to tell
them. The government would approach the Sheraton, Hilton
or Holiday Inn chains, and get them interested. They would
come, and almost invariably their response would be positive.
Sheraton or Holiday Inns would plan to build a 250-room
hotel in St. John's and another in Corner Brook or somewhere
else, and within days, either by direct announcement or leaking it, the CNR would make it known they intended to double
the size of the Hotel Newfoundland, or scrap it and build an
entirely new one. At that point, Hilton, Sheraton or Holiday
Inns would say they could not compete with a subsidized outfit
like the CNR, and discard their plans. That happened over
and over again, and Newfoundland suffered to the tune of
millions of dollars. As I have said, the value of the tourist
trade to Newfoundland in 1950 was $2 million. I made the
statement at a public gathering in 1950 that if we got the
hotels built and the trans-Canada highway completed we could
raise the value of our tourist industry to that of Nova Scotia's
which in that year, to my memory, was $27 million.

e

(1450)

We eventually got hotels in Newfoundland, but not through
the CNR. The CNR, to this day, has not lifted a finger to
assist us to increase hotel accommodation in the province. The
Government of Newfoundland had to guarantee the profitability of a chain of Holiday Inns, and we got those Holiday Inns
in St. John's and elsewhere. Other hotel chains were
encouraged to establish hotels in Newfoundland, and did so.
The value of the tourist trade to Newfoundland in 1963-64
was $30 million. It was more than the amount I had forecast
ten years earlier. The Government of Newfoundland decided
to call 1966 "Come Home Year", and invited tens of thousands of Newfoundlanders scattered throughout Canada and
the United States to come back to Newfoundland for their
holidays. Those visitors were in addition to the normal tourist
traffic, and again the CNR refused to lift a finger to provide
accommodation for them. It was at that point in time that we
went to Holiday Inns and induced them to establish hotels in
Newfoundland and thus provide the necessary accommodation.
The value of the tourist industry in 1966, Come Home Year,
was $60 million. Two years previously it had reached a high of

February 10, 1977

$30 million. I know whereof I speak. I was chairman of the
committee for Come Home Year. Incidentally, in all years,
save one, since 1966 the value of the tourist industry in
Newfoundland has increased, to the point where it has a value
in the current fiscal year of over $100 million. Given the
present unemployment situation in Newfoundland, I shudder
to think of what conditions would be like if we did not have a
$100 million tourist industry.
That is the record of the CNR in providing accommodation
in Newfoundland. The Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent
told us we would have to depend on a generous interpretation
of the Terms of Union. I submit to honourable senators that
when the Terms of Union were adopted-one of which was
that Canada would take over the operation of the Newfoundland Railway-the intent was not to degrade that railway, not
to make the cost of its services prohibitive to the Newfoundland people. Surely the intent was not to phase out the
Newfoundland portion of the CNR, which is what has taken,
and is currently taking, place.
I do not think many Newfoundlanders would have argued
for luxurious Pullman dining car rail accommodation across
Newfoundland, but such a service could have been modified by
eliminating some of the more expensive aspects. The CNR
could have instituted short-run dayliner services, and other
services, which would have helped to solve the transportation
problem in Newfoundland.
Let me remind honourable senators that the transportation
problem in Newfoundland today is more serious than it was at
the time of the tabling of the report of the MacPherson
Commission in 1961. The portion of the trans-Canada highway across Newfoundland, partly because of the use of that
highway by the CN bus service and heavy vehicles of one kind
or another, is disintegrating. I can safely predict that parts of
it will be impassable this spring.
No one suggested at the time of union that Canada would
operate a ferry service between North Sydney and Port aux
Basques provided it was not too costly. That was not said at
all. No one said Canada would operate that service provided, à
la Mr. Lang, it is self-supporting. Few if any of the railway
lines in Canada have ever been really self-supporting, and the
same applies to most of the land telegraph and telephone
systems. The postal service in this country is not self-supporting. If it were shown, for example, that the operation of the
postal service in the province of Quebec was operating at an
annual loss of $25 million, would anyone in his right mind
suggest that that postal service be eliminated?
That is what Dr. Bandeen said, in effect, a few weeks ago
regarding CNR services in Newfoundland-Dr. Bandeen
being, as I am sure everyone is aware, the president of CNR.
That same principle is implicit in the idea-this iniquitous
idea-of a "user-pay" service. The principle seems to be that
any public service or public utility that is not self-supporting
should be eliminated. Why don't we go back to the jungle?
Senator Forsey pointed out to me privately-and I am sure
he has done so publicly as well-that Canada is one of the few

February 10, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

countries in the world which has the provision of railway and
ferry services as part of its Constitution, so they must have
been considered important by those who framed the Constitution. I deeply regret, on the several occasions when the Government of Canada arbitrarily broke the Terms of Union, that
the Government of Newfoundland did not proceed with its
threat to institute an action in the Supreme Court of Canada.
The Province of Prince Edward Island did proceed with such a
suit in one instance, with the result that it got judgment in its
favour. With all due respect, it is my view that the case of the
Province of Newfoundland was infinitely stronger than that of
Prince Edward Island.
I regret that the Government of Newfoundland did not
pursue its threatened actions in the Supreme Court of Canada.
I was part of a former government of Newfoundland when it
was cajoled into withdrawing a pending suit against the Government of Canada. We should have proceeded with that
action. I was in favour of proceeding with it, and I regret that
we abandoned it. I regret that the present Government of
Newfoundland did not go ahead with its threat of two or three
years ago, when the Government of Canada permitted the
defenceless province to be cut off from practically all communication with the rest of the world.

Term 32 does not say, "Canada will maintain a ferry service
provided no strikes occur." It does not say, "Canada will
maintain the service for six months of the year, and then if 200
stevedores in North Sydney and Port aux Basques go on strike
for the other six months Canada's responsibility ceases." Of
course, it does not say that. But that is what happened. It
happened in high summer on the first day of August when tens
of thousands of tourists were in Newfoundland from California, from Texas and every other state in the American
union, from every province of Canada, and from other parts of
the world as well, and when tens of thousands of Newfoundlanders were out of the province on visits to other parts of
North America. That is when the strike occurred. You simply
took up your newspaper and read: "Strike! Ferries not running
between Port aux Basques and North Sydney."
Let me give the analogy again, because it is not just as
simple as that. If tomorrow the province of Ontario, with its
eight million people, or whatever the population is, were to
find all of its highways and railways leading to the province of
Quebec, the province of Manitoba and to the United States
were cut off by highway and railway workers obstructing those
highways and railway lines, that would be analogous to what
happened to Newfoundland in that summer. I ask how long
the Government of Canada would stand by and allow that to
continue. But it happened in Newfoundland, and it lasted for a
month. It caused Newfoundlanders and others affected by the
strike untold hardship. Thousands of people ran out of money;
thousands of people were forced to sleep out on the ground 8,
10 and 12 miles from Port aux Basques. Tens of thousands of
people were unable to get their children back to school on
time. Thousands of people found their resources depleted,
while those who could pay for accommodation could not find

any in Port aux Basques. That situation was allowed to
continue for a whole month with nothing done about it.
I suggest without fear of contradiction that if the equivalent
were to happen in Ontario tomorrow, if there were a strike
which paralyzed the province, no more than 12 hours would
pass before the Government of Canada intervened and sent in
either the army or some other force to open up the highways.
But in the middle of that high summer nothing was done for
Newfoundland. The airplanes were still flying, of course, but
they were far from sufficient to handle the situation.
The cost to Newfoundland can be reckoned only in the tens
of millions of dollars. But apart from that, can you imagine the
deleterious effect that situation must have had on the tourist
trade in Newfoundland? People from remote parts of the
United States and Canada, having gone to Newfoundland in
the expectation of having a good time-and most of them, I
am sure, did have a good time, because people who go to
Newfoundland enjoy their visits-would have returned home
in a disappointed frame of mind after the travail they
experienced as a result of the strike. What sort of ambassadors
of goodwill do you suppose we have made of such people?
Yes, the Government of Canada can evade its responsibilities under the British North America Act, and it has in some
cases tried to do so in respect of Newfoundland. There are
several ways that a government of Canada can evade its
responsibilities, especially when its opponent, if I may use that
term, happens to be a small and relatively weak province.
There are several ways in which the big fellow can break his
obligations. He can dismember or eliminate services. That is
what CNR bas done, and the CNR has not replaced the
dismembered or eliminated services with either adequate or
acceptable services.
Again, the big fellow can make a service prohibitively
expensive, and many people in Newfoundland are saying that
that is what has been done already in respect of the CNR bus
service in Newfoundland. The big fellow can break the Terms
of Union, if he is a big and strong enough bully. He can break
the Terms of Union by an arbitrary, unilateral interpretation
of those Terms of Union. That has been done. Again, the big
fellow can-and there is a strong belief in Newfoundland that
this is the case at the moment-take shelter under the umbrella of the CNR, which is being held aloft in the hands of Dr.
Bandeen.
I suggest again to honourable senators here that when the
bell tolls, when the Government of Canada disregards the
Constitution, they should not have the feeling that it is tolling
only for Ne.wfoundland. If it is Newfoundland today; tomorrow it can be some other province, and that, I suggest, is a
most serious matter.
Senator Grosart: May I ask the honourable senator a

question?
In view of the serious criticisms he has made of the policy of
the government and of the CNR, would he consider following
his statement with the introduction of a resolution criticizing
the government and the CNR so that we might vote on it?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Rowe: Well, what I have had to say today, of
course, I have tried to say in as public a manner as possible,
and I do hope, although it does not always happen, that what I
have said will be publicized. Certainly, I shall take other
measures as well, because I shall see to it that Hansard is sent
to a number of people.
Without evading your question, I must say that I am not too
sure what will happen to Senator Bonnell's resolution. Moreover, there is one point which I should perhaps have made
clearer at the beginning of my remarks, and that is that the
Government of Canada bas decided to set up a royal commission to study transportation in Newfoundland. I think that that
is at least a recognition on their part that all is not well down
there.
Senator Perrault: Hear, Hear.
Senator Rowe: And I for one am prepared to sit back for a
few months to sec what will happen.
Senator Grosart: I thought the honourable senator might
welcome the opportunity to put his vote where his speech is.
Senator Langlois: Why don't you do it yourself?
Senator Grosart: I might.
Senator Langlois: Go ahead.

On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.
WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION ASSEMBLY
TWENTY-SECOND SESSION, PARIS, FRANCE-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
inquiry of Senator Austin calling the attention of the Senate to
the second part of the Twenty-Second Session of the Western
European Union Assembly, held in Paris, France, from 29th
November to 2nd December, 1976, and in particular to the
discussions and proceedings of the Session and the participation therein of the delegation from Canada.
Hon. Jack Austin: Honourable senators, yesterday I reported to you on my attendance as your representative at the
Second Part of the Twenty-Second Ordinary Session of the
Western European Union Assembly held in Paris from
November 29 to December 2, 1976. In the main, I limited my
remarks to the question and problems of the construction of a
more coherent European Community, and the creation in that
context of a European Parliament to be elected by universal
suffrage during 1978. The remainder of what I wanted to say
being somewhat lengthy, I asked for and received your concurrence in my reporting today on other aspects of the work of the
Western European Union Assembly.

February 10, 1977

I have mentioned that the primary focus of the Western
European Union is on the defence of Western Europe. In this
regard three specific defence matters were debated-(1) Western Europe's policy towards Mediterranean problems; (2)
European security and East-West relations; and (3) anti-submarine warfare.
In general, however, the overriding concern of the European
parliamentarians can be expressed in the concept of weapons
standardization. Lord Duncan-Sandys of the United Kingdom,
in the debate on defence, made the following comment:
I made a tour of army and air force headquarters of
NATO in West Germany. Wherever we went, concern
was expressed to us about the grave consequences of the
failure to standardize the armaments of the NATO allies,
or, at least, to make them inter-operable.
* (1510)

As many honourable senators know, the Warsaw Pact
nations have armaments co-ordinated by and, in large part,
designed and made by the Soviet Union. They are thus standardized and interchangeable amongst all members of the
Warsaw Pact. They have what is known in the military world
as inter-operability. Modern warfare is essentially mobile, and
armed forces to be effective must be able to move freely over
the battle area. That means that the Warsaw Pact countries
can draw on one another's ammunition, and they now have
compatible communications systems.
Unfortunately, this is not the present position for Western
European defence. Several European parliamentarians were
prepared to admit that the state of ammunition and equipment
in the NATO alliance had been unduly influenced by the
respective domestic economic considerations and commercial
rivalry of NATO members, and yet while there was a general
acceptance of both the military and economic advantages of
standardization in NATO, there seemed also to be a sense of
frustration in respect of anything being done about it in the
near term. As more than one parliamentarian said during the
course of the Assembly, it was clear that whenever the interests of the group were somewhat costly to the interests of one
of the key member nations, it was almost inevitable that the
national interest was given primacy.
In addition, the conflict between the United States and
European nations in required weapons configurations was the
subject of specific comments. The United States require weapons for use throughout the world, whereas the Europeans need
them only for operations in the European theatre. As a result,
European armaments are generally less costly than United
States' weaponry. Moreover, Europeans tended to manufacture weapons more for their economic benefits, whereas the
United States manufacture of weapons is under rigid military
supervision and control.
Another point mentioned was the importance of research in
weapons standardization, and there exists little cooperation in
Europe in this matter because of the great profitability of
armament sales to other parts of the world. There is even less
cooperation in weapons research with the United States for

The Cyprus situation was described as one of the most

What has exacerbated this crisis is that geological formations favourable for oil prospecting have been found in the
Aegean and both Greece and Turkey have launched prospecting campaigns. It was clear that the Western European Union
was not prepared to take sides in this matter, but considered it
a basis of severe tension between Greece and Turkey, which
added to the military instability in the area.
The Lebanese affair was described as a situation in which
300,000 Palestinean refugees destroyed the delicate religious
and political balance between Moslems and Christians, on
which the Lebanese constitution and political customs were
based. The final fuse was that Palestinean armed elements
carrying out raids into Israel often attracted reprisals by
Israeli forces, many of which were directed against Christian
Lebanese. Again, European parliamentarians had no specific
proposals for the Lebanese situation, but said that Europe had
"a direct interest in maintaining a Lebanese State which is an
essential centre for its trade with the Arab world." The Greek
foreign minister, Mr. Constantin Stavropoulos, and a Turkish
parliamentarian, Mr. Inan, both spoke to the Assembly.
On the topic of European security and East-West relations,
much of the debate, after considering the military balance,
including the balance in strategic missiles in nuclear systems,
focussed on the defence effort in light of the political accommodation described as détente, and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, known as the SALT talks. The concern of
European parliamentarians in this area was that the effort at
maintaining European defences, even at the present level, was
being hampered both by the economic recession in Europe and
by a relaxed attitude in the governments of the NATO alliance
towards defence based on the policy of détente and the Helsinki Agreement. Dr. Henry Kissinger, then Secretary of State
for the United States, described the objectives of SALT at a
lecture in London on June 25, 1976, in the following way:
The continuing build-up of strategic arms only leads to
fresh balances-but at higher levels of expenditure and
uncertainty. Moreover, a continuing race diverts resources
from their needed areas, such as forces for regional
defence, where imbalance can have serious geo-political
consequences. All these factors have made arms limitations a practical interest of both sides, as well as a factor
for stability in the world.
In the same address, Secretary Kissinger, also speaking about
détente, made the following comment:
We should not allow the Soviet Union to apply détente
selectively within the alliance. Competition among us in
our diplomatic or economic policies toward the East risks
dissipating Western advantages and opening up Soviet

February 10, 1977

opportunities. We must resist division and maintain the
closest coordination.
Much of the debate on the question of European security
and East-West relations concerned itself with the degree of
coordination and cooperation which was necessary to prevent a
let-down in readiness, and in order to provide stability in
defence arrangements. On the matter of anti-submarine warfare, the Assembly was advised that the Soviet submarine
force consists of 309 submarines of all types, compared with
116 in service with the United States Navy. The debate related
to Western vulnerability in its sea lanes. European NATO
countries are dependent on seaborne traffic for both military
supplies and reinforcements which would flow across the
Atlantic in the event of hostilities. Total goods traffic between
Europe and America in 1975 amounted to 1.6 billion tons
carried by some 7,000 merchant ships. Oil supplies alone
amounted to some 65 million tons. The Deputy Supreme
Allied Commander Atlantic, Vice-Admiral Jungius, considered the Soviet submarine threat to be a serious one, and
gave it as his opinion that serious hostilities would require the
deployment by the Soviets of at least 100 submarines in the
North Atlantic. Accordingly, monitoring of Soviet submarine
activity to determine such a build-up was taking place, and
was a critical activity of the Atlantic alliance.
While no mention of the Canadian contribution was made
during the debate, many of the parliamentarians were aware
of the Canadian surveillance in the western Atlantic, and of
the debate in this country on the issue of re-equipping our air
capacity. I found the debate on submarine detection systems
quite fascinating, and I believe it will suffice for me to say that
no-one is yet satisfied that any existing technical systems are
adequate for detecting, tracking and identifying submarines.
The Assembly recommended that increased effort be undertaken in the matter of submarine detection.
One final major area was debated at the Assembly, and this
related to the question of European energy supplies. While it
was acknowledged that there is a close link between European
security and the safeguarding of energy supplies, it was also
acknowledged that Western European governments have been
unable, and some are unwilling, to establish a common energy
supply policy. So far as the nuclear program is conberned,
parliamentarians were satisfied that no large-scale effort was
possible until nuclear hazards were better understood and
much more was known about the problems of storing radioactive waste. It was generally concluded that there is a need to
reduce consumption in Europe even further in order to lessen
both the dependency on imported oil and having to resort to
nuclear power.
Finally, there was some urgency addressed to alternative
sources of energy, and some parliamentarians said that national research programs were indicating that solar energy
undoubtedly had a more significant role to play in the future.
In brief, there is not a great deal of difference between
Europe and Canada in our general attitude and approach to
energy policy. Energy demand in the future will relate to the
rate of economic growth and the success of conservation

February 10, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

measures. Nearly every prediction is for energy consumption
to nearly double by 1990, and that will dictate a tight control
of consumption because of the domestic supply situation, the
dependence on foreign oil and the increased danger of pollution. Governments in Europe and Canada will have to make
major changes in their energy policies, reduce per capita
consumption, and find ways of making these policies acceptable to their communities.
Until 1973 the cost of energy from existing sources did not
include a charge to cover the cost of seeking alternative
sources to take over when existing means were depleted.
Future prices will have to allow for this, and it is hard to see
how the near future-say, to the year 2000-will be other
than a high cost energy era. It was the conclusion of the
rapporteur that Western Europe, the United States, Canada
and Japan would have to collaborate in setting up machinery
for crisis management.
Honourable senators, I found it of great value to be present
at this particular session. I have endeavoured to describe some
of the events that took place at the public meetings. Let me
assure you that an added value, hitherto undisclosed, is the
opportunity for Canadian parliamentarians to sell Canada's
message to parliamentarians in Europe. I had more productive
conversations with British, German, Italian and French parliamentarians than I could have imagined when I first went
there. They are full of curiosity about Canada. They want to
know what we are doing, and why we are doing it. They want
to know why we have a different outlook from the United
States. They want to know what are the differences between
Canada and the United States. Some of them are extremely
well informed, and I felt a little sheepish at not having all the
answers.
In any event, I urge that the Senate continue to participate
in meetings of international parliamentarians at every possible
opportunity for the purpose of making Canada better known
abroad.
Honourable senators, if no other senator wishes to contribute to this debate, I suggest it be declared concluded.
Senator McDonald: Would the honourable senator permit a
question?
Senator Austin: Certainly.
Senator McDonald: In his remarks the honourable senator
referred to the amount of oil that is moving into Western
Europe through the Mediterranean. Has he any figures on the
amount of oil that is going to Western Europe through the
Mediterranean, compared to that moving across the Indian
Ocean and around the Cape?
a (1530)
Senator Austin: There has been a change in the quantities
since the Suez Canal was reopened. There is also a good deal
supplied by pipeline from the Gulf of Suez across into the
Mediterranean, and also by pipeline from Iraq to eastern
Mediterranean ports. I do not have the numbers with me, but I
can get them for you. I will say, however, as a general answer
to your question, that the transmission of oil through the Suez

80003--2/

Canal or by pipeline over Arab countries into the Mediterranean provides a very high proportion of the total tonnage of
oil delivered today.
Senator McDonald: Perhaps I might make one comment. I
think the volume of oil that is coming around the Cape is
much less, as you said, than it was prior to the reopening of the
Suez Canal, and also the construction of pipelines. I believe
that today Europe could not exist more than a matter of days,
or months at the outside, without those shipping lanes around
the Cape being protected. In my view, they have far less
protection today than have the lines of communication through
the Mediterranean. I believe this should be of equal interest
and concern, not only to Europeans but to ourselves, in view of
the vulnerability of the shipping lanes through the Indian
Ocean and around the Cape.
Senator Austin: As Senator McDonald obviously knows, the
Soviet fleet has a presence in the Indian Ocean, which is of
great concern to countries bordering the Indian Ocean. In
addition, iñ recent months the Soviets have played a larger role
in naval operations off the coasts of such countries as Angola,
so they, too, are aware of the importance to the so-called
Western countries of that shipping lane.
Senator Yuzyk: First of all, I should like to commend
Senator Austin for his excellent report on the Twenty-Second
Session of the Western European Union Assembly which, of
course, is important to us in many ways, and is connected with
NATO in general. I should like to ask whether any attention
at all was paid to the monitoring of the Helsinki Agreement.
Senator Austin: A considerable debate took place on the
Helsinki Agreement and whether it was being implemented in
the letter as well as in spirit by the Warsaw Pact nations. The
conclusion at this time is that it is too early to have a serious
reading of the overall trend of Eastern European policy on that
question. There were a number of comments that indicated
watchfulness and a certain degree of scepticism about the good
intentions of the Soviet Union in that respect. I would say that
a number of European parliamentarians stake a lot on the
ability of the United States to use its undoubted economic
power to bring about an effective degree of cooperation under
the Helskinki Agreement.
Senator Yuzyk: The reason I ask that question is because we
were dealing with that problem at a session of the North
Atlantic Assembly in Williamsburg. Up to that time-that is,
up to November 15 last-some of the European nations had
not indicated that they were prepared to monitor some aspects,
particularly the "third basket" of the Helsinki Agreement. I
was hoping that perhaps they would take this matter a little
more seriously, particularly those countries that had not so
indicated thus far, because of the fact that it is expected there
will be a review at a conference that is to be held in Belgrade
probably-I say probably-in June. We have had no indication that the Warsaw Pact countries are very enthusiastic
about this review.
Senator Austin: Perhaps honourable senators will permit me
a further comment. You will appreciate that the Western

SENATE DEBATESFeray0,17
European Assembly is concerned primarily with matters of
defence. As 1 said in my earlier remarks, there were a number
there who were concerned about an attitude of psychological
relaxation and Iet-down in European defence matters arising
out uf the Helsinki Agreement. Therefure, there was much
urging of a monitoring of that particular agreement to ensure
that it is not something that provides the Soviets with a
method of achieving that psychological relaxation so that they
can gain further momentumn in their arms buildup.
Senator van Roggen: 1 should like to ask a question. The
honourable senator made passing reference, at the beginning
of his remarks this afternoon, to the question of universal
elections for the European Parliament, which 1 have referred
to in this chamber when reporting on meetings of our interparliamentary group with the European Parliament. The last time
our group was there was early last fali, when they were Iooking
forward to further progress on this, although there was some
reticence on the part on the English, and a certain amount on
the part of the French, to move within the timetable of the
heads of state. Did he find continuing hopefulness that they

February 10, 1977

would indeed move forward on their timetable to universal
elections?
Senator Austin: 1 would say that the reaction of parliamentarians was one of hope and fear-hope that the decision of
the Council of Ministers to proceed towards the election of a
European Parliament will be put into effect and that elections
will indeed take place, and fear that national assemblies will
have to approve the resolution of the Council of Ministers, and
debate the matter beyond aIl possibility of realizing an election
of a European Parliament in 19'18. 1 found that British parliamentarians, in particular, both Labour and Conservative,
were raising a great number of questions about constituencies,
about whether national parliamentarians would be present,
about who would finance the elections, about whether procedures would be uniform, and, of course, raising the old chestnut of the supremacy of parliament. As domestic politics in the
United Kingdom are preoccupied with other issues these days,
1 wonder whether the British Parliament will be able to
consider this matter in 1977.
The Hon. the Speaker: As no other honourable senator
wishes to participate in this debate, the inquiry is considered as
having been debated.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 15, at 8 p.m.

NATIONAL SYMBOLS
DISTRIBUTION TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT-QUESTION

Senator Riley: Before I put a question to the Leader of the
Opposition, I am sure honourable senators will agree with me
thatSenator Asselin: Order. The honourable senator has said he
wants to put a question to the Leader of the Opposition.
Senator Riley: I meant the Leader of the Government.
Perhaps one day he will be Leader of the Opposition.
Senator Flynn: In directing a question to me rather than to
the Leader of the Government, the honourable senator no
doubt hopes to get a direct answer for once.
80003-27'2

Senator Riley: I should remind the Leader of the Opposition
of the opening words of the ode On the Receipt of My
Mother's Picture by the English poet William Cowper. His
mother had died and her remains were about to be taken away.
The poet mournfully looked at his mother's picture on the
bureau and wrote a poem beginning with the words:
Oh that those lips had language!
I might have to say that if I were to receive an answer to my
question from the Leader of the Opposition.
As honourable senators know, we are constantly being inundated with all sorts of publications, literature and brochures
from all departments of government. We learn how to gauge
the weight, under the metric scale, of a calf when it is being
weaned. We have brochures from Immigration, but somehow
they have missed us in one area.
a

(2010)

Under date of September 23, 1976, the Secretary of State
addressed a letter to the members of the other place. In that
letter he pointed out that there would be available for distribution by them a number of Canadian flags, some 50 of size 3
inches by 6 inches, about 200 desk-size, and 500 lapel pins
bearing a picture of the flag. He admonished the members of
the other place to share these flags with their constituents to
give them the opportunity to know Canada's flag and its use
and history. But somehow or other that letter did not appear
among the volume of correspondence which appears on our
desks. These piles are so big that I am reminded of the words
of the great Nova Scotian, the late Joseph Howe, who played
such a large part in the building of Confederation. When
writing in the Novascotian in 1833, he said:
We have beside us a mountain of Books, Magazines,
Pamphlets and Newspapers, that have been accumulating
for the last two months, unopened and unread. Like a
Turk, in the dim twilight of his Harem, he scarcely knows
which to chooseI called the Citizenship Branch of the Department of the
Secretary of StateSome Hon. Senators: Get to the question!
Senator Riley: I was told these flags and symbols were not
available to us, and I began to wonder if we in the Senate do
not have constituents with whom to share the flag and its
history and use.
I want to ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate,
why not? Are we second-class parliamentarians? Can't we
share with our constituents the flag of Canada that is being
distributed by the Secretary of State? Can these flags be made
available to us?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Perrault: I am sure the honourable senator is
second to none in his zeal to promote Canadian symbols, such
as the Maple Leaf flag pins and so on. I want to assure him
that a few hours ago I spoke personally to the Honourable the
Secretary of State and broached the question with him. He
said that it was his understanding that members of Parliament,
whether they serve in the House of Commons or in the Senate,
were to be entitled to a number of flag pins and other items to
distribute to their constituents. As I say, I spoke only this
afternoon to the Honourable the Secretary of State.
INCOME TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading of Bill C-22, to
amend the statute law relating to income tax.
He said: Honourable senators, it is not by my wish that I
address you once again in so short a period of time. The reason
I do so is that before the Christmas recess, when the chairman
of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce and other qualified members were out of town, this
bill was supposed to reach us. At that time our whip informed
me he was desperate and had therefore to call on me as his last
hope.
Senator Flynn: What date exactly? Do you remember the
exact date? It would be interesting for the record.
Senator Cook: It was some time before Christmas.
The bill before us, although in the main a relieving measure,
is in some respects a highly complicated and technical piece of
legislation. For that reason I am glad to propose that it again
be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce should it in due course be given second
reading. With those preliminary remarks, I will give you the
explanation I prepared last December because, notwithstanding the long delay in the other place, no amendment of any
consequence was made.
Senator Flynn: Despite our report.
Senator Cook: Quite. We can make a second report. Perhaps they will do something then.
Bill C-22 is intended to implement the ways and means
motion which was originally tendered by the Minister of
Finance with his budget resolutions on May 25, 1976. By
resolution of the Senate of November 16, 1976, the Banking
Committee was authorized to examine and report upon the
subject matter of the bill. On December 8, 1976, the committee reported to the Senate, and the report outlined the main
provisions of the proposed legislation. The Banking Committee
reported favourably upon the bill, subject to some misgivings,
and in a few moments I will draw these points to the attention
of the Senate.
As I have said, the bill is, in the main, a relieving measure,
except for one important provision. I refer, of course, to the
individual surtax imposed by clause 65 of the bill. This surtax
is imposed upon individuals and trusts other than mutual
funds, and is imposed for the taxation year 1976 only. The

February 15, 1977

additional tax is 10 per cent of the tax that is now imposed
when the present tax is in excess of $8,000. In other words, if
the existing federal tax is assessed at $10,000 the taxpayer will
pay a further $200; that is, 10 per cent on the tax of $10,000
less the $8,000 allowance which is stipulated for in the bill;
$10,000 less $8,000 equals $2,000, which would be subject to
the 10 per cent surtax. This measure will therefore affect only
taxpayers with taxable incomes of more than $30,000.
The principal relieving measures relate to: first, preferred
compensation plans; secondly, child care expense deductions;
and thirdly, small business deductions.
Taking these subject matters in turn, the first is deferred
compensation plans. I refer honourable senators to the report
of the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, which reads
in part as follows:
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS

Your committee welcomes the proposed amendments to
the Act (Clauses 1, 5 and 56 (4)) to increase the maximum amounts deductible for contributions to deferred
compensation plans. The proposed maximum for 1976
and subsequent years is as follows:

Maxinium

$2,500

$5,500

* (2020)

The act contains no limitation on the amounts a taxpayer may contribute each year to registered retirement
savings plans and deferred profit sharing plans; the Act
only contains limitations on the amounts taxpayers may
deduct in computing their income subject to tax. Certain
taxpayers have found it to their advantage to contribute
amounts in excess of the maximum amounts available for
deduction purposes to these plans because the earnings of
such contributions would not be subject to tax while held
by the plans.

February 15, 1977
February 15, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

The bill proposes (Clause 69) a tax of one percent (1%)
per month on contributions by taxpayers in excess of
$5,500 per year to each of their registered retirement
savings plans and deferred profit sharing plans to discourage this practice.
Your committee and very many taxpayers are concerned
with some features of registered pension plans and registered
retirement savings plans, and devoted a good deal of time to
considering these plans. You will be glad to hear that the
Minister of Finance is undertaking further study of the inflexibility that confronts the owners of these savings when the plans
mature.
Honourable senators will welcome clause 21 of the bill,
which doubles the maximum deduction for child care expense.
The maximum deduction upon the passage of the bill will be
$30 per week per child, a maximum of $1,000 per year per
child and a maximum annual limit of $4,000 per family.
The final major relieving provision relates to small business
deduction.
A measure of substantial benefit to incorporated small
businesses, which play such a leading role in our economy,
involves a further major increase in the small business deduction limits. Effective for 1976 and subsequent taxation years,
the maximum annual amount of active business income of
Canadian-controlled private corporations subject to the 25 per
cent low rate will be increased from $100,000 to $150,000, and
the total cumulative limit will be increased from $500,000 to
$750,000. Canadian small business will save an additional $30
million in taxes in the first full year as a result of this measure.
The bill also, by clause 60, proposes substantial changes
respecting the income tax treatment of charities. The purpose
of the changes is to ensure that charities are not inhibited from
carrying on their work in the most effective manner possible
and at the same time to prevent abuses that could arise.
The report of the Banking Committee goes into some detail
on this subject, and recommends for future consideration an
amendment to the section. However, further information on
the section, if required, could perhaps await the committee
stage.
Clause 24 of the bill will allow taxpayers the full amount of
Canadian exploration expenses incurred after May 25, 1976,
and before July 1, 1979, in computing their income. The
Income Tax Act now limits the deduction of such expenses for
taxpayers who are not principal business corporations to 30 per
cent per annum.
There are minor relieving amendments relating to imposition of capital gains tax on a taxpayer's principal residence.
Transfers from one spouse to another of the amount of certain
deductions is also somewhat simplified. These provisions were
all approved by the Banking Committee, and once again the
details of each subject matter could perhaps be better dealt
with in committee.
The Banking Committee suggested certain other amendments but I do not think I need refer to these in detail as they
go outside the sections of the bill which I am now explaining.

However, if any senator would like to refer to the report, these
amendments can, of course, be discussed in committee.
We come now to two sections which could be considered as
warts on the face of the bill, and which were questioned by
your committee. The first related to retroactive taxation.
While it is general practice to enact retroactive legislation to
give relief to taxpayers, clause 42(1) will enact a retroactive
provision which in a small way could operate against the
interests of taxpayers.
The purpose of the amendment is to prevent taxpayers living
with their spouses from claiming a higher deduction equivalent
to the marriage deduction for dependants in cases where it was
the intent of the act that they only be entitled to a lesser
deduction. In other words, taxpayers might be able to take
advantage of the wording of the act to defeat the intent.
Notwithstanding this proper fear, the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce felt that the retroactive effect of this amendment would create a dangerous precedent and the Senate should indicate its disapproval of any
retroactive provision adversely affecting taxpayers.
Finally, clause 75 which relates to the use of a taxpayer's
social insurance number incurred the disapproval of the committee, which feels that social insurance numbers should not
be used or abused for purposes over and beyond those contemplated when they were originally introduced. Paragraph (6) of
the report reads as follows:
Clause 75 provides that resident individuals must insert
their social insurance numbers on ownership certificates
which must be completed when receiving interest or dividend payments in respect of bearer coupons or warrants.
Should such an individual not provide his social insurance
number, the bank or paying agent would be obliged to
withhold 25 per cent of the interest or dividend payment.
This, of course, would be refunded by the department when
the number is provided. This paragraph of the report
continues:
Your committee feels this would constitute an improper
use of taxpayers' social insurance numbers and taxpayers
should only be obliged to provide their proper names and
addresses.
On motion of Senator Smith (Colchester), debate
adjourned.

encourage greater support for the Force. The financial
arrangements for UNEF/UNDOF are based on the principle of mandatory assessment and are generally satisfactory, altbougb Canada regrets the withholding of payment
by certain states for political reasons, which has resulted
in delays in reimbursing troop contributors. Canada is
hopeful that unpaid balances will eventually be settled..

enough to have kind words for me, even if we are not supposed
to be sitting on the same side of the house.
Senator Flynn: But we are.

(

Senator Marchand: Finally, I want to thank those who,
wanting to respect my humility, said nothing. The result is that
I do not have too many wounds to heal.
[Translation]
My appointment to the Senate, honourable senators, may
have come as quite a surprise to a great many of you but it did
to me too.
Senator Flynn: Not to me.
Senator Marchand: Of course, I believe that the thought
does enter the mind of every member of Parliament, for some
reason or another. One never knows when it will happen.
Personally, I thought it would happen much later but for the
reasons you all know, it came much earlier. And I am reminded, honourable senators, of an inscription I read-and I assure
you, honourable senators, that there is nothing in what I will
say-it is an inscription to be found at the entrance to the St.
Sylvestre cemetery in France and which reads as follows:
Passant qui passez, ne pensez-vous pas passer par ce
passage où passant, j'ai passé. Si vous n'y pensez pas
passant, vous n'êtes pas sage, car en n'y pensant pas, vous
vous y verrez passer.
Loosely translated, it means that whoever goes by thinking
he will not pass this way, as I did, is a fool because he will even
if he would rather not think about it. But here I am amongst
you, determined not only to take part in your work but also to
fight for our common ideals and be as active as possible so that
the Senate will really be equal to its past achievements, equal
to the reputation it deserves, the reputation it was meant to
have by the Constitution and that many would like it to have
in our society.
Honourable senators, i wish to talk briefly tonight about
what happened in Quebec or rather of certain aspects of the
situation. I have noticed in the debate going on in Canada, in
French-speaking Canada but mainly in English-speaking
Canada, a simplification of the problem which arose in
Quebec.
[English|
For some, it is a very simple thing. They feel they have the
answer. For them, there are no insurmountable problems. It is
the view of some that the Quebec problem will be solved by
simply reducing unemployment and increasing prosperity, or
through greater use of the French language. I regret to say,
honourable senators, that that is not the way I view the
problem. To my mind, it is much more complex than that. It is
a problem which will not be easily solved.
[Translation]
When studying the Quebec problem, there are some who
evidently restrict it to the nationalistic phenomenon-the
pequistes, the nationalists who have succeeded, through various circumstances, in taking over power and endangering the

411

life of our country. There are finally those who try to convince
the nationalists and the separatists that it would be very bad
for Quebec to separate from the rest of Canada and that
Quebec should stay within the country as a whole in order to
take advantage of a greater prosperity and higher standards of
living.
[English]
I must tell you, honourable senators, that I personally
believe that as far as this group of nationalists in Quebec is
concerned-and it is quite a large group; I would not want to
put any figure on it but it is a growing group-whatever
argument we may use in this respect, I do not think for a
moment it is going to change the mind of a single one of them.
It reminds me of Denis de Rougemont, a French author who
went to Russia and Germany during the thirties, and who,
when he returned, wrote in a French newspaper, "If ever you
meet a young Russian or a young German face to face you will
see all the -futility of having merely reason,"-because the
problem is not at that level. You can convince a certain
number of people-what we would call reasonable peoplebut for the others I tell you that they are not the majority. I
am convinced they are not the majority. I think they are an
important minority, but they are still not the majority. But if
they were the majority my conviction is that it would be
useless. We might do anything, such as changing the Constituion, or having all the debates here in French and having
French all over the place, but I think this matter would still
have to follow its normal course to the end. That is my
personal conviction, and I think this is the lesson we have
learned from history too. This, honourable senators, is one
problem, but it is not the one I want to deal with now.
[Translation]
How come that, at that time, the separatists came to power?
Is it because they had succeeded in convincing the majority of
Quebecers that separation would be a good thing? I simply
want to draw up a succinct list of the problems confronting
Quebec prior to the provincial election. Honourable senators,
as you know, I was one of the unsuccessful candidates-not
only unsuccessful but also one of the victims of the provincial
election. You had to live it to understand what it was. I
already have experienced several elections, I have been in
public life for 35 years, in extremely difficult situations, such
as the trade union movement, but I have never seen anything
like the last provincial election in Quebec.
What was at stake then? Of course, there was the nationalist problem, the problem of independence, which kept emerging in the history of Canada from 1763 or 1760-through the
Quebec Act, the Constitutional Act, the Union Act, the British
North America Act; in short, ever since the beginning there
has been this constant nationalist movement in Quebec, which
is more or less strong, according to circumstances. But what
was new this time? First, there was the strike, or the strikes in
the public and semi-public sectors: Hospitals were paralyzed,
schools and universities were closed, Hydro Quebec was sabotaged. There was the Olympics, which caused many disagreements. There was a confrontation between the provincial gov-

SENATE DEBATES
ernment and what is known as the common front; namely, the
three major trade unions, QTA, CNTU and QFL. There were
rising prices and inflation. There was unemployment. And
there was this extremely touchy issue, which hurt all of us, the
"gens de l'Air" problem. There were constitutional problems.
There was the problem of income control as well as Bill 22
and, of course, the Olympics. There was the political problem
arising from the imbalance at the Quebec Legislative
Assembly where one party had 102 seats while the others were
practically unrepresented we had the bilingualism and the
regional development problems-all of them at the same time.
Incidentally, as I was telling some of my friends about the
situation in Quebec, a few months before the provincial elections, I was prompted by the conditions prevailing there to say
to them that the first political party, the first politician who
would dare appear before the voters would get killed. It was an
untenable position as all these elements combined and played
their parts concurrently. Of course some of them were not
under federal jurisdiction. The Olympics, for example, were
Mr. Drapeau's responsibility, whereas inflation comes within
the federal government's jurisdiction. But as you know, the
electorate gives a general, not a municipal or provincial kind of
response, and dissatisfied voters tell the first politician they
happen to meet of their displeasure by voting him out.
I do not intend to deal with all those matters this evening,
because I will have more opportunities to do so, but I wanted
to deliver my first speech in the Senate on most of those points.
I intend to speak about them either in Quebec or elsewhere in
Canada, but the situation in Quebec is quite explosive.
As I say, the situation in Quebec is extremely complex and
difficult. Not only do those who proffer simplistic solutions not
help to solve the problem, they confuse the issue and will
eventually prevent us from solving it.
Now, there are two aspects I would like to deal with. One
may be somewhat technical but I shall try to make it as clear
as possible. There is, on the whole, the problem of confrontation between the state and the unions. For the first time in the
history of the Province of Quebec, we see such a confrontation
in the province; but it has also occurred in Ottawa, that is, in
the rest of the country, through CALPA and CATCA, as also
in the case of the Canadian Labour Congress.

(2040)

The Canadian Labour Congress decided to call a general
strike against a definite policy of the federal government.
What does that mean exactly? In order to understand exactly
what it means, you must know what the philosophic basis is of
our labour relations legislation. In order to know that you have
to examine the Wagner Act which was passed under Roosevelt
in the United States in 1935.
Perhaps you will say that that is pretty remote. Well, I have
to go that far away because it is the only place to go. That is
where the philosophy and structure of our labour relations
were defined for the first time in North America. And I tell
you that our own law, the first one, which was CP-1003, for

February 15, 1977

those who are as old as I am, which was passed in 1944, was
copied, in its spirit at least, from the Wagner Act, and
immediately after that a labour relations act was passed in
Quebec in February 1944, and all of the labour relations acts
in all of the other provinces also followed right away.
So what is the meaning of this Wagner Act? Before the
Wagner Act was passed in the United States, there used to be
a particular kind of trouble in the industrial world. First of all,
there used to be fights between unions to decide what union
would be recognized by an employer. I am not suggesting that
was the situation in all cases, but that situation was so
widespread that it became a matter of deep concern or worry
for the government. When one fight was finished and one
union had the majority, and therefore the control of the
workers, a second fight occurred. This was against the employer, and its purpose was to have the union recognized by the
employer, because there was no law compelling the employer
to recognize the union. Once that fight was over and the union
was recognized, a third fight occurred. This was a fight on the
agreement itself, because the union wanted to be recognized
not simply for the sake of being recognized but in order to
have a signed agreement which would benefit it.
So someone around Roosevelt's time made a decision with
respect to this whole situation. Unfortunately, I cannot
remember who it was. Some of my colleagues here who are
better acquainted with the labour movement probably do. Just
in passing, I think of Senator Forsey who wrote a history of
the labour movement in Canada, and if any of you are
interested in knowing how the labour movement developed in
Canada, you could benefit from reading Senator Forsey's
book, which is well written and most interesting.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Marchand: In any event, the situation was that
someone, under the National Industrial Recovery Act, if my
memory serves me well, decided that the union that had the
majority of a group was the bargaining unit, and it would be
the sole representative of the whole group. So that ended what
we would call in English the jurisdictional fights between the
unions. The second step was that the employer would have to
recognize the union that had the majority, and would be
compelled to negotiate in good faith with that union.
Now, what is the significance of that? Well, in order to
explain what has been going on in Quebec and elsewhere I will
have to go back a bit in history. First of all, when in North
America we speak of freedom of association-and I mean in
the industrial field or those groups falling under our industrial
acts-that means freedom of the majority, not the freedom of
all individuals. In other words, if you work in a steel plant in
Hamilton you will have to join the Steel Workers of America.
If you work at Price Brothers in Kenogami, or with the pulp
and sulphite workers, you will have to join the national union,
the CNTU. If you work in a hospital or are a civil servant in
Quebec, you will have to join the CNTU, and here in Ottawa
you will have to join the Alliance. So when we speak about
freedom of association it is the freedom of the majority. If you

February 15, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

do not agree with that, that is just too bad. But there is no
other way of being recognized.
In addition to that, you have what we call the union security
clauses in the agreement, because when yoù have this monopoly of representation established by law, you then have an
agreement which usually says that if you are a member of the
union you stay a member of the union, and you sign a card in
order that the dues may be collected by the employer. You will
have to pay, or you will have to join.

Well, he was elected. That night I thought I would die. I
could not understand it at all. So the following day, after I had
recovered a little, I saw a few friends and said, "Well, can you
explain that to me? This is nonsense. We have been fighting
this government, and then this happens." My friends said to
me, "Jean, we like you very much when you negotiate agreements, but politics is not your business. It is as simple as that:
politics is not your business." So they elected Tancrède
L'Abbé, and with a damned good majority.

* (2050)

Senator Fournier (de Lanaudière): And they did well. I
know him personally.

That means that the whole system is based on a certain
freedom-not a complete freedom, but a limited freedom, and
that freedom is the freedom of the majority.
How do you compare that with Europe? In France, for
example, or almost any other country, you join the union of
your choice. If you are a communist in France, you join the
CGT. If you are a socialist, you join la force ouvrière, and
there is no monopoly of representation of any kind. It means
that the union you join represents, or that its ideology corresponds with, your ideology.
In Canada that is not so. That is why it was always very
difficult and, I might say, almost impossible, for the unions in
Canada or in North America to bring the workers to support
one political party. Why? Because they do not join a union
because of the ideology of that union. I do not know what is
the ideology of the carpenters' union. I have no idea whatsoever, and I do not think any other honourable senator knows.
However, the workers do not join a union for that. So when the
union takes a political stand and says, "Well, we, the union,
say you should support this or that party," it is just too bad,
and I do not know where they get the mandate to say that.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Marchand: The result is that if honourable senators
look at the history of the labour movement in Canadastarting in 1943, when the Canadian Congress of Labour
decided to support the CCF-they will see that the majority of
the members probably never supported the CCF. I say that not
because I am opposed to the CCF, but because I have had
some personal experience.
I recall the asbestos strike. Some honourable senators here
may have heard of that strike. I was the leader of the strike,
and therefore recall it well. It will be recalled that we were
fighting Mr. Duplessis. It was an open fight against Mr.
Duplessis. We controlled all the mines except a small one
called the Bell Mine. It was a hard fight and one which spread
throughout the province. Even the bishops were involved.
There was a municipal election during the strike, and Mr.
Duplessis decided to present his candidate as mayor. French
Canadians in and around Quebec will all recall Tancrède
l'Abbé, who was Minister of State in Mr. Duplessis' cabinet. I
held a meeting with my men and said, "Well, let's give him a
real fight." This occurred in the middle of the strike. We
worked hard to defeat that man who, for us, was the symbol of
all that we were suffering in the asbestos industry.

80003-28

Senator Marchand: Because of our system, it is very difficult, through the central union, the parent body, to take a
political stand. That does not mean that the unions cannot
become involved in politics, because unions in North America
have always been involved in politics. They make representations to the government, they are members of boards, they
prepare and present briefs, and they publicly support certain
measures. That is politics, and it is normal. It is part of the
game. We have the unions negotiating, and through the parent
bodies; provincial and national, we make representations to try
to improve the welfare of the workers. That, I think, is entirely
normal and it should be kept that way. I support that.
But when labour agreements are used to compel the government to do something outside the scope of the agreement, then
unions are no longer acting within the same system. They are
changing the system. We cannot have, at the same time, the
European system and the American system. We cannot have a
monopoly of representation, which is something unique all over
the world, for the protection of agreements, and, at the same
time, have the freedom to do whatever we want or whatever
the union dictates.
When CALPA and CATCA decided to paralyze air traffic
in Canada because they were not satisfied with the policy of
the government, I say that was wrong and unacceptable. I
would not mind if CALPA and CATCA came to Ottawa and
said, "This is nonsense," and then met with members of the
opposition and the press and applied pressure. But to call a
strike and say to the government, "You are going to accept
this or, before the Olympics, we will paralyze air transport in
Canada," is what I call blackmail, and I do not think that any
government can stand for it. They have now been doing the
same thing in Quebec.
Senator Bourget: Exactly.
Senator Marchand: I shall not make any comment on that.
The provincial government decided to recognize, as a bargaining agent, what we call the Front Commun. Why is that wrong
in our system? It is wrong for one reason and that is that if
you recognize the Front Commun there is no longer any
flexibility possible in the negotiations, because the objectives
are determined by the Front Commun-and that means the
parent body, the CNTU-FTQ-CEQ and Mr. Charbonneau.
Those objectives become of such importance that no one will
compromise.

SENATE DEBATES
I recall that when I started in the labour movement I was an
organizer of the Canadian Catholic Organization of Labour.
We were fighting for the social doctrine of the church. We
could not compromise on anything like that. Can one compromise on the social doctrine of the church? It is not possible. I
recall a funny story about that.
* (2100)

However, the system has been built-and this is very important-in such a fashion that the local union may be recognized, rather than the union, or the parent body, itself. I tried
to have some unions recognize what we call in French "a
fédération professionnelle," but I never succeeded. And rightly
so, because the system is that the employer negotiates with the
local union, regardless of whether it is advised by the union or
the parent body. The employer negotiates with the local, and if
there are many locals they get together, although this is of
their own free will; this is not imposed by the law. The only
thing the law compels the employer to do is to negotiate in
good faith with the union that is certified by the board. This is
the only legal obligation they have.
Of course, the scope of the agreements is much wider than it
used to be, and I know that Mrs. Shirley Goldenberg wrote a
very interesting report on this for the professional workers, for
example.
At this point I am going to talk a little bit about newspapermen. I regret this, because I will lose the game. But, I will do
it just the same.
When the professional workers, the professional employees,
were organized, they were not interested only in wages and
hours of work; they were interested in their profession itself.
They wanted to protect their profession through their agreement, so they widened the scope of the agreement. The same
situation exists in the case of the newspapermen. From the
moment they were recognized they were interested in more
than hours of work, salaries and grievance procedures. They
wanted to protect the freedom of information. They wanted to
be free to report what they saw and to write what they
thought, and this is a good thing. I think this is the way it
should be. I do not think that because somebody owns a
newspaper he should be able to compel a newsman to write
something that he has not seen, or bas not seen in that
particular way, or to write something that he does not believe
in. That is what freedom of information is all about, and I
think that that is the way it should be. But the contrary is also
true. I mean by that that the newsman cannot choose, in order
to promote his own party or ideologies, to use the newspaper or
the facilities it offers. One situation is as serious as the other.
For example, the reporters of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation-or Radio-Canada, in French-have no authority
at all to use this institution to promote their own ideas. They
are violating the spirit and the letter of the law when they do
So.

The man who heads the CBC, AI Johnson, is a friend of
mine, but, apart from that, he is a man I like. I think he is a
very honest man. He cannot, however, control everything. I
know that the programming of the CBC, or, at least, Radio-

February 15, 1977

Canada, which I watch more often, has improved constantly
since he has been there, and this I like, but it is at the
information level where facts are distorted, and that is where,
in Quebec, systematically in certain cases, they have simply
supported the Parti Quebecois against the federal government
and against the country. They used a federal institution to do
this, and I think the unions themselves should discipline their
members when they do such things.
You may say to me, "Well, you have spent your life
organizing strikes." In fact, I was the one who led the CBC
strike in Montreal in 1959. At that time I was told about all
the tricks that those people can use in order to promote their
own ideas, or to destroy somebody, for example, with the
camera. You know, if you scratch your nose, that that will be
the time for a close-up. It is very easy. There are a hundred
ways to destroy a man. In an interview program you can invite
somebody strong from one side, and somebody weak from the
other. It is really very easy.
Of course, I know that Mr. Johnson cannot monitor all
this-that would be impossible-but I tell you that RadioCanada in Quebec-and I am speaking of the part which we
call
[Translation]
Les affaires publiques is largely responsible and, if ever this
country is destroyed, it will have been destroyed, in the main, I
do not say totally, but in the main, by a federal institution that
is financed by Canadians through their taxes. That is
important.
The other night, I was listening to a reporter everyone
probably knows. Besides, I shall not name him. He is a Belgian
named DeVirieux.
Senator Fournier (de Lanaudière): Not to name anyone.
Senator Marchand: Here is a case of lack of professional
ethics. I shall not speak of the accident because, as you know, I
am in no position to speak of car accidents. Still, the way he
described the man who died in the accident, saying he was an
old soak, an old offender, a fellow who, in short, bas not
worked since 1945, had nothing to do with the case in which
the public was interested. What is this obsession with tracking
down someone who has just breathed his last? Who knows, it
may have been his fault, I don't know. Why mention it? Just
to show that, even a dog wouldn't be treated like that. Perhaps
he was not better than a dog, perhaps he was worse, I do not
know. But when you have a man who went to defend his
country during the war.
Senator Fournier (de Lanaudière): You are right.
Senator Marchand: Well, when you consider this, you are
disgusted. If it happens once, well you forgive. But when it is
systematic, then it becomes dangerous. I do not say this
happens everywhere on CBC. I do not say this happens
everywhere on Radio-Canada. I mean the way they submit
cases to the public. The way they put questions-I heard for
example how they put questions to the Minister of Finance on
CBC. It was really nauseating-forgive me the word but it was
really nauseating. The questioning was biased from beginning

to end. The only objective was to put the federal government in
an awkward position.
I do not object to embarrassing questions. It is natural. They
are dealing with politics. The job of CBC is not to rescue the
Liberal Party. It is not their job to rescue the Conservative
Party. And it is not their job to rescue the CCF. But I am sure
about one thing: the job of CBC is not to destroy this country.
[English]
Honourable senators, after hearing me you will perhaps say,
"Well, Marchand is against the unions now he is in the
Senate." But I am not against the unions; I am for the unions.
In fact, I would be ready tomorrow to start over and fight
again all the fights I fought before in Quebec and outside
Quebec. I still believe that the labour movement in North
America is the institution that has contributed the most to the
improvement of our legislation and to the welfare of the
majority. So I hope there will be no interpretation to the effect
that I am opposed to the labour unions. I am not opposed to
the labour unions, but I am opposed to those who exploit the
workers, not only in plants but intellectually and politically.
If there are some labour leaders who want to be involved in
politics, why do they not do what I did? I simply resigned, and
ran. That is all. It is so simple. But to do both at the same time
is quite another matter. If you participate in politics, in the
way I defined it, by making representations, by meeting with
the government, by bringing political and social pressures to
bear on them and so forth, that is one thing; but to use the
weapon of the strike to compel the government to act illegally,
as CALPA and CATCA did, and if that is accepted, as the
House of Commons accepted it, there will be no more labour
movement in Canada. There will be no longer a labour movement in Canada because it would be impossible to maintain
this prerogative in the law which we call the monopoly of
representation. I think it is a good feature of the law. I think
our unions are very efficient in negotiations. I think we have
better conditions than most other parts of the world because
we have these kinds of union. Those interested in the labour
movement can enter the labour movement, and those interested in politics can join political parties and fight there. Nobody
is compelled to accept an ideology that he does not believe in
or does not share.
e (2110)

I am not opposed to the teachers organizing. I remember
very well that under Mr. Duplessis they did not even have the
right of arbitration. The organization-the corporation, they
called it at the time-refused to ask for arbitration. It was the
labour movement that brought pressure to bear which resulted
in the teacher's getting the right to go to arbitration when they
were not satisfied with their working conditions. We did it.
After that we filed for the right to strike.
You can ask, "What is your stand on that? Do you favour
the right to strike in the public service?" My answer is yes. It
will surprise some of you to hear that my answer is yes. I do
not think there is any substitute for the right to strike. Butand there is a "but"-I remember making representations in

80003-28½

Quebec in respect of the right to strike for the hospital
employees and the civil servants, with Jean Lesage, who is a
former colleague of many of you. I told them at the convention, "If ever you abuse that, you are going to die with it. You
are going to die with it." You do not strike against the
government in the same way that you strike against a private
enterprise. Private enterprise is there to make a profit and, of
course, it will try to exploit the market as much as it can.
These are the rules of the game.
So the unions have the right to strike the moment they feel
they can get better benefits from labour agreements. That is
all right. But, you cannot do the same thing with the state.
You cannot imagine for one moment that you will have a
union that will have the government on its knees, and be able
to say, "Now you are going to agree to what we are asking." If
that occurs then I regret to say that you no longer have a
government in the country. That is for those who know something of the labour movement. That was one of the tragedies of
the labour movement called ELFO-I do not know what the
name is in Swedish, but it refers to the civil servants' association. They did not want to be caught between the government
they were supporting as socialists, and the organization of
their employer.
Honourable senators, you can ask, "Why are you not for
binding arbitration?" I am against binding arbitration. It is
my view that nobody in this country should be able to go
before the House of Commons and the Senate and say, "Here
are the salaries you are going to pay to your employees." It is
the prerogative of the government, of course, which reports to
the House of Commons and the Senate, to decide that. We do
not have the right to refer that to anybody. That means
somebody may decide at one moment to impose conditions
that will not be acceptable to the House of Commons, the
Senate and the government. Nobody has this right.
But in the public service, unions have been civilized a little
bit. Let me take the CGT strike in France, for example. What
is the purpose of the strike? The purpose of the strike is not to
defeat the government; its purpose is to draw the attention of
the public to the conditions under which the workers are
compelled to work. If the subway strike is paralyzing Paris,
everybody asks what is going on, and the press can report what
the workers are complaining about. But you do not see a
permanent strike. In the public service in France you do not
see that. You do not see it in Germany, and you do not see it in
Sweden.
An Hon. Senator: Even in Italy?
Senator Marchand: Let's make some exceptions in respect
of Italy.
I tell you that I prefer to have this right to strike, which is
controlled by the union-controlled to take into account the
fact that they cannot defeat the government through that
method. This is not a proper way of doing it. I prefer drawing
attention of the public to the workers' conditions to binding
arbitration.

SENATE DEBATES
I cannot understand how, in a civilized society, you can close
a university for six months. I do not blame the professors or
the university, but I tell you that such a situation is unbearable. I think the structure of universities should be determined
by governments, and not negotiated by the parties. That does
not mean the professors do not have the right to defend their
rights. They have the right to organize, to have a labour
agreement to protect their freedom and so forth, the same as
the newspapermen. The institution is not there to make money.
The universities are there to prepare a new generation of
professionals, technicians and intellectuals. This is the purpose
of the universities. Where there are injustices, the professors
must have a recourse, but I tell you that to my mind it is
unthinkable that they can destroy a university because they do
not agree on the way the universities should be run. I tell you
this is the responsibility of the government. I do not blame
anybody in the particular dispute that is going on now, but I
tell you that I do not believe that we can maintain a society in
those circumstances.
I come to my last point. So far as CATCA and CALPA are
concerned, I tell you that I regret it. I know Mr. Maley
declared that his purpose-and he declared it in Time magazine-is to stop bilingualism in Canada. I tell him that it is
none of his damn business. If he wants to do that, let him
stand for election and fight the government in that way.
An Hon. Senator: Moncton, probably.
Senator Marchand: They have created a very serious problem, and I must tell those who are not from Quebec that we
were very much humiliated by this situation-humiliated. To
the majority of French-Canadians, even those who are pro-federalists, it is unthinkable that the government should settle a
strike by modifying its policy. Of course, I did not agree, and I
resigned. I would do it again today if it had to be donc,
because I do not believe in that. I do not think the government
should be blackmailed by anybody.
There are more and more power groups in society. Take, for
example, the Manicouagan plant in Quebec. If you shut down
the Manicouagan plant in Quebec during February, you close
down the whole damn province. Everybody is going to freeze.
Yet, there are a few hundred workers who have this power in
their hands. This is when they say, "Everybody must be
treated equally." There is no equality between the unions.
There are unions that can paralyze the country from Halifax
to Vancouver overnight. Then there are other unions that I
have in mind such as, for example, those for the poor textile
workers who can stay on strike for months and months and
nobody worries. This is what they call equality. There is no
such thing as equality.
a (2120)
They talk about the working class. There is no working class
in Canada. There are working classes, which is a little bit
different. There are reasons for that, which I could explain
later on. Don't tell me that a pilot who gets $60,000 a year is
the same kind of man as the man who sweeps the streets here
in front of the Parliament Buildings at $6,000 a year. In

February 15, 1977

Europe you do not have the same situation, but that is not
what I want to deal with.
In Quebec the government had to face the common front,
and a situation was created which was largely reflected in the
vote in Quebec. To what extent I did not analyze, but it is truc.
Everybody now talks about cooperation between unions and
management, about consultation and cooperation. When I
hear that I ask how. One of the weaknesses of the labour
movement in Canada is that the unions have not had enough
money to conduct all the research that has been needed in
order to meet the employers in rational negotiations. That is a
fact. Senator Forsey can back me up on that. He was in that
field for years, and was the most able man we had in the
labour movement. There are negotiations, and I can tell you
how the decisions are made most of the time. We have a
meeting and say, "What are we going to ask for this year? In
Montreal yesterday they asked for 67 cents an hour." The
reaction is, "Oh, boy! We should ask for the same thing." But
then you say, "No, let's ask for 75 cents, because we will have
to compromise at 60 cents." There is nothing rational in all
this.
The way in which the labour movement has been built is
impossible. In the United States it is better because they have
more money. The United Automobile Workers and the Steel
Workers of America have enough money to be able to afford a
good staff and a good research bureau; they can make a deal
with the employers and negotiate on an equal level. That is not
true of most of our small unions. This is why we have to have
recourse to strikes.
I must here say something to my good friends of the labour
movement. Do you know why the CNTU is now what it is?
Because of controls during the war. You may ask how that
should be. The CNTU had a very weak labour movement,
which could hardly call a strike. When wages were frozen we
had to go before the board and argue. A small union with no
money only needed a good man who could argue to get as good
a settlement as a big union with a lot of money. You may think
I am kidding, but it is truc. I tell you that the CNTU
accomplished much more than any other labour movement
during the war. This is why when they talk of controls I do not
react in the same way as some others.
This will be my last point, honourable senators, because I do
not want to abuse the time of the Senate. I will have other
opportunities to speak. When we speak of the labour movement we do not know exactly what we are talking about. The
Canadian Labour Congress is not the same thing as the
CNTU, the Confederation of National Trade Unions. They
are not built the same way. There are people who really
represent the workers who are not known at all, but there are
others who do not represent anything who are very well known
and are considered as being strong men. When I see my good
friends the newspaper men going to interview Mr. Laberge in
Quebec, asking, "Mr. Laberge, do you think we are going to
have a general strike?" I do not even read the answer because
I know very well Mr. Laberge has not got this power. If Mr.
Jean Gérin-Lajoie says the same thing I start to worry,

February 15, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

because he represents workers, he represents something. When
Mr. Joe Morris says he is going to call a general strike in
Canada, some people are frightened because Joe Morris has
decided that. I like Joe Morris very much; I have nothing
against him; but I know very well he cannot call a general
strike in Canada; he does not have this power, unless each of
the unions say, "We are going to call a general strike."
They recently described what they called a general strike in
Canada as their success. I regret to say that it was not a
success. It was a failure in their fight against controls in
Canada. When they say a million workers were paralyzed by
the strike, I must tell you immediately that at least half of
them were prevented from going to work because transportation was paralyzed. Probably many hundreds of thousands
were on strike because they did not like to be called scabs and
they decided to take leave of absence or sick leave or something like that. Do you think there was a general strike in
Canada? We never had a general strike in Canada. Why? Not
because the workers don't want to defend their interests but
because of the way the labour movement is built. As I
explained to you, the strength is at the base. The local union
controls, and has a monopoly of representation. The union bas
the strike fund, which is very important-not the Canadian
Labour Congress, but the union. Most of the time it concerns
the American unions from the States. The serious question is:
When you have to cooperate with the labour movement, with
whom do you cooperate?
I can say the same thing about the employers. When you
talk about the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, what do
they represent? Who feels that they are bound by the CMA?
Do you feel bound? You don't. Nobody feels it. You have the
government talking together with the chambers of commerce,
the CMA, the Canadian Labour Congress, the CNTU, all
those people here in Ottawa saying, "Let's have consultation in
order to manage the economy properly." I wouldn't waste five
minutes there. But if you tell me that the director of the steel
workers, the director of the paper mill workers, the directors of
the unions which control their membership and are responsible
for labour agreements are getting together in the hall, then I
say, "Hey! Let's talk business. Mr. Laberge, you can stay out.
We will tell you what is going on afterwards." This is very
difficult for people who are not within the labour movement to
understand, because some of them are sure that Mr. Laberge
is somebody who can control the whole thing.
Just one last laugh-at least for me. One day I appeared
before a committee of the Legislative Assembly in Quebec,
when the name was the Legislative Assembly. We were asking
for amendments to the Labour Relations Act. We had present
a predecessor of Senator Sarto Fournier, Mr. Jean Drapeau.
Also present were representatives of the FTQ, the Quebec
Federation of Labour, the CNTU, the Chamber of Commerce,
and so forth-all the organizations which were interested in
that legislation. Each organization in turn disclosed the
number of people it represented, and I took my pencil and
wrote, "Mr. Drapeau, two million; Mr. Laberge, 250,000 and

the remainder. I said: "Hey, do you know what the population
of Quebec is? It is 10,500,000."
* (2130)

I wish to finish on this point, because otherwise I would be
much too long. We in this country really have to work together
in the field of labour relations. I have been in public or
semi-public life for 35 years, and what has struck me most is
that Canadians do not know Canada; we do not know each
other. We know our region; we know our community; sometimes we know a little about our province, but we do not know
each other. We cannot have a united country if we do not
understand the problems of others. We cannot understand
British Columbia if we do not understand that that province
has two important ports on the Pacific ocean, that it exports
lumber, plywood and minerals of many kinds, and is close to
the United States. Also, of course, British Columbia is very
interested in external trade, not only with the United States
but with Japan and other Asian countries. If we do not
understand that, we do not understand British Columbia.
What about the prairie provinces? Wheat crops are sometimes good and sometimes bad. If the price is good the
producers spend the winter in Hawaii; if the crop is poor, they
spend the winter here in Ottawa complaining about it.
Now, people in this large province of Ontario say, "We pay
the whole shot; we pay for everything. We pay the equalization
payments, and the Maritimes get money from Ontario and
British Columbia." Well, we may say to Ontario, "If you did
not have the federal government with its tariff policy protecting your products against American competition, half your
industries would disappear tomorrow. Your industries exist
because there is this protection. Westerners and easterners
have to buy your products because they don't have any choice,
and they must pay more because these products are protected
against American imports."
The maritimes, of course, need the rest of Canada, as does
Quebec. The province of Newfoundland cannot do anything it
wants, not because Newfoundlanders are not good people but
because the problems in that province are so different. Newfoundland is far away from the markets, climatic conditions
are difficult, and so it is a very difficult province. This applies
also to New Brunswick. The point is that in this country we all
need each other. It is not true that no one gives anything to
anyone. When we talk of equalization payments and regional
development, we are not talking about making gifts to anyone.
We are not taking money from anyone; we are just equalizing
income a little, sharing Canada's opportunities. If this were
not done it would mean that some parts of the country could
not survive. Ontario could not live without decent markets.
Well, I have nothing against Ontario.
We have other problems such as our linguistic problem. The
problem of Quebec is a real problem. It is not something that
has been invented just to embarrass Canada. You know,
nations are not theories; they are facts. I was born in Champlain near Trois-Rivières and I speak French, but that does not
mean that I speak French much more fluently than I speak
English.

SENATE DEBATES
We have this community of Quebec with its territories, its
resources and its government, and, of course, it creates a
problem. But at the same time it is a wealth for the whole of
Canada. In my opinion we can modify many things in Canada
to accommodate Quebec, and to accommodate British
Columbia. Provinces today are not the same provinces they
were 25 years ago. Things are entirely different. I firmly
believe that we need a strong central government, but it does
not have to control everything. It has to control in order to
maintain the economy and protect our standard of living. It
must do this, but many things can be administered by the
provinces.
Do you wish to have an idea of how different things are? In
1946 Quebec's budget was $350 million. Today it is $11
billion. They say they lost power. I do not know where.
However, it is just an attitude of change. Even taking inflation
into account, you will see that the provinces are much more
powerful than they were. There was a time when Alberta was
a have-not province, and boy, oh boy, they were so close to
Ottawa that sometimes we were confused. However, it is now a
rich province and it says it can manage its business alone. If
tomorrow oil is found in Nova Scotia and it becomes a rich
province, will it take the same attitude? We must understand
all this and get together. We can play politics; this is part of
the game. We do not all have to share the same ideology or the
same opinions, but when national unity is at stake I believe
that we should put aside partisan attitudes to protect and save
Canada.
I believe that Canada is more important than the Liberal
party; it is more important than any party. This is what we
must understand. That does not mean that because we are in
danger all the others should disappear, but I do not think that
we should play politics with anything and everything. In
Quebec, unfortunately, this has happened too often. What did
happen, and is happening, is that in the rest of Canada they
really do not understand in depth what is going on in Quebec.
The next speech I am to make will not be in the Senate, but
in Toronto or Burlington, and I intend to deal with this

February 15, 1977

subject. I believe that English Canada will have to understand
what I am saying; if it does not understand it, it is just too
bad. I tell you that life is impossible for us here. That is all. I
have been in Ottawa with a broad mind-as broad a mind as
could be-and I tell you that I have suffered frustrations on
many occasions. However, I believe that that is the price we
must pay to have a country, but you must understand that we
suffer those frustrations.
I thank you very much, honourable senators, for listening to
me. I wanted to make these few remarks at the commencement of my career in the Senate. I hope those who heard them
and those who read them will not react as racists, but as
Canadians. Being Canadians, we have to accept that there are
five million people in the province of Quebec whose language
and culture is French. We have to accept that the French
language can be used for purposes of air traffic control over
the province of Quebec without its resulting in accidents and
death. Having been the Minister of Transport, I know damn
well that 99.9 per cent of accidents occurred when the English
language was being used by both controllers and pilots.
» (2140)

In any event, the question of the language to be used for air
traffic control will be resolved by those studying it, but we do
not need incidents such as that which took place in the Maple
Leaf Gardens in Toronto; we do not need reactions such as
that of the gentleman in Windsor, Ontario, who said he did not
want a French language school in Windsor because he was a
bigot.
1, along with others, have been fighting in the province of
Quebec for this country. I believe in Canada, and I hope my
English confreres in this chamber and in the other place are
going to fight as much as we in the province of Quebec have in
order to keep this country together. To do so, we will have to
solve the problems I enumerated during the course of my
remarks.
On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

RADIO-CANADA
PROPOSED APPEARANCE BEFORE SENATE COMMITTEE OF
PRESIDENT OF CBC AND COMMENTATORS-QUESTION

[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I would like to ask a
question to the government leader. Since Senator Marchand in
his speech yesterday formally accused some CBC French
network employees, either interviewers or commentators, of
attempting to destroy Canadian unity-he was referring to
their comments and reports on political events in Quebec-I
wonder if it would be relevant, given the seriousness of the
question now that Canadian unity is being challenged, for the
government to have appear before the appropriate committee
of the Senate and the House of Commons--of the Senate, in
our case-the CBC president as well as people mentioned by
Senator Marchand yesterday who, according to him, were
doing everything to destroy national unity? Since we know also
that the CBC aims at preserving the unity of the country
through its programs, would it be appropriate that the Senate

have the CBC president and people mentioned yesterday
evening appear before the Senate Committee on Transport and
Communications? This would give them an opportunity to
defend themselves, besides enabling us to ascertain whether
those charges are justified and ensuring that in future the
CBC play its role which, as I said earlier, is to preserve
Canadian unity?
I repeat that I think it would be relevant and most urgent,
given the precarious situation of national unity, to allow those
people to appear before the committee so they could state their
intentions and also to ascertain that they assume their responsibility as assigned by parliamentary legislation.
[English]
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the proposal should
be given serious consideration. I suggest, however, that any
individual senator, on his own initiative, may propose a
motion. In this case, it might receive widespread support.
Certainly, however, the proposal put forth by the honourable
senator will be given serious consideration.
Senator Flynn: In view of the fact that the accusations were
made by a supporter of the government, and a former Minister
of Transport, I think these charges should be given more
serious attention than if they had been made by any other
individual member of this chamber.

•

(1410)

Senator Perrault: Every senator speaks in his own right.
There are no restrictions placed on comments made by
individual senators.
Senator Flynn: I know, but if it came from us it might be
looked at as being a bit partisan.
Senator Perrault: I want to assure honourable senators that
there will be no resistance on the part of the government to the
introduction of a resolution in this chamber to have the
President of the CBC appear before one of our committees. If
Senator Asselin wishes to make that motion, other honourable
senators in their own right will say whether they wish to
support that decision.
Senator Flynn: I think it would be appropriate if Senator
Marchand were to move that motion.
Senator Riley: You move it and the Leader of the Government will second it.
INCOME TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND--SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Cook for the second reading of Bill C-22, to
amend the statute law relating to income tax.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. George I. Smith: Honourable senators, I should say at
once that I do not rise to argue that second reading should not
be given to this bill, or that it should not go to committee. I do
in fact feel it should go to the appropriate committee, and
consequently I am in favour of second reading. That, however,
does not mean that I am in favour of everything that is in the
bill, or of omitting everything that is not dealt with in the bill.
There are some matters related to the bill which should receive
particular attention.
My first comment is that the bill obviously and clearly is
intended to implement the proposals of the budget speech of
last May. It will not have escaped your notice, I am sure, that
the budget was brought down in late May of 1976, almost nine
months ago. Here we are, three-quarters of a year later,
hastening to pass this bill before the first day of March so that
we may legalize what has been going on for all of these
months, and particularly legalize what has been advertised by
countless financial institutions throughout the country,and no
doubt acted upon by countless individuals. This relates to the
plan referred to as RRSP or Registered Retirement Savings
Plan.
That we are now in this situation, I suggest, is indeed a sad,
sad commentary on the ability of this government, this faltering government, to manage the business of Parliament. No
wonder it bas proved so feckless in carrying out is prime duty,
managing the business of this great country.
Senator Perrault: Don't become partisan now.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I should find no difficulty, as I
have said before, to stay as far away from partisanship as the
Leader of the Government does. I am sure I shall not cross any
boundary in relation to partisanship that he has not previously
crossed.
This is simply a housekeeping bill, though it is in a field of
the widest scope which in these difficult times should be
utilized to its utmost potential to improve our general economic situation as individual citizens and as a country-the field of
taxation.
In this bill, honourable senators, in these troublous times we
find no bold initiatives, no new concepts, no substantial action
even on old concepts or building upon them. It is just a
housekeeping effort, just like sweeping the floor when the
house is in danger of burning down. Surely we should have had
before us in this legislation not only the things that are there
now, the things the government feels appropriate, but at least a
substantial reduction in taxation, particularly in the taxation
of personal incomes. However, we do not.
Let me say this about taxation and the general conduct of
affairs by this government. This cannot possibly be partisan,
because I have a quotation from the product of the mind and
pen of that well-known Liberal, Mr. Asper, who will be
well-known to our friends from the west as a great supporter of
the Liberal Party. He said, as recently as November 19:
Canada is truly a country adrift; one with no discernible foreign policy, with which the public can identify; one
which rations its massive and untapped energy resources

February 16, 1977

by the strange means of overcharging, through taxation,
the people for what should be a plentiful resource; one
which cries out, on the one hand, for new business entrepreneurship, but bludgeons efforts towards it, on the other
hand, with legislative and tax disincentives, to mention
but a few facts of our national schizophrenia.
It seems to me that this eminent and highly respected
member of the party which supports the government, this
highly respected authority on taxation, has said exactly what
needs to be said to describe the present situation, the present
attitudes and the present activities of this government. No
wonder the honourable and very able senator who sponsored
this bill did not, or could not, find very much to enthuse him.
No wonder in reading his speech one gains the impression that
he really damned it with faint praise, and very faint praise
indeed.
The statistics on personal income tax are to this general
effect. For 1976 the government bas estimated a 26 per cent
increase in revenue from aggregate personal income tax; a 26
per cent increase in one year. To show just how the importance
of personal income tax has increased in the total concept of
government revenues, may I draw honourable senators' attention to this. In 1968 personal income tax represented a total of
about 34 per cent of the total revenue. In 1976, if the estimates
of the Minister of Finance are correct, it will be almost 53 per
cent, an increase of 18 per cent, half as much again, in relation
to the total revenues of the country.
* (1420)

So much for general comments. I would like to turn, only
for a very short time, to some of the specifics of the bill. The
first comment I should like to make is similar to one made last
evening by the sponsor. It is that the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce considered the subject matter of this bill last fall, before the bill itself could come
to us, and made a report which is contained in the Committee's proceedings of Wednesday, December 8, 1976. I am
constrained to say that as I read the text of the bill which is
now before us I find it difficult indeed to ascertain that any of
the well considered, thoroughly reasoned conclusions of that
committee have found their way into the context of the bill
and its provisions. That is a matter which seems to me to merit
the attention of all honourable senators, and to merit particular attention if and when, as I suppose will be the case, the bill
itself rather than just the subject matter finds its way soon to
the same committee.
I will not repeat in full the references to the report made by
the sponsor last evening, but I would like to mention a few of
them. The report on page 7:6 refers to the proposed changes in
registered retirement savings plans. After some comments
describing the plans and the existing regulations concerning
them, the report goes on to say:
Only the two options are available at maturity of a
plan: to take all funds out of the plan or to purchase a life
annuity from an insurance company.

February 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

The first alternative will subject taxpayers to immediate tax on the proceeds received. By purchasing an annuity, a taxpayer may defer the payment of tax and, in all
probability, pay tax at a lower marginal rate. By doing so,
however, he loses control over the assets which accumulated in his plan. Annuities issued by insurance companies
may provide a lower rate of return than might be available otherwise, together with eventual loss of capital.
While the committee recognizes the problems caused
by this inflexibility, it is also aware of the advantages.
The committee also recognized the relationship of this particular system to the achievement of the original intentions in the
legislation which established such plans.
Then, on the next page of the report, numbered 7:7, it is
said:
The Minister of Finance is undertaking further study of
the inflexibility that appears at maturity of a plan. An
investigation will be made to determine whether the
inflexible provisions should be changed in the interests of
the taxpayer. Your committee encourages such study.
It is my respectful submission that this would be a very
appropriate item for the committee to examine when it now
receives this bill.
The next item that I should like to mention is the child care
expense deduction. That provision, of course, is particularly
important from the point of view of working mothers and
fathers who are the heads of single parent households. There is
a good case to be made for the proposition that the deduction
does not go far enough. In any event, this particular provision,
if approved, will be of substantial assistance to those
concerned.
Clause 60 contains changes with respect to charities. The
proposed changes are said to be, and probably correctly so, an
improvement which will be of assistance to the fundamentally
proper work of charities. There are some provisions, however,
which may relate adversely to contributions from foreign
sources, or vice versa, and perhaps that is an area which the
committee might look at.
The increase in the small business deduction is worthy of
approval, and I have no hesitation in commending it to the
favourable consideration of the house.
The proposed changes with respect to Canadian exploration
expenses seem to me to be a step in the right direction. I
cannot help recalling that approximately a year ago Parliament passed into law legislation which was, in my opinion, a
direct and substantial disencouragement to Canadian exploration, and many of us argued against it at the time. If clause
24(1) of the bill represents a change of heart on the part of the
government or the Department of Finance, it is welcome. I feel
certain we would be in a much more satisfactory position
today with respect to the amount and vigour of exploration
had we not had placed before us and the country the disincentives to exploration which we have seen over the past few
years.

Certain clauses of the bill will have a retroactive effect,
some of which will be helpful to the taxpayer. I have no
objection to legislation having a retroactive effect if it is
designed to cure a wrong from the point of view of the
taxpayer, or right an unfairness. There is the question of
whether the legislation itself in such cases should allow the
taxpayer the undoubted legal right to file an amended return
to take advantage of such retroactive changes. I understand
the position of Revenue Canada to be that it is its custom to
allow amended returns in such cases. However, it seems to me
that this is the kind of right that should be enshrined in the
legislation itself, not something which should be left to the
whim of even the best intentioned official of the Department of
National Revenue, or any other department, for that matter.
To that end, I suggest it would be appropriate for the bill
itself to be amended to make this a legal right and not one
which is dependent upon the thinking at any particular time of
any particular person.

•

(1430)

There is, however, I believe, some possibility of adverse
retroactive effect in some of the provisions of this bill, provisions intended, as I understand the explanation given on them,
to allow the department to go back into previous years and
compel taxpayers to pay taxes now which they did not have to
pay in the past and which they did not pay because it was quite
legal for them not to do so. They did not do anything wrong;
they followed the legislation as it then was. But I understand
the department now says it never intended that the legislation
should have that effect and that it ought now to be allowed to
go back to correct the error it made by use of a wording which
clearly was not effective to carry out the intention it now says
it had. It seems to me that if I am right in feeling that such a
provision does exist in this bill, then it ought to be deleted, for
surely a taxpayer should not be compelled retroactively to pay
taxes which he legally did not pay under the law as it existed
at the time he was being assessed for tax.
It seems to me that this is indeed an effect which we should
not allow. In the first place, it is wrong in itself. In the second
place, it would seem to follow a principle which we ought to
resist to the last ounce of our strength; namely, the application
of retroactive legislation which will retroactively affect in an
adverse way the citizens of this country who honestly did
something in accordance with the law as it was at the time. It
seems to me that this is a fundamentally wrong principle, if
indeed one can dignify it by the name of principle, and we
should not put ourselves in the position of accepting it.
There is just one other provision I want particularly to
mention, and that is a clause in the bill which is referred to at
the bottom of page 7:10 of the committee report and which
carries over to the next page. I am sorry, honourable senators,
I promised too soon, like many other speakers, that I had come
to the last point. I realize now that this is only the second last
point.
Senator Flynn: You do not have to apologize for that.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Smith (Colchester): There is the question of whether, when a taxpayer has been unfortunate enough to suffer
such a loss during a year that he has no tax to pay, and indeed
has suffered such a loss that, if it is properly reported, it would
follow that not only would he have no tax to pay but that he
was so far below the line that it would constitute a loss to carry
over into the following or some future year. I think the
provision in the bill which deals with this situation does not go
far enough. There is, as the report states, substantial conflicting jurisprudence as to whether a taxpayer has the right in
such cases to appeal an assessment made by the minister which
simply shows nil tax payable. That kind of assessment may be
grossly unfair. One may ask at first blush how it can possibly
be unfair to a taxpayer to have him show that he has no tax to
pay, but it may be unfair for the reason I mentioned; that is,
that a correct assessment of his tax position would not only
show nil tax payable but would show a very substantial
negative balance which might be of advantage to him in the
future.
As a result of this conflict in jurisprudence, taxpayers have
been deprived of a fundamental right under our legislation to
appeal a new assessment. We think that-I am saying "we"
because I do consult others sometimes and I try to incorporate
their views into mine, which is more than one can say for some
people whose activities we have to deal with occasionally. I
think that the legislation itself should give the right to a
taxpayer to appeal a so-called nil assessment so that, if the
facts merit it, he can receive a clear-cut decision or assessment
from the minister showing that he has in fact a negative
balance or loss and not merely "no liability to pay tax."
We think that the clause as it now stands in the bill does not
go far enough in this respect. I refer to clause 61, subclause
(1). We think that the necessary change should be made to
make it clearer that this right does indeed exist.
I come now to the last point I wish to mention, which has to
do with clause 75. This clause provides that residents of
Canada must insert their social insurance numbers on ownership certificates, which must be completed when receiving
interest or dividend payments in respect of bearer coupons or
warrants. The clause provides among other things that, if this
is not done, the bank or other paying agent should withhold 25
per cent of the total, whatever it may be, of the interest or the
dividends until the taxpayer finally comes along and produces
his social insurance number.
It seems to me that this is another field of trespass which
ought not to be acknowledged as right or to be accepted by any
legislative group.
Senator Forsey: Hear, hear.
Senator Smith (Colchester): The social insurance numbers
were not brought into being for the purpose of a use which
might be applied to any sort of human activity over which the
government has any control or any interest. They came into
being for one purpose only, and if you will read the debates of
the days in which that particular legislation was before Parliament you will find that there was then considerable apprehen-

February 16, 1977

sion that this was only the beginning of a system of allocating
numbers and putting them on computers and other machines
which would eventually be used to regulate all our activities. I
suggest that here is one instance, a most objectionable
instance, of that proliferation. And much as it might conceivably-and I cannot really think it would be very much-assist
someone in catching a culprit who had tried to evade paying
taxes upon interest or upon dividends, it seems to me that any
good which might come of this, in this aspect of things, is far
outweighed by giving legislative approval to what I consider to
be an invasion of privacy. It is an extension of the principle of
pursuing all of us and gaining information about all of us by
means of central banks of records which can be identified, as
everyone knows, and called up into being by the touch of a few
keys on some machinery. I feel that this, too, is a most
objectionable thing, objectionable as a matter of principle and
in any concept of human rights and the privacy of the
individual. In my opinion, it should not be accepted.
* (1440)

Honourable senators, I proceed now to keep my word, and
will conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning, that I
do not oppose second reading but suggest that the matters with
which I have taken up the time of honourable senators merit
very careful consideration by the Senate itself and by the
committee to which the bill will be referred if it passes second
reading.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I do not intend
to go over thebill itself because Senator Smith has dealt very
ably with its plus and minus factors. I have only one comment
to make about clause 75, with which Senator Smith dealt at
the end of his speech.
My reason for rising is that I am concerned that perhaps the
formula which we have been using, the Hayden formulawhich has us referring complicated technical bills of this
nature to committee before they actually reach us-has lost its
value.
This is not the first time that a committee of the Senate has
prepared a report and made recommendations to the government or the other place, and the report has been completely
ignored.
The idea behind our doing this is to help both the government and the House of Commons save face. We suggest
amendments which can then be proposed by the government
and accepted by the house before the bill reaches us.
Few, if any, of our recommendations are accepted in this
way by a motion of the government or by decision of a
committee of the house. What then can we hope to achieve
when a bill is before us and is dealt with by a committee of the
Senate only after it has passed the House of Commons?
We know how complicated are the procedures in the other
place for the passage of a bill. But if we cannot have our
suggestions approved using the Hayden-formula approach,
what hope have we of having our suggestions and amendments
considered when we make them in the usual manner when a

February 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

bill reaches us after passage in the other place and is referred
to our committee?
I am worried about this problem. I am not saying that all
the recommendations made by the committee should have
been accepted, but I am certain that in committee we would
want the minister to explain why she completely ignored or
disregarded them. It is important that we know where we
stand with regard to this formula of having the subject matter
of a bill referred to a Senate committee before the bill reaches
us.
If it means nothing at all, we might as well forget it. We
might then arrange to adopt another attitude, perhaps a braver
one, when, in the normal course of events, a bill reaches us
after passage through the other place.
With regard to clause 75, I share Senator Smith's views. It
seems to me that the government wants to have its share when
anyone wishes to defraud. The bill says if the person cashing
interest or dividend payments does not wish to give his social
insurance number, the bank will have to withhold 25 per cent.
If someone is prepared to accept the cash on any interest or
dividend, less 25 per cent because he does not want to give his
social insurance number-which, in my opinion, is wrong in
any event-it is probably because he bas something to hide. It
appears to me that all the government wants is to share with
that person either the fruit of a theft or some kind of fraud. It
is foolish to have this kind of penalty in such a situation. I
don't see the value in this withholding clause. A person could
give a false insurance number or a false name. All that the
governnient would do is collect from him or ber, whom they do
not know, 25 per cent. Therefore, in my opinion, the government wishes merely to share in the fruits of what could have
been a fraud or theft.
The clause is one which is likely to prove completely ineffectual, and may be even harmful. For this reason, I consider that
it cannot be approved or condoned. In my view, the government may well be making of itself in a number of cases an
accomplice to someone who wishes to defraud or commit a
theft.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, my friend, the

Leader of the Opposition, has referred to the report made by
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce on its study of the subject matter of this bill. I should
point out to him-because otherwise the information would
not come to his attention-that our report has produced some
response from the Minister of National Revenue in respect of
a particular provision of the bill.
Those who have some knowledge of income tax law know
that at times the department issues a nil assessment, which
means that the taxpayer has filed a return and has shown in
that return losses and no earnings. In such cases the department issues a nil assessment without making any calculation or

determination of the amount of the loss.
The Supreme Court of Canada, in a judgment, held that a
nil assessment was not an assessment of income and, therefore,
was not appealable. That left the taxpayer high and dry. He

could not appeal for the purpose of determining what was the
amount of the loss, and yet he might want to carry that loss
back, as legally he could do, for a period of five years and set it
off against income in those years; or he might wish to carry it
forward five years and apply it against income.
a

(1450)

The intent of the government in this particular amendment
is a very laudable one. By it they attempted to negate the
effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada.
Unfortunately, in one of the conditions in the amending section, they simply provided that the department may determine
the amount of the loss. The position that we took was that that
was not good enough, that it would put us back into the
position that presently exists and will continue to exist unless
there is some change. We suggested that the obligation should
be on the department to determine the amount of the loss.
There would then be an assessment, and an appeal would be in
order.
There bas been no indication in the House of Commons of
the acceptance of any of our proposals, but I did receive from
the Minister of National Revenue a letter dated December 23,
1976, in which she says:
I have noticed with interest the comments of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce
on the question of the determination of losses.
The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act contained in subclause 61(1) of Bill C-22 will enable the
amount of a loss to be determined where there is a
difference of opinion between the taxpayer and my
Department.
The subclause now contained in 61(1) of Bill C-22 does
not oblige the Minister to determine the amount of a
taxpayer's loss. However, understanding that the law
should not unjustly disadvantage the taxpayer, it would be
both in most taxpayers' interest and in my Department's
interest to make the determination in virtually all cases
where the taxpayer wished to have the determination
made. My Department would, therefore, almost invariably determine a loss when requested to do so by a
taxpayer.
I would therefore be prepared to make the following
statement to the Committee of the Whole when the clause
is being debatedThe reference to the committee of the whole arises from the
fact that the plan, as I understand it, was that if the income
tax bill came to us immediately before Christmas, dealing with
the bill in committee of the whole of the Senate might have
been more expeditious than referring it to the standing committee. This is the statement the minister said she was prepared to make before the committee of the whole, and I
conclude that she would also be prepared to make it before the
standing committee, to which this bill may well be referred in
the ordinary way if it receives second reading. The statement is
as follows:

SENATE DEBATES
Where my Department bas determined the amount of a
taxpayer's loss, and that amount differs from the loss
reported by the taxpayer, our official determination of the
loss will be issued when the taxpayer requests it. This will
allow the taxpayer to appeal the determination immediately in all cases where he wishes to do so. My Department will be publishing information to taxpayers to
explain how they may obtain a loss determination.
It is quite apparent, therefore, that our report has been
considered by the Department of National Revenue, which is
charged with the administration of the Income Tax Act. The
Minister of National Revenue is prepared to appear before the
committee and give this undertaking. How the committee will
deal with this is up to the committee at that time. I would not
attempt to predict what their decision might be, but such an
undertaking would reasonably assure us that until such time as
a formal amendment is made to this clause of the bill a
taxpayer, by asking for a determination of his losses, may
obtain that information at once.
The question the committee will have to decide is whether,
in the light of such an undertaking, coupled with the undertaking that an amendment will be brought forward in due
course-in the next session of Parliament, or in the next
budget-this substantially, but not fully and not legally, provides a benefit to the taxpayer. Therefore, we should not refuse
to pass the bill on second reading because of that.
I realize I have to pick my words very carefully on this
subject, because we have the master of statutory regulations in
the chamber at the present moment, and I do not want to put
myself in the position of being a horrible example by suggesting that we should not insist that absolutely legal procedures
be followed. However, I do suggest that we can effect a
compromise which will benefit the taxpayer and give him what
he wants without benefit of the law-let me put it that wayrealizing that in due course, in the light of the undertaking, the
position is that we will probably achieve what we are seeking
to achieve.
While I am on my feet I would like to mention that there is
another provision in the bill in respect of which we recommend
that a change be made. That has to do with charities.
The provisions concerning charities have been substantially
rewritten. In this regard I think the opinion of the committee
generally is that in the form in which they have been rewritten
they are fair and reasonable, and there is recognition of the
great value that the deserving public in Canada gets from
charitably minded people who make substantial donations to
charities, or who set up charitable foundations or participate in
charitable organizations.
One of these provisions has to do with the reciprocity that
bas existed as between, say, Canada and the United States,
whereby the laws in each country seemed to permit an
exchange of donations to charities which would be recognized
for taxation purposes, and would be allowed as deductions
from income that might otherwise be taxable. In this bill,
however, in the definition of a charitable foundation, some

February 16, 1977

words have been added which present, or may present, a few
problems. The provision is that the charitable organization or
foundation must be created or established in Canada, and you
can see how that may conflict with this interchange or reciprocity as between Canada and the United States in the matter
of legal provisions in both countries. I refer to the report of the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee relating to the
subject matter of this bill, and to a paragraph that is to be
found at page 215 of Hansard of December 9, 1976, which
reads as follows:
* (1500)

(4) Subparagraph 212(14)(c)(i) of the Act provides
that the Minister may exempt non-resident charities from
withholding tax provided that if such charities were resident in Canada, they would have been exempt from
Canadian income tax. In other words, they would have to
have the same attributes as tax-exempt Canadian charities to be exempt from withholding tax.
This particular paragraph, dealing with withholding tax,
does not make any reference to the definition of a charitable
foundation, which is also in this bill. The provision as to the
creation or establishment in Canada of such entities may not
be met by a non-resident charitable foundation and, therefore,
donations going out of Canada to such an organization may be
subject to withholding tax.
I think the least that we should have here is an undertaking
to amend the law. We should ascertain, first of all, what the
minister is prepared to do. We can always make an amendment. We have done it before, and it bas been effective.
If I may digress for a moment-and this is entirely unrelated to this bill-the committee bas been working on the Bankruptcy Bill which we studied perhaps a year and a half or two
years ago. It bas been subject to conferences between our
advisers, myself and the departmental officers, in order that
they might relate in appropriate language the effect of the
amendments we proposed in the new draft of the bill. I think
we suggested 140 amendments in the original bill, and to this
moment we have achieved agreement in relation to 116 of
them.
Senator Flynn: A new bill. We probably can kill the bill.
Senator Hayden: You may ask, "Why didn't you get 100
per cent agreement?" I learned many years ago that you reach
for 100 per cent, but you settle for whatever you can get, if it
is enough. It depends on the character or the nature of the
amendment. I can tell you, without disclosing any secrets, that
there are a few of the amendments that they have not bought,
but we have them segregated in our own minds as possible
concessions we might make in the bargaining process. As to
others, we have compromised on the interpretation. We have
gained much in some; not so much in others. But the net result
will be a much better bill, and it will amply support the
method we follow in studying a bill in advance of its course
through the House of Commons.
Do not underestimate our ability, and the threat of proposing an amendment, as a basis for achieving the things we want

February 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

and which we think are important in this bill at this time. To
compromise is an art, and impatience is the worst reaction if
you hope to succeed in compromise. You can be firm; you can
have strong arguments; you can yield at the proper time, and
you will be surprised at how often you make your way. I have
no reason to believe that we will not make our way and achieve
the purposes that we were aiming at when we made the report.
The report was the unanimous decision of the committee. It
belongs to all of the committee, not just the chairman.
I expect we shall have the Minister of National Revenue
appearing before the committee. I may alert her in advance as
to what the procedures are and the course of action that may
be taken, but it will also indicate that up until this moment,
and even while the committee is sitting, we still have the power
of veto.
Senator Flynn: May I ask a question of the honourable
senator? It has nothing to do with legislation by undertaking,
because I do not want to arouse Senator Forsey, either. Nor is
it my intention to compliment Senator Hayden for having
risen to the occasion I offered him to defend his formula. It is
a technical question.
Since the minister bas sent Senator Hayden, as chairman of
the committee, the letter of December 22, saying that she is
prepared to make an amendment, and since the bill was
studied in committee of the whole some time towards the end
of January, or even since then, why was it not possible for the
amendment to be proposed in the committee of the whole of
the other place?
Senator Hayden: All I can say to my friend is that I cannot
put myself within the thinking processes of the people in the
other place-nor, with regard to some of them, would I want
to. We have to wait until the bill comes here in order to do
anything more, because the work of the committee was completed when it made this report. We had obeyed our instruction from the Senate. The next date we have with this bill will
be as, when and if it is referred to committee.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, I would like
to endorse very strongly what the honourable Senator Smith
(Colchester) and the Leader of the Opposition have said about
clause 75. I think it is a most improper clause to have in a bill
of this sort. I think it is an attempt to use the social insurance
numbers for a purpose which was not contemplated when they
were first introduced, and I think it could set a very bad
precedent indeed. It could lead to a situation where these
things would be used for all sorts of purposes never contemplated by Parliament when they were first introduced. I hope
very much that the committee will view with a very jaundiced
eye clause 75, and I even venture to hope that it may decide
that it ought to be eliminated.
The same question occurred to me about this other matter,
the legislation by undertaking, that occurred to Senator Flynn.
I can't imagine why on earth, in the time that has elapsed
since the minister's letter, the amendment was not proposed in
the other house. Is it something so frightfully technically
complicated that it must undergo a process of incubation

lasting for months before it can be hatched? I should have
thought it a matter well within the competence of the skilled
personnel in the department to produce an amendment of this
sort within fairly short order. This may be merely the naive
and ignorant reaction of a non-lawyer. I am fortified, however,
that apparently the same idea occurred to that eminent legal
practitioner, the Leader of the Opposition.

e

(1510)

I hope very much that the committee which examines this
bill will take both these matters into consideration and try to
get the government to drop clause 75, and to make the
amendment which the minister apparently is prepared to make
at some unknown date in the future. I even hope it may be
possible for the committee to report to the Senate that clause
75 should be struck out.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
CONSIDERATION OF SECOND REPORT OF STANDING JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, February 8, the debate
on the consideration of the second report of the Standing Joint
Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on Regulations and other Statutory Instruments.
Hon. John Morrow Godfrey: Honourable senators, when I
was listening to Senator Forsey's speech last week and he
expressed the hope that the members of the legal profession in
the Senate would give us the benefit of their views, I could not
help but think that he may have unwittingly discouraged us
from doing so, because his brilliant and entertaining performance last week is certainly a hard act to follow-as is, of
course, the maiden speech of Senator Marchand last night on
another subject.
Having been an active member of the committee that prepared the report I certainly felt that I should make some
contribution to the debate. In trying to think of what more can
be said, after re-reading Senator Forsey's speech it occurred to
me that, because he is such an expert on this subject and has
devoted so much time to the work of the committee, he might
have taken a bit too much for granted as to the knowledge that
members of this house and the public might have of the
background of the Statutory Instruments Act-the basic purpose of the act and the provisions of the act for the appointment of the joint committee.

SENATE DEBATES
As Senator Forsey pointed out, there is a lot of hard work to
do in reading the material before each committee meeting, as
well as in attending the meetings themselves, so perhaps we
who are members of the joint committee may be forgiven if we
are inclined to think that the main purpose of the act was to
have all regulations and other statutory instruments reviewed
and scrutinized by our committee. Not at all. One of the main
purposes of this act, as opposed to the old Regulations Act
which it replaced, was to provide for the examination of a
proposed regulation, before it is actually enacted, by the Clerk
of the Privy Council in consultation with the Deputy Minister
of Justice to ensure that:
(a) it is authorized by the statute pursuant to which it is
to be made;
(b) it does not constitute an unusual or unexpected use of
the authority pursuant to which it is to be made;
(c) it does not trespass unduly on existing rights and
freedoms and is not, in any case, inconsistent with the
purposes and provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights;
and
(d) the form and draftsmanship of the proposed regulation are in accordance with established standards.
The act further provides that after such examination:
-the Clerk of the Privy Council shall advise the regulation-making authority that the proposed regulation has
been so examined and shall indicate any matter referred
to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of that subsection to
which, in the opinion of the Deputy Minister of Justice,
based on such examination, the attention of the regulation-making authority should be drawn.
The old Regulations Act merely provided for the recording,
publication and laying before Parliament of regulations after
they are made. Presumably, the theory was that because
regulations, with some exceptions, had to be laid before Parliament fifteen days after they were published, some conscientious member of Parliament who had examined the regulation
in detail could draw the attention of Parliament to any defect.
In practice that was a very ineffective way of dealing with the
problem of defective regulations.
The provisions in the Statutory Instruments Act for the
examination of proposed regulations by the Privy Council
Office and the Department of Justice before they are enacted
was a big step forward, and I would venture to say it did result
in a great improvement in the drafting of regulations, and did
act as some curb on departments or bodies who were proposing
regulations to the regulation-making authority. Before the
passage of the Statutory Instruments Act, each department
would draft its own regulation for enactment, say by order in
council, and the standard of drafting and the care taken to
ensure that the proposed regulation was intra vires could vary
widely between departments.
Like the old Regulations Act, the present act provides for
the registation and publication in the Canada Gazette of
regulations, with certain exceptions. The act does not provide
for the laying of regulations before Parliament, but does

February 16, 1977

provide for the notification of a new regulation to members of
the Senate and House of Commons by delivery to each
member of a copy of the Canada Gazette in which the
regulation is published. I do not suppose that senators generally read the Canada Gazette any more than I do. What is far
more important is that it provides for the reviewing and
scrutinizing of each statutory instrument by a parliamentary
committee.
At this point I think it is appropriate to point out another
difference between the old and present acts. The old act dealt
with and defined "regulations" only. The present act provides
for a new, broad, general breed of subordinate legislation
called "statutory instruments", of which regulations are only a
part. Under the present act-and I am only generalizing-it is
only regulations, which are usually examined prior to enactment by the Privy Council Office and the Department of
Justice, which are registered in the Privy Council Office and
published in the Canada Gazette. The balance of statutory
instruments-and here again I am generalizing-do not usually have to be examined, registered or published, and yet the act
provides that all statutory instruments are to be reviewed and
scrutinized by the committee. This, as is pointed out in the
report, results in almost insuperable difficulties as far as the
committee is concerned with respect to statutory instruments
which are not regulations.
How do we find out whether such statutory instruments
actually exist? If we do hear about one-as we did, for
example, in the Manual of Guidelinesfor Immigration Officers-how do we force the department to produce it for scrutiny by the committee when the department refuses to produce
it on the grounds that, in their opinion, it is not a statutory
instrument? The simple answer is that there is no way, and, as
the report and Senator Forsey pointed out, the act should
provide some mechanism by which someone other than the
department concerned should determine whether or not it is a
statutory instrument and, therefore, subject to scrutiny by the
committee.
The committee in its report talks a great deal about "the
enabling statute," and I think it would be appropriate at this
point to refer to the enabling section of the Statutory Instruments Act which authorizes the setting up of the joint parliamentary committee. Section 26 simply states that every statutory instrument issued after the coming into force of the act,
with certain exceptions, shall stand permanently referred to
the committee established "for the purpose of reviewing and
scrutinizing statutory instruments", and that is all.
* (1520)

That section is not very clear in its meaning. Nothing is said
as to the purpose of the review and scrutiny by the parliamentary committee, and what action the committee is to take. It
certainly could be argued that the main purpose of the committee under that section was to sec whether the Department
of Justice and Privy Council Office were doing their job and
drawing the attention of the regulation-making authority to
any of the four criteria contained in the act, which I have
already quoted and which the proposed regulation might

February 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

offend. Furthermore-and this would probably be even more
important-was the regulation-making authority paying any
attention to what the Department of Justice and the Privy
Council Office was telling it with respect to regulations? Were
other types of statutory instruments which were not examined
by the Justice Department and the Privy Council Office
conforming with the criteria laid down in the act? It was
certainly not clear whether the committee had the power to see
whether the registration and publication provisions of the act
had been complied with.
The committee decided that the only way they themselves
could avoid being accused of doing something that was ultra
vires was to draw up a list of criteria which could then be
adopted and approved by Parliament as part of the committee's terms of reference. The four criteria set out in the act
were expanded to 14, with the result that after these were
adopted by the Senate and House of Commons and included in
the terms of reference the joint committee had vastly extended
powers over what was probably originally intended to be
granted to it under the rather mealy-mouthed wording of
section 26.
I may say that our joint chairmen, Senator Forsey and Mr.
Robert McCleave, M.P., deserve the lion's share of the credit
with respect to ensuring that the committee did have proper
terms of reference, with comprehensive criteria that they could
apply to the regulations and any other statutory instrument
coming to their attention. As Senator Forsey has pointed out,
the committee is not just concerned with whether regulations
are intra vires or not, but also whether they comply with the
other 13 criteria referred to in the report.
I would like to emphasize what was pointed out by Senator
Forsey, and at great length by Appendix I of the report,
namely-and I quote Senator Forsey-"the extraordinary
obscurity" of the definition of a statutory instrument contained in the act. I have scratched my head over it, and while I
do not want to appear unduly immodest I really do not think it
is my fault that I cannot be sure what it means. The legal
opinion of the committee as to what it probably means, as set
out in Appendix 1, is about as close as anyone can come to it
and, in my opinion, is certainly much more preferable than the
legal opinion adopted by the Privy Council Office. I do not
want to appear to be competing linguistically with Senator
Forsey, but I really believe that the drafting of section
2(1)(d)(i) defining a statutory instrument can be properly
described as execrable-and this in a statute which attempts
to ensure that the "form and draftsmanship of the proposed
regulation are in accordance with established standards". Certainly the drafting of the statute itself is not in conformity with
"established standards".
I agree most emphatically with Senator Forsey and the
report when they say that there is no solution to the problem
except a redrafting of the definition section. About the only
thing that is clear is that if there is a provision for a penalty,
fine or imprisonment for its contravention then it is a regula-

tion, although, of course, it can be a regulation also if it is
made in the exercise of a "legislative power" conferred by or
under an act of Parliament.
Many of the matters which are discussed in the report, and
which were mentioned by Senator Forsey, may sound like
nit-picking-and to a certain extent they are. Taken by itself,
it is difficult to get too excited about Jacques Leblanc because
be, as an individual and not as a member of a certain class or
category, received a modicum of mercy by being exempted
from certain provisions of the Parole Act by means of a
dispensing power, originally made unlawful by the Bill of
Rights of 1689, rather than by the exercise of the royal
prerogative of mercy. Justice was done for Jacques Leblanc,
and the only criticism is that it was done by a wrong procedure
when a proper procedure was available on the recommendation
of the same body, namely, the Governor in Council.
Still, it is important in the long run that we insist on a strict
observance-of the law, because if we do not then there may be
an abuse in the future of a serious nature which would not
simply be a case of doing something quite reasonable by an
unlawful procedure when a perfectly lawful procedure is available. If we make sure that the authorities follow the proper
procedures at all times, even when the merits of the case
justify relief, then we go a long way to making sure that no one
in government will attempt to use an unlawful dispensing
power in cases where the merits do not justify the use of any
procedure.
The Statutory Instruments Act was preceded by the report
of the Special Committee of the House of Commons on
Statutory Instruments, which was chaired by Mr. Mark MacGuigan, M.P., and has come to be known as the MacGuigan
Committee. This committee recommended only one class of
documents, namely, "regulations", and would not make the
distinction between statutory instruments and regulations contained in the present act. It would have subjected all such
documents to scrutiny before enactment, and registration and
publication thereafter. The joint committee, in its report which
we are presently considering, broadly favours the same course.
The minister responsible for the Statutory Instruments Act
decided to ignore the recommendation of the MacGuigan
Committee and establish two classes of instruments. In a
matter such as this, which is completely non-partisan, highly
technical and goes to the root of our parliamentary system, I
would suggest that, unless there are compelling reasons to the
contrary, a minister and the government would be better
advised to follow the recommendations of a parliamentary
committee. If be had done so in the present instance, we would
not be in such a muddle about the definition of a statutory
instrument, or face some of the other difficulties to which I
have referred. I trust that the present minister does not make
the same mistake and ignore the recommendations contained
in the report of the joint committee now before this house.
On motion of Senator Lang, debate adjourned.

ARREST OF SOVIET DISSIDENTS-MOTION TO CONVEY MESSAGE
OF CONCERN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOVIET UNION

Hon. Paul Yuzyk: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(h), I move, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Forsey and hopefully with the
unanimous consent of the SenateSenator Fournier (de Lanaudière): Senator Forsey is not
here.
Senator Bourget: It is all right. Carry on.
Senator Yuzyk: -the following resolution:
That the Government of Canada convey to the Government of the Soviet Union the profound concern of the
members of the Canadian Senate about the recent arrest
of Mykola Rudenko, Oleksiy Tykhy, Alexander Ginzberg
and Yuri Orlov and ask for their immediate release, and
urge the U.S.S.R. to honour the commitments it made
when it signed the Helsinki Agreement which guarantees
fundamental human rights to all citizens.
The Hon. the Speaker: Who is your seconder, Senator
Yuzyk? Senator Forsey is not here.
Senator Ewasew: I will second the motion.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by
the Honourable Senator Yuzyk, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Ewasew, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding
Rule 45(l)(h):
That the Government of Canada convey to the Government of the Soviet Union the profound concern of the
members of the Canadian Senate about the recent arrest
of Mykola Rudenko, Oleksiy Tykhy, Alexander Ginzberg
and Yuri Orlov and ask for their immediate release, and
urge the U.S.S.R. to honour the commitments it made
when it signed the Helsinki Agreement which guarantees
fundamental human rights to all citizens.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Senator Yuzyk: Honourable senators, I should like to call
the attention of the Senate to a very important and urgent
matter raised in the other chamber and which received unanimous approval.
Alarming reports in the press reveal that the Soviet Union is
increasingly violating the Final Act of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe known as the Helsinki
Declaration, Agreement or Accord, which was signed by the
Soviet government as well as 34 other countries including
Canada in August 1975.
More and more Soviet citizens are being arrested and
sentenced to long prison terns for criticizing their government
for not living up to the commitments made in the Helsinki
Agreement and for violating fundamental human rights.
Last November a Helsinki monitoring group was established
in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine in the Soviet Union. Last week,
the chairman of the group, Mykola Rudenko, and the secretary, Oleksiy Tykhy, were arrested and imprisoned, and the
other members have been threatened by the KGB police.
* (1410)

Alexander Ginzberg, who has been defending Alexandr
Solzhenitsyn and giving aid to political prisoners and their
families, as well as Yuri Orlov, a prominent dissident, were
also arrested and put into prison recently. Members of the
Human Rights Committee in Moscow, whose chairman is the
renowned scientist, Andrei Sakharov, and members of the
Amnesty International group, whose chairman is Valentyn
Turchin, who succeeded the now imprisoned Andrei Tverdokhlebov, are being constantly harrassed.

February 17, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

This has been of great concern to Canadian citizens whose
compatriots live on the other side of the Iron Curtain, in
countries under the domination of the Soviet regime. Many
petitions and telegrams from the organizations of the Canadian Ukrainians, Jews, Bylorussians, Estonians, Lithuanians,
Latvians and others have been sent to the Canadian government asking it to protest the flagrant violations of human
rights in the U.S.S.R.
Canada, as a signatory of the Helsinki Agreement, has been
strongly upholding the implementation of Basket Three, which
it is now being monitored through NATO in preparation for
the review conference to be held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, some
time this year. We can no longer remain indifferent to the
Soviet violations of the Helsinki Agreement and human rights.
It is not interference in the internal affairs of another country
to protest and condemn such violations, especially if such
country is a signatory of the Helsinki Agreement.
Consequently, I am raising this grave matter at this time
and requesting the Senate to approve this resolution, which has
the support of the Honourable Leader of the Government and
the Honourable Leader of the Opposition.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(g), I move that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Tuesday
next, February 22, 1977, at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Honourable senators, before the question is put, I should
like to give the usual short summary of the business of the
Senate for the coming week.
Two committee meetings are scheduled for 2 p.m. on Tuesday. The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs will meet to
continue its study on Canada-United States relations, and the

Standing Committee on Agriculture will meet to continue its
inquiry into the Canadian beef industry.
On Wednesday the Standing Committee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce will meet at 9.30 a.m. The committee will deal
first with Bill C-22, an act to amend the statute law relating to
income tax, and then continue with its examination of the
subject matter of Bill C-16. The Canadian Bankers Association will be appearing on Bill C-16.
At 3.30, or when the Senate rises, the Standing Committee
on Agriculture will meet again to hear witnesses with respect
to the beef industry. There will also be a meeting, of the
Special Senate Committee on Science Policy.
On Thursday at 9.30 a.m. the Standing Committee on
Foreign Affairs will again meet to discuss Canada-United
States relations. Also at this time the Standing Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce has scheduled another meeting
on the subject matter of Bill C-16, when they will hear
witnesses from several associations of advertisers. At 11 a.m.
there will be an in camera meeting of the Standing Committee
on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration.
It is expected that Bill C-2, an act to facilitate the making of
advance payments for crops, will pass the House of Commons
before we return on Tuesday. So we will have this bill to deal
with as well as the metric conversion bill.
In addition, the Senate will continue its consideration of the
second report of the Joint Committee on Regulations and
other Statutory Instruments, and on Senator Cook's inquiry
calling the attention of the Senate to matters of interest
concerning Labrador.
Motion agreed to.
TRANSPORTATION
EFFECT ON DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CANADA-MOTION TO
REFER SUBJECT MATTER TO TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE WITHDRAWN-DEBATE ON
INQUIRY CONCLUDED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Bonnell, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Norrie, that the subject matter of the inquiry of the
Honourable Senator Bonnell calling the attention of the
Senate to transportation in Canada, whether by land, by
air or by sea, especially as it affects the different regions
of Canada, be referred to the Standing Senate Committee
Senaon Transport and Communications.-(Honourable
tor Petten).
Senator Petten: Honourable senators, I yield to Senator
Bonnell.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell: Honourable senators, I ask leave to
continue this debate.

SENATE DEBATES
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Bonnell: Thank you, honourable senators. As you
all know, I have already spoken on this motion, and in order to
speak twice I need your consent, which you have graciously
given me. I shall try not to tire you, but to bring you some
enlightenment, this afternoon.
On December 8, 1976, I called the attention of the Senate to
transportation in Canada, whether by land, by air or by sea,
especially as it affects the different regions of Canada.
Since that time many senators have participated in the
debate and some very worthwhile discussion has taken place.
But, perhaps more importantly, the Department of Transport
of Canada must have taken heed of my remarks, because by
December 10, 1976, eight days later, the Toronto Globe and
Mail reported that Premier Frank Moores of Newfoundland
stated that the Government of Canada and the Government of
Newfoundland had agreed that a commission should be
appointed to study transport problems in Newfoundland. It
was further stated in that press release that the federal government had also agreed that existing services should not be
allowed to deteriorate while the inquiry is under way.
* (1420)

The commission will study land, sea and air transport needs
in Newfoundland and Labrador. According to this press
release, you would almost think that the minister and the
premier had taken my inquiry and changed the words "in
Canada" to "in Newfoundland and Labrador." But whatever
their reason for agreeing to this inquiry, the important fact is
that something is being done to improve transportation in
Newfoundland with the cooperation of both governments.
Next in the sequence of events which took place following
my inquiry of December 8 was the fact that the minister, the
Honourable Otto Lang, brought before Parliament Bill C-33,
which received first reading on January 27, 1977. Bill C-33 is
an act to amend the National Transportation Act and the
Department of Transport Act for the purpose of defining the
objective of the transportation policy for Canada, and authorizing the consequential rearrangement of powers and duties
relating to transport, and to amend the Transport Act and the
Railway Act in respect of freight rates and other matters. The
bill would add a new section, stating:
It is hereby declared that the objective of the transportation policy for Canada is to achieve a transportation
system that
(a) is efficient,
(b) is an effective instrument of support for the
achievement of national and regional social and economic objectives, and
(c) provides accessibility and equity of treatment for
users,
and it is further declared that achievement of the objective of the transportation policy for Canada requires the

February 17, 1977

integration of services employing the most appropriate
modes for each service and that it is the responsibility of
governments to attend to the provision of the transportation system.
Bill C-33, which is now before Parliament, makes many
changes in transportation in Canada as we now know it and I
believe it will be the base on which the transportation policies
of Canada can be upgraded, improved and modernized and
can be made more efficient, more economical and more satisfactory to the people of Canada. I want to congratulate the
minister on his quick action in bringing forward this new
legislation which can be the beginning of a new transportation
policy for Canada.
On February 7, 1977, the Minister of Transport for Canada,
the Honourable Otto Lang, while meeting in Charlottetown
with the Premier of Nova Scotia, the Honourable Gerald
Regan, the Premier of New Brunswick, the Honourable Richard Hatfield, the Premier of Prince Edward Island, the Honourable Alex Campbell, and Mr. James Morgan, the Minister
of Transportation and Communications for the province of
Newfoundland, discussed a number of transportation issues of
both national and regional concern. The representatives of the
four provinces and the Minister of Transport agreed that
regional development should take precedence over commercial
viability in transportation systems.
The headlines in the local newspaper the next morning,
February 8, 1977, stated: "Lang Backs Down on User Pay
Idea." This, honourable senators, was the main thrust of my
motion, and the policy that stirred me to bring it before the
Senate in the first place. It was the straw that was breaking
the camel's back and when I read the local Charlottetown
Guardianon February 8, and read the comments that the user
pay transportation policy is a thing of the past, I then felt that
my inquiry was an effort worth while, not only for Atlantic
Canada but for all of Canada.
During the meeting with the premiers of the maritime
provinces on February 6, Mr. Lang stated that the federal
government was committed to regional economic development.
To this end he emphasized that the objectives of a transportation system should be to serve as an effective instrument of
support for the achievement of national and regional social and
economic objectives, as well as to achieve throughout Canada
an efficient transportation system. Mr. Lang, the maritime
premiers and Mr. Morgan agreed that such a system should
also provide for accessibility and equity of the treatment of
users. Mr. Lang and the premiers agreed in principle to a
selective approach to freight rate assistance within the region,
which would be intended to make the existence of the Maritime Freight Rates Act and Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act more responsive to regional economic development
needs.
Joint agreement was also reached on the desirability of
improving passenger transportation in Atlantic Canada. Mr.
Lang, the maritime premiers and Mr. Morgan agreed in
principle that improved passenger transportation could best be
achieved by providing special assistance for upgrading bus and

February 17, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Another of my concerns regarding Atlantic Canada is to
make sure that we have sufficient reefer cars for the shipment
of perishable goods, such as potatoes, to the markets of central
Canada. On February 10, 1977, the Minister of Transport, in
reply to a question, stated that the facilities for the handling of
potatoes was discussed, particularly in private meetings, with
representatives of the Province of Prince Edward Island, who
had figures on shortages which exist at this time.
He also said earlier that one of the questions which still
remained to be resolved before steps could be taken to correct
the situation was as to the kind of equipment which should be
provided for the hauling of potatoes in the future. The minister
stated that he agreed with the representatives of Prince
Edward Island that we had to be very conscious of the
timetable in looking at questions concerning facilities and
equipment.
Further, the Canadian National Railways has advised that
they have leased 1,000 reefer cars for a period of three years.
It is the position of Canadian National Railways that 1,000 to
1,200 such cars, given conditions similar to the 1976 monthly
patterns, should closely match the normal demand for the

air services in the region. It was further agreed that any
savings that could be acquired by providing special assistance
for upgrading passenger transportation service would be
invested in a priority highway link in the region.
It was anticipated by the minister and the premiers that
these measures, which clearly reflect the federal government's
recognition of the importance of transportation to the region,
will provide improved transportation services in the Atlantic
provinces, ensure that transportation investments are more
responsive to regional economic development needs, permit
scarce financial resources to be spent in a more efficient
manner consistent with development needs and the opportunities of the region, and eliminate the expenditure of funds in
areas where little benefit accrues. The minister and the maritime premiers agreed that current transportation services and
subsidies would be reconstructed to ensure that they most
efficiently meet the current and future regional economic and
transportation needs, and additional funds would be provided
by the federal government for selective improvements and
investments in the transportation system.

JOINT MEETING OF UNITED STATES CONGRESS
ADDRESS BY PRIME MINISTER

Senator Fournier (de Lanaudière): Honourable senators,
with leave, I should like to call the attention of the Senate to a
certain matter.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Fournier (de Lanaudière): Considering the fact that
it is the first time in the history of the United States and
Canada that the Prime Minister of our country has been called
upon to deliver a speech before a joint meeting of Congress in
Washington, and considering the high quality of his remarks, I
would request-and t hope to be supported by the Honourable
Senator Grosart-that the Prime Minister's address be printed
as an appendix to the Debates of the Senate.

e

(2010)

Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, in view of the importance of the occasion and, as the honourable senator has put it,
it is the first time in the history of the Congress of the United
States that a Prime Minister of Canada has addressed Congress, I would be prepared to support Senator Fournier's
suggestion, in spite of my objections at an earlier time to the
unnecessary proliferation of the documentation of our proceedings here.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For text of the Prime Minister's speech, see appendix to
today's Hansard.)
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I am sure that ail
those present have been impressed by the generosity of spirit
which moved Senator Fournier (de Lanaudière), supported by
Senator Grosart, to make the suggestion which has just been
approved by ail honourable senators. We may have our partisan differences from time to time in Parliament, but all federal
political parties in this nation are concerned about the preservation of Canadian unity, and no one party exceeds any other
in its zeal to promote that unity. This has been demonstrated
this evening in the Senate.

CANADA-UNITED STATES RELATIONS
DIVERSION OF WATER FROM LAKE MICHIGAN-QUESTION

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators will recall that I
gave a commitment on behalf of the government that the
matter of diversion of water from the lower Great Lakes to the
Chicago area would be proposed as a possible subject for
discussion between the Prime Minister of Canada and the
President of the United States during the current meetings
which are under way in Washington. This day I received
further information on this matter from the office of the
Secretary of State for External Affairs. This communication
reads as follows:
You will recall that you informed your Senate colleagues on February 3 that, as a result of a request by the
Government of Canada, Canadian officiais would be
given a full briefing on the state of planning for the
implementation of the proposed demonstration project to
study the effects of increased diversions at Chicago. This
briefing was presented by representatives of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Illinois, and the
Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago at a
recent Canada-United States meeting in Washington on
Great Lakes levels. U.S. planning activities are, of course,
only at the initial stages but our officiais received firm
assurances that we would be kept fully informed on a
regular ongoing basis of ail activities related to the proposed project. The briefing provided us with a valuable
opportunity to impress on those directly concerned with
the project Canada's strong and continuing opposition to
any unilateral increase in diversions from Lake Michigan.
Canadian officiais were also able to point out the inevitability of substantial losses in Canada to hydro-electric
development entities and navigational interests should the
diversion be increased. It was stressed that Canada would
expect full compensation for these losses.
At this same meeting, it was agreed to present the
International Joint Commission with a Reference to study
the effects of diversions and consumptive use of water in
the Great Lakes Basin. At our initiative, this Reference
specifically instructs the Commission to examine into and
report to Governments upon the effects of the proposed
Chicago Diversion demonstration project.
Honourable senators, this letter is signed by the Honourable
the Secretary of State for External Affairs. It continues:
In the circumstances I think you will agree that it
would not be essential to request the Prime Minister to
raise this problem with President Carter at the present
time.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I wonder
if I could ask the Leader of the Government what measures
the Government of Canada is taking to make a study. of the
probable effects from Canada's point of view, rather than
relying upon the International Joint Commission or the United
States Army Corps of Engineers?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I believe, together
with the honourable senator, that this is a most important
question. I would like to take the question as notice and
provide that information at the earliest time possible. It is an
extremely important question as far as our nation is concerned.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Thank you.
GARRISON DAM-PROPOSED DIVERSION OF WATER-QUESTION

Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, with respect to
another proposed diversion-I am referring to the Garrison
Dam-I wonder if the Leader of the Government intends to
place before this chamber some information that we understand has been sent to a private citizen in Manitoba concerning government policy and intention in whatever initiative it
may be taking? If the Leader of the Government is not aware
of the communication to which I refer, I shall be glad to be
more specific.
Senator Perrault: I would appreciate hearing any information the honourable senator is able to impart to the chamber.
Senator Grosart: I gather from the press, and'from reports
in another place, that a letter indicating a government initiative in the matter was disclosed primarily-perhaps, only in a
letter-to the person who has been described as the Liberal
leader in the Legislature of Manitoba.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I must take that
question as notice. At the same time, I would say that the
matter of the Garrison Dam and the proposed diversion of
water is a matter of great concern to Canadians of all political
persuasions. This certainly was one of the concerns which
prompted the Prime Minister's visit to Washington. Most
Canadians, I believe, welcomed the announcement that construction on the Garrison Dam is to be halted, at least,
temporarily. Undoubtedly the matter of the Garrison Dam is
the subject of conversations between the President of the
United States and the Prime Minister of Canada, and I wish
to assure the honourable senator that I shall endeavour to
obtain as much information as possible with respect to allegations which, apparently, have appeared in certain periodicals in
western Canada. I hope to be able to report to the Senate later
this week.
Senator Grosart: I was really only asking that whatever
information was conveyed be given to Parliament in this
chamber and, perhaps, the other house.
Senator Perrault: The chamber is certainly entitled to any
information which may have been communicated to any political representative in the province of Manitoba. I shall
endeavour to ascertain whether, in fact, any information which
purports to relate to the Garrison project has, in fact, been
communicated.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, the question was not
addressed to me, but in order to keep the record straight it
should be pointed out that the reply from the Prime Minister
was, in fact, a reply to a communication from Mr. Huband in
Manitoba. He was simply responding to that original request.

February 22, 1977

It was not a sudden message from the Prime Minister to a
private citizen, as might be inferred from the question.
Senator Grosart: Such an inference was not my intention.
However, in view of the assurance we have received from a
distinguished senator who was formerly in the position of the
recipient of that particular letter, I am sure that he will agree
that not all his letters were answered as promptly.
Senator Perrault: The mails are moving much more quickly
these days.
TRANSPORTATION
PACIFIC WESTERN AIRLINES-JUDGMENT OF SUPREME COURT
OF CANADA-QUESTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I would like to ask a
question of the government leader. It concerns the decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada given today in the Pacific
Western Airlines case. I understand that the Minister of
Transport, Mr. Lang, is prepared to introduce an amendment
to the Aeronautics Act which would bar any other provinces
from taking control of regional carriers.
a (2020)

Can the government leader tell the Senate whether the
legislation in question will be made retroactive to deal with the
Government of Alberta's acquisition of Pacific Western
Airlines?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada today will inevitably
prompt consideration by the government of possible future
courses of action with respect to the acquisition by provincial
governments of regional carriers, but as yet no final position
has been established. When that position is taken by the
government, honourable senators and members of the other
place will be made aware of it.
Senator Austin: Would the government leader not igree
with me that it would hardly be equitable to allow Alberta to
control Pacific Western Airlines, and not allow Manitoba to
control Transair?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I do not wish to
comment further on the subject at this time. I have not had an
opportunity to read in full the judgment of the Supreme Court,
thus I think it would be presumptuous of me to render any
type of final personal judgment.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I assume
from the replies given by the Leader of the Government that
he is aware of the general content of the decision and, consequently, will be able to answer part of my question at least
from his personal knowledge. Is it correct to say that the
general burden of that decision is that the acquisition of the
airline by the Province of Alberta was within the law? Secondly, would he be prepared to acknowledge that retroactive
legislation in such a circumstance would be a departure from
the ordinary principles of jurisprudence?

February 22, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the government
does not regard the decision of the Supreme Court today as
either a victory or a defeat.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I did not ask that.
Senator Perrault: No, but I would say in a preliminary way,
in reply to your question, that reference to the court through
an appeal was to establish where jurisdictions lie. Surely that
is in the national interest.
Perhaps a somewhat comparable case was the referral to the
courts of the question of the ownership and control of offshore
mineral and other resources in the Atlantic provinces. Following the decisions of the courts, an agreement with respect to
ownership, control and revenue sharing was achieved, I understand, with certain Atlantic provinces-an agreement, which I
think the honourable senator may agree, has been highly
satisfactory to the Maritime provinces.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Don't presume too much.
Senator Perrault: Well, I can only state that the premier of
one well known and respected maritime province, whose government was led formerly by the distinguished Senator Smith,
has hailed the agreement as being in the interests of the people
of Nova Scotia.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Well, he had to.
Senator Perrault: I must not comment on provincial affairs
of concern to the honourable senator.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Then please don't. Just answer
the question.
Senator Perrault: But, as I have said, these two instances
may be comparable. As in the case of the referral regarding
the ownership and control of offshore resources in the Atlantic
provinces, today's Supreme Court decision, after an appeal by
a government, appears to have established the legal situation
with respect to PWA.
There is now the possibility of a policy decision following
today's ruling by the Supreme Court. However, the government is not in a position to make any announcement with
respect to that possible policy at this time.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Well, in any event, I am sure
the Leader of the Government did not mean to evade answering my question as to what was the general purport of the
decision of the Supreme Court, which obviously lies within his
knowledge.
Senator Perrault: Up to this time I have been able to obtain
only truncated news report versions of that purported decision.
Obviously, the honourable senator has read the complete
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, an opportunity
which I have not had.
Senator Smith (Colchester): This is not a question but I
think I have to assert that I had not realized, until Senator
Austin asked the question of the Leader of the Government,
that the decision had actually been rendered. All I am trying
to do now is ascertain what knowledge the Leader of the
80003-29

Government is able to impart to us with reference to that
decision.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senator, I would not presume
to interpret the implications of the decision of the Supreme
Court without having read it completely, especially in the
august presence of so many honourable senators learned in the
law.
Senator Smith (Colchester): That is a very prudent attitude.
I trust it will obtain in all other matters with which the
honourable Leader of the Government is engaged.
Senator Croll: Senator Smith ought to have quit while he
was ahead. He was right on both questions. Why go any
further?
CONFEDERATION
PROPOSED SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE MATTERS
OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO ALL CANADIANS-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, February 2, the
debate on the inquiry of Senator Cook calling the attention of
the Senate to matters of interest concerning Labrador and also
to the desirability of establishing a Special Joint Committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons to examine matters of
mutual interest to all Canadians whether they reside in
Quebec or elsewhere in Canada.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I should like
to say a few words in support of Senator Cook's observations
on his inquiry. I congratulate him on the initiative he has
taken in bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate,
and on the extremely lucid and competent manner in which he
dealt with a difficult and delicate subject but one which,
nevertheless, is of great interest to all Canadians. The very
existence of Canada as a nation is at stake. The election of a
separatist government in the province of Quebec has suddenly
brought us face to face with what heretofore most of us
regarded as unthinkable.
If this threat to our national existence were coming from
without, the majority of Canadians from one end of Canada to
the other would come together and, as we have done over the
past 200 years, would put forth a united effort to defend and
preserve our national entity.
This time, however, the threat is from within, but it is no
less real and no less dangerous. It could be even more dangerous than a threat from without, and it will demand the same
degree of dedication, and perhaps an even more difficult kind
of effort, than was required in the past.
What we must realize at the outset is that the struggle to
preserve Canada as a nation is largely ideological-ideological
in the broadest- sense, which includes the psychological aspects
as well. Those who would fracture Canada have a powerful
idea, plus a passion and a plan. Their idea is division. It is a
bad idea but, nevertheless, within its limits, is a strong, unifying and dynamic force. As for their passion, their total dedication and commitment to the ultimate victory of their idea is

SENATE DEBATES
without question. And they also have a plan and a strategy.
Their plan is to present their idea as something that is
inevitable; as an idea whose time has come; as a logical and
progressive sequence of events which is painless and in the best
interest of all concerned.
Their general strategy is to ignore the details and concentrate on the general idea, focusing attention on the broad
outline without bothering to deal with the ramifications, the
contradictions, the unpleasant and inconvenient details, and
the awkward questions about what is actually involved and
how things are going to work.
They have among them trained people who are skilled at
painting with a broad brush; at giving people a false sense of
security; at manipulating the truth; and in all this they have
substantial support of a section of the Quebec press, assisted
by Radio Canada.
That is what we federalists are up against, and it would be a
very foolish mistake to underestimate the strength and advantages of those who are dedicated to the division of our nation.
There are a thousand ways in which they can take the initiative, and we have no adequate response. There are a thousand
ways in which they can exploit opportunities to cause pinpricks
day after day, which they hope will generate frustration and
resentment to the point where the rest of Canada will say,
"The heck with it; let them go". These are the kinds of tactics
that have already been used and will be used even more. We
must understand this and learn to keep our cool, develop our
patience and devise strategies of our own.
*

(2030)

The Parti Québécois have been propagating their idea of
separatism for a number of years, and their task has been
made easier for them because those of us who oppose separatism have treated the problem as being more or less an
academic question which would fade away with the passage of
time. We have certainly not regarded it as a question that
would have to be dealt with by this generation.
Acting under this delusion, we have sought to buy time by
granting to Quebec special concessions, one by one, in a
piecemeal fashion, sometimes because most of us care for the
welfare of the people of Quebec, and sometimes in response to
an ultimatum.
In this way we have, to some extent, accustomed ourselves
to accepting the separatist idea, while at the same time the
powers of the federal government have been diminished and
dissipated to the point where Canada has become more and
more difficult to govern. We are already the most decentralized federation of its size in the worldSenator Forsey: Hear, hear.
Senator Carter: -and had the other provinces demanded
and received similar concessions, Canada today would be
nothing more than a loose collection of incohesive states, each
pursuing its own narrow selfish interest regardless of the
consequences to each other or to the world at large.
The idea of separatism is not confined to Quebec. It exists in
other provinces, particularly in the west, and also within

February 22, 1977

provinces. Northern Ontario feels it would be better off if it
could become a separate province, and this feeling is also
prevalent in Labrador. In my own province there is a growing
disenchantment with the federal system for reasons that have
been stated many times in this chamber and need not be
repeated now.
In 1948-49, when the question of joining Canada was before
the people of my province, they had to consider along with it
an alternative proposal of some kind of union with the United
States. This had a very strong popular appeal, economically
and emotionally, because expenditures of the U.S. government
had brought unprecedented prosperity, and the American
forces had forged extremely warm and friendly ties with our
people-ties which were greatly strengthened by the marriage
of many Newfoundland women to U.S. servicemen.
We chose Confederation by a very narrow margin, and one
of the factors that tipped the scale in its favour was our
historic loyalty and devotion to the British CrownSenator Forsey: Hear, hear!
Senator Carter: -along with our emotional attachment to
the Royal Family. We share these emotional ties with the
majority of English-speaking Canadians. When our Queen is
insulted, it is an insult to us. Such actions create disunity.
The idea of union with the United States is again being
revived, and should Quebec become an independent state it
will likely gain very strong support. Once one part of Canada
becomes unstuck, it will be much easier for the other parts to
become unstuck also.
The events of November 15 last came as a shock, particularly to English Canada. To use a favorite Newfoundland nautical expression, "We have been brought up with a round turn,"
and, personally, I think this is a good thing. It might well turn
out to be a blessing in disguise because had we continued
drifting lethargically along, as we were doing, a separated
Quebec could well have become a fait accompli before we
realized what was really happening.
Now we have been shaken out of our lethargy, and find
ourselves suddenly faced with reality. All Canadians must now
face the question: Is Canada as a national entity worth saving;
if so, what am I as an individual prepared to do about it? In
the past we have not given much thought to these questions
because we have been too engrossed in pursuing our own
narrow selfish interests. We have taken Canada more or less
for granted. Now these questions suddenly confront us and we
cannot evade them any longer.
The inquiry before us poses a further question: What should
be the role of the Senate in this matter? As I see it, there are
two kinds of jobs to be done, both of equal importance, and the
Senate should'be involved in both of themn. Furthermore, they
should be done simultaneously.
The first job as Senator Cook pointed out, is to get the facts.
As I said earlier, Mr. René Lévesque and his ministers are
painting with broad strokes, concentrating on the broad outline
of the picture and ignoring the details. They talk about some
sort of association of an independent Quebec with English

February 22, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

Canada. They refer to a common market, a monetary union
and a customs union, but always in the vaguest terms. The
task is to bring these details into focus, to get the factsinsofar as they can be obtained-as to what the effects of
separation would be and wbat is involved in the varjous
proposais they are talking about. This information must then
be made available to ail Canadians, particularly to the people
of Quebec, so that wben the referendum is held they will know
what is involved in the choices they are asked to make.
It seems to me that this job can best be done by an aIl-party
joint committee of botb bouses as it is most appropriate that
the people themselves be represented on the committee
througb their elected members. Such a committee should be
provided with the ablest staff available-people specially fitted
by training and experience for this particular kind of work,
people whose reputations are such as to command nation-w ide
respect so that their findings cannot be easily dismissed or
challenged by the separatists.
As Senator Cook pointed out in bis excellent speech on
February 2, there are a number of important matters about
wbich we must have the facts before we can really understand
what is involved for ail of us-Quebecers as well as other
Canadians-should Quebec become a separate state. This is
vital for several reasons-to clear up the confusion that
already exists; to prevent the creation of further confusion; and
also to refute the misinformation that bas already been spread
and is stili being propagated.
To give an example, about two weeks ago on TV-Ontario,
two ministers of the Quebec goverfiment appeared on Judy
LaMarsh's Sunday evening program, and the question of the
Labrador boundary was discussed. Both these ministers
claimed that Quebec had been deprived of territory at a
bearing to whicb the province bad flot been a party. Senator
Cook lias already refuted this dlaim, pointing out that Quebec
was represented at that bearing by one Mr. Aimée Geoffrion.
This is confirmed in the Encyclopedia Canadiana, volume VI,
page 35, but the falsehood continues to be spread.
a (2040)
If you study the Boundaries of Canada, 1 964, published by
the Geographical Branch of the Department of Mines and
Tecbnical Surveys, you will see that the samne principles and
interpretations were applied to the Labrador question as were
applied in determining the other boundaries of Quebec. Senator Cook bas deait witb this matter so thoroughly that notbing
more needs to be said on this subject, except that the Encyclopedia Canadiana goes on to say, "Finally in 1971 the Royal
Commission on Quebec's boundaries admitted that Quebec's
case in Labrador was not wortb pursuing." The people of
Quebec have been grossly misinformed, and the trutb needs to
be emphasized over and over again. Without the facts we will
not know what we are doing or even what we are talking
about.
Related to the boundaries question, bowever, one of the
most important problems to be settled, should Quebec become
an independent state, is the question of territory. Confederation was an agreement-a compact, really,-between Quebec
80003-29'/2

and the other provinces, and, sbould Quebec unilaterally
decide to break that agreement, it is inconceivable that Quebec
alone would decide what territory belongs to bier and wbat
belongs to the rest of Canada.
The territory administered by the Quebec government today
is practically double wbat it was wben Quebec joined with the
other provinces in 1867. At that time the northern boundaries
of both Quebec and Ontario were the southern boundary of
Rupert's land in the Nortbwest Territories, which were admitted to the Dominion of Canada as a separate entity called the
Nortbwest Territories. Quebec's boundaries have been extended several times since 1867 for purposes of administration, and
it was not until 1912 that the northern boundary of Quebec
was extended to Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, incorporating
wbat bad corne to be called the District of Ungava.
The act of secession would nullify ail these agreements,
wbich were made with the understanding that Quebec would
always remain a part of Canada. As a general principle,
therefore, it is difficult to see on wbat basis Quebec could
expect to take out of Confederation any more territory than
she brought into Confederation.
The territories beyond Quebec's bistoric boundary of 1867
bave always been bistorically a part of British North America,
and belong to al Canada. There are two valid reasons why
Canada miglit refuse to relinquish control over these territories. One is for defence purposes and the other is our obligations to the native peoples, who are a federal responsibility.
Indeed the native peoples themselves might want to have a say
in this matter. They would be perfectly justified if they did,
because they have their own language, culture and heritage,
whicb are as distinct as the attributes on the basis of which
Mr. Lévesque justifies Quebec's bccoming an independent
state.
Fact finding is a vital necessity, and there is so much to be
done that the sooner it is started the better. The separatîst idea
is not going to be disarmed by concessions, by dollars and
cents, or by other material considerations. An idea can be
cbanged only by a superior idea; consequcntly, there is another
equally important, equally vital task to be performed, and that
is the development and promotion of a counter-ideology which
bas as its central core the positive idea of national unlty. This
task, in my opinion, can best be done by a special committee of
the Senate. No contest bas ever been won by defensive action
alone. If Canada is to remain united, federalists must assume
the initiative. To do this, we must bave the facts, and this is
wbere the two commîttees complement each other.
What would the Senate committee do? As I sec it, its first
task would be to examine the brand of federalism we have
today and find out what bas gone wrong with it, and why it is
not working in the way that was envisioned. What mistakes
have been made and wbat must be donc to put them right?
Wbat are the main factors responsible for the alienation, the
lack of cooperation, the pettiness and the meanness of spirit
that bas developed among us? What is the basis of sucb unity
as does exist in Canada today, and how does it compare wjth
what the true basis sbould be?

SENATE DEBATES
A second task that must be carried out is to interpret the
different parts of Canada to each other, making Canadians
aware of each other's hopes and aspirations, and developing an
awareness and appreciation of each other's contribution to the
nation as a whole.
Canada is such a vast expanse of territory that many
Canadians find it difficult to think in terms of the whole
country and therefore tend to think of their provinces in
isolation from the rest of the nation. That has made us
parochial, and this parochial outlook and approach shows up
very well in our printed media.
The result is that when they think of Canada as a whole,
they too often visualize a picture that is often drawn by
politicians. This picture portrays Canada as a cow extending
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The animal feeds in western
Canada and is milked in central Canada, and it is not difficult
to imagine what happens in the maritimes. How can we expect
to develop national unity when we foster such concepts?
There are many positive forces in our nation, and a third
task is to mobilize them in the cause of national unity.
Already, the Quebec-Canada movement has come into existence and is spreading rapidly. It needs to be encouraged and
assisted in every way possible. But there are other positive
forces, such as the Royal Canadian Legion, Rotary International, and the National Survival Institute, to name a few.
These organizations are well established, with branches all
across Canada. They all have a stake in national unity and are
anxious to play a part in keeping Canada together. There is,
however, need of a coordinating agency to plan an integrated
strategy so that maximum benefit can be obtained from the
contribution each can make towards meeting successfully the
challenge that confronts us all.
Finally, we must get our people to understand the truc
concept of democracy. If asked to define democracy, most
people would quote Lincoln at Gettysburg and answer that
democracy is government of the people, by the people and for
the people. Actually, Lincoln himself was quoting the Reverend Theodore Parker, who stated this first in 1850, and
again in 1854, in the condensed forms that Lincoln used nine
years later.
Abraham Lincoln's actual words at Gettysburg were:
That this nation [the United States] under God, will
have a new birth of freedom, andHere the phrase "under God" is still implied.
-that government of the people, by the people, for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.

•

(2050)

It is evident that the phrase "under God" is the core of
Lincoln's entire concept of democracy. Without being pious he
made practical the one realistic hope of binding up his nation's
wounds. In the same way, it is the key to our national unity
and national survival. How can we expect to achieve unity,
truth and justice, righteousness and freedom in our ]and if we
leave the Supreme Ruler out of our plans? In both Houses of
Parliament we open each sitting with prayers, and we pray

February 22, 1977

"Thy will be donc." If these are empty words, we should not
say them. If we mean them, we should apply them.
Both separatists and federalists share many common objectives as Canadians and as members of the human race. It is
where one party, one individual or group is determined to
impose his or their will and plans on another, no matter what,
that traumatic division is inevitable. A wise and politically
astute man has said:
The petty plans of men like me
Rob my country of its destiny.
This is what each of us, from the Prime Minister down, is
facing today.
I have tried to give a brief outline of the vital tasks that
must be done, and how in my opinion the Senate can make the
greatest contribution to Canada.
The stunning impact of November 15 is moving Canadians
out into a period of second thoughts. Second thoughts are
second nature to this chamber. It exists to consider them.
Ideally we have been chosen as individuals because we have
long been exposed to the winds of change; to the sweeping
away of superficialities; to the quick recognition of the bedrock
on which two centuries of Canadians have created a nation.
If there is anything which should help each of us to greater
purification of motives, to the willingness to break old but
demonstrably inadequate modes of thought or conduct, it is
the simple fact of the hour that has struck for Canada-the
hour of both domestic crisis and the opportunity to give heart
to a world already burdened with the tragedies of division.
But let us not fool ourselves. There is a price to be paid. The
price of national unity and truc democracy comes high. The
question is whether we are prepared to pay for it.
There is evidence that Mr. Lévesque and his ministers are
banking heavily on the assumption that when the crunch
comes we will not be prepared to pay the price. The Quebec
market is very important to Ontario, and a recent article in the
Ottawa Citizen by Douglas Fullerton states as follows:
In the course of one private talk with a banker in New
York, at the time of the recent speech, Lévesque and
Finance Minister Jacques Parizeau were asked about "the
difficulty of negotiating a customs or economic union with
Canada after separation." Parizeau is reported to have
dismissed this concern, in somewhat summary fashion, by
saying, "We have discussed this at length with Ontario;
there are no problems."
The article continues:
It is unfortunate that Premier William Davis' recent
visit to Quebec and his conciliatory statements at that
time appear to give some credence to this claim.
Canada now faces the same question as Hamlet-"To be or
not to be." Those of us who want to preserve Canada intact as
one nation, face a tremendous challenge and a tremendous
opportunity to build a new unity and a new concept of
democracy in our country.

February 22, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

The battie is for the hearts and minds of people, particularly
the people of Quebec. It wiIl be fought mainly on the ideological front. We have the superior idea of democracy as defined
by the Reverend Theodore Parker and applied by President
Abraham Lincoln. If we adopt this idea and apply it to our
personal and national ile, there will be no separation. The
dynamics of this idea in action wilI generate an over-arching
uniting force that wilI be irresistible, and wilI enable us to
bring to reality that noble dream of the Founding Fathers
expressed in the words: '"That He shail have Dominion front
Sea to Sea."
Hon. Paul Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, I shail speak
for not more than six minutes and I will do so in French, 50
bear with me, if you please, for a little while.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, 1 wish to congratulate Senator Cook
for the skilî, the restraint and sober thought which he demonstrated when he put forward the subject matter of his speech.
The humility and moderation of our esteemed colleague have
added to the value of his argument. 1 also want to congratulate
Senator Carter for the excellent contribution he has just made
to the debate on Senator Cook's motion.
However, h am far from convinced that this is the right time
to debate with the best resuits the issue of the separation of
Quebec from Canada before a joint committee of the House of
Commons and the Senate.
If 1 understood welh what the Senate governiment leader said
recently, we should rather wait until the federal government
expresses its views on the best ways to investigate, study and
analyse the issue of the Quebec separatist movement. For more
than seventy-five years now, the problem has been getting
worse. It becomes important now to opt for the most constructive measures to maintain the unity of the federation, the unity
of the Canadian nation. The remarks of the Leader of the
Government in the Senate, the Honourable Ray Perrault,
invite us to tread lightly.
In addition, 1 wonder what useful purpose could be served
by discussing Labrador at a time when exchanges could readi-

441

Iy turn into heated debate. In short, ever since 1927 the topic
has neyer failed to arouse controversy in Quebec as well as in
Newfoundland.
Why then join this issue with that of separatism? 1 feed that
such discussions now would be negative rather than positive
and constructive.
Suffice it to point out, as an example, that the 1927 decision
of the Privy Council of London, transferring a huge part of
territories over which Quebec claimed and still dlaims uniquestionable rights, is stili considered by the vast majority of
Quebecers, men and women alike, as a wrongful decision on
the vested rights of Quebecers and for them a perfidious
judgment and bad opportunist policy. Fifty years later, that
1927 transfer has yet to be recognized, or swallowed, by those
Quebecers. So because of the problem of separatism, which 1
feel must now have priority in study and consideration, it
seems to me in bad taste to bring up again a debate at once
emotional and controversial at such an unfortunately critical
time in the history of our Canadian fedieration.
For moy part, 1 would rather wait, to better discuss the
arguments pertaining to the separation of our federation, until
we have had the resuits of the analysîs now under way on the
best ways to strengthen unity among the members of our
Canadian federation.
So, for ail those reasons, 1 consider premature the motion of
Senator Cook to set up a joint committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons to study the matter of the separation of
Quebec and brri g up once more the Labrador controversy.
1 also feel thil 1 should not speak on the subject at this time.
1 would ratiier wait for a more propitious occasion, when we
know what plans the federal government has made to deal with
the various movernents to dislocate the confederative system of
our Canadian nation. Then 1 shahl do so, recognizing and
evaluating the topics so brilliantly put to us by our colleague
Senator Cook.

APPENDIX
(See p. 435)
JOINT MEETING OF UNITED STATES CONGRESS
February 22, 1977
ADDRESS BY PRIME MINISTER

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress:
For much more than a century, individual Canadians, in
countless ways and on countless occasions, have expressed to
Americans their friendship. Today, as Prime Minister I am
given the opportunity to express those feelings collectively
before the elected representatives of the American people.
I do so with pride, and with conviction.
[Translation]
I speak to you as a fellow Parliamentarian, honoured, as are
all Canadians, by your invitation to appear in this historic
chamber. Here, on the spot where so many of your distinguished leaders have stood, I express to you the most cordial of
greetings. The warmth of your welcome reinforces what I have
always known: that a Canadian in the United States is among
friends.
[English]
The friendship between our two countries is so basic, so
non-negotiable, that it has long since been regarded by others
as the standard for enlightened international relations. No
Canadian leader would be permitted by his electorate consciously tosweaken it. Indeed, no Canadian leader would wish
to, and certainly not this one.
Simply stated, our histories record that for more than a
century millions upon millions of Canadians and Americans
have known one another, liked one another, and trusted one
another.
Canadians are not capable of living in isolation from you
any more than we are desirous of doing so. We have benefited
from your stimulus; we have profited from your vitality.
Throughout your history, you have been inspired by a
remarkably large number of gifted leaders who have displayed
stunning foresight, ofttimes in the face of then popular sentiments. In this city which bears his name, on the anniversary of
his birthday, George Washington's words bear repeating. In a
message familiar to all of you in this chamber, he said: "It is of
infinite moment that you should properly estimate the
immense value of your national union to your collective and
individual happiness."
At a moment in the history of mankind when men and
women cannot escape from the knowledge that the only hope
for humanity is the willingness of peoples of differing complexions and cultures and beliefs to live peaceably together, you
have not forsaken Washington's high standards. You have
chosen to declare your belief in the protection of minorities, in
the richness of diversity, in the necessity of accommodation.
You have contributed new fibre to that seamless fabric we call
the history of mankind-that stumbling, incoherent quest by
individuals and by nations for freedom and dignity.
Liberty and the pursuit of happiness have not been theoretical concepts for Americans, nor have they been regarded as

elusive goals. You have sought each with vigour, and shared
with all mankind the joy and the creativity which are the
products of freedom. You have illustrated throughout your
history the resiliency, the dedication and the inherent decency
of American society.
The United States' achievement in recent years of conducting a great social revolution--overcoming difficulties of
immense complication and obdurateness, and doing so through
the democratic process-is surely a model for all nations
devoted to the dignity of the human condition. Freedom-loving
men and women everywhere are the beneficiaries of your
example. Not the least among them are Canadians, for whom
the United States has long been the single most important
external influence-the weather only excepted.
We in Canada, facing internal tensions with roots extending
back to the 17th century, have much to gain from the wisdom
and discipline and patience which you, in this country, in this
generation, have brought to bear to reduce racial tensions, to
broaden legal rights, to provide opportunity to all.
Canadians long ago determined to govern themselves by a
parliamentary system which favours the flowering of basic
aspirations-for freedom, for justice, for individual dignity.
The rule of law, sovereignty of parliament, a broad sharing of
powers with the provinces, and official support of the pluralistic nature of Canadian society have combined to create in
Canada a community where freedom thrives to an extent not
exceeded anywhere else, a community where equality of opportunity between people and between regions is a constant goal.
The success of our efforts in the first century following
Confederation was promising, but by no means complete. We
created a society of individual liberty and of respect for human
rights. We produced an economic standard of living which
approaches your own. We have not, however, created the
conditions in which French-speaking Canadians have felt they
were fully equal or could fully develop the richness of the
culture they had inherited. And therein is the source of our
central problem today. That is why a minority of the people of
Quebec feel they should leave Canada and strike out in a
country of their own. The newly elected government of that
province asserts a policy that reflects that minority view
despite the fact that during the election campaign it sought a
mandate for good government, and not a mandate for separation from Canada.
The accommodation of two vigorous language groups has
been, in varying fashion, the policy of every Canadian government since Confederation. The reason is clear. Within Quebec,
over 80 per cent of the population speak French as their first
or only language. In Canada as a whole, nearly one-fifth of the
people speak no language but French. Thus from generation to
generation there has been handed down the belief that a
country could be built in freedom and equality with two
languages and many cultures.

i am confident it can be done. I say to you with ail the
certainty i can command that Canada's unity will not be
fractured. Accommodations will be made; revisions will take
place. We shall succeed.
There will have to be changes in some of our attitudes; there
will have to be a greater comprehension of one another across
the barrier of language difference. Both English-speaking and
French-speaking Canadians will have to become more aware
of the richness that diversity brings and less irritated by the
problems it presents. We may have to revise some aspects of
our Constitution so that the Canadian federation can be seen
by six and a half million French-speaking Canadians to be the
strongest bulwark against submersion by 220 million Englishspeaking North Americans.
These very figures illustrate dramatically the sense of
insecurity of French Canada. But separation would not alter
the arithmetic; it would merely increase the exposure.
Nor would the separation of Quebec contribute in any
fashion to the confidence of the many cultural minorities of
diverse origin who dwell throughout Canada. These communities have been encouraged for decades to retain their own
identities and to preserve their own cultures. They have donc
so and flourished, nowhere more spectacularly than in the
prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The
sudden departure of Quebec would signify the tragic failure of
our pluralist dream, the fracturing of our cultural mosaic, and
would likely remove much of the determination of Canadians
to protect their cultural minorities.
Problems of this magnitude cannot be wished away. They
can be solved, however, by the institutions we have created for
our own governance. Those institutions belong to ail Canadians, to me as a Quebecer as much as to my fellow citizens
from the other provinces. And because these institutions are
democratically structured, because their members are freely
elected, they are capable of reflecting changes and of responding to the popular will.
i am confident that we in Canada are well along in the
course of devising a society as free of prejudice and fear, as
full of understanding and generosity, as respectful of individuality and beauty, as receptive to change and innovation, as
exists anywhere. Our nation is the encounter of two of the
most important cultures of western civilization, to which
countless other strains are being added.
Most Canadians understand that the rupture of their country would be an aberrant departure from the norms they
themselves have set, a crime against the history of mankind;
for I am immodest enough to suggest that a failure of this
always-varied, often-illustrious Canadian social experiment
would create shock waves of disbelief among those ail over the
world who are committed to the proposition that among man's
noblest endeavours are those communities in which persons of
diverse origins live, love, work and find mutual benefit.
Canadians are conscious of the effort required of them to
maintain in healthy working order not only their own nation
but as well the North American neighbourhood in which they
flourish. A wholesome relationship with our mutual friend
Mexico and a robust partnership with the United States are
both, in our eyes, highly desirable. To those ends we have
contributed much energy. And you in this country have recip-

rocated to the point where our relationship forms a model
admired by much of the world-one moulded from the elements of mutual respect and supported by the vigour of
disciplined cooperation.
We have built together one of the world's largest and most
efficient transportation and power-generating systems in the
form of the St. Lawrence Seaway. We have conceived and
established the world's oldest, continuously functioning binational arbitral tribunal-the International Joint Commission.
We have joined together in many parts of the world in defence
of freedom and in the relief of want. We have created ofttimes
original techniques of environmental management, of emergency and disaster assistance, of air and sea traffic control, of
movements of people, goods and services-the latter so successfully that the value of our trade and the volume of visitors
back and forth exceeds several times over that of any other two
countries in the world. It is no wonder that we are each so
interested in the continued social stability and economic prosperity of the other.
Nor should we be surprised that the desire of the American
and Canadian peoples to understand and help one another
sometimes adopts unusual forms. In what other two countries
in the world could there be reproduced the scene of tens of
thousands of people in a Montreal baseball park identifying
totally with one team against the other, forgetting ail the while
that every single player on each is American, and a similar
scene in the Washington hockey arena where thousands of
spectators identify totally with one team against another,
forgetting that virtually every player on the ice is Canadian.
Thus do the images blur, and sometimes do they lead to
chafing. Yet how civilized are the responses! How temperate
are the replies! We threaten to black out your television
commercials! You launch fusillades of anti-trust proceedings!
Such admirable substitutes for hostility!
More important than the occasional incident of disagreement is the continuing process of management which we have
successfully incorporated into our relationship. It is a process
which succeeds through careful attention, through consultation, and through awareness on both sides of the border that
problems can arise which are attributable neither to intent nor
neglect, but to the disproportionate size of our two populations
and the resulting imbalance of our economic strength.
Those differences will likely always lead us in Canada to
attempt to ensure that there be maintained a climate for the
expression of Canadian culture. We will surely also be sensitive to the need for the domestic control of our economic
environment. As well, in a country visited annually by extreme
cold over its entire land mass, a country so far-flung that
transportation has always posed almost insuperable problems,
the wise conservation of our energy resources assumes a
compelling dimension. And for a people devoted throughout
their history to accommodating themselves with the harshness,
as well as the beauty, of their natural surroundings, we will
respond with vigour to any threat of pollution or despoliation
be it from an indigenous or from an external source.
Our continent, however, is not the world. Increasingly it is
evident that the same sense of neighbourhood which has served
so well our North American interests must be extended to ail
parts of the globe and to ail members of the human race.
Increasingly, the welfare and human dignity of others will be

the measurement of our own condition. I share with President
Carter his belief that in this activity we will achieve success.
Even as we have moved away from the cold war era of
political and military confrontation, however, there exists
another danger: one of rigidity in our response to the current
challenges of poverty, hunger, environmental degradation, and
nuclear proliferation. Our ability to respond adequately to
these issues will in some measure be determined by our
willingness to recognize them as the new obstacles to peace.
Sadly, however, our pursuit of peace in these respects has all
too often been little more imaginative than was our sometimes
blind grappling with absolutes in the international political
sphere. Moreover, we have failed to mobilize adequately the
full support of our electorates for the construction of a new
world order.
The reasons are not hard to find. In these struggles there is
no single tyrant, no simple ideological contest. We are engaged
in a complex of issues of overwhelming proportions yet with
few identifiable labels. Who, after all, feels stirred to oratorical heights at the mention of commodity price stabilization or
full fuel cycle nuclear safeguards or special drawing rights?
Yet these are the kinds of issue that will determine the
stability of tomorrow's world. They will require innovative
solutions and cooperative endeavour, for these struggles are
not against human beings: they are struggles with and for
human beings, in a common cause of global dimensions.
It is to the United States that the world looks for leadership
in these vital activities. It has been in large measure your

80003-30

fervour and your direction that has inspired a quarter century
of far-flung accomplishment in political organization, industrial development and international trade. Without your dedicated participation, the many constructive activities now in one
stage or another, in the several fields of energy, economics,
trade, disarmament and development, will not flourish as they
must.
My message today is not a solicitous plea for continued
United States involvement. It is an enthusiastic pledge of
spirited Canadian support in the pursuit of those causes in
which we both believe. It is as well an encouragement to our
mutual re-dedication at this important moment in our histories
to a global ethic of confidence in our fellow men.
In that same address to which I referred some minutes ago,
George Washington warned against "the insidious wiles of
foreign influence" and the desirability of steering "clear of
permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world."
Yet here I stand, a foreigner, endeavouring-whether insidiously or not you will have to judge-to urge America ever
more permanently into new alliances. That I dare do so is a
measure not only of the bond which links Canadians to you,
but as well of the spirit of America. Thomas Paine's words of
two centuries ago are as valid today as when he uttered them:
My country is the world, and my religion is to do good.
In your continued quest of those ideals, ladies and gentlemen, all Canadians wish you Godspeed.

NATIONAL SYMBOLS
DISTRIBUTION TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT-QUESTION

Senator Riley: Honourable senators, I should like to address
a further question to the Leader of the Government in the
Senate-not to the Leader of the Opposition this time-on a
subject I raised recently, that being the provision of supplies of
the national emblem of Canada, whether in the form of flags
or lapel pins, for distribution to our constituents.
These buttons and flags are available to members of the
House of Commons, but apparently they are not available to
members of the Senate. I was told when I asked the question
the other evening that the Leader of the Government had
already spoken to the Secretary of State and had been assured
that these emblems would be made available to senators. I
subsequently made a further inquiry of the Citizenship Branch
and was told that they had heard nothing of this. The first
time I was told that it had been discussed but that it had been
decided that they would not be available to senators.
Senator Grosart: Question!
Senator Riley: My question is this: Has the Leader of the
Government had any confirmation that these symbols will be
made available to us? He said he had spoken to the minister,
but I called subsequently and was told that they were not
available.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I can only reiterate
that I received verbal assurances from the Secretary of State
that there would be equal treatment for members of the
Senate and members of the House of Commons with respect to
the distribution of flag pins and emblems. I have not received
that assurance in writing, but I hope to receive in writing that

I have no further information to offer the house at this time,
but it is a matter which I hope can be clarified in writing by
the Secretary of State.
* (1410)

Senator Riley: May I ask a supplementary question? If the
Leader of the Government is able to obtain this confirmation
in writing, will he also endeavour to obtain for us the name of
the person in the Department of the Secretary of State to
whom senators may direct a request for a supply of these
flags?
Senator Perrault: I agree that at this particular time in our
history it is important to make widely available those symbols
of national unity which all of us acclaim and support. I shall
certainly undertake to obtain from the Honourable the Secretary of State details with respect to the source, supply and
provision of these flags and pins. I hope to do that within the
next few days.
Senator Flynn: May I ask a supplementary question? Would
the problem be that it is difficult to find the constituents of
some senators, especially those from New Brunswick who
represent the whole of the province, which is not the situation
with respect to senators from Quebec, who have definite
constituencies or divisions?
Senator McDonald: Honourable senators, I wonder if I may
be permitted to shed a little light on this subject. Only
yesterday I phoned the office of the Secretary of State to
inquire whether it would be possible for me to obtain a
quantity of the flags and the lapel pins of the Canadian flag. I
was informed that the members of the Senate and the members of the House of Commons have equal privileges in this
area, but that the problem is that at the moment there are no
flags or pins available. I was told that as soon as they became
available I would be notified.
Senator Flynn: That is a supplementary answer, not a
supplementary question.
Senator McDonald: If you want to know how to get them, I
am just telling you how.
TRANSPORTATION
PACIFIC WESTERN AIRLINES-JUDGMENT OF SUPREME COURT
OF CANADA-QUESTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Leader of the Government with respect of

February 23, 1977
February 23, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Pacific Western Airlines. The Attorney General for British
Columbia stated yesterday that he expected the government to
follow up on the advice given by the Minister of Transport
that, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada,
consideration would be given to retroactivity with respect to
the acquisition of control of Pacific Western Airlines by the
Government of Alberta.
The government leader will be aware that in answer to a
question by me on July 14, 1976, he said that:
-thought is being given to legislation with some possible
retroactivity to meet some of the concerns posed by the
acquisition of Pacific Western Airlines by the Province of
Alberta.
The leader is aware that the purpose of the Canadian transportation legislation is to allow new owners or proposed new
owners to explain the public interest in the acquisition of
control of regional carriers. I would ask the leader to advise
whether the government proposes to have a public examination
of the purposes for which the Government of Alberta acquired
Pacific Western Airlines, and thereby to obtain public assurances with respect to its management and/or whether the
government proposes to deal with legislation amending the
Aeronautics Act to provide for retroactivity to achieve the
same resuits.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, the decision rendered yesterday by the Supreme Court of Canada with respect
to Pacific Western Airlines, stemming from an appeal by the
Province of Alberta, has possible implications for many other
regions of Canada. For that reason there has been discussion
in government about possible actions following that decision.
These discussions within government have taken place over a
number of months, but no final position has yet been evolved.
There is a belief on the part of the government that it is a
legitimate function of the federal government and/or its agencies to ensure that the regions of Canada are served fairly and
equitably by the regional air carriers of this nation, wherever
those air carriers may Ôperate.
There was some initial concern with respect to the acquisition of Pacific Western Airlines Ltd. by the Province of
Alberta, because at the time a spokesman for the Government
of Alberta stated that the acquisition was being undertaken to
benefit the people of Alberta, and there was concern expressed
at that time by some federal spokesman that there were some
legitimate questions to be asked with respect to the planned
PWA service for other provinces and political entities within
the service region of PWA.
The federal government, in any case, will not formulate its
policy in any kind of punitive spirit, but only with the objective
of ensuring that all regions of Canada are treated equitably
and fairly with respect to air transportation.
There are obvious implications stemming from the fact that
provincial governments, be they in eastern, western or central
Canada, may wish to acquire effective control over regional air
carriers. Regional interests must be protected, and it is the
belief of the government that the Canadian Transport Com-

80003-30/2

mission has a legitimate role to play in ensuring that ail those
who live in these regional areas, regardless of the province of
residence, should have good service, should be treated fairly,
should have their needs met within reason, and should have the
right to appeal to a neutral federal agency.
Senator Austin: I take it that the leader is saying that he
agrees there should be a public hearing with respect to the
ownership by the Province of Alberta of Pacific Western
Airlines Ltd., and that an amendment may well be brought in
to provide that a public hearing take place.
Senator Perrault: I can only say that an amendment is
certainly under consideration, but it is not possible for me to
go beyond that at this time.
Senator Flynn: May I ask the Leader of the Government if I
was wrong in interpreting Mr. Lang, the Minister of Transport, as having said that the legislation would not be
retroactive?
Senator Perrault: There were press reports to that effect,
but I did not hear Mr. Lang's statement. I believe it would be
in the interests of the Senate if I undertook to obtain a
statement from the Minister of Transport and the government,
and present it to the Senate tomorrow afternoon. I shall
undertake that responsibility.
Senator Flynn: Would the Leader of the Government, at the
same time, clarify whether the problem of acquisition is not
distinct from the problem of the head office of a regional
airline and whether that head office should be situated in one
province or another?
Senator Perrault: I believe there may be three aspects of the
question under consideration. There is, first of aIl, control,
supervision of schedules and the type of service provided to the
regions of Canada, and whether or not there should be some
agency with the power to ascertain whether those regional
interests are being served.
The second aspect, surely, is whether provincial crown companies should, in fact, be permitted to control regional air
carriers or to own any part of those regional air carriers; and,
if so, to what extent.
The third aspect is the one to which the Leader of the
Opposition referred.
Senator Flynn: Would the leader say whether his heart is in
British Columbia or Alberta?
Senator Langlois: On the border.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a concern,
just as has the Leader of the Opposition, primarily for the
Canadian national interest.
*

(1420)

Senator Austin: I thank the Honourable Leader of the
Opposition for his assistance, but I thank him cautiously
because I do not know what he has in mind.
I would request the Leader of the Government that it be
borne in mind that in terms of the question of retroactivity Mr.
Lang's statement last summer-

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Flynn: Last summer is a long time ago.
Senator Austin: -made it clear that as the province had
proceeded without any notice to the federal government, or
federal government agency, the federal government had felt
that no retroactive barrier would apply.
Senator Buckwold: May I ask the Leader of the Government to provide an answer to a fourth question in this particular area? Has the government given any consideration to the
taxation position of a provincial crown corporation operating
an airline? As we know, one government does not tax another,
so that a provincial crown corporation operating an airline,
ostensibly, could escape federal income tax. My interest in
this, of course, is the potash question in Saskatchewan. I would
be interested in any response I could get in this particular
field, since I think this question is going to be of growing
importance insofar as profitable industry is being taken over
by provincial governments and thus escaping federal income
tax.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I will include a
reply to that question in the statement which I hope to make
tomorrow. Honourable senators have correctly identified this
as an important question of national policy. As a result of a
verdict rendered by the Supreme Court yesterday, undoubtedly there will be some action taken by the government in the
form of legislation, but a final decision has not been taken with
respect to the nature of that legislation. I hope to make a fuller
statement tomorrow.
Senator Flynn: May I suggest to the Leader of the Government that he might inquire, for the benefit of Senator Buckwold, about the difference between a crown corporation and a
crown-owned private corporation.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I wonder, honourable senators,
if I might trespass on the good nature of the Leader of the
Government to ask whether he could include in his answer
some indication as to whether there are any other regional
airlines in the country in which provincial governments have a
whole or partial ownership, other than Pacific Western.
Senator Perrault: Yes, I would be glad to undertake that
inquiry. There are a number of regional air carriers with
regard to which I understand provincial governments have
expressed an interest in either obtaining some degree of ownership or total control. The principle involved here is a matter for
considerable discussion and debate, I would suggest, among
parliamentarians, not in terms of air carriers which operate
solely within the borders of one province but in terms of, for
example, an industry which serves more than one province but
is controlled by only one province in that region. There must
surely be some way in which the interests of all residents of
any particular region can be protected, and that is the concern
of the federal government.

February 23, 1977

CONFEDERATION
PROPOSED SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE MATTERS
OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO ALL CANADIANS-DEBATE
CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Cook calling the attention of the Senate to matters of interest concerning Labrador and also to the
desirability of establishing a Special Joint Committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons to examine matters of mutual interest to all Canadians whether they
reside in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada.-(Honourable
Senator Langlois).
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I yield to Senator
Riley.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Daniel Riley: Honourable senators, I had not intended
to speak at this particular moment on Senator Cook's inquiry,
but probably this is the best opportunity, when the house has
the time to listen, to express briefly my views in respect of the
subject matter he has raised.
I would like first to congratulate Senator Cook on his able
presentation on initiating the inquiry, and also Senator Carter
on his spendid presentation last evening. I had the privilege of
serving with Senator Carter in the other place many years ago,
and I have long respected his opinion. I respect him even more
after having listened to his contributions to the debates in this
house.
I would also like to express my congratulations to Senator
Marchand for the able manner in which he argued his case on
his inquiry recently.
It was with great interest that I listened to Senator Desruisseaux last night, and I appreciate some of the points he raised.
He questioned whether this was an opportune time to bring up
the question of a possible separation of the province of Quebec
from Canada. He also said that this might not be the proper
time to introduce into this debate the question of the Newfoundlanders' concern regarding Labrador. While I am not
entirely in accord with what Senator Desruisseaux said, I
respect his sagacity and eloquence.
If my memory serves me correctly, the question of Labrador
was not introduced by Senator Cook. It was brought up just
after the November 15 Quebec election, and statements were
made in the national media to the effect that a separated
Quebec was going to look very closely at the question of
Labrador.
As this is a subject which may become heated by statements
which will be made by both Newfoundlanders and the odd
group of separatists in the Province of Quebec, I think this is
perhaps an opportune moment for Newfoundlanders to express
their real concern about the possibility of future disputes over
the Labrador boundaries. After all, it is part of the Province of
Newfoundland-Labrador, and they have great plans for de-

February 23, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

veloping the resources of Labrador. Their concern is both vital
and timely, and I think both Senator Cook and Senator Carter
are to be highly commended for introducing this note into the
debate.
I know that there will be further debates. There may be
committees formed. The subject matter of this particular
inquiry may not go to a committee. It may be that Senator
Cook himself would agree that a better method of having a
wider debate on this question, with a fuller presentation of the
views of the honourable senators on both sides of the house, is
to set up another committee with more general terms of
reference, or even more specific terms of reference, so that all
of us will have an opportunity to enter the debate. He has had
at this time the temerity to raise the question in the Senate. If
it accomplishes no other purpose, I believe he has caused
honourable senators to think that perhaps, after all, we can,
among ourselves on both sides of the house, determine if there
is a better channel whereby we can engage in more prolonged
and detailed debate on the subject.
•

(1430)

Earlier this afternoon the Leader of the Opposition suggested something about my position in New Brunswick. He has a
high regard for New Brunswick and its people, and I assume
that to be because of his Irish background. Of course, not all
Irishmen are as eloquent or-I was going to say-as loquacious as those who have had an injection of French-Canadian
blood into their veins.
We in New Brunswick are naturally very much concerned
about all this talk of separatism and the possibility of a small
minority in the province of Quebec determining the destiny of
Canada.
In New Brunswick there are about 265,000 Acadian people
who are closely related to the French-speaking people of the
province of Quebec, whose Acadian culture is closely related to
the French-Canadian culture, whose problems are in many
ways similar to those of the French-speaking people in our
neighbouring province--or, perhaps I should say, those in the
segregated sections of Quebec where the people think and talk
in French. They have the French mentality and they do not
understand the English-speaking people in the rest of Canada;
they have not had the opportunity to make contact with them.
They live in French, they believe they have rights as French
Canadians, and they are concerned over the loss of their
culture and their language, among other things.
In New Brunswick we have had many problems similar to
those that have existed until recent years, to a large extent, in
the province of Quebec. When our Acadian people were
expelled back in 1775, they were mainly an unlettered race;
there were a few storekeepers, a few traders, and so on, and
they were pawns between England and France. Some of them
escaped before they got to Louisiana; others fled to the woods
and established settlements, and their progeny are the foundation of the Acadian race as we know and respect it today in
New Brunswick, and in parts of Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island.

443

I have said that there are 265,000 or more French-speaking
Acadians in New Brunswick, and some honourable senators
may be surprised to learn that they make up over 35 per cent
of the population of the province. Up until about 1881, they
were living mainly in the small farming communities and the
small fishing villages. They were exploited intolerably by the
merchants who, in our province, would be akin to what the
separatists in Quebec call the "Englishocracy," and they had
many reasons to gripe.
It was not long ago that an English-speaking person went to
get a better knowledge of Acadians, and found that up until
recently there were only a few French lawyers in the province
of New Brunswick. There was one French dentist. Perhaps this
was mainly due to the fact that they did not have the opportunities for education-technical education in particular.
However, they have come a long way. As I have said before in
the Senate, their schools were operated on the basis of how
much money could be raised during a year to support a
one-room schoolhouse, and they engaged teachers with whatever money they could raise, many of them being housewives
who had never gone beyond grade 7 or grade 8 in school. But
they were teaching our Acadian children. Now we have, under
the equal opportunity program instituted by the former
premier, Senator Robichaud, and his colleagues-of whom I
had the good fortune to be one-equal opportunity for education in every nook and cranny of New Brunswick.
This has also happened in Quebec. When we have an
opportunity to listen to some of the English-speaking bigots in
Canada we realize that they have no knowledge of what the
French-speaking people, particularly those in the rural and
fishing areas, have suffered in Quebec. Many of these people
do not realize how the French-speaking people on the coast
and in the lumbering areas were exploited by what they
termed, with some disdain, the "Englishocracy." This is a fact
of life, and one of the reasons why English Canada should take
a long, hard look at the problems which exist for the French
Canadians, the French-speaking people in Canada, before
adopting a red-neck attitude toward them.
I know it is difficult. It was also difficult in New Brunswick
for the English-speaking people to accept the French fact, but
they have accepted it there, and our two-well, Senator Asselin shakes his head. I know that there are pockets of bigots still
in New Brunswick. We had a classic example of that in the
last federal election. A man who comes from a city, approximately 25 per cent of which is made up of Acadian people,
who won an election there through the people's vote, and his
name probably will get into the Canadian lexicon one day.
However, as one who was brought up among the Frenchspeaking people in the province of New Brunswick and who
was partly educated by them, I say that we have wonderful
educational institutions there at the present time. I am thinking particularly of the centre of Acadian development, the
University of Moncton.
I live in a mainly English-speaking city, and I find that
many of my neighbours, who had previously adopted what
could be termed "a bigoted approach" to the Acadian people

SENATE DEBATES
who moved into the city, and who were skilled in the technical
trades because of the teaching available to them in the technical institutes in the province, are now saying that we have
bigots on our side. However, apart from those few bigots, I
find that the English-speaking people of Saint John want their
children to learn French and to be bilingual.
e (1440)

Previously, those who taught the French language in Saint
John and in other English-speaking communities in New
Brunswick were, basically, English-speaking people who had
picked up a smattering of French from textbooks and received
instruction in the French language from teachers whose
mother tongue was English. These were the people who then
came into our schools and tried to teach our children how to
speak the French language. They could not pronounce the
words; they did not know the grammar; they could not conjugate the verbs; they could not differentiate between the masculine and the feminine. As a result, our children through
frustration took a dislike to French classes. They were not
learning the French language.
What we are doing now is not designed to placate the
French-speaking people in our area. Rather, it is a genuine
effort on the part of the English-speaking people to have their
children learn the other official language in what is now a
bilingual province. We are putting French-speaking teachers in
our classrooms starting at grade one, with the eventual aim of
having instruction in the French language available right
through high school.
The same thing applies in the province of Ontario where
there are large numbers of French-speaking people. If the
French-speaking people of the province of Quebec feel they are
the only ones determined to maintain the French language and
culture in Canada, let them look at Ontario, the western
provinces, as well as the maritime provinces. There are
French-speaking people throughout Canada who want to
maintain their language and culture. There is a genuine effort
under way in the maritime provinces, including Prince Edward
Island, on the part of the English-speaking people who want to
see the Acadian people maintain their language and culture.
There are small pockets of bigots on both sides. They are
insignificant. Not only are they insignificant in number, but
their minds are insignificant.
To cite one example, the New Brunswick Telephone Company a few years ago voluntarily printed its telephone directories in both languages. The direct dialing service was located
in Saint John. This was at a time when I was chairman of the
Public Utilities Commission. French-speaking people would
call me up and enquire as to why they could not use the
French language in trying to get a desired number. I checked
to see how many complaints were being received in that
respect, and they numbered about two or three a month. I
traced one inquiry to its source, which was a lady in Fredericton. She was perfectly bilingual. She happened to get an
operator who could not speak French, with the result that she
raised quite a storm. Instead of being understanding and
tolerant towards the efforts of the New Brunswick Telephone

February 23, 1977

Company to create a bilingual system, she raised a storm. As
it turned out, this particular individual was one of the best
translators we had in Fredericton. In fact, she was used as
such on many occasions by the then government of Premier
Robichaud. That is intolerance. That is the bigotry on the
other side.
There is no doubt in my mind, or in the minds of many other
English-speaking people in Canada, that we can resolve our
problems. We can resolve our problems through negotiation. It
is not only a problem that exists in respect of the province of
Quebec; rather, it is in the whole area of federal-provincial
relations.
At one time I was also chairman of the Motor Carrier Board
of the Province of New Brunswick, which is a quasi-judicial
board. The federal government had been allowing the provinces to maintain jurisdiction over bus and truck transportation in the provinces until the Winner case, which originated in
New Brunswick and concerned an American bus line that was
coming into New Brunswick. That case went to the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council, which determined that the
operation of buses and trucks on an interprovincial basis was
solely within the federal jurisdiction. For years, the provinces
had been issuing licences in this area. That is one of the cases
where, in my opinion, the doctrine of stare decisis should not
apply.
The federal government then brought in enabling legislation
which allowed the provinces to issue licences to truckers and
bus operators, allowing them to operate within the respective
provinces and allowing them to travel interprovincially. In the
case of New Brunswick, this meant licensing them to go into
the provinces of Quebec and Nova Scotia and the State of
Maine. The wording of the licences issued by the Province of
New Brunswick was such that it allowed bus and truck
operators to operate over certain or all highways within the
province and, in the case of Quebec, to the province of Quebec
"as authorized thereby", and to proceed into or through New
Brunswick from other jurisdictions "as authorized thereby."
The federal government, instead of exercising its jurisdiction
as determined by the Winner case, passed enabling legislation
which permitted the provinces to continue to issue licences in
respect of bus and truck operations. That is still the situation,
to my knowledge, but it is clearly stated on the back of the
licences that we do so by virtue of the federal legislation.
I cite that as an example of the way in which the provinces,
through federal-provincial cooperation, can acquire jurisdiction over those matters which pertain to the provinces. It is the
old question of "Render therefore unto Caesar the things
which are Caesar's." There are certain matters of jurisdiction
that should be determined rightfully by the provinces, and the
federal government must be prepared to relinquish that jurisdiction to the provinces.
One thing that has always bothered me is the question of
cablevision. Every time we raise the question of cablevision, we
get hit with the Broadcasting Act. Does the Broadcasting Act
govern the signal from Anik, or a signal from the atmosphere,

Februar

y

SENATE DEBATES

the ionosphere, or the stratosphere? How far does the Broadcasting Act enable the federal government to control the
taking of a signal out of the air by provincial undertakings?
Cablevision, to my mind, is a classic example. Taking as an
example a town in the province of Quebec or a town in the
province of New Brunswick, in both cases the signal is taken
from the atmosphere. In the case of cablevision in New
Brunswick, however, we take a signal which emanates from
within the province-from a station, say, in Moncton, and
Moncton takes a signal emanating from Saint John. It is all
done by microwave within the province. Once that signal is
transmitted into the cable which services the different homes
and institutions, the different hotel rooms, and so on, in a
particular area within the province, then the jurisdiction with
respect of that signal, to my mind, belongs entirely to the
province.
(1450)
(

I read in the paper just recently that the Quebec government
is ignoring, or intends to ignore, the forthcoming meeting on
communications and I think that decision is mainly based on
the controversy between the federal and provincial governments on cablevision. In my view Canada should give jurisdiction over cablevision to the provinces, and that applies whether
it be Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick or
any other. I think one instance of where the provinces should
have some measure of control over their own destinies is the
transmission of signals by cablevision.
Honourable senators, I mentioned the question of transportation, but there are others. One of the questions that comes
up every day in the newspaper is that of the use of both official
languages in the air and on the ground so far as it concerns air
transportation in the province of Quebec. I agree with the
argument that the people of Quebec are entitled to the use of
both languages at their airports, whether the airport be Montreal, Mirabel, Rimouski, or Grinstone in the Magdalen
Islands, and I can only trace the dissension in this field to the
fact that there is bigotry on the part of English-speaking pilots
and air traffic controllers. Many of these pilots, as bas been
repeated time and time again, have gone to European and
Asian airports. Somebody asked whether the Russians use
English as the language of the air in respect of their own
aircraft flying into their own airports, and I understood the
answer to be no. The same thing applies in Beigium, France
and many other countries including the Middle East.
I have touched only upon one or two matters, but as
somebody who has lived among French-speaking people I can
say that Quebec can easily remain within Confederation and
still be given many of the rights demanded by the people of
that province. In fact, I think they are entitled to many of
those rights-and this applies not only to Quebec, but to all
other provinces as well.
I hope to be able to enter into further debates on this subject
as opportunities arise, honourable senators, but at the same
time I want to repeat that I respect the views of Senator Cook
and Senator Carter in raising the question of Labrador,
because it is a question of vital concern to the people of

Newfoundland-Labrador. I understand that the full and
proper name is the province of Newfoundiand-Labrador. I
wanted to say these few words in the hope that they might
spark some interest because when this question of separation
arises, and becomes as important as it bas now become, it
bothers us in the province of New Brunswick. It bothers our
French-speaking people, and because of their isolation the
question arises in many minds: If Quebec should separate,
where are we? We are a minority. We have many rights; in
fact, we have practically all the rights we need as a minority in
the province of New Brunswick, but will the English-speaking
people in the other provinces, or the English-speaking people
within our own province, ask, since Quebec has denied the
language rights of the minority in that province, why should
they do not the same thing?
With those few words, honourable senators, I thank you for
your attention. I repeat that I hope to speak further on this
subject at another time.
Senator Buckwold: Will the honourable senator-permit a
question?
Senator Riley: Certainly.
Senator Buckwold: The honourable senator glossed over the
separatist appeal to the French-speaking minority in New
Brunswick. I heard on one of the cross-country radio shows
some weeks ago a man whom I recall being named the
president of the separatist group in New Brunswick. He
claimed that there was great support for his group among
French-speaking New Brunswickers, and he certainly gave the
impression of a very close affinity between this group and the
Parti Québécois.
I wonder whether Senator Riley would care to enlighten me
and other members of the Senate as to the strength of that
particular organization, and its affiliation, if any, to the Parti
Québécois.
Senator Riley: Perhaps Senator Robichaud, who is closer to
the situation than I am, could answer that question. I understand he knows the leader of this group. For my own part, I
would say that it is a group without any great influence, and it
is a group that will never achieve any significant strength in
the province of New Brunswick, or anywhere in the maritime
provinces for that matter.
I would say that within the compass of my knowledge of the
province of New Brunswick we have nothing more than a few
dissident people who liken themselves to the separatists in
Quebec, but I think one of this particular group said recently
that they had had no contact with, and no approaches from,
the Pequiste Government of Quebec. In my view, the separatist movement as it is in the province of New Brunswick can be
likened to a small pebble that has been thrown into a big pond.
It has not caused any great ripple among the French-speaking
people.
Our Acadian people embrace, and will continue to embrace,
the concept of complete unity within Confederation.
On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.

CUSTOMS TARIFF
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Senator Hayden, Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, presented the following report:
Thursday, February 24, 1977
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce, to which was referred Bill C-15, intituled:
"An Act to amend the Customs Tariff" bas, in obedience
to the order of reference of Thursday, February 3, 1977,
examined the said Bill. In the course of such examination
it appeared that tariff item 69605-1, in Schedule III of
Bill C-15, does not reflect the intention of the Minister in
bringing forward such proposed legislation.
The intention of the original wording of tariff item
69605-1 was considerably broadened by a decision of the
Tariff Board in July 1976 and the purpose of the revised
wording of the item, as set out in Bill C-15, is to restore
the original intent of the tariff item. However, it appears
instead that the new wording of the tariff item in Bill
C-15 has the effect of narrowing that meaning considerably and does not provide the coverage and the free entry
for the items covered thereby that Parliament intended.
In order, therefore, to restore the original meaning,
effective at the earliest possible date, when the importation of goods might be adversely affected administratively
by requiring payment of duty that was not intended, the
Minister of Finance appearing before the Committee
proposed that an Order in Council be passed, effective as
and from October 14, 1976, under the provisions of
Section 17 of the FinancialAdministration Act (R.S.C.
1970, Chapter F-10), and that such Order in Council

would be in force when importations are made by those
entitled to the benefit of duty free entry of such goods.
This proposed Order in Council would, therefore, have
a blanket effect in relation to all scientific preparations
covered by tariff item 69605-1 and the wording of the
Remission Order would be as follows:
SHORT TITLE

1. This Order may be cited as the Scientific Preparations Remission Order.
REMISSION

2. (1) Remission is hereby granted of the customs duty
paid or payable under the Customs Tariff on scientific
preparations including their containers, imported into
Canada on or after October 14, 1976, by or for a society
or institution qualified to use the provisions of tariff item
69605-1 of the said Act, for use directly in teaching,
research or medical diagnosis.
(2) Remission is hereby granted of the sales tax paid or
payable under the Excise Tax Act on scientific preparations, including their containers
(a) sold on or after October 14, 1976, to a society or
institution referred to in subsection (1), or
(b) imported into Canada on or after October 14, 1976,
by or for a society or institution referred to in subsection (1),
for use directly in teaching, research or medical diagnosis.
In addition, the Minister of Finance gave to this Committee an undertaking to put in statutory form the provisions of this Remission Order at the next session of
Parliament. Since it appears that such procedures by way
of a Remission Order and the subsequent enactment of
legislation that would substantially reflect the terms of
the Order in Council would provide effective duty free
entry for the items proposed to be covered, your Committee accordingly reports the Bill without amendment.
Respectfully submitted,
SALTER A. HAYDEN
Chairman
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a third time?
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, since there are some
unusual features in the report, with the consent of the Senate I
should like to make a short explanation.

SENATE DEBATES
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Hayden: This report deals with one particular tariff
item which covers certain importations in relation to research.
The ones who are particularly concerned by this item are
universities engaged in research, teaching hospitals, and the
like. This tariff item has been in the law for some years, but in
July of last year the Tariff Board, broadened the scope of
importations which could enjoy duty-free status. It was not the
intention that there should be such a broadening, and item
69605-1 in schedule III of the bill was intended to restore the
original meaning of the original tariff item but, whatever the
reason, the meaning ended up by being too narrow.
The approach then went from a broadening influence to too
narrow an influence, the effect of which was that people in the
categories I have described, to whom it was intended to give
this duty-free status, were being penalized. The question then
was, "How do you deal with this?" Obviously, of course, it
could be dealt with by amendment, but that is a sort of
delaying process, or very well might be. So we developed a
two-pronged approach. The first approach, which is referred to
in the report of the committee, is the use of section 17 of the
Financial Administration Act, which provides for remission of
duty. That section would permit a blanket order in council in
respect of the remission of duty. The language of section 17 of
the Financial Administration Act is such that an order in
council could be passed before, after, or pending the situations
that involve the application to import particular items.
• (1410)
We got from the minister this morning a copy of his
proposed remission order. It is part of the report of the
committee. That order in council will be enacted as soon as
this bill becomes law.
Then there was the broader situation to be covered, that
being to put the subject matter of this tariff item back into the
statute law under the Customs Tariff. So, we received a
further undertaking from the Minister of Finance this morning
that at the next session of Parliament he will introduce an
amendment in line with the substance of the remission order,
thereby enabling us to report the bill without amendment. In
the circumstances, it seemed to members of the committee
that there was a good case made for giving immediate relief by
order in council because duties commenced being assessed
against people who were never intended by the original legislation to be subject to these orders on October 14, 1976.
It was the view of the committee that we should not insist on
an amendment, or in any way delay the coming into force of
this measure, and that is why you have the report in the form
in which it is.
Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I wonder if I might
ask Senator Hayden a question?
Under which particular subsection of section 17 of the
Financial Administration Act is this order in council being
passed, and are you confident that the retroactive effect is
valid under the statute?

February 24, 1977

Senator Hayden: I appreciate my friend's position. I expected that I would be asked some questions in this respect. All I
can say is that there is statutory authority for creating a
remission of duty, and that statutory authority permits it to be
done by order in council, and an order in council that is passed
before there is any importation.
I am not one to challenge the statutory authority, and I
doubt if even the range of investigation of my friend's committee extends that far. His committee can look at it, it can
challenge it, but there are two reasons for not effectively
challenging that authority, the first one being that the cause is
worthy, and the second being that the statute is very clearly
worded.
Senator Forsey: I merely want the assurance of the honourable and learned senator on this point. In the Statutory
Instruments Committee's report, it may be recalled, we suggested that it was well for members of both houses to examine
rather carefully the proceedings on legislation when it was
before Parliament to see that undue use was not made of
powers.
I wanted to be quite sure that in the honourable senator's
opinion the apparent retroactive effect of this order is perfectly
valid under the statute. Apparently he is convinced of that, so I
have no further questions to ask.
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, I should tell you that
later this afternoon I may have to ask the Senate to revert to
Reports of Committees, because I expect to have a report
shortly on Bill C-22.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a third time?
Is the Honourable Senator Benidickson moving third reading of the bill?
Senator Flynn: As the first order.
Senator Benidickson: Honourable senators, I am the sponsor of this bill. While I am not a member of the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee, I did attend its sittings. I
have confidence, having regard to the well-known legal competence of the chairman, in his willingness to accept this order in
council, which is promised after the bill passes, in satisfaction
of the question raised by Senator Hicks during the debate on
second reading. I think he said at that time there were
probably imports to the value of $35 million under this item,
and most of them would be for research institutions, particularly universities. Naturally, some of us, including myself,
were concerned about it.
Senator Hicks also emphasized that these institutions were
largely funded and subsidized by government, both provincial
and federal. Therefore, if there were an extra impost or tariff,
it would be paid by government.
I think the solution arrived at with the Minister of Finance
this morning, at the meeting of the Banking, Trade and
Commerce Committee and under the chairman's guidance, is
satisfactory.

INCOME TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Senator Hayden, Chairman of the Standing Senate Comnmittee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, presented the following report:
Tbursday, February 24, 1977.
The Standing Senate Cormmittee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce, by resolution of the Senate on November
16, 1976 was autborized to examine and report upon the
subject-matter of Bill C-22 intituled "An Act to amend
the statute law relating to income tax" in advance of tbe
said Bill coming before the Senate.
In accordance witb the Order of Reference, your Comnmittee presented its report to tbe Senate on Thursday,
December 9, 1976.
The Bill was read a second time on February 16, 1977
and referred to your Committee.
Your Committee bas beard tbe Honourable Donald S.
Macdonald, Minister of Finance, and the Honourable
Monique Bégin, Minister of National Revenue.
For the reasons appearing in the above recitals, your
Committee now reports as follows:
In its report of December 9, 1976, your Committee
noted that clause 61(l) of the Bill, as drafted, did not
have the desired result, namely to give tbe taxpayer the
right to appeal a "nil" assessment. Tbe desired result was
not obtained because the Minister was still not obliged,
notwitbstanding clause 61 (1), to determine the amount of
a taxpayer's loss. The Minister of National Revenue and
bier officiaIs described to your Committee tbe difficulties
tbey would bave to determine ahl taxpayers' losses.
The Minister of National Revenue, recognizing your
Committee's concern, bas undertaken as follows.
"Wbere my Department bas determined tbe amount of
a taxpayer's loss, and that amount differs from the loss
reported by tbe taxpayer, our official determination of
tbe loss will be issued when tbe taxpayer requests it.
Tbis will allow tbe taxpayer to appeal tbe determination immediately in alI cases wbere he wisbes to do so.
My Department wîll be publisbing information to taxpayers to explain bow tbey may obtain a loss
determination."
Furtbermore, tbe Minister of Finance undertook to
introduce an amendment to tbe Income Tax Act substan-

tially incorporating tbe aforesaid undertaking of bis colleague in a manner satisfactory to bier.
In its report to the Senate on December 9, 1976, your
Committee noted tbe retroactive effect of clause 42(1) of
tbe Bihl wbich would prevent taxpayers living witb their
spouses from claiming the bigber deduction equivalent to,
tbe marriage deduction for dependants wben it was the
intent of the Act that tbey only be entitled to a lesser
deduction. Your Committee was concerned witb tbe
adverse retroactive effect on some taxpayers. Your Coinmittee understands from Department officiais tbat very
few taxpayers will be adversely affected. Furtbermore, an
appeal is now before the Federal Court wbicb may deny
the taxpayers this rigbt. Wbile your Committee feels tbis
clause would constitute a dangerous precedent, it will flot
insist on its removal on the understanding tbat your
Committee wilI not be bound in any way to accept, in the
future, retroactive amendments wbich may adversely
affect the taxpayer. Clause 42(1) of tbe Bihl was approved
by a majority of your Committee witbout amendment.
In its report of December 9, 1976, your Committee feit
tbat clause 75 of tbe Bill amending Section 234 of the Act
and requiring resident individuals to insert tbeir Social
Insurance Numbers on ownersbip certificates would constitute an improper use of taxpayers' Social Insurance
Numbers. Tbe Minister of Finance bas undertaken to
review and report on the operation of tbis clause no later
than April 30, 1979, and preserit tbe Senate witb the
opportunity to discuss bis report and review its
conclusions.
It was agreed by a majority tbat the Committee report
the bill witbout amendment to clause 75.
Your Committee notes tbe amendment made to paragrapb 212 (14)(c) of tbe Act by tbe House of Commons
in conformity witb a recommendation made by your
Committee in its Report to the Senate on December 9,
1976.
For tbe reasons above stated the Committee now
reports tbe Bill without amendment.
Respectfully submitted,

Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, may 1 bave leave to
explain tbis report?
The Hon. the Speaker. Is leave granted?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, this report deals
witb income tax amendmnents. You will recaîl that the Senate
referred tbe subject matter of this income tax bill to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce in November 1976, and the committee tabled a report
in this chamber on December 9, 1976, in wbicb it dealt witb

SENATE DEBATES
certain points and made certain recommendations in relation
to the bill.
Later the bill came to the Senate in the ordinary way, and,
after debate, was referred to the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce for examination and report.
In the course of our examination we compared the recommendations we had made in our earlier report with the provisions of the bill as it came to us, and we found that in a
number of cases the bill did not reflect our recommendations.
When the Minister of Finance and the Minister of National
Revenue were before us we enquired as to the whys and
wherefors for not accepting the recommendations. There were
possibly three recommendations on which we stated our view,
but which they did not accept, and which are dealt with in this
report. Also, we made one important recommendation in relation to charities which they did accept on third reading in the
Commons.
The first of the three items is one I discussed in this
chamber as a result of a statement by Senator Flynn. I spoke
about the nil assessment. I explained what a nil assessment is.
A nil assessment exists when a taxpayer files a tax return that
shows a loss, because the most expeditious way the department
has of dealing with that is simply to make a nil assessment.
This means that there is no tax payable. But that is not final in
any sense, because it is still subject to investigation and
checking.
The difficulty that arose was that the courts, even the
Supreme Court of Canada, have ruled that a nil assessment is
not an appealable assessment. Therefore, there would be no
way by which the taxpayer could get to the root of his problem
if he had income in the previous year or four or five years, or
income going forward four or five years, because he would not
have his losses established. Now, it was the department itself
that proposed this amendment in the bill in order to negate the
effect of the decisions in the courts.
However, as we saw in committee, the amendments they
proposed did not go far enough. One of the amendments was
that the minister "may determine the losses." Our thinking
was that if the minister is not obliged to determine the losses
but just "may determine" them, then, if he does not determine
them, up until that time you are simply under the authority of
the existing law and you do not have an appealable assessment.
We proposed, therefore, some change in that, and as a result
I had, before the committee met, a communication from the
Minister of National Revenue expressing appreciation for the
point, which I think is understandable because basically it was
an amendment proposed by the Minister of Finance, the
administration of which would be handled by the Minister of
Revenue. Therefore, in essence, it was their amendment.
The Minister of Revenue gave us the interpretation she
would apply to this, and this is the language she used:
Where my Department has determined the amount of a
taxpayer's loss, and that amount differs from the loss
reported by the taxpayer, our official determination of the
loss will be issued when the taxpayer requests it. This will

February 24, 1977

allow the taxpayer to appeal the determination immediately in all cases where he wishes to do so. My Department will be publishing information to taxpayers to
explain how they may obtain a loss determination.
* (1430)

This was the immediate procedure to make available, under
these terms of interpretation, facilities for appealing an assessment in order to determine the loss.
In our meeting, at which both the Minister of Finance and
the Minister of National Revenue were present, we secured an
undertaking from the Minister of National Revenue that this
interpretation would be applied immediately, and would be
fully publicized as a matter of interpretation so that taxpayers
would know their position.
Then, from the Minister of Finance, we obtained an undertaking that he would, at the next session of Parliament,
implement the interpretation as substantially as can be done,
and, of course, with the approval of the Minister of National
Revenue. It is difficult for me to see any risk in accepting such
a qualification because, after all, the amendment is a product
of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of National
Revenue.
Therefore, we saw no reason for insisting on amending the
bill, since there are some excellent relieving sections which
benefit taxpayers. The introduction of an amendment to the
bill would throw the proceedings beyond March 1, that being
the deadline for those who are self-employed, and who have
created their own registered retirement savings plans-generally called RRSPs-to make their contributions. March 1 is
within 60 days of the beginning of their taxation year. If they
do not make their contribution for the current year by next
Tuesday, they will have missed a year and there is no way in
which they can recover. Therefore, there was an urgency in
respect of moving the bill along. That is only one of many
relieving sections in the bill.
Another item dealt with retroactivity. The thinking of the
committee has always been that if there is something retroactive in income tax legislation that is beneficial to the taxpayer
the committee will support it without question; but if it is
adverse to the taxpayer, the committee will scrutinize it very
carefully, and it usually ends up objecting, and sometirnes even
insisting on changes or undertakings to make changes.
In this case, we were faced with a problem. If we look at the
substance of the problem, it is not too difficult to rationalize
the waiving of our insistence on doing away with the provision
dealing with retroactivity. The bill proposes that it should be
effective from the year 1975 onward, so the retroactive effect
is from 1975.
The provision deals with deductions which a husband would
be entitled to make in certain circumstances where-perhaps
because his wife has income-he is not entitled to take the
allowance which he would otherwise receive because of the
fact that he is married. There was a provision in the same
section of the bill which gave the husband the right to deduct
an amount equivalent to that of his wife's deduction, which he

February 24, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

could take on behalf of his dependents, yet elsewhere in the bill
the deduction that a father may make for dependants is a more
limited amount.
The department felt therefore that while there was a defect,
or deficiency-and undoubtedly they had created it-no one
appeared to have tumbled to the situation. There may be a few
appeals pending, but very few such returns are filed. They
decided that any publicity in connection with this might alert a
number of people who up to this moment have not been aware
of the provision, and of what I might call the windfall which
they might be able to develop.
While I would say it was not thought to be in the most
meritorious of taste, the language was changed by an amendment and made effective to 1975 and 1976 in order to destroy
what someone bas called "an anomaly." Perhaps I should be
frank and say that it was a defect or a deficiency. It was never
intended. Therefore, we had to rationalize for ourselves our
well-known principle of not wanting to support anything that
was adverse and retroactive with the things that might be said
in favour of this particular application of retroactivity.
The majority of committee members decided that they
would not insist on their recommendation that this retroactivity be taken out of the bill, and that the committee would
assert, which it has done in its report, that it is not a precedent
and does not tie its hands or change its attitude on the subject
of retroactivity on any future occasion.
A special item was the use of social insurance numbers.
People have been taking to the bank coupons attached to
bonds, debentures and some stock, and cashing them. They
sign a certificate, or something, to the effect that they are the
owner.
It was felt that there were several opportunities for fraud,
for theft of bonds, with the bearer of the coupons cashing them
at the bank and there being no record of whether persons were
evading tax by not declaring their full income. The department
required the provision as machinery for keeping a closer tab on
the situation regarding the bearers of coupons.
The bill provides that the bank, which is the payor of these
bearer coupons, will be obligated to compel the payee, the
person cashing the coupons, to put his social security number
on the certificate. If he does not do so, the bank is obligated to
deduct 25 per cent of the amount, to withhold it and to remit
it.
The committee thought, and said so in its report, that this
was an unusual and unintended use of the social security
number. Perhaps there are uses to which it could be put and
has not yet been put, but which would be commendable and
perhaps desirable. However, it was felt that this was not one of
them. After developing the question further it seemed that
there may be some advantage here. It may assist in opening up
avenues where there has been a practice of using bearer
coupons and other bearer instruments to obtain money that
cannot be traced.

S(1440)

So, this morning we heard the Minister of National Finance.
There was full discussion, and some opposition in principle to
making such use of the social insurance number. Finally, a
majority came to the conclusion that we should allow it to go
on a basis of trial and error. It was finally decided that on or
before April 30, 1979 the minister is to prepare a report and
submit it to the Senate as to the result of the monitoring of
these cashings of coupons under the new law and to ascertain
the result in order to see whether this provision bas produced
worthwhile disclosures of evasion of tax. As was pointed out to
him, we, of course, have the right at all times, if we consider
the monitoring does not justify the continuance of this provision, to insist that it be removed. With respect to income tax
bills, of which we can assume there will be one each year, we
can refuse to pass certain sections until we are given the right
to attack particular elements.
Those are the main features of the bill. I did mention the
one very important item, dealing with charities, with respect to
which we made a recommendation which was accepted. So, all
in all, the report contains the best consideration that the
committee could give to both the subject matter and the bill
itself. We received excellent cooperation from the two ministers, and this is the best we can do.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, once again we have
heard an excellent explanation of a report of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce by
Senator Hayden. Personally, I found this one to be extremely
interesting. That applies, also, of course, to the report presented to us a little earlier by Senator Hayden. Listening to that
report, it occurred to me that we have now instituted in the
Senate what might be termed the Hayden formula No. 3. I
will not take the time of the Senate to describe Hayden
formulas No. 1 and No. 2. However, formula No. 3 now seems
to be recourse to certain sections of the Financial Administration Act to expedite the passage of a bill without undue delay.
In the report now before us we have the statement over and
over again with respect to the three main points raised by the
committee that the minister, or ministers, have undertaken
either to make amendments or to reconsider or review the
operation of the sections which the committee questioned. I
personally cannot complain about this method of, essentially,
making changes in proposed legislation without actually sending the legislation back to the House of Commons for reconsideration, although in these cases in which there have been
undertakings by the ministers there would probably be little
additional debate in the other place, because the amendments
would normally be introduced by the appropriate minister
following the suggestions of the Senate committee.
However, one thing always concerns me. The Senate never
gets the credit it should when it amends legislation in the
manner in which we will be doing, in effect, when we accept
this report and pass the bill consequential upon the undertakings given in the report. As I have looked over the history of
assessments of the Senate, its work and its contribution to the
public interest, I have noticed that academics, at least, almost

SENATE DEBATES
invariably start by totalling the number of amendments the
Senate has made to bills. Now, because we have had these very
successful Hayden formulas, we are not receiving that credit. I
am not for one minute suggesting that in all cases I would have
liked to have seen the committee actually amend bills,
although in more cases than the committee in its wisdom has
decided I would have liked to have seen that done, if only for
the reason I have just indicated.
There is no question that the committee and the chairman
are satisfied with the undertakings that have been given,
although some of the undertakings seem rather strange. One is
an undertaking by one minister to honour the undertaking
given by another minister, which seems like a slightly roundabout way of doing it. On the other hand, there is no question
that the use of this type of procedure by the committee and as
recommended to the Senate does expedite legislation. I for one
feel that we should never apologize too much if the purpose is
to expedite legislation. In one particular case here, of course,
we know that there is a very important deadline, and failure to
meet it would affect the public and private interest of many
citizens.
I was interested in the consideration given by the committee
to the question of the use of social insurance numbers. The
committee has made it clear that the particular use suggested
here is, I believe the phrase was "an improper use." This of
course, reflects the fear of many Canadians that social insurance numbers will in time introduce some aspects of a police
state in Canada. I know that distinguished Canadians, distinguished parliamentarians, have expressed that fear on many
occasions. It is not one that I particularly share, because I
have always felt that most Canadians would not object to
being given a number which would be their identification
number for all purposes. However, I can understand the
concern of the committee in this regard, because in this case
the suggestion was that failure to produce a social insurance
number would make payment by the bank subject to a discount. I can understand that this does introduce an elementSenator Hayden: Or a fingerprint.
Senator Grosart: Or a fingerprint. I can understand that
this does introduce an element of impropriety into the particular use. There seems to me to be considerable evidence that
these social insurance numbers are being used in many ways
certainly not contemplated by the original legislation which
introduced them. I am told, for example, that one of the
methods by which attempts are made to prevent people seeking
employment to which they are not entitled-and I am now
referring to non-Canadian citizens who are in Canada but are
not entitled to work and earn remuneration here-is the use of
these numbers. Apparently, they are being used very successfully in this area, and again I say that I have no objection to
this, because obviously if there is not some obligation placed
on an employer then he has no incentive whatever to examine
the legal employability of somebody who comes seeking
employrnent from him. The employer is required to report
certain deductions from salary or wages paid, such as Canada
pension plan contributions, unemployment insurance premi-

February 24, 1977

ums, old age security premiums, and so forth, and here the
social security numbers appear to be used at the moment very
successfully. I repeat, however, that I understand that the
committee's objection in this particular case is in a rather
different category.

•

(1450)

Senator Hayden, in presenting the report, used some very
strong language. I was glad to hear him use the phrase,
"insisting on changes." I would hope that it will be made clear
to our colleagues in the other place, and to the public of
Canada, that in refraining from actually holding up the passage of legislation by these devices-and I do not use the word
in a prejorative sense at all-the Senate should not be assurned
to be reluctant to amend legislation in this chamber and send
it back to the other. In fact, I believe that if we can find
legitimate cases for amending legislation-and most of such
legitimate cases would flow from the wisdom of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce-we
should not shy away from doing so, since while it is one thing
for a minister to give an undertaking which may or may not
result in an amendment, which may merely be in the area of
the administration or regulations, or merely an undertaking to
interpret a clause or a section in a certain way, this is not,
from the point of view of the Senate, quite the sane thing as
an amendment coming from this chamber and going to the
other in circumstances in which we are not unnecessarily
holding up the passage of legislation.
I commend the committee and the chairman for a report
which has very extensively covered, in connection with Bill
C-22, a number of what I consider to be very important points.
Senator Benidickson: Honourable senators, I would like to
say a few words at this time because I assume that in view of
the long delay in passing this bill, which concerns a great
number of taxpayers, particularly with regard to the RRSP
field, there will be a request to waive the normal rules and
have third reading today. I sometimes am inclined to oppose
this, but I would not do so today.
I do want to point out, however, that this is just part two of
a very important and exhaustive Senate study of this income
tax amendment legislation. Therefore, I want to go back to the
report under the Hayden formula, the study of some consequence that was made last year in the knowledge that this bill
would come before us. I refer to the report of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce which
was tabled on December 9, 1976. A couple of references have
been made this afternoon to December 8, but as far as I know
the report was tabled on December 9.
As I did in committee this morning, I should like to refer to
a couple of what I consider to be important subjects which
were studied by the committee last year and are referred to in
the report of the committee, which appeared as an appendix to
the Debates of the Senate on December 9, 1976. The first is
dealt with on pages 213 and 214 of Hansard under the
heading "Deferred Compensation Plans."

February 24, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

I think all of us have had some representations from the
Consumers' Association of Canada in connection with some
inflexibility that exists in the RRSPs setup, and the obligation
to obtain annuities, probably from a narrow source. I now read
from the report, as it appears on page 213 of Hansard:
With respect to registered pension plans and registered
retirement savings plans (RRSPs), your committee is
concerned with the inflexibility inherent upon maturity of
such plans.
Later on the same page it says:
While the committee recognizes the problems caused
by this inflexibility, it is also aware of the advantages.
It goes on to say, again about these undertakings, the
following:
The Minister of Finance is undertaking further study of
the inflexibility that appears at maturity of a plan.
Though not a voting member of the committee, when we
had the pleasure of the presence of the Minister of Finance
this morning I raised the question of whether, between December 9 and now, more than two months later, he had had an
opportunity to review our committee's report and come to any
further conclusion with respect to this particular point. I
appreciate that in view of the pressure of other matters he may
not have had an adequate answer to offer today, but the
question was raised, and I also want to raise it here in the
Senate.
I know that we may not have an opportunity of seeing, with
only a day's notice, the written report of the committee, and I
am not quite certain what the chairman reported with respect
to charities and foundations. This was raised at the meeting
this morning, and I would like to quote from the report as it
appears on page 214 of Hansard.
It is therefore suggested that the bill be amended to oblige
private foundations to distribute only the lesser of fair
market value of such assets and their cost base.
In presenting his report, the chairman said something about
charities and foundations, but I was not clear what he said.
Was this dealt with or an amendment made in the House of
Commons?
In any event, I want to point out again an old gripe that I
have. At public expense we had this morning a reprinting of
the 113 pages, I believe it is, of this bill as passed by the House
of Commons. There were, as usual, blank right-hand pages. To
my knowledge there were quite a number of amendments
made in the House of Commons between the first and third
reading stages.
Senator Hayden: There were seven or eight amendments. If
that be "quite a number", then it is quite a number.
Senator Benidickson: Okay, but no notice is ever given to
senators. Our Law Clerk does not provide senators with explanations as to amendments made in the House of Commons. It
is true that we have in our desks the first reading version of a
bill which indicates the proposed changes from the statute as
the law now stands, and one can see what is proposed by way

of amendment. However, when we come to committee consideration, or final consideration of a bill in the Senate, we are
not provided with explanatory notes. As I have said on previous occasions, usually it would take only 15 minutes for our
Law Clerk, with scissors and paste, to provide us with explanatory notes. This information would assist us greatly in our
deliberations.
S(1500)

Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, I expected my honourable friend to make remarks along the lines he has. The
answer strikes me as being a very simple one. So far as the
Senate or its committees are concerned, we are provided with
first and second reading versions of bills, which contain all
explanatory notes. This was the case with Bill C-22. In addition, in committee we had Hansardof the other place. Honourable senators need only to read that material to ascertain
the nature of the amendments. I read through all that material
and found the minister's explanations to be excellent. They
were clear and understandable.
The only area of difficulty would have been in obtaining
those amendments which were made to the bill during the
course of debate on third reading after closure had been
invoked. The House of Commons Hansard made no direct
reference to the section that was amended. Apparently, that is
a procedure that is permissible. In other records, however, the
amendments were available, and the amendments were available to us in committee.
As to explanatory notes in bills as passed by the House of
Commons, that is something which is entirely within the
province of the other place. I do not think we can order them
to provide such explanatory notes.
It is a question of whether the Senate should at any stage
provide its own explanatory notes. Such explanatory notes are
provided on House of Commons bills on first and second
reading, with the result that Senate committees have such
explanatory notes before them when they are considering the
subject matter of a given bill. In those circumstances, the
explanatory notes are before committees of the Senate while
debate is progressing in the other place and before there is any
finality there.
If honourable senators are of the view that they should have
these explanatory notes before a bill is considered in the
Senate, that is fine. If honourable senators feel that our Law
Clerk should have that additional responsibility, that is fine,
but if that were ordered I think we would need to engage at
least one additional law clerk.
Senator Benidickson: It would require a mere 15 minutes of
his time with a pair of scissors and some paste.
Senator Hayden: I agree fully that if one has some difficulty
in getting answers, it tends to lead one to adopt the attitude,
"Well, I have tried and I cannot get it. Perhaps by the time I
do get it, it will be too late for me to do anything effective
about it." But you cannot blame your committees for that. As
Chairman of the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, I
supply members of the committee with all material which I

SENATE DEBATES
think will be of assistance, including newspaper clippings,
publications, comments, and so forth. This is distributed to
every member of the committee. I endeavour to keep committee members as well informed as possible, with good results.
Senator Benidickson: Honourable senators, I should like to
reply to my honourable friend's remarks.
Like everyone else, I admire the work of the Chairman of
the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, Senator
Hayden. However, he does not seem to be aware that only he
and 1, and perhaps one or two others, had before us during the
committee consideration of this bill this morning a copy of the
bill on first reading, a copy of the ways and means motion, and
a copy of the amendments made by the other place between
first reading and third reading stages. It would seem that I was
provided with these items because our Law Clerk knows that it
is a point of gripe with me if I do not have that information
before going to a committee.
Senator Grosart: Perhaps the Leader of the Government
would consider referring this matter to the Rules Committee,
or whatever the appropriate committee might be, for consideration. As a layman, I appreciate the difficulties that Senator
Benidickson and perhaps others have in this connection. I am
delighted to discover that such a distinguished lawyer as
Senator Benidickson meets the same problems which I run
across from time to time.
I appreciate Senator Hayden's comment that it is not a
matter for his committee, but rather a matter for the Senate as
a whole to decide. At first glance, the easy solution appears to
be to provide each senator with a copy of the bill as introduced
on first reading in the other place. That, of course, would be
misleading. There would have to be a note indicating that the
explanatory notes are applicable to the bill as read the first
time but not as amended. In those circumstances, honourable
senators may be misled by the notes added at the first reading
stage by the draftsmen who, it should always be remembered,
are merely draftsmen.
I think this is an important and interesting question, and one
which should be referred to the appropriate committee for
consideration. It would be helpful to lay persons such as myself
if we could be advised, not only in committee but in the Senate
itself, as to exactly what has happened to a bill since it
received first reading.
This is a matter which has been discussed previously. There
is also the question of what authority such notes or comments
might have if the Senate took it on itself to provide these
explanations.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I can advise the
Senate that this question was considered again only this week.
Certainly, there is no objection from the government to having
this matter referred for study and recommendation by an
appropriate committee. It may not require a formal initiative
in the form of a motion. If it seems to be the consensus of
honourable senators that a problem does exist, then one of our
committees should look into that problem. I will certainly
undertake an initiative in that respect.

February 24, 1977

Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I have one question
that I should like to ask arising, doubtless, out of my sheer
ignorance of the matter, and two very brief comments. If
Senator Hayden could delay his departure for just a moment, I
should like to ask one very simple and, I fear, ignorant
question.
S(1510)

Under clause 61, what I am a little puzzled about is
whether, if the taxpayer now gets the consideration which has
been promised, there will still be a nil assessment and, if so,
whether this will be appealable in the view of the courts?
Perhaps I should repeat the question, in case the honourable
senator didn't get it. Clause 61, with the undertaking that
presumablySenator Hayden: I had disconnected my earphone.
Senator Forsey: With the undertaking which has been given,
would there be a nil assessment and, if so, would that be
appealable in the view of the courts? That is my question.
Senator Hayden: A nil assessment by a court as high as the
Supreme Court of Canada bas been held not to be an appealable assessment.
Senator Forsey: I understand that.
Senator Hayden: Having ruled that, it means that you
cannot move anywhere in relation to a nil assessment. Therefore, you have to convert it into the form of assessment that is
appealable, and, therefore, you have to get an official determination of losses from the department because in the first
instance, as you know, when you file an income tax return, it is
a self-serving document. Some people misconstrue that, and
make it too self-serving. In the first instance, it is a self-serving
document. The department will make what we call a "quickie"
assessment. That does not bind them in any way. You do not
have any rights in connection with the "quickie" assessment;
they come only when you get a formal assessment.
The only kind of formal assessment you can get from the
department, when you have a nil assessment, will be an official
determination of losses.You may say you have a loss, but if the
department can confirm a profit or income that will cat up the
losses and leave something more, then, of course, the nil
assessment disappears and there is an appealable situation
because there is a full-fledged assessment. If the department
simply accepts your statement of loss, then you are locked in,
until possibly the next year when, if you have income, you
attempt to carry that loss forward. But if you go for two or
three years without income, and then try to carry the loss
forward, you face a very difficult situation.
Do not forget that this was a recognition by the department
and by the government, that a nil assessment was not something that the taxpayer should be continually faced with.
There should be a determination. They tried to stultify the
Supreme Court of Canada judgment but, in our opinion, they
did not do a good job.
Senator Forsey: If I may be allowed, honourable senator, I
think I understood all that. But what I am trying to get at is,

February 24, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

will the undertaking which has been given mean that the
taxpayer, in this difficult situation, will now have something
that is appealable, or will he still faced officially with nothing
but a nil assessment, plus a determination which the courts
will not recognize? I simply want to get that clear. Will he
now, under this undertaking, be able to take his case to the
courts if he has to?

The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?

Senator Hayden: The undertaking, in the first instance, was
on the matter of the interpretation that would be applied. The
interpretation that becomes effective right away, and the
public, generally, will be notified of it, brings it to an official
determination of losses.

JOINT COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING
ADJOURNMENTS OF THE SENATE

Senator Hayden: I beg your pardon?
Senator Forsey: Which will be recognized by the courts, will
it?

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Motion agreed to.
LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(i), I move:
That the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of
Parliament have power to sit during adjournments of the
Senate; and
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to
acquaint that House accordingly.
Motion agreed to.

Senator Hayden: Yes.
Senator Forsey: That's all I wanted to find out. Thank you.
Senator Hayden: At that stage it is an assessment.
Senator Forsey: That was my question.
My two comments are, first of all, in connection with, I
think it is, clause 42, the committee says, in effect, that this is
not to be regarded as a precedent. I am afraid I am not very
much impressed by that because I have too vivid a recollection
of the number of times that the Senate has amended a money
bill, and the House of Commons has accepted the amendment
always with the pious addendum that this is not to be drawn
into precedent, and it goes right on being done. It is in fact
regarded as a precedent and this addendum is "words and
breath and of no force to oblige a man at all," as Thomas
Hobbes said.
My other comment is on clause 75. I am very sorry to find
the committee backed water on this, and I must confess the
inducement which was given them to back water startles me,
because it appears to be merely an undertaking by the minister
to produce some information before some day or other in 1979,
which seems to me rather a long way off. Had I been a
member of the committee, I should have protested vigorously
against this. Had I even been able to attend this morning at
the meetings of the committee, which I was not because I was
presiding over another committee, I should have made my
protest simply as a non-member attending the sittings of the
committee. I regret very much that this improper use of the
social insurance number, as the committee itself earlier called
it, has been allowed to stand with merely this sop from the
minister, promising certain information roughly two years
hence. This seems to me altogether inadequate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a third time?
Senator Cook: Honourable senators, I move, with leave, that
this bill be placed on the Orders of the Day for third reading
later this day.

QUESTION PERIOD
TRANSPORTATION-NATIONAL SYMBOLS-QUESTIONS
ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I gave a commitment yesterday that I would provide some information with
respect to the Supreme Court ruling in response to an appeal
taken by the Province of Alberta in connection with Pacific
Western Airlines.
I will be quite brief. I can report to honourable senators that
legislation is presently being prepared which will deal with the
question of provincial control of regional airlines. I have been
advised by the office of the Minister of Transport that it is not
anticipated that the legislation under preparation will contain
any retroactive provisions.
I have been advised further that meetings have been held
between the President of Pacific Western Airlines and the
Minister of Transport, and assurances have been given that
Pacific Western Airlines believes in decentralization, and only
the head office will be relocated in Calgary. The rest of the
operation will remain in Vancouver.
There was a question posed by one honourable senator
yesterday regarding the payment of taxes. It is assumed that
Pacific Western Airlines will continue to pay taxes as it has in
the past.
* (1520)

Another question was asked as to whether other provincial
governments own, or have partial ownership in, regional air
carriers. I have received information that to the knowledge of
the government no other provincial government owns or controls or partially controls any regional air carrier in Canada at
the present time.
There was another question asked with respect to flags and
pins, and the availability of these items for distribution by
senators to residents of the regions which they represent. The
Secretary of State's office reports that up to this time honour-

SENATE DEBATES
able senators have not been eligible for these flags and pins
which have been made available in some quantities to members of the House of Commons. The department is not at
present in a position to fill orders for members of this and the
other chamber. However, there is a possibility that some may
be available for April 1 of this year.
Representations are going forward from my office to the
Secretary of State that members of Parliament who serve in
either the Senate or in the House of Commons should be
treated equally in this regard, and the suggestion is going
forward that additional funds be made available for the expansion and continuation of this program which I believe to be an
important one at this time.
I think honourable senators have articulated very well a
current attitude in the country-that the young people of
Canada should be encouraged to acquire these symbols and
wear them with pride, not only within the borders of Canada
but abroad as well.
I have been given assurances by the Secretary of State that
the entire question is being given sympathetic study, and it is
hoped that favourable action can be taken. I may say that
similar representations are being received by the Secretary of
State from members of the other place who believe that this
program of distribution of pins and symbols is of great value.
So there is a good deal of support for this program not only
here but in the other place.
Senator Forsey: If I may ask a supplementary question
arising out of what the Leader of the Government has just
said, in regard to the first point about the regional airlines, I
am much surprised to hear that the information he has
received is that no provincial government has any even partial
ownership of a regional airline, because I was under the strong
impression that one or more of the Atlantic province governments had some share in Eastern Provincial. I cannot recall
where I got that impression, but I was under that very strong
impression, and I wonder if, perhaps, I was completely mistaken or whether I may have some ground for it.
On the other point, I wonder if the Leader of the Government is aware that some years ago several of us-certainly I
myself, and some colleagues here tell me the same-received
these pins. I got an enormous bagful of them. I should think it
must have been easily 500, and I couldn't use all of them and I
returned some of them to the Secretary of State's office. But
we were certainly getting them then, unless I was very highly
favoured for some unknown, certainly very obscure, if not
completely unknown reason. I think we were all getting them.
I don't know whether other colleagues can confirm that
impression.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I recall that as well.
However, I understand that it was not during the current fiscal
year or the past fiscal year. I think that there was a distribution of pins under the direction of the previous Secretary of
State, and the distribution was confined only to pins. Other
symbols and devices were not included. What we may be
talking about is a new program which constitutes a resumption

February 24, 1977

of a previous one-one which I think was very successful. I
know it was very popular with the young people in my home
area.
As to the honourable senator's comment with respect to
ownership or partial ownership by provincial governments of
regional air carriers, I think a number of us had heard a report
similar to that mentioned by the honourable senator. However,
I can only say that I have given the official response which I
received from the Ministry of Transport. The exact words
which appear in this memorandum are:
Inquiries indicate that no other provincial government
owns a piece of any regional air carrier.
I can only say that I shall pursue the question further to
ascertain whether or not there is some other kind of provincial
government involvement in a regional air carrier in other parts
of Canada.
Senator Cook: My impression is that the Newfoundland
government is a bondholder, but not a shareholder, of Eastern
Provincial.
Senator Grosart: Perhaps I might suggest to the Leader of
the Government that the author of the memorandum might
define what he means by "a piece of."
Senator Perrault: I have requested that a fuller statement
with respect to ownership of regional air carriers be made
available for presentation to the Senate, and I have not yet
received it. I think this is a very important question, and I can
only say that the request has gone forward, but the answer has
not been prepared in its totality. The honourable senator has
asked a good question.

Bill S-3, to amend the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act and the Foreign Insurance Companies Act.

February 24, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill to amend the
legislation governing the activities of federally incorporated
insurance companies and companies from outside Canada
doing business here. The legislation applicable to Canadian
companies and British companies is in the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act, and the legislation applicable to other foreign companies is in the Foreign Insurance
Companies Act. The requirements applicable to foreign companies are as nearly as possible identical with those applicable
to British companies. In other words, British companies do not
get more favourable or different treatment than other foreign
companies. Apparently the reason for adopting two acts was a
1931 Privy Council decision that declared ultra vires certain
provisions of the insurance act then in force. It was felt that it
would strengthen the constitutional base of the federal legislation relating to non-Canadian companies if there were two
acts, although why that should be so is not very clear.
The bill is really divided into three parts. The first part
applies to Canadian companies; the second part applies to
British companies; and the third part applies to foreign
companies.
With one or two exceptions the amendments applicable to
British companies and to foreign companies are a repetition,
with appropriate changes in wording, of the amendments
proposed with respect to Canadan companies. My main comments, therefore, will refer to the amendments applicable to
Canadian companies. These are found in the first 17 clauses of
the bill; that is, up to page 26. Pages 26 to 40 repeat these with
respect to British companies, and the remainder of the bill
from page 40 on deals with foreign companies.
The principal purpose of the amendments is to change the
statutory rules concerning the calculation of the actuarial
reserves which companies are required to hold with respect to
outstanding policies, and the rules concerning the valuation of
assets. These changes are being put forward as a consequence
of intensive study of the whole field of financial reporting for
insurance companies. These studies have been going on in
recent years in the United States and Canada in the accounting profession, in the actuarial profession and in the insurance
industry itself.
Insurance supervisors in this country and in the United
States have also taken an active part in the discussions. The
broad object of the study is to improve the financial reporting
of insurance companies and, generally, to bring such reporting
more into line with generally accepted accounting principles
that are applied to other kinds of corporations.
At this point I can explain what is meant by referring to the
question of how acquisition costs of writing a life insurance
policy should be treated. These acquisition costs include
agents' commissions and other expenses which can, in total, be
more than 100 per cent of the first year's premium. It would
not be unusual if these totalled 150 per cent. In other words, it
could cost a company $150 for every $100 of first year
premiums to write a new policy. Instead of charging the whole
$150 off against income in the year the cost is incurred, it was
desired to charge it off over a five-year period, because this

would then give a more realistic picture of whether a company
was losing or making money.
I might explain that at one time I was a director of a life
insurance company that was starting up in business. In effect,
we kept two statements of account. One we published, which
contained the official statements showing all of the expenses
written off in the first year. This showed a substantial loss in
each year, which resulted in a reduction in the surplus of the
company-what was known as "surplus strain." But so long as
the company had sufficient capital it could keep on writing
new policies even though at a loss. But then the directors were
presented with another statement which showed that, rather
than losing money, we were actually making money because,
for our own private consumption, we would charge these costs
off over a five-year period. So for every $100 in the first year,
instead of charging $150 of the costs, we would charge only
$30.
Now, the security analysts in the investment community
were doing exactly the same thing as the directors of the
company were doing, and, in effect, what this bill proposes is
that, under the control of the Superintendent of Insurance,
companies will be able to defer these acquisition costs more
realistically, and the officially published financial statements
showing the profit and loss will be more in accord with the
facts than they have in the past.
The amendments proposed in this bill will give the necessary
statutory authority to modify financial reporting requirements
to make considerable progress towards this end, although it is
recognized that because of the particular nature of insurance
companies and insurance company liabilities it is probably not
possible or desirable to try to fit them into exactly the same
mould as would apply to other types of corporations.
Concerning the calculation of actuarial reserves, the broad
intent is to give more scope to the actuary responsible for the
valuation to choose appropriate valuation bases and methods,
but without abandoning all supervisory control. The amendments propose a minimum reserve method, but will enable the
company to use any method that produces higher reserves.
However, in order to make it possible to compare one company
with another, and to interpret income accounts more accurately, companies will be required to reveal not only the reserves
actually shown in the balance sheet but also the reserves
computed on the basis described in the act and the reserves on
the net level premium basis. An actuarial report will be
required in which the actuary will be expected to state that, in
his opinion, the bases chosen are appropriate and the reserves
make good and sufficient provision for the liabilities.
Concerning the valuation of assets, special rules are
required, since the valuation of assets is linked, in an insurance
company operation, to the valuation of liabilities that they
have assumed under the policies.
I believe I should explain this briefly. This is a highly
technical subject, but I can use one illustration with respect to
life insurance companies. If premiums are paid by a certain
age group whose life expectancy is 20 years, and if the life

SENATE DEBATES
insurance company invested that part of the premiums
required to start establishing the reserve to meet the obligations 20 years from now in bonds maturing in 20 years, then it
does not really matter whether the bond goes down in market
value one year from now, because ordinarily the life insurance
company has no need to sell that bond during the 20-year
period before it matures. However, while the life expectancy of
those people in that age group is 20 years, that is an average
only. Some will die before the 20 years are up, and some of the
bonds might have to be sold at less than their face value, if the
market for bonds happens to be down at that time. Furthermore, there can be a default in some of the bonds.
It is proposed that the assets be valued at their book value
less an investment valuation reserve to be fixed by regulation,
which would be designed to provide some safeguard against
the two main risks, namely, loss from having to dispose of
assets before maturity to meet liquidity needs and loss by
reason of default.
These rules would make the valuation of assets of an
insurance company somewhat less sensitive to changes in the
market value than is presently the case, and it would permit
the use of values that are consistent with the valuation of their
obligations contained in their policies.
Much technical discussion is continuing among accountants
and actuaries on the general question of the valuation of assets
in relation to particular bases chosen for the valuation of
liabilities assumed by insurers in their policies. It is likely that
new developments will be occurring from time to time in this
field and, as a consequence, it seems appropriate to establish
the investment valuation reserve by regulation. However, I
would suggest that it would be appropriate for the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce to
request detailed information as to what these regulations will
eventually contain.
a

(1540)

The bill also proposes certain changes in the minimum
capital and surplus requirements that are now prescribed for
property and casualty insurance companies. The changes will
reduce somewhat the capital and surplus requirements where
this can be safely donc. The consequence will be a greater
ability of the existing insurance companies to serve the
Canadian market.
Certain changes are proposed with respect to investment
powers of insurance companies. Companies will have somewhat broader powers to invest in real estate than at present,
and will be able to invest jointly with any other corporation.
The maximum limits on single parcels of real estate will be
raised, and companies will be permitted to invest up to modest
limits in real estate that is not at the time of investment
improved or in the process of being improved. Companies will
be permitted to invest up to 7 per cent of their assets in
income-producing real estate that does not qualify on the basis
of being leased to a substantial corporation or on the basis of

February 24, 1977

having a three-year earnings record. Certain other changes
will make some technical modifications in the tests of eligibility for debentures and common shares. The maximum limit on
investments in common shares would be increased for property
and casualty companies that have more than the minimum
required capital and surplus.
The bill also proposes a modification in the definition of
"British company" in order to make it possible to register
Lloyd's under federal insurance legislation. Because of the
special nature of Lloyd's, it may be necessary to modify
somewhat the requirements that would otherwise apply, and
the bill proposes to give the Superintendent of Insurance
authority to work out appropriate arrangements with Lloyd's,
all within the general requirement of maintaining assets in
Canada sufficient to cover liabilities in Canada.
A further change with respect to investments would limit
companies' power to invest in government securities to securitics of Canada, any province of Canada, or the government
securities of any country in which the company is doing
business. This is somewhat more restrictive than at present
since the legislation now contains a list of countries whose
government bonds are eligible investments.
With the introduction some years ago of the power to invest
up to 7 per cent of assets in any securities not otherwise
specifically authorized, often referred to as the "basket" provision, there is no need to continue to designate the government
bonds of other countries as eligible investments.
The bill contains a number of other changes of lesser
importance. Companies, both life insurance and property and
casualty insurance, would be given the power to conduct
business ancillary to the insurance business. At present, life
insurance companies can do this through a subsidiary but not
directly. Examples of the types of ancillary business now
carried on by life insurance companies are computer services
and investment counselling. There are tax difficulties for life
insurance companies carrying on business through subsidiary
companies because, unlike other companies, they cannot move
profits from the subsidiary to the parent by way of dividends
that are tax free. Property and casualty insurance companies
would also be given the power to own subsidiaries to carry on
an ancillary business as well as being able to do it directly.
The requirements concerning audit would be modified
slightly to improve the wording, and also to make it clear that
an auditor may accept the actuarial reserves as certified by the
valuation actuary. Some clarification is proposed concerning
the deposit of assets out of Canada in order to give more
control to the supervisory authorities, and a provision is included to confirm and clarify the power of life insurance companies to transact accident and sickness insurance. Companies
would be given power to divide the capital stock into classes of

SENATE DEBATES

February 24, 1977

shares. At present, the act contemplates only one class of
shares. This would permit companies to raise additional capital
by way of the issuance of preferred shares.
As mentioned earlier, the changes proposed for British and
foreign companies are similar to those proposed for Canadian
companies, where applicable. These companies are now
required to maintain assets in Canada to cover their liabilities
here. The proposals, however, will slightly strengthen this
requirement by specifying that the companies must maintain
assets to cover not only the basic liabilities but also some
margin equal to that required of Canadian companies. Authority is sought to permit the Superintendent to accept letters of
credit from Canadian banks as part of the provision to cover
liabilities in Canada, subject to maximum limits. This would
be used only for special circumstances.
British and foreign companies are now required to maintain
assets in Canada to cover their liabilities, and the assets must
be essentially Canadian assets. However, they may at present
deposit securities of their home governments as part of the
assets in Canada to cover the liabilities. The bill proposes that
deposit of home government securities be permitted only with
the consent of the Superintendent of Insurance. It is considered desirable to exercise some control over this power in
order to prevent a foreign company from using this authority
to deposit its home government securities for more than temporary or special circumstances.
In conclusion, honourable senators, this is a highly technical
bill that lends itself much more to detailed discussion in
committee than in this house. That is why I have not attempted to go into more detail at this time.
On motion of Senator Grosart, for Senator Flynn, debate
adjourned.

THE LATE HONOURABLE CLARENCE JOSEPH
VENIOT
TRIBUTES

Senator Burchill: Hanourable senators, 1 rise ta pay tribute
ta a former member of tbis bouse wbo passed away in Bathurst, New Brunswick, yesterday. 1 refer ta tbe late Senator
Clarence J. Veniot, wbo was one of a graup of Il senatars wbo
were swarn in an April 4, 1945. He came ta the Senate from
the House of Communs. 1 believe tbat ten members of tbe
group of 1l have naw passed an, and 1 arn the last.
1 arn sure therc are those in this cbamber tonight wba

SENATE DEBATES
man who made a distinguished contribution to this country as
a member of this house. He was the son of the late Peter
Veniot, who at one time was Premier of the Province of New
Brunswick and who afterwards became Postmaster General.
Senator Veniot and I were for many years warm friends,
and I had the highest possible respect for him. He made a
valuable contribution to the public life of New Brunswick as
well as that of Canada, but the foremost dedication of his
heart and soul was to the medical profession. He will be
remembered affectionately by the people of Bathurst and
Gloucester County, where he lived, for his distinguished service to wide circle of patients whom he served for many years.
My wife joins me in extending sympathy to Senator Veniot's
family.
Senator Riley: Honourable senators, I too should like to pay
tribute to the late Senator Clarence Veniot. When I first came
to Ottawa in 1949 at the age of 33 he was my neighbour in the
London Arms on Metcalfe Street. I also knew him as the son
of the late Peter Veniot, Premier of the Province of New
Brunswick and subsequently Postmaster General of Canada. I
had a very warm affection for him, and I join with Senator
Burchill in extending to Senator Veniot's family the deepest
sympathy that one can express to the family of this Acadian
senator who, when he retired from the Senate a good many
years ago, left behind him the great Senator Burchill.

CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
DOCUMENTARY PROGRAM-QU ESTIONS ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, on December 16 of
1976 the Honourable Senator NorrieSenator Flynn: What date did you say?
Senator Perrault: December 16, 1976. The
Senator Norrie asked a long and detailed question
to a CBC documentary program. The question
length that it obviously required a substantial
research on the part of corporation officiaIs.

Honourable
with respect
was of such
amount of

Senator Flynn: And a long reply.
Senator Perrault: The essence of the question is:
1. What was the total cost of production of this The
Fifth Est ate film on MeCain Foods?
2. What is the breakdown of costs, in dollar terms, of
the use of film and cameras?
(a) How many boums were spent to make the video tape
as shown?

SENATE DEBATES
(b) How many hours were spent to obtain the audio
tape to produce this 40-minute documentary?
And so on. I shall not repeat the entire question.
The answer that has been provided by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to the Honourable the Secretary of State
of Canada is as follows:
Parliament has not, as a matter of custom since the
Corporation's creation in 1936, required CBC to supply, in
answering Parliamentary questions, certain details of its
internal management and administration. Parliament has
had two reasons for following this custom: first, the
independence of the CBC as a Crown Corporation, established for the purpose of producing and broadcasting,
independently of political or commercial interference,
programs for a national program service; and secondly,
the competitive nature of many of CBC's activities. The
appropriateness of the CBC providing certain categories
of information has been considered on many occasions by
various Parliamentary Committees and when the CBC
has suggested that such information should not be made a
matter of public record, its views have been accepted by
them. The names of employees and their functions in
relation to specific programs, their salaries or expenses,
the costs of individual programs, or business arrangements are examples of details which it has not been
customary to require the CBC to supply. It is open to
Parliament and its appropriate Committees to discuss the
policies it and the CBC have followed in this regard.
That really does not provide the honourable senator with
much detailed information.
Question 2 reads as follows:
2. What is the breakdown of costs, in dollar terms, of
the use of film and cameras?
The reply merely states:
See reply to part 1 above.
Section (a) of question 2 is:
(a) How many hours were spent to make the video tape
as shown?
The answer is:
(a) Because some CBC staff members, freelance and
contract employees were also engaged on other segments of the program, and the way in which time
records are maintained, it is not possibe to separate out
the number of hours spent exclusively on Citizen
McCain.
The reply to question 2(b)-and I want to be as helpful as
possible here, without going into exhaustive detail about the
original questionSenator Smith (Colchester): You are doing fine so far.
Senator Perrault: I am sure honourable senators understand
that this information was provided to me.
Section (b) of the second question is:

March 8, 1977

(b) How many hours were spent to obtain the audio
tape to produce this 40-minute documentary?
The answer is:
(b) Recording and editing of the audio portion is
simultaneous with the video portion.
Section (c) is:
(c) How many feet of tape were taken but not used?
The reply is:
(c) In CBC programs in general, the ratio of film
usage, i.e., the amount of film shot compared with the
amount used, is between 5:1 and 8:1. However, in
major film documentaries and in programs of investigative reporting such as The Fifth Estate, the average
ration is between 15:1 and 20:1. Most of the Fifth
Estate items, including Citizen McCain, have fallen
within this range.
Question 5 is:
5. How many people were interviewed in total for the
show? Specifically,
(a) How many farmers were interviewed?
(b) How many employees of McCain Foods or associated or affiliated companies were interviewed?
The answer is:
(a) Three present or former potato farmers appeared
and were identified.
Senator Norrie: That is a lie.
Senator Perrault: The reply continues:
(b) Two present or former McCain employees appeared
and were identified.
Question 6 is as follows:
6. With respect to the opening of the new McCain plant
in England,
(a) How many employees of CBC went to England to
see the opening?
(b) What was the total cost involved?
(c) What were the hotel expenses in total?
(d) What was the bus fare in total?
(e) What were the taxi fares in total?
The reply to this question is that no CBC staff members
went to England for the opening of that plant, and one
contract employee did go.
The reply to sections (b), (c), (d), (e), of this question is as
follows:
See reply to part 1 above.
Question 7 is:
7. Did all or any of the employees of CBC go first class
by airplane?
The CBC simply states: "No.".
Senator Norrie: Honourable senators, I must tell the leader
of the Government that I am very reluctant to accept such an
answer, and I feel that the public is not going to accept it

either. 1 have had numerous letters from different people, flot
including McCain's, asking for the report of the CBC concerning this matter. It is going to cause a great deal of trouble if 1
report that. 1 arn very reluctant to accept such a misleading
reply.
*(2020)

Senator Perrault: 1 can only say that this is the information
provided by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to the
Honourable the Secretary of State. There is always the opportunity, of course, at an appropriate time, to ask any crown
corporation about its spending and operational policies. Perhaps the honourable senator may wish to avail herself of that
opportunity at that appropriate time. If, in the meantime,
there are other questions the honourable senator wishes to ask,
1 shall certainly seek to obtain replies of some kind.
Senator Norrie: Thank you. That will be fine.
Senator Smnith (Colchester): 1 wonder if the Leader of the
Government would kindly note that there are other members
of this chamber who feel very much as Senator Norrie does.
Will he also note that it might be useful to convey to the CBC
that if they need to provoke anybody any more this type of
answer would be an excellent way to succeed in doing so?
Senator Forsey: I had a similar runaround some time ago
with the CBC, and I was subsequently given to understand
that the matter of this kind of non-answer was going to be
carefully considered. But that appears to have vanîshed into
thin air.
Senator Hicks: Just to show that there is no political bias in
this situation, because my honourable friend Senator Smith
(Colchester) and I have quarrelledSenator Asselin: Oh!
Senator Hicks: Why don't you wait to hear what I arn
saying?
Senator Flynn: You should have said it at the end.
Senator Hicks: Why don't you wait until you hear what I
arn saying?
My honourable friend Senator Smith and 1 have quarrelled
many times in the legisiature and other places, but I agree
with him one hundred per cent on this occasion. 1 think it is an
affront to Parliament and to this house of Parliament for the
CBC to be permitted to make a response lîke that to a
question. I personally wiIl vote against their appropriation. The
CBC is having some difficult times, perhaps, in more important areas than that of the McCain question in New Brunswick, but I think this is the kind of high-handed attitude with
which Parliament should not put up, and I amn distressed at the
kind of reply we have had this evening.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: I would ask the Leader of the Government if
he is happy with the answers he has had to provide to Senator
Norrie and others.

possible for the CBC, on this occasion, to provide us with
greater detail. If honourable senators believe there is menit to
this, I shaîl undertake to convey to the Honourable the Secretary of State, for the information of corporation officiais, the
sentiments expressed here this evening.
SALARY 0F FORMER CBC EMPLOYEE-QUESTION

Senator Riley: Honourable senators, following the answer
just given and the subsequent questions asked, I should like to
ask the Leader of the Government if it is true that a present
member of the Péquiste government in Quebec, who was an
avowed separatist before she was elected as a Péquiste
member, was earning much more money than the President of
the CBC before she ran as a Péquiste candidate?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have no knowledge
regarding the salary scale paid by the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. As honourable senators are aware, there is the
possibility that the Canadian Radio and Television Commission may be inquiring into certain aspects of the CBC.
Senator Riley: As a supplementary question, I would ask the
Leader of the Government if he is aware that the particular
person I refer to, a female, who is at present a member of the
Péquiste government, has stated publicly that she earned much
more than the President of the CBC?
Senator Asselin: You are out of order. Ask a question.
Senator Riley: It is a question. I asked if the leader of the
Government is aware of that.
Senator Asselin: You are seeking information.
Senator Riley: I arn asking the Leader of the Government if
he is aware that that happened.
Senator Asselin: That is not a question.
Senator Riley: Did it happen?
Senator Perrault: I arn not aware of any such information,
and I do not want to indulge in the pursuit of any rumours or
fragmented reports that may be brought to the chamber. I do
not think this is the proper place to do tha.
Senator Riley: Honourable senators, I make this a question,
which I ask of the Leader of the Government. It it true that a
present member of the Péquiste goverfiment in Quebec was
earning more money than the President of the CBC when she
was an employee of the CBC and an avowed separatist?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I can only take the
question as notice. 1 shaîl endeavour to obtain a reply from the
Secretary of State.

house. That is why I have not attempted to go into more
detail at this time.
I agree with Senator Godfrey entirely. As he explained, the
bill has to do with problems of a uniform system of valuation
of assets and liabilities of insurance companies and the bringing in of changes to parallel the provisions for British and
foreign companies.
The legislation has also in view a new system of valuation of
assets more in line with generally accepted accounting principles in the balance sheets of those companies. It would also
give property and casualty insurance firms more latitude in
reducing in some circumstances the minimum capital and
surplus required to be held in reserve in relation to certain
companies' liabilities.
This is all very complicated stuff-that is quite obvious to
everyone-and I think it is more for a committee to deal with
this question in detail than for the Senate as a whole.
* (2030)

I was interested in Senator Godfrey's remarks as to why we
have two separate acts at the federal level respecting insurance
companies coming under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent
of Insurance.
Bill S-3 would amend two acts, the Canadian and British

SENATE DEBATES

operating in Canada, which are chapters 1-15 and 1-16 respectively of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970.
Those acts would make interesting reading for honourable
senators who are interested in the question of which authority
has jurisdiction over the insurance business in Canada. To
begin with, both acts contain seven "whereas" clauses. As you
know, "whereas" clauses do not often appear in bills which
come before Parliament. In addition, each act contains a
declaration, as follows:
It is hereby declared that this Act has been passed with
the object and intent of prescribing the status and powers
of insurance companies incorporated by the Parliament of
Canada,
And there is no problem in that respect.
-or by the Legislature of the former Province of CanadaThat refers to the period prior to Confederation.
-the limitations thereof and the conditions on which
such companies and British insurance companies and
associations may be registered for the purpose of transacting the business of insurance in Canada;
In Canada generally, not in a given province.
-of providing for the voluntary registration of provincial
companies; of determining the conditions upon which all
such companies shall be deemed to be insolvent, and of
preventing any such companies that are insolvent, from
commencing or continuing to transact the business of
insurance in Canada; and if any provision of this Act
should hereafter be determined to have any operation or
effect beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada to authorize and sanction, and to be in
that respect void and inoperative, it shall, in such respect,
be treated as severable from the other provisions of this
Act, and such other provisions continue to have full force
and effect according to their tenor.
I think it is worthwhile having that declaration on the record
as it indicates the attitude of the Parliament of Canada in this
respect some 45 years ago. Things have changed greatly, but it
does indicate the complexity of the situation.
As far as the practical problem is concerned, the bill before
us has only one purpose, that being to update the system of
evaluation of assets and the definition of the type of balance
sheet a company should prepare, and protection, of course, of
the policyholders, all of which can be much more thoroughly
dealt with in committee.
There is, of course, nothing that we can oppose in the bill
itself, especially if we obtain the information required in
committee.
One wonders, however, whether it is not time to have a
complete reform of the federal legislation pertaining to insurance. It is my view that we should have one act covering
insurance, not two. The two acts were proclaimed as a precaution in light of the decision of the Privy Council some 45 years
ago. The years have now clarified the situation. Perhaps in the

not too distant future the legislation in this area can be
updated in the manner h have suggested.
Hon. John M. Godfrey: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I wish to inform the Senate that if
the Honourable Senator Godfrey speaks now, his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate on the motion for the
second reading of this bill.
Senator Walker: Honourable senators, I wonder if I might
make a comment before Senator Godfrey closes the debate. I
have gone over this bill carefully and I intended going into
some detail on it. I want to compliment Senator Godfrey on
his explanation of the bill. He is a greater authority on this
proposed legislation than he is on sports. To my mind, he made
a great contribution to the Senate in being as explicit and clear
as he was in explaining this bill.
Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, I think the only
thing I need comment on in Senator Flynn's remarks is his last
observation. I entirely agree with him that it is time for a
complete overhaul of federal legislation covering the insurance
business in Canada. It was the hope of the Superintendent of
Insurance that a bill could be brought down for the purpose of
consolidating the two present acts. However, given the present
workload of the drafting section of the Department of Justice,
there would be quite a delay in bringing forward such a bill.
For that reason it was decided to go ahead with this interim
measure. I agree completely with Senator Flynn, as does the
Superintendent of Insurance and, I believe, the government
that all insurance companies should now come under one act.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?

LABOUR RELATIONS
EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMY-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Marchand, P.C., calling the attention of the
Senate to certain fundamental problems which preoccupy
Canadians, namely, problems of labour relations in the
country and certain related problems of economic
order.- (HonourableSenator Petten).
Hon. Paul Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, it is my
understanding that I may speak tonight instead of Senator
Petten.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Desruisseaux: I compliment our new colleague, the
Honourable Jean Marchand, for calling the attention of the
Senate to certain fundamental problems which preoccupy
Canadians. His recent vibrant maiden speech in the Senate
was timely, particularly with regard to some of the major
problems that we Canadians are presently facing. In my
opinion, his reasoning and common-sense comments, regardless of the reaction it provoked in some quarters, will help clear
some of the foggy political atmosphere we are now
experiencing.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, the contribution of Senator Marchand
here is therefore important.
First may I say that, for me, the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation has the noblest mission to fulfill among our crown
corporations, the one which at the same time involves considerable and serious responsibilities and provides the most satisfactory consolations. The CBC has the transcendent mission to
promote the qualities and nobleness of our nation and to
defend it against unfair attacks and subversive movements. It
is CBC's duty to participate at all times in the development of
a young nation evolved from two great and noble main lines of
ancestors, both of which seek, each in its own way, to ensure a
glorious future for their members.
Ail honourable senators recognize the serious, important
and often transcendent part each and every member of this
corporation is called upon to play in our midst.
When a number of people in command positions within such
a corporation are accused of trying to rock the boat and
jeopardize everything with a sustained and biased propaganda,
aimed at fostering the personal interest of a questionable
group of people, the Senate has the right-perhaps i should
say the duty-to find out what is wrong, to investigate or order
an investigation to identify what is unfair, biased or false and
which might be broadcast with often unhappy and irreparable
consequences. Such an investigation would also serve to clear
the reputation of all law-abiding members of the corporation
who have the right to be considered as such. This is no plot.
The CRTC is the body which has been appointed to carry out
this examination of the programs and to set them straight,
should the need arise, all of this in accordance with the aim
and objectives provided for under the act governing that
corporation.
Besides, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation never had
the mission to destroy our national unity or to divide us. On
the contrary, its lofty mission has been and remains to unify
us. The CBC has to comply with the objective and the goals
set by Parliament in its incorporation act. It would thus
become unforgivable that a Parliament let a crown corporation
develop to act against its objective and goals because of some
objectionable and unauthorized propaganda by some people in
strategic positions. It would become even more unforgivable
that those who have the responsibility to ensure compliance
with the incorporation act showed indifference.

March 8, 1977

A good number of Canadians who listen to the crown
corporation programs charge it of having failed to comply with
the objective and goals set in its incorporation act. This would
never have been tolerated in communication companies of
other countries. And it should not be tolerated here in Canada,
since too much is at stake, particularly now.
Before Confederation, the association of two territories to
make up one Canada did not have the expected success. At
that time in our history, we had insubordination, rebellion and
too often bloodshed, and ail that needlessly.
The establishment in 1867 of a large federal state, of a
Canadian Confederation, remains our best achievement and
our best historic performance. In spite of the shortcomings
attributed to the system, our Confederation remains, with that
of West Germany, the outstanding model for confederal states
in today's worid, and the best government structure around.
Our Confederation remains as well a good example of success
during the last century. Though imperfect, the Canadian
Confederation may again, with some other changes, serve us
efficiently and constructively in the future. It may allow us to
continue our upward course, and perhaps improve on what we
have done for more than a century. That is what i feel it is our
duty to seek with ail the minds we have. That is in my opinion
the key, the solution to a good number of our problems.
Canada is big, beautiful and prosperous in spite of its
troubled history and its endless constitutional debates. Seconded by its provinces, although imperfect, it is strong and
capable of achievements for the betterment of all its members.
Canada can pursue great national objectives which clevate
each of its members. With the cooperation of ail its members,
Canada can find readily acceptable solutions to all our present
problems. It is not necessary for Canada to sacrifice prestigious positions which put it among the first nations of the
world in economic endeavours. It must not overlook its role in
the world because of disputes which intelligent people can
always settle and which they normally settle.
During the last two decades, we often heard answers to the
question put to Quebecers: "What does Quebec want?"
As we must know and seriously analyse their answers and as
they are very confused, i took the liberty of drafting a list of
those which seem most authoritative, with a view to making an
objective assessment.
In the preamble to his book Égalité ou Indépendance published in 1965, the then Premier of Quebec, Daniel Johnson,
made the following comments:
What is important is to determine what are the powers
essential to the assertion of the French Canadian nation.
Both for nations and individuals, there are basic liberties
which cannot be begged for and which cannot be the
subject of any compromise or any tricky dealing.
The right to self-determination for the French Canadian
nation is one of them.
What we want is more powers than those prescribed in
the Constitution of 1867.

March 8,

1977

SENATE DEBATES

What we want is the right to decide for ourselves or to
take an equal part in the decisions made in all the aspects
of our national life.
* (2050)

In his book, the late Daniel Johnson-asked the following
questions:
Are we truly masters in our own home when Ottawa
controls everything in the field of radio, television and the
media, which in this day and age are the most efficient
instruments of culture? When Ottawa refuses to protect,
with adequate tariffs, some products that are vital to the
French Canadiansand this is my own addition: for instance, the textile, the shoe
and glove industries, and generally, the secondary industries
which, in Quebec, give maximum employment in terms of the
value produced.
Here, I interrupt my quotation again to mention the GATT
agreements as a total failure, as far as the province of Quebec
is concerned; in the future, we should show more foresight,
wisdom, and protect the industries in the province. People do
not change their minds without reason.
And now, to go back to quoting Daniel Johnson:
When Ottawa could use immigration to change the technical balance to the point of our becoming the minority, in
the very state of Quebec?
When a decision of the Bank of Canada can affect the
credit of our businesses, our financial institutions and
even the state of Quebec?
When the federal treasury wants to reap the profits from
the development of natural resources that belong to the
Quebec people and, through corporate taxes, prevent us
from planning our economy, in terms of our own needs?
When through succession dutiesHe said this in 1965.
-the government can turn upside down the economy of
the Civil Code?
When nationalization is the only means left us to repatriate to Quebec the taxes levied on our primary industries?
When the Supreme Court, whose members are ail
appointed by Ottawa, is the ultimate interpreter of our
French law and the only court to which we can submit our
grievances against the federal government?
In addition, Quebec militant separatists wonder today why
no one realizes that the whole matter of the appointment of
lieutenant governors-and the governor general-must be
revised. Why should the judges of the superior courts of the
provinces still be appointed by the federal authority
nowadays?
About ten years ago, the present Premier of Quebec
expressed ail his philosophy on Quebec separatism in his book
Option Quebec. Today he reiterates the same philosophy to a
certain extent. This is also truc of Quebec demands concerning
the separation of the province. They have not changed to any
valuable extent for more than a decade.

471

Many formulas have also been proposed concerning our
joint rapprochement and progress. They did not meet Quebec
demands. Therefore none seemed valid or satisfactory. As
Canadians we have so far never been prepared to make aIl the
sacrifices required for the adoption of acceptable formulas.
A considerable number of experts from several of our provinces offered and are still offering somewhat magic solutions
which can be summed up to a certain extent as a larger
decentralization of powers without, I believe, considering the
possibility of ensuring balkanization nor, I believe, the lessons
of history.
It remains that aIl these efforts coming from people from
every walk of life should give us some hope and indicate that
no matter whether we are separatists, Conservatives, Liberals,
New Democrats or Social Crediters, we aIl want to find
formulas which are readily acceptable and viable and which
would enable us to progress together.
I am still convinced that the Quebec government as well as
the people's representatives, those in the party of René
Lévesque and in the minority parties, share this hope, even
though the solutions suggested seem rather extreme and hard
to accept under our concept of government in Canada, with a
view to maintaining a strong, stable and productive country
which we ail greatly need.
It is important that ail parties involved should seek together
formulas which will ensure that Canada will always act with
authority in international economic matters and cultural fields;
that is, a Canada that will grow stronger along with ail its
members. In this regard, we should promote much more large
conventions and meetings of ail kinds in ail spheres of activities which make true assessments possible and result in mutually acceptable agreements.
Within one hundred and ten years our country, in spite of its
tiny population and its modest economic means, has moved to
the front among world nations.
An intelligent review of our present positions will make it
truly possible for us to go much further in establishing, within
the framework of modern history, an even stronger Canada
capable of meeting the most demanding provincial ideals and
moving progressively up towards the fulfillment of the highest
economic and social objectives.
Such is my wish. I believe it is also our duty. It is the one
objective that together we will strive for to regain peace, unity
and full prosperity.

REGIONAL AIRLINES-EASTERN PROVINCIAL AIRLINESQUESTION ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, on February 24 the
Honourable Senator Forsey asked a question regarding regional airlines. He said:
... I am much surprised to hear... that no provincial
government has any even partial ownership of a regional
airline, because I was under the strong impression that
one or more of the Atlantic province governments had
some share in Eastern Provincial.
I have looked into the matter raised by Senator Forsey and I
have been informed that 52 per cent of the ownership of
Eastern Provincial Airlines is by individuals, with the remainder being owned by the public. A loan had been given to EPA
in 1975 through the Bank of Montreal, secured by a mortgage
in the amount of $2.1 million to be carried by the Government
of Newfoundland, but no ownership is involved.

NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL SESSION, WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA,
U.S.A.-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, February 1, the debate
on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator McElman calling
the attention of the Senate to the Twenty-second Annual
Session of the North Atlantic Assembly, held in Williamsburg,
Virginia, U.S.A., from 12th to 19th November, 1976, and in
particular to the discussions and proceedings of the Session
and the participation therein of the delegation from Canada.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, as this
is the first opportunity for some time for me to stand in my
place in this chamber and make a contribution to a debate, I
should like to take the opportunity of extending my congratulations to Madam Speaker for the admirable way in which she

SENATE DEBATES
has presided over the Senate for the last few years. Her duties
as Speaker, both in this chamber and outside, have been
performed with grace and charm. In my opinion her performance has proven to be a tremendous asset to this institution,
not only here but among the public and especially the Ottawa
community. It is a delight to see you in your present position,
Madam Speaker, and it is my hope that I will cause you little
concern on this or on future occasions.
I should also like to extend my congratulations to those
members of the Senate who were appointed since our last
session. Two of the gentlemen, Senator Ewasew and Senator
Rizzuto, are new names and new faces to me. I had never had
the opportunity of meeting either of them until they came to
the chamber. Our initial meeting was a joy to me and, i hope,
for them. Over the years, our acquaintanceship will grow, and
because of their presence the Senate will make a greater
contribution to the public life of Canada.
Senator Marchand, of course, did not need any introduction
to this chamber. He had certainly made his mark on the
Canadian community at large over the past several years by
his service in the other place. His maiden speech in this
chamber was a breath of fresh air. I enjoyed it; I welcomed it.
i knew he was capable of making such a contribution, and I
hope that he will continue to give us the benefit of his long
experience, his wit and his charm for many years to come.

Senator McDonald: You know, i used to be one myself, but

Honourable senators, it had been my intention to introduce
this inquiry at a much earlier date but that became impossible
because of other matters, and on December 14 our colleague,
Senator McElman, introduced the inquiry. During his comments he dealt with the participation of the Canadian delegation in the North Atlantic Assernbly's annual meeting at
Williamsburg. There is nothing that I can add to his contribution. As honourable senators are aware, Senator McElman
was the Senate's representative on the Economic Committee of
the North Atlantic Assembly, which is one of the more
important committees in that unless the economies of our
respective nations are strong we have no hope of fulfilling the
duties and responsibilities of the North Atlantic Assembly or
of NATO itself.
One of the main factors confronting the ability of NATO to
meet the threat from the Warsaw Pact stems from the weak
economic conditions which prevail in several member countries
of the North Atlantic Assembly. However, I believe that

SENATE DEBATES

Yuzyk made reference to the Helsinki Agreement. I believe all
of us were happy in that the conference was held in Helsinki.
Many Canadians were concerned as to the type of document
we were signing in Helsinki. Time has proven that those
concerns were well founded. The interpretation placed on that
agreement by the Western World is much different from that
of the Soviet Union and her satellites. Neither the Soviet
Union nor her satellites have lived up to our interpretation of
that agreement, not only in respect of human rights but also in
respect of the borders as they now exist in Europe. There is no
doubt that there are two distinct and different interpretations.
The Western World, in discussing détente with the Soviet
Union, is confronted with the question of whether the other
side is talking about the same thing and whether both sides
interpret documents in the same way.

•

(1420)

I suggest that it does not; I suggest that the interpretation
placed on such documents by the Soviet Union is vastly
different from that of the Western World. The Western World
must be even more careful in the future in entering into such
agreements where we have doubt as to the interpretation
placed by the other side. We have to bear in mind that the
Soviet Union is a nation whose word is worth nothing, but
whose power is enormous. History has proven that to be so,
and our actions in the future must be taken in the light of our
post-World War Il experiences.
Following Senator Yuzyk's contribution to this particular
subject matter, Senator Austin reported to the chamber on a
trip that he had made to Paris to represent Canada at a
conference of the Western European Union. I gathered from
his remarks that that was the first opportunity he had had to
attend such a conference as a parliamentarian, although he
had represented Canada at such conferences in his capacity as
a senior public servant. I was amazed at the knowledge be was
able to gather respecting the military and economic problems
that plague the North Atlantic Assembly and NATO in
general.
Honourable senators, I want to make a rather lengthy
speech, and for that I do not apologize. I am one of those who
believe that the existence of NATO and the North Atlantic
Assembly, the Western European Union, and other such
organizations, has been partially, perhaps largely, responsible
for the maintenance of peace in Europe for one of the longest
periods in history. I think such organizations are worth something, not only in Europe but to us. Without peace in Europe,
all of those matters which are referred to us on Parliament
Hill, or to any other governing institution in Canada, will be
meaningless. I am sure we will not be concerned about any
day-to-day problems or legislation that may come before this
chamber unless we have peace in the world.
However, we have three committees that want to hold
meetings this afternoon. Not only do they want to, but they

80003-32'h

have to. I think all of them have witnesses who have come to
Ottawa to appear before them. One of those committees has
permission to sit while the Senate is sitting, though, as I
understand it, the other two have not. In my view there will be
a more appropriate occasion on which I can conclude these
remarks. The committee meeting that I want to attend, the
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, will be hearing
representatives of the Government of New Brunswick, including the minister, and representatives of the Agriculture Institute of Canada, who want to make representations to us. It is
extremely important to hear these witnesses and we certainly
should not have them cooling their heels in the hall while I
make a speech on another subject in this chamber. Therefore,
honourable senators, with your permission I shall adjourn this
debate.
Senator Flynn: Seconded by Senator Argue!
Senator McDonald: I do not care whether somebody
seconds it or not, or even if nobody does. I am doing what I
think is right.
On motion of Senator McDonald, debated adjourned.

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, before the question
is put I should like to remind you that there are three
important Senate committee meetings this afternoon. When
the house adjourns, the Standing Committee on Agriculture
will meet in room 253-D to continue its inquiry into the
desirability of long-term stabilization in the Canadian beef

REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS

Senator Sparrow: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(e), I move:
That the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance be authorized to review the recommendations in
the Report on Canada Manpower of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance, appointed in the last
session of Parliament and authorized in that session to
examine in detail and report upon the Estimates of the
Manpower Division of the Department of Manpower and
Immigration for the fiscal year ended the 31st March,
1975, tabled in the Senate on 19th October, 1976.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave given, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Sparrow: By way of explanation, honourable senators, I should say that in its report on Canada Manpower your
committee states:
The government takes from a report what it wants, discards or ignores what it chooses, but there is no wayother than by inferring from analysis of any subsequent
changes in policy-of knowing what the government's
reactions to it have been and why. This diminishes the

value of the report, limits the opportunity of a committee
to learn on the job, and denies the Canadian public the
last and most important chapter of the study. To fill this
void, the committee will invite the Minister of Manpower
and Immigration to comment on this report and its
recommendations, and in particular to explain where and
for what reason he and the Manpower Division disagree
either by letter or preferably in a public hearing.
The report goes on to say that from time to time the committee will review the recommendations of its reports. It is to
accomplish this end that I make this motion today.
Motion agreed to.

LUMBER INDUSTRY
EFFECT OF TARIFF ON IMPORTATION OF SOFTWOOD
PLYWOOD-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Burchill calling the attention of the Senate to the
tariff on the importation of softwood plywood and the
serious effect it is having on the Canadian plywood industry.-(Honourable Senator Robichaud, P.C.).
Senator Robichaud: Stand.
Hon. Ann Elizabeth Bell: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might speak to this order if Senator Robichaud does not wish
to proceed at this time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Senator Robichaud: Yes.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Bell: Thank you, Senator Robichaud.
Honourable senators, when Senator Burchill brought to our
attention on December 2 last year the serious situation in
which the Canadian softwood plywood industry found itself,
we had come through an extremely serious time. Our plywood
producers at home were faced with a declining export market
and, at the same time, were competing with American exports
into Canada.
The present situation, as Senator Burchill explained so well,
is that we have a 15 per cent tariff against American plywood,
while they have a 20 per cent tariff against our plywood, and
with that 5 per cent tariff differential the American exporter is
able to ship into Canada and undersell our locally made
plywood.
What shocked and concerned me most were the figures we
were given showing that in a very short period of time the
Americans had increased their share of the market from 5 per
cent in 1973 to more than 18 per cent in 1974. That was a
tremendous jump in one year.

March 10, 1977

If we have a healthy plywood industry in Canada, we shal
have a healthy forestry industry in the whole country. One way
by which we can do something about this is ensuring that
while current negotiations are going on in Geneva with GATT
we at least retain our 15 per cent tariff and work towards
parity.
We used to have parity with the Americans but, for some
reason through the Kennedy Round negotiations, the Americans ernerged with a 20 per cent tariff and Canada with a 15
per cent tariff. That made it more difficult for our industry.
When I point out that British Columbia supplies more than
two-thirds of our total domestic production and also has a
large share of the export market, honourable senators can see
that this affects my province most seriously.
* (1420)

Why should we negotiate parity? I think the main reason is
that we are faced with several problems in the industry. We
started off with modern plywood plants, but they are now
having to be replaced. The United States has economies of
scale that we cannot possibly compete with. I think someone
said that three or four of the American plywood companies
can produce all of the softwood plywood that Canada needs, so
it is very important that we at least maintain the tariff that we
have.
One of the things we were told was that by the end of 1976
the Americans might have captured 30 per cent of our domestic market. There were, I think, two reasons for this, although
I would like to be corrected if I am wrong. With the devaluation of the Canadian dollar, American plywood was not quite
as attractive a buy for Canadians. It boosted up the price. The
other reason was that the American economic recovery last
year was stronger than had been forecast, so housing starts,
which are the indicators of how the plywood industry is going
to go, really picked up in the United States. The Americans
now are buying their own plywood production to the extent
that it is not necessary for American producers to export to
Canada and undersell our producers. This has given our
plywood industry a bit of a lease on life but if I am right, and
those are the two main reasons for our coming through without
being as badly damaged as we feared at the end of the year, I
do not think we should be complacent, since there are fundamental reasons why this industry still needs help.
One of the things I should like to offer for consideration is
that the plywood firms face higher taxes than their American
counterparts, and their labour costs are higher. In addition,
their production costs are higher because their aging mills are
not able to produce what the more modern plants, with more
modern tools, can produce. Transportation costs in the United
States do not form as high a proportion of total production
costs as they do in our country. In Canada transportation costs
form a really large proportion of the total.
Some of these difficulties can be overcome by the federal
government through legislation, but others will have to be
overcome by the industry itself. Perhaps the main thing we
should consider is how to improve our investment climate,
because if the plywood industry is going to be strengthened it

March 10, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

must be made more attractive to the investor. It has to look
better before people will invest in it. If you have improved
profits you are then able to raise capital to improve the plant,
which in turn gives you improved productivity, which brings
you back to improved profits. It is a sort of circle.
With respect to legislation in this regard we have to ask
ourselves: Is it going to improve the total investment picture in
Canada? How will it affect our forest industry and our
plywood industry? On the positive side, I think the Canadian
plywood industry, in spite of the problems I have outlined, has
a great deal in its favour, and certainly great potential. We
have the raw materials, of course, and these are well managed.
We are not running out of forests, but we have not gone nearly
as far as we can in reforestation in the way of putting in new
species and that type of thing. Our forests are a source of
perpetual yield if they are managed properly. The industry, I
think we would ail agree, is second to none in the world as far
as experience, expert knowledge and management are
concerned.
Canada's geographical position gives us an advantage with
respect to trading with the European Common Market, the
United Kingdom-which is where we ship most of our plywood and a great deal of our lumber to-and the Pacific Rim
countries. We are in a strategic position for shipping from both
sides of our country. Another thing in favour of this industry is
that, considering aIl the industrial funds spent in Canada, it is
one of the better performers with regard to research. Canadian
industry generally has not shown up very well against the
performance of some of the OECD countries, but the forestry
industry is not too badly off in that regard.
One of the things I would mention at this point is an
interesting development in wastewoôd chips-methanolwhich is being worked on right now as part of Canada's
development. If this works out, it will mean 40,000 new jobs
for Canadians, and save us $800 million a year on imports of
crude oil for gasoline, and so on. Apparently it is feasible in
Brazil. They have a pilot under way using sugar cane. We
think we can do that with forest wastes. We feel there is great
potential for this, if we get encouragement where it is needed.
Another thing to bear in mind is the importance of the
forest industry-plywood and lumber, and pulp and paper-as
a strong earner of foreign exchange for us. One of the things
that the federal government can do-and nobody else can do
it-is make sure the tariff situation is rectified. The federal
government recently lowered the mortgage interest rate so that
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation can encourage more residential housing starts, cooperative building, and
institutional and non-profit buildings. That is having a helpful
effect on the construction plywood industry. Several years
ago-l have forgotten the date-the Council of Forest Industries cooperated with the Department of Industry, Trade and
Commerce and set up demonstration projects in Japan to show
the Japanese that they could build with plywood. When the
Japanese change their building code we will have a great deal
more trade in that direction. That will be very good for the
industry.

Honourable senators, I do not think I need to go on at
length about this. I just wanted to mention a few points for
you to consider as to why an industry which is basically a free
trade industry-which the Canadian forestry industry isshould want an exception to tariffs on plywood. The British
Columbia forest industry would certainly support more liberalization of tariffs. They find tariffs an inhibiting factor in the
export of more finished products. Immediately you drill a hole
in a piece of moulding, for instance, you are into a tariff of
more than 18 per cent if you ship it to the United States. This
has been brought out very clearly in Senator van Roggen's
Foreign Affairs Committee by a witness for B. C. Forest
Products.
British .Columbia strongly supports more liberalization of
trade but-and here is the exception--only where Canada can
be competitive internationally. I hope I have made it clear that
where Canada cannot be competitive internationally is in
plywood. If our negotiators in Geneva make sure that we
retain the 15 per cent tariff, and work to get us back to parity,
where we used to be before the Kennedy Round-and we
should urge this upon them-I am sure that would be a very
helpful step for an industry with great potential.
*

(1430)

Senator Burchill: Honourable senators, may I ask Senator
Bell if in her research into this question she has been able to
discover the reason for the difference in the tariff, and why it
came about.
Senator Bell: Senator Burchill, I am glad you asked that
question, because since you spoke in December I have been
trying to find out. Just before I entered the chamber today I
was given the latest information on the matter. I was not
speaking to the person directly, but the message I was given
said, "In the case of plywood, even if I knew the exact answer
in this case, I would not be at liberty to say because of the
Officiai Secrets Act." This message came from someone who
was present at that time and had some responsibility for our
negotiations. I have not found the answer yet.
Senator van Roggen: Senator Bell, apart from a question I
have to ask you, might I say that my best information-this is
from my recollection of some time back-is that that five per
cent was gratuitously given away by Canada on the theory
that it would provide a lower cost for plywood in Canada, and
thus a slightly lower cost for housing in Canada. That was a
giveaway which is very difficult to justify in light of the
present state of the plywood industry in this country. It was a
gratuitous giveaway on a tariff item which would produce
interesting results if it were ever applied to the manufacturing
industry.
If I may, I should like to ask if you would not agree that
there is absolutely no justification whatsoever for Canadian
taxation policies, both federal and provincial, exacting a substantially higher level of taxation from the forestry industry
than from the manufacturing industries, in view of the fact
that the forestry industry in general takes almost ail of its
products to the furthest level of processing before they leave
this country, and also in view of the fact that the forestry

SENATE DEBATES
industry is seriously in need of capital for modernization and is
one of our biggest dollar earners.
Senator Bell: I agree with you one hundred per cent,
Senator van Roggen, but one of the problems is that this is a
resource industry and the province has every right to exact as
much revenue from it as it can. Until the provinces and the
federal government get together and see to it that the industry
is at least on a par with the manufacturing industry in terms of
taxation, this sad situation will remain. Like the mining industry, the forestry industry may be squeezed almost out of
existence if there is no cooperation.
Senator van Roggen: It will be the next healthy industry to
become unhealthy because of what can only be described as an
unfortunate lack of appreciation, by both provincial and federa] governments, of the worth to this country of our great
resource industries. I am sorry. That is not a question; it is a
statement.

AGRICULTURE
"KENT COUNTY CAN BE SAVED!"-A COMMITTEE STUDY INTO
AGRICULTURAL POTENTIAL OF EASTERN NEW BRUNSWICKDEBATE CONCLUDED

On the order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Argue calling the attention of the Senate to the
Report entitled: "Kent County Can be Saved", a study
into the agricultural potential of Eastern New Brunswick,
of the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, which
was appointed in the last session of Parliament and
authorized in that session, without special reference by
the Senate, to examine from time to time any aspect of
the agricultural industry in Canada, tabled in the Senate
on Tuesday, 16th November. 1976.-(HonourableSenator Michaud).
Senator Michaud: Honourable senators, I would ask that
Order No. I on the Orders of the Day for Tuesday, March 15,
1977, be brought forward and placed on the Orders of the Day
of this date.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
[Translation]
Hon. Hervé J. Michaud: Honourable senators, following
three years of in-depth study on this situation of agriculture in
eastern Canada, in the province of New Brunswick, and in
Kent County in particular, the Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture submitted its report entitled "Kent County Can
Be Saved!". That report was released on September 29 last, in
the morning in the Senate in the form of a press conference
presided over by Senator Argue, and in the afternoon in
Moncton in the presence of different groups concerned and
local media. I personally presided over the ceremony in Moncton, with Senator Margaret Norrie and Senator Michel Four-

nier (Restigouche-Gloucester) at my side. The results were
immediate, with requests for the report increasing day by day
from ail parts of the country. Of course, the province of New
Brunswick is the area where interest was highest. Governments, farming organizations, education centres were among
the many in the province anxious to get it.
Both national and local media also gave it a favourable
reception. Here is what the Moncton daily L'Evangéline wrote
about it on October 6, 1976:
The Senate of Canada does not have a good press these
days and several people awaited with skepticism the
famous Standing Senate Agriculture Committee report.
Well, those people had a nice surprise when they read the
report entitled "Kent County Can Be Saved!". That
Senate committee has just produced a valuable, interesting and very well documented report.
That report is original from several standpoints. First, it
does not fear to assess objectively both the weaknesses
and the good aspects of federal and provincial programs
to develop the county's primary resources. Second, after
outlining the seriousness of the situation the report
emphasizes the extraordinary potential of the area that
remains undeveloped. It points out, for example, that in
the eastern New Brunswick counties alone, that is
Gloucester, Westmorland, Kent, Northumberland and
Albert counties, there is a food market with an annual
value of $200 million which for a very large part has yet
to be claimed by the area's farmers. Third, the report
proposed as an overall solution the creation of a Kent
County Development Association made up of local people
to coordinate ail development efforts in the county. That
could ensure a better allocation of the high amounts of
money now being earmarked for the development of the
area.
There are other positive aspects. The report places
much importance on the human aspect in ail development
matters. A whole chapter deals with the history of the
county, its origins and the Acadian culture of the major
part of the county's population.
The Senate committee draws two clearcut conclusions:
Kent county has a very rich land, good for a large variety
of commercial production, and the market is there. But
producers should be given some organizational, financial
and technical help.
In short, this report should be seriously studied as it is a
bank of relevant information and makes a whole variety
of valuable suggestions~-

sions of the report recommendations. So, during this winter
many meetings were held to this end in the various farming
centres of the area.
In a letter sent to the committee chairman, Senator Argue,
on January 4, the chairman of FAFAM wrote:
Honourable senator:
First, the Fédération agricole de l'archidiocèse de
Moncton would like to thank you and all members of your
committee for the interest you have demonstrated in the
last three years for the situation of farming in southeastern New Brunswick and particularly in Kent county.
We also wish to commend you for the excellent report
"Kent County Can Be Saved!" that you published and
distributed a few months ago.
This report is now being studied by our federation. This
study consists in a series of meetings with farmers and
other interested people of the area where we discuss the
multiple recommendations of the report.
To date, there were three meetings, one in Buctouche,
one in Rogersville and the third in St-Louis de Kent and
two or three other meetings are scheduled. Among the
comments made during meetings, those which seem to
dominate by their number and by the urgency which they
expressed are, first, statements about their nearly total
lack of informed leadership among the agricultural population of the area; and second, expressions of belief in the
urgent need for a technical training program for present
operators, and especially in the need for agricultural
science courses to train replacements for present
operators.
Naturally, pessimism, frustration and other negative
attitudes always come up. Some people think "another
study that will bring no result", "a futile exercise", etc.
However, there now seems to be some hope that someone
is finally getting seriously interested in the future of
agriculture in Kent.
In any event, the leaders of our federation believe that
it would be unfortunate not to take advantage of this
opportunity to make the whole population of the area
aware of the many development possibilities raised by the
data and the recommendations contained in your report.

At St. Joseph de Memramcook, on January 25, the
same themes were brought up. Moreover the lack of
co-operation among producers was deplored and the sincerity and wisdom of governments in the development of
policies concerning food product imports and agricultural
grants and loans was questioned.
On February 8, we took part in a meeting of the Kent
county English-speaking agricultural federation. We then
gave a brief summary of our efforts since the publication
of your report and we noted during discussions that those
people have approximately the same reactions as the
members of our own federation. Indeed, the discussion
concerned mostly the lack of training, the need for cooperative structures and methods for production, marketing and the purchase of farm machinery.
These letters to the chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture clearly show that farm associations in
Kent County did a good job in piloting assiduously the study
of this report.
However it would be unrealistic to believe that everything is
certain and that the recommendations contained in the report
are now implemented. On the contrary, it is in this context
that the role of the federal and provincial Departments of
Agriculture is essential if we do not want their recommendations to be forgotten.
On the visit of the Senate Committee on Agriculture in
Moncton, in June 1973, L'Evangéline said the following:
0 (0440)

It is a good thing that a Senate committee should hold
public hearings to focus attention on a current issue.
What senators would like to achieve is now the responsibility of the federal and provincial governments. Even the
latter are not very concerned about the farmers' problems.
The consulting physician is coming, but the patient may
be dead already ... And the surgeon-that is the governments-does not realize yet how serious the case is ... It
is hoped that the senators' proceedings in New Brunswick
will be fruitful and will contribute to solve the problem.
It is now the responsibility of the federal and provincial
Departments of Agriculture to carry on with a job so well
started. The Kent farming community did its job in the first
place, so it is now for the governments to take action.

Zoël Arsenault, Secretary.
In another letter, dated February 10, the same association,
FAFAM, wrote the following:
Dear Senator:
In reference to our letter of January 4, we would first
like to give you a brief report on subsequent meetings.
At Cap-Pelé, on January 20, the farmers emphasized
the need for a strong organization of producers (marketing boards, etc.), for agricultural teaching at several levels
and for a demonstration and research farm.

[English|
Honourable senators, the concern for the future of agriculture in the rural areas of New Brunswick is what led the
Senate of Canada to establish an inquiry into agricultural
potential in New Brunswick and to the subsequent publication
of "Kent County Can Be Saved!"
In New Brunswick, and more precisely in Kent County, we
have what many consider to be the saddest story in the
continuing episode of rural deterioration in Canada. Not many
realize that the gross agricultural output in New Brunswick in
1976 was 20 per cent less than it was in 1939. All around the
world the demand for agricultural land keeps going up with

SENATE DEBATES
growing world pressure on the food supply. Land sells at $500
to $600 an acre in Alberta; at over $2,500 an acre in Iowa, and
at an even $100 an acre in Columbia, where annual farm
income is $500 to $700.
While this is happening, here in eastern Canada we have an
abundance of good agricultural land virtually being reclaimed
by the forest. If ever the need was there and the time was ripe
for agricultural development, it is now. And the place is New
Brunswick. Yet, in New Brunswick alone there is a deficit of
some 45 million pounds of beef annually, 27 million pounds of
pork, and two million pounds of lamb. The only products that
New Brunswick is self-sufficient in are potatoes, strawberries
and blueberries. This was not the case in 1939, nor need it be
the case today. But we have been told this before. It is not new.
But what is new is that it is later than we think. We can no
longer afford the luxury of waiting for tomorrow.
In "Kent County Can Be Saved!" we suggested that should
agricultural development be given high priorities in New
Brunswick, tremendous benefits could accrue to the economy.
If we are allowed to suggest that a possible goal might be
moving towards self-sufficiency for most commodities, our
calculations show not only a strengthening of the rural base
but a strengthening of the whole New Brunswick economy. If,
for example, Kent County were developed to its immediate
agricultural potential of some $12 million at the farm gate, the
economic impact of this production would be felt throughout
the region and the province, resulting in some $47 million in
economic activity generated as it made its way to your dinner
table. The resulting 2,700 jobs would return approximately $5
million by way of income tax to the governments annually.
How large the potential impact might be if all New Brunswick
agriculture was developed is not exactly known. However,
readily available figures suggest that a tripling of this $47
million figure might be reasonable as a short-term goal.
Such analysis also strongly supports a case for the development of the agribusiness sector-for feed and processing especially. A strong rural base and a strong market can ensure
long-term returns to business.
These are some of the findings our agriculture committee
has reached in the course of our many committee sittings. May
1, at this point, quote from editorials which appeared following
the publication of our committee's report.
From the Federicton Gleaner of October 1, 1976-"A Valuable Study":
It is a valuable study, but its value will decrease each
day the provincial and federal governments fail to take
action to implement its findings.
The arable land is here. We have people who want to
farm it. Yet we must import meat, vegetables and fruits in
tremendous amounts every year.
Even more interesting will be the response of the provincial and federal governments.
From the Moncton Times of October 5, 1976-"Act on the
Report":

March 10, 1977

New Brunswick's Kent County must be one of the most
studied parts of Canada. The latest examination of the
very real woes of this poor county is the report prepared
by the Senate Agriculture Committee.
There is far more in the report, but this is not the place
to repeat the shocking findings and the challenging
recommendations. Suffice to say that for once there is
apparently a change in approach, for which the Senate
committee is to be commended. It is in its committee
work that the Senate is frequently outstanding. In this
particular case, the Agriculture Committee carried out its
study and prepared its report and recommendations at the
request of Kent County farmers. The initiative shown by
the farmers and the hard work of the committee must not
be wasted.
Here is an unbiased report, compiled on request of
people who have had more than their share of hard time.
The federal and provincial governments ought to seize
the opportunity presented and make Kent the model for a
new deal.
Our Agriculture Committee feels confident that the recommendations embodied in the report, "Kent County Can be
Saved!", can be of great assistance in solving the major
problems affecting agriculture in eastern New Brunswick, and
in Kent County particularly. This feeling is also shared by the
local farming people. I have already read some of the letters to
that effect sent to our committee chairman, Senator Argue, by
the French-speaking agricultural association, FAFAM. A
letter from the English-speaking agricultural association of
that area, FARM, dated December 27, 1976, was also written
to Senator Argue, expressing the expectations, as well as the
impatience, of the members of that association with respect to
the implementation of the recommendations of the report.
To conclude, I should like to quote two excerpts from the
many excellent briefs presented to us when we attended the
meetings in Moncton in June of 1973. The first is from a brief
presented by Mr. William D. Denier, General Manager, Maritime Co-operative Services Limited. Those of us who were
there and who have had the privilege of meeting Mr. Denier
will be saddened to know that he has since passed away. Mr.
Denier had this to say:
Perhaps what most upsets the people of Kent is that there
is a feeling in some places that agriculture should be
written off in our area and all production moved to the
areas with the so-called comparative advantage.
e (1500)
We don't feel this is good enough in terms of people. In
the hearts of many Kent County residents, people are
being ignored and they are somewhat impatient with the
preoccupation of economists and others with the two
issues of comparative advantage and allocation of
resources. These people tend to completely ignore human
resources and we all know it is impossible to reduce the
problems of Canada to dollars and cents, and economic
models.

March 10, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Mr. Harry Shorten, the Director of New Brunswick NewStart Inc., had this to say:
Yes, there is definitely a future for agriculture in Kent
County. I will go further than that. If we took advantage
of all possibilities there are in the agricultural field in
Kent County, I have no hesitation in saying that the
general economic climate here would be at par with the
rest of Canada.
Honourable senators, the farming population of Kent
County region is asking for our support in its efforts to solve
its many problems. Our committee is pledged to provide that
assistance, and the committee will honour that pledge.
The Hon. the Speaker: As no other honourable senator
wishes to participate in this debate, this inquiry is considered
as having been debated.
CLERESTORY OF THE SENATE CHAMBER
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) moved, pursuant to notice
of Tuesday, March 8:
That a special committee of the Senate be appointed to
consider and report upon the question of the installation
of stained glass windows in the clerestory of the Senate
chamber;
That the committee have power to send for persons,
papers and records, to examine witnesses and to print
such papers and evidence from day to day as may be
ordered by the committee;
That the committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate; and
That the papers and evidence received and taken on the
subject in the preceding session be referred to the
committee.

He said: Honourable senators, perhaps I should say a word
or two in explanation of the re-establishment of this committee. Originally, the Senate established the committee on January 22, 1975, during the last session of Parliament. The
committee held eight meetings during which it heard evidence
from officials of the Senate, former officials of the Senate,
historians and artists. It heard particularly from artists working in stained glass and from people from the National
Gallery.
Members of the former committee will agree that the
witnesses who appeared before us gave us some excellent
information and a great deal of help. Their evidence was of a
high order indeed. I do not think it is too much to say that we
had a good addition to whatever liberal education we might
have had in the fine arts previously, because there were many
solid discussions by experts on problems of architecture, painting, sculpture, stained glass and even tapestries as those topics
might affect this chamber.
Each of those meetings was in itself a most interesting
exercise for senators to attend. I believe the historians first
captured our imagination more than anyone else, but as the
members of the committee became accustomed to dealing with
the subject matter, we certainly became more familiar with the
problems at hand, which ultimately we will report upon.
Frankly, I had hoped that the committee would be re-established earlier in this session, but owing to circumstances with
which you are all familiar that was impossible to bring about. I
envisage two or three more meetings in this session and I
would certainly hope that before the summer recess the committee will be able to report its findings to the chamber. I
recommend the adoption of the motion.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 15, at 8 p.m.

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL FINANCE
ON SUPPLEMENTARY ÈSTIMATES (D)

March 10, 1977
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance to
which the Supplementary Estimates (D) laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1977, were referred,
has in obedience to the Order of Reference of Tuesday, March
8, 1977, examined the said Supplementary Estimates (D) and
reports as follows:
THURSDAY,

1. In obedience to the foregoing the Committee made a
general examination of the Supplementary Estimates (D) and
heard evidence from the Honourable Robert Andras, President
of the Treasury Board, and Mr. B. A. MacDonald, Deputy
Secretary, and Mr. A. Morin, Assistant Secretary, Program
Branch, Treasury Board.
2. Supplementary Estimates (D) will add $930 million to
the total appropriations for 1976/77. This sum is in addition to
the total amount of $749 million added previously through
Supplementary Estimates (A), (B) and (C). The original Main
Estimates for 1976/77 of $39,545 million have therefore been
increased through Supplementary Estimates to a total appropriation for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1977, to $41,224
million. The original forecast made thirteen months ago that
total federal expenditures for this year would not be allowed to
exceed $42,150 million has been achieved.
3. Expressed in percentage terms, tle total requirement of
$41,224 million for 1976/77 represents an increase of 14%
over total expenditures for 1975/76. This means that the
current increase is within the target ceiling of the percentage
increase in the nominal Gross National Product, a relationship
which this Committee has long felt to be desirable. Further,
the total Supplementary Estimates for this fiscal year represent an increase of 4.2% over the Main Estimates. This is well
down from the comparable increase arising from Supplementary Estimates in 1975/76 of 9%.
4. Supplementary Estimates (D) contain statutory items in
the amount of $436 million, almost half the total. The rest is
accounted for by items to be voted. Some of the major items in
the Supplementary Estimates (D) are as follows:
(a) Fiscal transfer payments, $396 million;
(b) Provision of additional funds to the Central Mortgage
& Housing Corporation in order to change the corporation's appropriations from a calendar to a fiscal year
basis, $155 million;
(c) Payment to Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. to enable
the corporation to pay outstanding interest on loans, $85
million;
(d) Payment towards purchase of 2,000 hopper cars in
connection with Grains and Oilseeds Program, $71
million;
(e) Public Debt Charges, $65 million;

(f) Loan to Manitoba Hydro for additions to Nelson
River Transmission System, $42 million;
(g) Payments to Province of Nova Scotia in respect of
industrial energy conservation and oil substitution
projects and a program of home insulation loans, $29
million;
(h) Deficiency payments to Interprovincial Pipeline Limited fôr calendar year 1976, $25 million.
5. The witnesses supplied the Committee with a list explaining 52 $1 items in these Supplementary Estimates (D). This
list is attached as Appendix (A) to this report. The Committee
was profoundly disturbed by the increasing number and complexity of these dollar items. Approval for 19 similar $1 items
was requested in Supplementary Estimates (B) making a total
of 71 separate legislative adjustments being effected in this
fiscal year through the device of the supply bill. The Committee reconmends that the continued and expanding use of this
method of redressing inadequacies in basic legislation and in
program planning by departments be vigorously scrutinized by
the Treasury Board.
Respectfully submitted,
H. SPARROW,
Deputy Chairman.

million by the issue and sale of securities in the private
market.
Explanation-Authority is requested by the Corporation to
borrow funds to finance capital expenditures through the
issue and sale of interest-bearing securities in the private
market. The Corporation does not have this authority
under its existing legislation.
INDUSTRY, TRADE AND COMMERCE

Vote-To authorize:
(1) the payment of remuneration to members of the
National Design Council;
(2) the entry into of an agreement to purchase leased

Vote 77d-To amend the Export Development Act to increase
the limits for insurance and guarantees in respect of
Canadian exports.
Explanation-It is proposed to increase the limits of liability
under the Export Development Act for insurance and
guarantees from $750 million to $2,500 million under
Section 26 (Corporate Account) and from $750 million to

the transfer of net proceeds from Olympic stamp sales
after December 31, 1976, to the Olympic Account,
Department of Finance.
Explanation-Although the sale of Olympic stamps for regular postal services was discontinued during 1976, Olympic
stamps are contained in philatelic packages which the
Post Office will continue to sell. Since the Olympic
(1976) Act does not permit transfer of proceeds after
December 31, 1976, authority is requested to amend the
Act to permit the transfer of net proceeds beyond this
date.
PUBLIC WORKS

Vote 10d-Authority is requested to amend the Public Lands
Grants Act and the Public Works Act so as to permit the
Minister to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of certain
public properties and to authorize a transfer to this vote
of $10,999,999.
Explanation-Since there is uncertainty as to the authority of
the Minister of Public Works to lease property which is
not surplus to Crown requirements, authority is requested
to enable the Minister, notwithstanding paragraph 4 of
the Public Lands Grants Act, and Section 39 of the
Public Works Act, to lease Crown property at 240 Sparks
Street, Ottawa and Place du Centre, Hull to private
developers.
In addition, funds are required for increased operating
costs of Crown-owned and leased buildings totalling
$11,000,000.
Source of Funds-Vote 15-($10,999,999)-Funds are available due to delays in construction projects caused mainly
by labour strikes.

Vote 27d-Authority is requested to amend the Currency and
Exchange Act and the Royal Canadian Mint Act.
Explanation-It is necessary to amend the Currency and
Exchange Act (which stipulates the content, size and
design of Canadian coins) and the Royal Canadian Mint
Act (which limits the production of coins to the "Coins of
Canada") so as to permit the minting and issue of a $100
gold coins to commemorate the Queei's Silver Jubilee and
to ensure that it will be legal tender. The amendments are
required since the gold content will be less than the face
value of the coin and it would not otherwise be considered
a "Coin of Canada".

SENATE DEBATES

TRANSPORT

Vote 52d-To establish VIA Rail Canada Inc. as a railway
company pursuant to the Railway Act, and to authorize it
to enter into contracts for rail passenger services. Authority is also sought to authorize the Minister of Transport to
(a) enter into contracts with VIA for the provision of
selected rail passenger services and (b) share with railway
companies the cost of assistance for workers adversely
affected by discontinuation of some rail passenger
services.
Explanation-The process of rationalizing rail passenger services now underway will entail discontinuation of some
services and the operation of others on an improved basis.
The Department of Transport has concluded that the
effective management of the optimum rail passenger
system requires a single entity which will be responsible to
the government for the arrangement of rail passenger
services. To achieve this rationalization, the following
authorities are requested:
(1) To establish VIA Rail Canada Inc. as a railway
company under the Railway Act.
(2) To permit the Company with the approval of the
Minister of Transport to enter into contracts with any
railway for the purpose of providing a unified management and control of rail passenger services in Canada.
(3) To authorize the Minister of Transport to enter into a
contract with VIA Rail Canada Inc. with respect to:
(a) the provision, management or operation of selected
rail passenger services so as to improve efficiency,
effectiveness and economy,
(b) to reimburse the Company for the net cost of
operating a contractual rail passenger service,
(c) to provide incentive payments for efficient operation
of rail passenger services in accordance with the
contract.
To authorize the reimbursement of a railway company
for costs incurred in the provision of income maintenance

March 10, 1977

benefits, layoff benefits, relocation expenses, early retirement benefits, severance benefits and other benefits to its
employees where these costs arise as a result of the
implementation of the provisions of the contract or discontinuance of a rail passenger service.
The maximum amount that may be paid annually under
these provisions are not to exceed $240 million.
TRANSPORT-ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY AUTHORITY

Vote LI 16d-To authorize the conversion of $624,950,000 of
debt to equity.
Explanation-Authority is requested to convert the aggregate
principal amount of loan indebtedness of the Authority to
equity as at April 1, 1977. The St. Lawrence Seaway
Authority has had insufficient toll revenue since 1959 to
enable the Authority to make any repayment of capital
costs. It is expected that this conversion will provide the
Authority with a realistic financial base.
Authority is also requested to enable the Minister of
Transport to fix from time to time the amount to be paid
annually out of the Authority's toll revenue as a return on
capital.
VETERANS AFFAIRS

Vote 45d-To amend the Public Service Superannuation Act
so as to include certain persons as contributors to the
Public Service Superannuation Plan.
Explanation-Authority is requested to permit Department of
Veterans Affairs hospital employees to continue to be
contributors to the Public Service Superannuation Plan
even though they have been transferred to an approved
employer by deeming such employer to be a Public Service Corporation for the purposes of the Public Service
Superannuation Act as long as the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital employees are employed by the designated Corporation.

honourable senators, to ask another supplementary, to be
taken as notice also.
In view of the recent assertions of the Chairman of the
CRTC in reference to this inquiry that he had not, at the time
of that assertion, received any specific complaints about the
broadcasting activities of the CBC or its employees:
(a) has the government or the Prime Minister received
any such specific complaints, or has it or he any knowledge of such complaints;
(b) if so, has it or he already placed those specific
complaints before the CRTC, or will it or he do so; and
(c) if not, will the government invite, seek or look for any
such specific complaints so that the same may be placed
before-the CRTC for its inquiry, in line with the assertion
of the Chairman of the CRTC?
Senator Langlois: This third question is also taken as notice,
and I hope to be able to answer the three questions tomorrow.

SENATE DEBATES
CANADIAN AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES ACT
FOREIGN INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of the report of the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce on Bill S-3, to amend the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act and the Foreign Insurance Companies
Act.
Senator Hayden moved the adoption of the report.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill was considered in
committee the other day, and a number of amendments were
proposed by the Superintendent of Insurance. According to his
statement at the meeting the contents of these amendments
had been discussed with some of the groups, and some of the
principal groups, that were interested in the subject matter of
the two acts that were being amended, namely, the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act and the Foreign Insurance Companies Act.
Ordinarily, because the amendments are technical and possibly might even be called housekeeping or tidying up amendments, it might not be considered necessary to go into them in
detail. However, this is a Senate bill, and I know that in the
past criticism has been voiced in the other place at times with
respect to bills originating in the Senate. The usual complaint
has been that the record has not always been full and clear. Do
not think I am going to use that as a base to make a full or
complete statement about these amendments tonight, but I
think 1 may go so far as to say that I can make a clear one.
The first two amendments in the report, as printed in
Hansardof last Thursday, deal with shares and changing their
values. The intention was not fully expressed in the amendment contained in Bill S-3, but the purpose of the amendment
is to make it clear that the par value of the shares of
companies governed by the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act may be changed to a par value that is lower or
higher, depending on the percentage of shareholders who vote
in favour of a by-law to do this.
The Superintendent of Insurance announced that the intention in due course-possibly in the next few years-would be
to propose a further revision of these insurance acts, with the
object of bringing the corporate clauses closely in line with the
corporate clauses in the Canada Business Corporations Act. In
the meantime, at the suggestion of those concerned with these
insurance acts, amendments 1 and 2 were proposed to provide
more flexibility for those companies which may decide to
subdivide shares or to increase or lower the par value or
change the classes of their shares.
Next I want to refer to amendments 5, 8 and 10, which also
appear in Hansard of last Thursday. These deal with amalgamation, and the purpose of the amendment is to clarify the
language used. The amendment provides that the earnings and
dividends of the companies, as they stood before the amalgamation, will be attributed to the resulting company, after
amalgamation is completed. It was called to the Superintend-

March 15, 1977

ent's attention by people interested in insurance bills that there
are some jurisdictions in Canada where as a result of an
amalgamation there is no continuing company after the amalgamation. To avoid any confusion or difficulty, the amendment was proposed in terms which did not strike out the
reference to the company continuing after amalgamation but
added the words, "or formed as a result of the amalgamation."
There are two other amendments in the report that I want to
refer to particularly, amendments 7 and 9. No. 7, which
amends subclause 28(2) on page 36 of the bill, restores a
subparagraph that was inadvertently omitted in the bill. It was
intended that it be put in, and this is one of the amendments
that the Superintendent of Insurance requested. The subparagraph in question has to do with a class of assets that are
eligible for deposit by a British company to cover its Canadian
liabilities. Amendment No. 9 applies to classes of assets that
may be deposited in Canada by a foreign company to cover
liabilities here. It is parallel to the amendment relating to
subclause 28(2) for British companies.
There is an amendment to clause 10, which appears on page
13 of the bill. In dealing with the position of the valuation
actuary who was to provide the valuation to the auditor, which
the auditor was to include in the financial statements of the
insurance companies, it was intended to make reference to two
paragraphs in the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act. The paragraphs would deal with reserves. Unfortunately,
or inadvertently, only one of those paragraphs was referred to
in the bill as it was presented to us. The other paragraph had
to do with the reserves that must be provided in the case of
sickness and accident policies, and in connection with provision
for instalment payments and the liabilities under certain of
these types of policies. The proposai then was to include in
clause 10 on page 13 a reference to the second of these two
paragraphs dealing with reserves; that is, paragraph
102(4)(b).
* (2020)

This just about deals with the subject matter of the report,
except for one item. That item had to do with a provision in
subclause 4(1) on page 4, giving Canadian insurance companies the right to invest in the government bonds of any foreign
country in which the company is carrying on business. The
Superintendent of Insurance explained that this did not give
enough flexibility. He felt there might be good reasons why an
insurance company that was not doing business in a particular
foreign country might still wish to invest in government bonds
of that country. He therefore suggested a more flexible wording. The more flexible wording did not involve the naming of
any foreign countries and government bonds of those countries, but provided that those countries and the government
bonds of those countries that might be eligible for investment
would be prescribed by regulation.
This concludes the contents of the report. I hope I have not
taken too long, but I hope I have done the second part of what
I said I was going to do, which is to make it reasonably clear
for those who have a background in insurance law.
Motion agreed to and report adopted.

SENATE DEBATES

March 15, 1977

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?
Senator Langlois moved that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting of the
Senate.
Motion agreed to.
THE ESTIMATES
CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE
COMMITTEE ON SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (D)-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of the report of the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance with respect
to supplementary estimates (D) laid before Parliament for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1977.
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow: Honourable senators, you have
before you the report of the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on supplementary estimates (D)The Hon. the Speaker: Is the honourable senator moving
adoption of the report?
Senator Flynn: No; I think it is only to be considered.
Senator Sparrow: Yes.
Honourable senators, you have before you the report of the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance on supplementary estimates (D), which will add $930 million to the
estimates for 1976-77. With the addition of $749 million
representing supplementary estimates (A), (B) and (C), the
total supplementary estimates for 1976-77 come to $1,679
million. The estimates for 1976-77 have, therefore, been
increased from $39,545 million in the main estimates to a total
of $41,224 million.
The President of the Treasury Board, who appeared before
the committee, mentioned that the government's restraint
target for this fiscal year, which his predecessor had predicted
13 months ago would result in an increase in the estimates of
well below 16 per cent, had been more than achieved.
I have been concerned, as have some other members of the
committee, about the size of the supplementary estimates and
it is encouraging to note that the total of the supplementary
estimates for this year has dropped considerably. In fact, the
percentage increase over the main estimates comes to 4.2 per
cent which is roughly half the percentage increase of last year.
For some years members of the committee have been pressing for the increase in federal expenditures not to exceed the
increase in the gross national product. In December 1975, the
Honourable Jean Chrétien, then President of the Treasury
Board, appeared before your committee and indicated that this
premise had become government policy, stating: "We would
like as a general policy that the public sector should not take
more out of the economy than is reflected in the gross national
product." I was pleased, therefore, to learn that this year this
goal had been achieved, in that the growth of government
expenditures has kept within the growth in the nominal gross

491

national product. It is to be hoped that this relationship will
continue in the future, with a goal of reducing the per cent
increase even further to endeavour to compensate for past high
per cent increases.
Supplementary estimates (D) total $930 million, of which
$436 million are statutory items, or approximately half the
total. The remainder to be voted amounts to $422 million in
budgetary expenditures and $72 million in non-budgetary
items.
e (2030)

The largest statutory increase in these supplementaries is
the $396 million in transfer payments to the provinces under
the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. On the voted
budgetary side the largest single item is the $155 million to
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation in order to
change the method of financing the corporation from a calendar year basis to a fiscal year basis.
Other substantial amounts being sought are $100 million in
the energy sector for conservation and renewable resource
development programs in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island, deficiency payments on the Sarnia-Montreal Pipeline,
and additions to regional electrical connections in Manitoba;
$71 million for a new purchase of 2,000 grain hopper cars,
which will increase the fleet of those cars to 8,000; and $85
million for a debt write-off of interest due on the loans to
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited for the prototype reactors
at Douglas Point and Gentilly.
One area that has worried me as a member of the committee
for some years has been the use of the $1 items in supplementary estimates as a means of authorizing the provision of funds
for anticipated operating expenditures through the deferral of
capital projects and making legislative adjustments through
the device of the supply bill. I was therefore disturbed to note
that there were 52 such items in supplementary estimates (D)
which, along with 19 such items requested in supplementary
estimates (B), makes a total of 71 separate legislative adjustments being effected this year by this means. I feel strongly
that the continued and expanding use of this method of
redressing inadequacies in basic legislation and in program
planning by departments should be vigorously scrutinized by
the Treasury Board, and a stop put to this practice, with the
exception only of items of immediate and utmost urgency.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.
NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL SESSION, WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA,
U.S.A.-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 9, the debate
on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator McElman calling
the attention of the Senate to the Twenty-second Annual
Session of the North Atlantic Assembly, held in Williamsburg,
Virginia, U.S.A., from 12th to 19th November, 1976, and in
particular to the discussions and proceedings of the Session
and the participation therein of the delegation from Canada.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable senators, when I
adjourned this debate on Wednesday last, March 9, I had
progressed to the point where I was congratulating Senator
Austin on the report that he gave to this house with respect to
his representation as a delegate from Canada at the recent
conference in Paris of the Western European Union Assembly.
I mentioned at that time that Senator Austin, judging from his
report, had certainly represented Canada well. He covered
many points which, had he not made that speech, I would have
liked to have covered this evening, because his feelings and
mine run a parallel course as far as the defence of Europe is
concerned.
I wish to refer to one paragraph of his remarks which
concerns the standardization and interoperability of military
equipment in Europe, about which he said:
As many honourable senators know, the Warsaw Pact
nations have armaments co-ordinated by and, in large
part, designed and made by the Soviet Union. They are
thus standardized and interchangeable amongst ail members of the Warsaw Pact. They have what is known in the
military world as interoperability. Modern warfare is
essentially mobile, and armed forces to be effective must
be able to move freely over the battle area. That means
that the Warsaw Pact countries can draw on one another's ammunition, and they now have compatible communications systems.
I suggest to you that the interoperability of the Warsaw
Pact countries is much more complete than was outlined by
Senator Austin. As you know, armaments for the Warsaw
Pact are made in the Soviet Union itself or in some of its
satellite countries. The design of the product is dictated by the
Soviet Union. They not only have interoperability in communications and armaments; they have complete interoperability in
repair and maintenance, and they have complete interoperability in fuel supplies, ammunition-the whole gamut. A tank
from the Soviet Union can be serviced in any one of the
Warsaw Pact countries.
This is not truc of the western world or of the NATO forces.
The fact that the NATO forces in Europe have not been
standardized or made interoperable is costing an estimated
$10 billion a year. The western world cannot afford this, and
whether we like standardization and interoperability or not, we
have no option. We are not able to match the forces that are
being put in the field by the Warsaw Pact countries today or
the equipment with which they are being equipped, so how on
earth can we continue to waste $10 million a year on research
and development on many of these same items?
I have two reports here, one of which is on the activities of
the Subcommittee on European Defence Cooperation and
which consists of 25 pages. Each page, one after the other,
points out areas where we are repeating research and development, and even production, of items that never should be
researched or developed ai aIl. Why on earth should we be
designing machine guns in seven or eight different countries?
Why should we be designing air-to-ground rockets or ground-

March 15, 1977

to-air rockets in virtually every country that belongs to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization?
The second report deals with the standardization of technical missiles. It has 51 foolscap pages, and 22 of them list the
air-to-ground rockets or ground-to-air rockets available in
NATO countries. How on earth can we afford the research
and development involved in whatever number of rockets there
are included in those 22 pages? I don't know.
The fact is that we cannot afford that research and development, and therefore, whether the nations like it or not, we have
to insist that aIl members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization cooperate with one another and divide the
research among themselves on different articles of war. When
a weapon that meets the satisfaction of the partners generally
is produced, then aIl nations should buy that particular
weapon.
We have moved somewhat in that direction in the last year
or 18 months. As you know, the Europeans have now decided
to purchase a replacement for their fighter aircraft in Europe.
Several of them are buying the F-16, which the Americans are
using in Europe. There is some unification or standardization
with regard to tanks. As you know, Canada has purchased the
Leopard tank, undoubtedly one of the finest tanks in the
world. At one time it was hoped that the research, development and production of tanks in Germany could be combined
with a similar effort in the United States. This has proved to
be impossible. One of the reasons is the fact that the United
States has now developed a gas turbine engine that is more
efficient, has greater range and more horsepower, and does a
better job than any diesel engine built so far.
But there is going to be some interoperability between the
new XM-1 tank in the United States-the new class of tank
that will come into being in the early 1980s-and the Leopard
Il. I say that because I understand there will be interchangeability of tracks, rollers, gun turrets, gun aiming equipment and
red eye whih is used for night operation. This is going to mean
that the tanks built in Germany will, to a large extent, be
interoperable with those built in North America.
The committee known as the European Defence Cooperation Committee, a subcommittee of the Committee on
Defence, has existed for some time. The problem they have run
into is the fact that Europe imports so much of her armaments
from the North American continent, and especially from the
United States. It is impossible to bring about standardization
and interoperability unless America and Canada take part in
the work of this subcommittee. I am pleased to report that ai
the last Assembly meeting in Williamsburg two Americans
were nominated and elected to the subcommittee, and I was
fortunate enough to be nominated and elected as the Canadian
representative on that subcommittee. It is my hope that
Canadian industry can get its fair share. We are ail aware that
Canada manufactures few, if any, complete weapons, but we
do have the capability to produce parts of weapons and
certainly the electronic systems, and we must, of course, have
our share of any market into which ail of the NATO countries
are putting their defence dollars.

March 15, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

* (2040)

Another aspect of the problem with respect to interoperability and the use of the same weapons in North America and
Europe has to do with*topographicaI matters which confront us
in Europe vis-à-vis the North American continent, chiefly with
respect to the sea and the air elements. In North America the
distances involved in both the sea and the air are much greater
than they are in Europe. Consequently, Canada is finding it
difficult to adopt F-16 as a replacement for the F-104. The
F-16 will do the job for us in Europe, but the experts tell me
that it will not do the job required of an aircraft in Canada
because of the great distances it is necessary to cover here.
With these few exceptions, however, i look forward to-and
undoubtedly we will have it-far greater standardization and
interoperability in the very near future.
Senator Austin also went on to say that the NATO forces in
Europe were outgunned, outmanned, outtanked and outplaned.
He said it is doubtful that we could meet and deal head-on
with a threat or an attack by the Warsaw Pact nations. He
referred to the fact that the western powers might be called
upon to use tactical nuclear weapons at an early stage of any
such conflict. i do not believe that tactical nuclear weapons
will ever be used, and I say that from the knowledge I have
acquired from trips abroad and the opportunities I have had to
see modern, conventional weapons being used in the field.
A war today with conventional weapons is unthinkable, but
you cannot even dream of a war with atomic weapons. i doubt
very much that in the circumstances which prevail today
tactical nuclear weapons will ever be used. Back in 1948, when
NATO came into being, the United States had overwhelming
nuclear superiority. The United States could dictate to the
Soviet Union and any other country, and no one would dare
argue with her. But the Soviet Union, in a very short space of
time, has achieved at least parity in both overall nuclear
capability and tactical nuclear capability. Knowing that, how
can any nation become involved in the use of tactical nuclear
weapons?
But, despite the disparity in numerical strength as between
the Warsaw Pact and NATO countries, I do not believe it is
impossible for NATO to blunt a thrust into Europe or even to
defeat the Russians. We have been led to believe by some
military experts that an attacking nation needs three to five
times as many guns, tanks and other pieces of armour as a
defending nation. Well, I do not accept that, and i do not
accept it because of the lesson we should have learned in 1940.
In 1940, when Nazi Germany moved into France, it was
estimated that Germany had between 7,000 and 7,500 tanks.
In actual fact she had 2,400 tanks. She had a few more in
store, but she retired practically all of the Mark I tanks and
many of the Mark Il tanks in 1940 after her experience in
Poland. But those 2,400 tanks, which moved from the Meuse
to the English Channel in ten days, were faced by 3,100 tanks
belonging to Britain and France. Of those 3,100 French and
British tanks, 2,285 were modern, the equivalent of or better
than those tanks available to Germany. Then, how did the
German tanks move from the Meuse to the English Channel in

ten days? They did so for; the simple reason that the Germans
were the people who brought into being what Senator Austin
referred to as mobility. They were the people who invented the
blitzkrieg. Unfortunately, France and Britain had learned few
lessons from the First World War. They believed in a broad
front; in defending a front all the way from Switzerland to the
English Channel. But when the Nazis attacked, they attacked
over a narrow front and penetrated so rapidly and forcibly
through France that neither Britain nor France had the capability to meet that attack head-on or to pinch it off. We have
learned many lessons since 1940, and the Germans are now on
our side-thank God.
However, as in the last war, no army can survive in any new
war without control of the air. Without mastery of the air, no
army can survive. I suggest to you that no naval force can
survive without complete mastery of the air either. Going back
again to 1940, Germany had at its disposal 1,400 bombers
while France had 175 and Britain had 220 stationed in France.
That was not the entire British bomber capability but just
those aircraft stationed in France. The 1,400 German bombers
were opposed by a force of 395. The Germans had Stuka dive
bombers, which virtually replaced artillery and they had 342
of those. France had 54 dive bombers, and Britain had none in
France. The Germans had 1,000 fighters; France had 700, and
Britain had 130 in France. Germany had 500 reconnaissance
aircraft; France had 350, and Britain had 50 in France. The
Germans had complete superiority in the air. That is another
reason why the Nazi drive into western Europe could not be
stopped. We did not have control of the air. If you do not
control the air, then neither your land forces nor your sea
forces can make worthwhile progress or even hold any ground
they might have gained.
What is the picture with respect to the military balance
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact? I have some figures for
1976-77. What about troops on the ground; combat troops in
place? The NATO countries have 635,000 troops in Europe,
while the Warsaw Pact countries have 910,000, and of those
620,000 are U.S.S.R. troops. What about support troops? The
NATO countries have 540,000, while the Warsaw Pact countries have 395,000 and 155,000 of them belong to the U.S.S.R.
* (2050)

The point to remember about support troops is that the
Russian and Warsaw Pact support troops are on the ground in
eastern Europe. A large number of our support troops are on
the North American continent, and i have grave doubts, if
hostilities broke out, that we would have time to move men
and, in some instances, equipment to Europe. So I attack with
a grain of salt the figures of support troops because, in my
opinion, we are comparing oranges with apples.
What about other comparisons? Let us consider battle
tanks. Germany, during World War II, had 2,400 tanks when
she moved into France and Belgium. The Warsaw Pact countries today have 19,000, not 2,400. We have 7,000 with which
to oppose them. Of the 19,000 possessed by the Warsaw Pact
countries, 11,000 are manned by troops from the U.S.S.R.

SENATE DEBATES
What about aircraft? I am speaking only of northern and
central Europe; I am not including the southern flank or any
other area. NATO has 185 light bombers, and the Warsaw
Pact countries have 225, of which 200 are from the Soviet
Union. What about fighters? We have 1,250, while the
Warsaw Pact has 1,375, of which 950 are manned by the
U.S.S.R. What about interceptors? We have 375, the Warsaw
Pact countries have 2,050 of which 950 are operated by
members of the Russian air force. We have 275 reconnaissance aircraft while the Warsaw Pact countries have 550 of
which 400 are from the U.S.S.R.
Many other comparisons can be made, but those are some of
the main elements. That is the disparity which exists in
conventional forces.
Despite these figures, I do not believe that the Soviet Union
has overwhelming superiority in central and northern Europe
today. I believe that our equipment is much better; that our
soldiers are as good as theirs, if not better. I believe we can
rely on our comrades in Europe for their wholehearted effort,
more than the Soviet Union can rely on some Warsaw Pact
countries who are members not by desire but by force. I wish
to emphasize that anyone who is foolish enough to attack
NATO in Europe might win the war but would receive such a
bloody nose and such a headache that he would wish he had
never started it. I am confident of that.
British, German and French troops-and also Canadian
troops, small in number as they are-are among the best
soldiers, and form the best equipped of any army, in history.
We should make no mistake about that. They are able to give
a good account of themselves in any situation that might crop
up in the foreseeable future. That does not mean that all of us
should not make a greater effort, and I am happy at what
Canada has achieved during the past year or 18 months in
improving her forces both at home and abroad. Honourable
senators are aware of what is happening in that direction.
I wish now to comment on the nations of western Europe in
NATO. The nine European member countries of NATO have
a combined population of 262 million people. The combined
population of the member countries of the Warsaw Pactseven countries-is 362 million people. Therefore, the Warsaw
Pact has a 28 per cent advantage in manpower. But manpower
docs not tell everything. The gross national product of the nine
European nations is $l,430 billion annually. The gross national product of the seven Warsaw Pact nations is $925 billion. In
my view, what we lack in manpower we more than make up in
our ability to produce goods and services as compared with the
cast European nations.
However, I do not believe that al] member countries of
NATO have made as great a contribution as they should to
the defence of western Europe. If we have a 35 per cent
advantage in material resources over an enemy, we ought to be
able to look after ourselves. But western Europe has never
been in a position to look after herself vis-à-vis the Warsaw
Pact, and she is not in that position today.

March 15, 1977

It seems to me that the number of troops, particularly
American troops, stationed in Germany today is too high. I do
not believe that the North American continent has forever to
make the effort which the Americans particularly have made
since 1948. Canada now has only 5,000 troops in Europe. I
wish we still had 10,000 but we do not. I believe it is to our
advantage to keep at least 5,000 men and women in Europe,
whether or not the Warsaw Pact threat disappears, because
there is no finer training area in the world. People who train in
the same area in which they may be called on to fight in the
event of war are in a far better position to deal with a situation
than those who train on the North American continent and
who probably have never been to Europe. Therefore, it is in
Canada's advantage to keep her troops in Europe and to
increase the number if need be.
Senator Austin also informed us of the very dangerous
position in which Europe finds itself becàuse of energy supplies
to that part of the world. He mentioned new facilities that are
available because of the opening of the Suez Canal and the
pipelines which have now been laid down to the eastern
Mediterranean.
I do not believe that is a major problem concerning cither
the North American continent or western Europe. The West's
consumption of oil today is great, but by 1985 it will be twice
as great. Can we imagine, in eight years, being faced with the
responsibility of moving that volume of oil, with the economic
circumstances that it entails? In the first place, will the
Middle East continue to produce the amount of oil needed to
meet the demand? What will be the price if they produce it at
all?
The opening of the Suez Canal was not nearly as much a
benefit to western Europe as it was to the Soviet Union. A
large percentage of our oil today comes around the Cape into
the western Atlantic, and it then moves to North America or
along the African coast into the Mediterranean to western
Europe. For great distances along this tanker route we have
little or no protection. The Indian Ocean itself is 4,000 miles
long and 4,000 miles wide. America, or NATO, has the Sixth
Fleet in the Mediterranean, but it is stretching one's imagination to think that it can maintain security in that area of the
world as well as in the Indian Ocean.
* (2100)

To demonstrate what the Suez Canal means to Soviet
Union, I would point out that normally there are 50 Russian
vessels in the Mediterranean, but during the Yom Kippur war
the number went up to 95. They can move those 95 ships from
the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal and into the Indian
Ocean in a very short space of time, and in a hell of a lot less
time than it takes to go from North American shores to the
Indian Ocean.
i suggest that we cannot protect these routes today, yet
NATO has said that her responsibility ends at the Tropic of
Cancer. I think that is very short-sighted. Unless we have
access to Middle East oil 1 do not think we can sustain a
peacetime economy in western Europe, let alone a wartime
economy, and I think greater effort must be made by all the

March 15, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

member nations of NATO to put more troops, more ships and
more aircraft in that area of the world.
To indicate what this route around the Cape means to the
western world I would like to cite certain figures for 1972,
which is the latest year for which I could get accurate figures.
I have figures for each NATO country, but I am not going to
give them all. In the month of February 1972, there was a
grand total of 1,132 NATO freighters going around the Cape.
In the same month there were 703 tankers, for a total of 1,835
ships. The freighters had a gross registered tonnage of 11,320,000. The tankers had a dead weight tonnage of 28,120,000.
The tankers, when they move in one direction are empty, and
when they move in the other direction they are full. That gives
some idea of the importance of protecting those sea routes, not
only in time of war but in time of peace as well.
Honourable senators, I suggest to you that that is one area
of the world that is most vulnerable today. It is vulnerable
because of the tremendous needs of the western world. If the
supply of oil to Japan were cut off-and most of it comes from
the Middle East-90 per cent of Japanese industry would be
shut down. Seven hundred million gallons of Middle East oil
per day go to Europe. Over the next decade it is estimated that
that volume will increase by 450 per cent. Britain obtains 66
per cent of her oil from the Gulf states, Italy 84.5 per cent,
France 51 per cent, and West Germany 62 per cent. The
U.S.A. has only been receiving about 3 per cent, but it is
estimated that her demand from the Middle East will go to at
least 25 per cent. The dollar drain on the Western World for
imported oil was $2.1 billion in 1970. By 1985 it will be
roughly $13 billion. Therefore, we have a problem not only in
wartime, but in peacetime as well.
I want now to refer to a military tour that I had the
privilege of taking last May through the area called the
southern flank-France, Italy, Greece, Crete and Turkey. In
France we visited the naval harbour at Toulon. They have
excellent facilities there for repair, maintenance and manufacture, but I am fearful. You must all have a memory of where
the French navy wound up in 1940-scuttled in the harbour at
Toulon. On one day around the end of last May, there were
three French aircraft carriers in that harbour. One of them
was for sale, and the other two, the Foch and the Clemenceau,
do not have a single aircraft aboard. We were informed that
they could go to sea in six days, but I think 60 days would be
more accurate. How can you have barnacles the thickness of
your hand on the side of an aircraft carrier and be prepared to
go to sea? I have eyes to see with, I assure you. So much for
the French navy in Toulon.
We visited an air force academy in Italy. I should not
criticize our partners, but I think one has to from time to time.
That air force academy in Italy appeared to be an establishment for the landed gentry, but wars have to be fought by
people, whether they have titles or not.
I now come to some good news. At one point we were
privileged to go aboard the Nimitz, the largest warship in the
world and the largest aircraft carrier. This is a vessel of 96,000
tons. She has enough fuel aboard to enable her to stay at sea

for 13 years without refuelling. She carries 84 aircraft, and
can launch one every three seconds. In my view there is more
striking power and more protection on that one ship than in a
lot of areas throughout the southern flank. This aircraft
carrier carries attack aircraft, radar aircraft, strike aircraft,
fighter aircraft, and helicopters. Her main job is to put those
aircraft into the air and to retrieve them if she can. I repeat,
her main purpose is to get those aircraft aloft. When you get
84 of them into the air, somebody is going to have an awful
headache. I think the power of such modern men-of-war is
what it needed on a permanent basis, not just on a visitation
basis, in the Indian Ocean.
We went from Italy to Greece, where we met the Minister
of Foreign Affairs. In that country we had lots of conversation,
but we did not see many signs of military equipment. However,
the meetings with the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs were
very important for Canadians, because the Canadian delegation told him that Canadians were getting sick and tired of
maintaining a peacekeeping force in Cyprus. We told him that
they had been there long enough. We told him that the
differences between Greece and Turkey should have been
solved long ago, and our troops moved into another peacekeeping area, or back home or to Europe.
During our visit to Turkey we met the Minister of Foreign
Affairs of that country, and he got the same message. I do not
know whether we did any good or not, but I am convinced that
they know exactly where Canadians stand. Canadians want to
see action, and they want to see the problems between the
Greeks and the Turks on Cyprus solved, so that they and other
countries can return their troops home or send them to serve in
other areas of the world.
We had a one-day stay in Crete. It was interesting for me to
go to Crete, because I recall the part of that island where the
Germans landed when they captured it in the last World War.
Only a few miles removed from that area they now have a
ground-to-air missile training school which is sponsored by
NATO. I wish all the NATO countries would use those
facilities because I think they are the best available to the
western world but, because of political indifference and nationalism, only a few countries are now using them. However, they
do have training facilities there for the Hawk missile and the
Nike missile. They put on several demonstrations for us and,
believe me, they worked. A German air force ground defence
unit was there training on 20-millimetre cannon. I think
Germany had the best ground-air defence of any nation in the
world during the last World War, and I do not think they have
lost any of their expertise. I can only repeat that I wish these
facilities were being used by more members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
e (2110)
I want to conclude my remarks by stating that we have
virtually no procedure in the Senate by which we can talk to
our defence people. We have no defence committee. The
House of Commons has a single committee on External
Affairs and National Defence, but it seems to me that the time
has long past for the establishment of a joint defence commit-

not in the very short run, would greatly ameliorate our situation in regard to crime and which would, I think, also have a
profound effect beyond the confines of this country if our

it is worth, to this excellent initiative of Senator McGrand's. I
rather gather that it may not get very far at this session, but I
hope that if it does not, he will repeat his proposal in subsequent sessions. They say that constant dripping wears away a

produce an effect on public policy in this country.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC
AREA AND BOUNDARY-INQUIRY ANSWERED

Senator Carter inquired of the government, pursuant to
notice of December 22, 1976:
1. What is the present area of the province of Quebec?
2. What was the area of the Province at the time of
Confederation?
3. How is the present boundary of Quebec defined?
4. What changes have been made in the boundary of
Quebec since 1867?
5. What are the instruments and authorities that gave
effect to these boundary changes?
(Answered by Senator Perraulton March 10, asfollows:)
The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources reports
as follows:
1. 594,860 square miles.
2. No figure can be given for the area in 1867 because
the northeasterly part of Quebec (Canada) was undefined, being adjacent to Newfoundland Territory in
Labrador and this was described only in vague terms in
the governing instruments. The official definition and
location of the Canada-Newfoundland boundary later
became the subject of dispute and was only settled in
1927 following joint referral to the United Kingdom. In
1867, apart from this undefined territory, the northerly

boundary of Quebec followed the watershed of the
Hudson Bay and St. Lawrence drainage basins.
3.' (a) The entire boundary with the United States has
been demarcated under the terms of the treaties of 1783
and 1842 and is maintained by the International Boundary Commission.
(b) The boundary with Ontario is defined by the
Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, (Statutes of U.K.,
52-53 Victoria, 1889) except for the St-Lawrence River-Lake St-Francis section. This portion (about 30
miles long) is as described in Statutes of Canada 14-15
Victoria, C. 5, 1851 and 16 Victoria, c. 152, 1853. The
precise location is still being negotiated. The straight
line portions of the boundary have been demarcated.
(c) The boundary with New Brunswick is defined by
Statutes of the United Kingdom, 14-15 Victoria, c. 63,
1851 and 20-21 Victoria, c. 34, 1857. The straight line
portions have been demarcated.
(d) The boundary on James Bay and Hudson Bay,
Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay and with the Northwest Territories is described in Statutes of Canada, 2
George V, c. 45, 1912.
(e) The boundary between the Provinces of Quebec and
Newfoundland was formerly the boundary between the
Dominions of Canada and Newfoundland. This was
settled constitutionally by the Judicial Committee of
the British Privy Council in 1927. Canada and Newfoundland agreed to this boundary in their Terms of
Union, confirmed by Statute of the United Kingdom,
12-13 George VI, c. 22, 1949.
(f) The province also includes the Magdalen Islands, by
virtue of the Quebec Act, 1774, and Anticosti Island,
by the Labrador Act, 1825.
4. (a) In 1898 the western portion of the northerly
boundary of Quebec was extended northerly from the
Hudson Bay watershed line to the Eastmain River and the
branch thereof issuing from Patamisk Lake, thence following the parallel of latitude 52°55'. (The changed made
at the same time to the eastern portion of this boundary
was nullified by the 1927 decision on the Canada-Newfoundland border).

THE ESTIMATES
MANPOWER DIVISION OF DEPARTMENT OF MANPOWER AND
IMMIGRATION-REPORT ON REVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS
OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE TABLED AND PRINTED AS
APPENDIX

Hon. Douglas D. Everett: Honourable senators, I have the
honour to table the report of the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance which was authorized to review the
recommendations of the committee report on Canada Manpower appointed in the last session and tabled in the Senate on
October 19, 1976.
I would ask that the report be printed as an appendix to the
Debates of the Senate and to the Minutes of the Proceedingof
the Senate of this day and form part of the permanent records
of this house.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For text of report see appendix, pp. 512-530.)
Senator Everett: With leave of the Senate, 1 would ask
permission to make a brief statement in explanation of this
report.
The Hon. the Speaker: Leave granted, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Everett: Honourable senators, in examining the
estimates, the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance, in addition to its normal examination of the blue
book, has embarked over the years on two separate types of
hearings. One is an economic study. The first report that we
issued arising out of an economic study was the report on
Growth, Employment and Price Stability. The second type of
hearing is a detailed examination into the operation of departments and programs of government.

Our first study in the latter area was on Information
Canada; our second one, completed in August, was on Canada
Manpower. At present we are involved in a study of the
operations of the Department of Public Works. What we are
doing, in fact, is a form of zero-based budgeting of continuing
programs of the departments of government. It is interesting to
note that the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance
is the only area of government in which this kind of examination of continuing programs is carried on. The cabinet does not
do so, because of time constraints; the Treasury Board only
examines in detail new programs or new major departures in
existing programs; the Auditor General is only allowed to
examine the implementation of policy and is precluded from
making comments on policy itself. The House of Commons, of
course, is constrained both by time and by its partisan atmosphere. The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance is
therefore the only area of government that is making this kind
of study, resulting in reports such as this on Canada
Manpower.
The question is often asked: How effective are these
reports? In other words, are they implemented? When we
issued the report on Canada Manpower we decided that we
would follow up with the minister of the Department of
Manpower and Immigration to see what recommendations his
department would agree to implement. We met with the
minister yesterday. There had been a hiatus because the
minister is a new minister and we had to give him time to get
to know his department. Incidentally, he said that one of the
ways in which he got to know his department was by reading
the report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance.
The committee, in examining the report and its recommendations with the minister and his officials, found to its delight
that the minister has agreed to take action on 52 of the 56
recommendations. In the course of the meeting the committee
found that the department will implement the bulk of the
report. I would suggest that this may be unprecedented in the
production of a Senate report, and perhaps even in a royal
commission report. Of course, we will be following up with the
minister and his department over a period of time how well
they actually implement our recommendations. But, as I say, it
may be unprecedented that the department has agreed to
follow almost entirely 56 recommendations contained in a
report of 141 pages. A few minutes ago I tabled the minister's
statement and the detailed comments of the department on
each one of our recommendations. This document will appear
as an appendix to today's Hansard, but I would just like to
quote from the minister's statement, as follows:

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

I believe that the Senate Report on Manpower contained
a very comprehensive description of the way we operate,
how we can do our job and how we can do a better job.
That is precisely what our committee wants to do in examining
the estimates of government departments. In our examination
of the Department of Public Works, and in any future examination of departmental estimates, we intend to give a comprehensive description of how the department operates, how it
does its job and how it can do a better job.
Honourable senators, on behalf of the committee and its
competent staff, I am extremely gratified that the recommendations contained in our report on Canada Manpower have
had such acceptance by the Department of Manpower and
Immigration.

an optimist but very likely I was too much of an optimist last
night when I said I hoped to be in a position to answer Senator
Smith's questions today. However, as soon as the Senate
adjourned last night I set the wheels in motion to get this
information, but I had overlooked the fact that some of the
information sought by the honourable senator had to come
from sources outside government circles. This is why I have
not been able to secure all the information necessary to give a
complete answer to the senator's three questions, but I am still
endeavouring to get this information before we adjourn this
week.
Senator Flynn: If you succeed, it will put you way ahead of
what the Leader of the Government was ever able to do.

He said: Honourable senators, I have here, as you would
expect, a formal statement which I intend to make in connection with the second reading of this bill. Before doing so,
however, I should like to say that it is a distinct pleasure for
me, as I am sure it will be for other senators, to consider a bill
that without any doubt signifies an improvement to our old age
security legislation. Some of you, I am sure, followed the
debate which took place on this legislation in the other place. I
have taken the time to read the entire debate, and also the
committee proceedings.
Several points stand out. This proposed legislation met with
unanimous approval in principle in the other place and, indeed,
I believe in most details. The only real criticism that I could
detect was that offered by several honourable members, in
particular the honourable member for Winnipeg North
Centre, Mr. Stanley Knowles, that the bill does not go sufficiently far and they would like to see it include provisions for
universal old age pensions at the age of 60, with an increase in
the statutory payments.
Senator Flynn: What else is new?
Senator Rowe: However, apart from that, he, along with, I
believe, all members of the other place, agreed with this bill.
That, I am sure, is a source of satisfaction to us here, although
we do not necessarily have to follow that example.
I should like to say also that this bill has been described by
some as being complex. It would be complex, I suppose if we
were to spell out the infinite number of detailed cases that
could arise under its provisions, but perhaps that is something
we can look forward to doing to some extent when the bill is
referred, as I presume it will be, to our own appropriate
committee.
One other point I might make before proceeding with my
formal statement is that when this legislation came under
debate in the other place the honourable minister concerned
prepared a letter and a question and answer sheet, which he
had circulated to members before the bill was referred to
committee. I have secured a sufficient number of copies of that
letter to allow me to forward copies to all honourable senators,
if it is their wish, either today or tomorrow in anticipation of
our deliberations in committee at a later stage. The letter itself
covers some of the questions which, I believe, would arise in
the minds of senators. The usual procedure will be followed in
committee consideration; namely, that there will be departmental officiais present who will be able to enlighten the
committee on some of the more complex details of the proposed legislation.
In speaking on Bill C-35, to amend the Old Age Security
Act, I should like at the outset to emphasize certain points so
as to get a clear understanding of what is intended. Persons
now in receipt of an old age security pension would not be
affected by the proposed legislation. Indeed, persons wbo are
25 years of age or over and residing in Canada, or who resided
in Canada after their eighteenth birthday following the coming
into force of the new regulations, would be able to claim their

SENATE DEBATES
pension at age 65, or later, either under the present regulations
or the new regulations, whichever is to their advantage.
I assume from statements made elsewhere that the date that
the government has in mind for the coming into force of the
new regulations is July 1 of this year. It has been made
abundantly clear by the minister that the officials of the
Department of Health and Welfare will be given special
instructions to see to it that applicants who are affected, or
who may be affected in the future by this legislation, will be
advised as to which will be more beneficial to them, the
present regulations or the proposed regulations.
Two basic principles were followed by the Government of
Canada in proposing these amendments. The government felt
that persons now retired should not be affected and that the
new rules should be fair to any future pensioners. Because the
pension is universal and non-contributory and, under the proposed amendments, would be based exclusively on residence in
Canada during a period of 40 years between the ages of 18 and
65, it appeared logical that 40 years should elapse before
everyone is governed by the same set of eligibility rules. In this
way, no one who is in the process of building entitlement to an
old age security pension would be deprived of anything.
The need for a 40-year period flows from the fact that there
are presently three eligibility criteria for a pension:
(a) 40 years of residence in Canada after age 18 qualifies
an applicant, at age 65, for a full pension payable anywhere in the world;
(b) 10 years of residence in Canada immediately before
commencement of the pension, normally between the ages
of 55 and 65, qualifies an applicant for a full pension
payable in Canada only; and
(c) each year of absence from Canada in the 10-year
period preceding commencement of the pension can be
made up by three years residence prior to age 54, producing a pension payable abroad in full when the applicant
can satisfy a 20-year rule for export.
e

(1420)

In order to claim the pension under this three-for-one provision, however, the applicant must reside in Canada for a
complete year before claiming the pension. These are the
present criteria.
It is important to bear in mind that a person who cannot at
present fulfil any of these eligibility requirements is not entitled to any pension at all. It is an all-or-nothing situation.
Under the new rules, partial pensions would be established and
each year of residency in Canada after age 18 would have the
same value, one-fortieth of a full pension. Thus 10 years of
residency in Canada, after age 18, would be worth ten-fortieths of a full pension; 13 years would be worth thirteen-fortieths; 20 years would be worth twenty-fortieths, or a half, and
so on up to forty-fortieths. It therefore follows that if a person
was under 25 when the new rules come into force, he or she
would have the opportunity to earn a forty-fortieths pension
before retiring. Under the present rules a minimum of 10 years
of residence would continue to be required for the payment of

March 16, 1977

a partial pension in Canada, and a minimum of 20 years for
payment abroad; that is, payment to someone who has qualified and who now lives abroad.
The proposed amendment would also authorize the inclusion
of the old age security program in international agreements
which would make benefits portable to and from countries
with which Canada may negotiate agreements on a reciprocal
basis. That is not possible under the present old age security
legislation.
The central purpose of such agreements is to protect
migrants who spend a portion of their working lives in more
than one country. Such persons cannot always meet the minimum eligibility requirements of the mandatory social security
programs to which they have contributed. In addition, most
countries place explicit restrictions on the payments of social
security benefits outside their national boundaries. Some pay
benefits only to nationals and some freeze the benefits at the
level at which they were when the beneficiary left the country.
Others require minimum periods of residence or contributions
or allow payment abroad only on the basis of a reciprocal
agreement. I repeat that that is not possible so far as old age
pensions are concerned. Social security agreements are
designed to overcome such restrictions. This is accomplished
by adding together periods of residence or contributions to
determine eligibility under the programs of one or both countries. Once eligibility is established, each party to the agreement calculates under its own rules its share of the composite
benefit payable, and pays it direct to the beneficiary.
Such countries as the United Kingdom, Italy, the United
States and France, from which a large number of immigrants
to Canada have come in recent years, have expressed an
interest in having reciprocal agreements with Canada. Until
now, however, we have had no adequate response because the
OAS program, the building block of our retirement income
system, at present lacks provision for it to be taken to the
bargaining table. Further, the current rules, based as they are
on an all-or-nothing principle and on three sets of residence
requirements, make it impossible to relate the program to the
corresponding ones of other countries which have provision for
the payment of partial pensions and only one set of eligibility
criteria.
The Minister of National Health and Welfare has made it
clear that once Parliament has approved the proposed amendments the Government of Canada will be prepared to negotiate
reciprocal agreements with interested foreign governments to
remove duplicate coverage for the same period of work or
residency and to make benefits portable to and from Canada
and those countries. Such agreements would directly benefit a
large number of immigrants to this country--especially those
who have chosen to retire in Canada to be near their children
and grandchildren-many of whom find their foreign pensions
frozen at the level at which they were on the day they left their
country of origin, and eroded by inflation and devaluation. It is
expected that some 500,000-and this is, of course, an estimate only-500,000 residents of this country would thus eventually gain access to social security credits which they have

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

acquired overseas. Foreign benefits which are not now payable
in Canada or not payable in their entirety will become available to them.
In conclusion I wish to touch briefly on certain other
provisions envisaged in the proposed legislation before us and
on related measures which the government has announced its
intention to take.
Under the proposed amendments, persons receiving full or
partial pensions will still be eligible in Canada for the incometested guaranteed income supplement-which is generally
referred to as the GIS-and partial pensions would be adjusted quarterly in line with increases in the consumer price index,
as full pensions are at this moment.
The proposed legislation also includes a provision which will
exempt family allowance benefits as income for the purpose of
calculating an entitlement to the guaranteed income supplement and spouses allowances. It is estimated that some 10,000
grandparents and elderly persons will benefit from this change.
Several other amendments are being proposed to simplify
the administration of the old age security program and to
make it more consistent with the other two levels of the
Canadian retirement income system, the Canada Pension Plan
and private pensions. In addition to an active information
campaign to convey the provisions of the bill accurately to the
general public, the minister has announced his intention to
continue efforts to keep members of Parliament fully informed
concerning program developments and to reinforce the link
which already exists between old age security regional offices
and constituency offices by continuing to provide the latter
with program information as was done during the initial
phases of the bill.
The minister bas also announced the government's intention
to broaden the options feature under the GIS and spouses'
allowance programs to provide compensation for reductions in
Canada Pension Plan benefits and for cessation or reduction of
alimony payments or of private carrier disability insurance
payments. This will be accomplished through amendments to
the old age security regulations which will provide for the new
option provisions to become effective with the proclamation
date of the present bill, which, as I indicated earlier, is likely to
be July 1. Meanwhile, the possibility of adding other income
items to the list used to determine entitlement to income-tested
benefits under the OAS program will continue to receive
active study by departmental officials. I am sure that some
honourable members would like to have some of this statement
elaborated on in committee when we have the officials of the
department present to help us.
Honourable senators, I have mentioned the provisions of this
bill which would create more equity within the old age security
program itself and would render it more consistent with the
other two tiers of the Canadian retirement income system. I
have also described the advantages to be gained from international social security agreements whereby the government
proposes, on a reciprocal basis, to protect the social security
credits acquired abroad by residents of Canada and of which

501

they are presently deprived in the absence of such agreements.
It only remains for me to urge all senators to support the bill
and thuspave the way for the government to move forward in
the important task before it.
* (1430)

Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators, I wish particularly to speak on that aspect of the bill which affects spouses.
Other portions of this measure appear to be acceptable. In
mentioning spouses I have reference to the spouse who is able
to receive supplementary benefits on a means test basis but
who loses them on the death of a receiver of a pension who is
65 years of age or over. This is a very serious matter because it
affects a great many people. In the other place, the government said that this provision affects 200 people per day. That
statement surprised me, but nevertheless it stood up.
It would not have been necessary to include the provision
dealing with spouses in the bill had the government implemented the recommendation concerning a guaranteed income
made by the Special Senate Committee on Poverty, and
contained in its 1971 report. Had that been done, we would not
have today those heartrending conditions and harsh treatment
which are affecting a large group of citizens. Moreover, if the
government had accepted that recommendation in the report
we would have abolished the welfare state by this time, saved
millions of dollars, and preserved for people both freedom and
dignity.
I therefore take this opportunity to say something about
poverty and the guaranteed income recommended in the Poverty Committee's report, which is now six years old-or six
years young, depending upon how we like to think of it. From
a statement that I shall read in a few moments honourable
senators will see that a guaranteed income will not be long in
coming. The implementation of that recommendation is just
around the corner. As a matter of fact, it is already knocking
at the door. The evidence is clear, and I should like to read
from House of Commons Debates of March 9, 1977, beginning at the top of page 3824-these words are important so I
shall read them slowly-where the Minister of National
Health and Welfare said:
In the course of the social security review, we have
proposed to the provinces a form of guaranteed income
which would cover income support for those unable to
work, whatever their age ... It would cover those who are
59, 58, and 57 years old, as well as those between the ages
of 60 and 65. We have proposed a program of income
supplementation, a program to supplement the incomes of
those still able to work and earn a living even though
forced to downgrade their activities and earn a lower
income than when they were active and in the prime of
life. The provinces support this broad concept. We are
looking at methods of implementing such a program. I
hope that by the end of this year we shall have concluded
reviews of techniques for administering such an approach.
The provinces endorse this concept in principle. However,
several provinces have indicated that they may not have

SENATE DEBAILS
the resources in the ncxt fcw ycars xwith which to providc
such a program 10 tbeir citîzns.

SENATE REPORT:

Poverty level set ai 50 per cent of average Canadian family income adjustcd to family size, making provision for inflation
and gross national product.
STATISTICS CANADA:

Updated cutoff is determined by adjusiing tbe low income lines developed in 1961 for increasing prices as reflected in
Consumer Price Index.
Revised cuioffs are based on cbanging consumption patterns wbich now indicate tbat families who spend 62 per cent or
more of their income on food, clothing and sbelter (as opposed to the 70 per cent criterion used in tbe updated lines) are in
straiiened cireumstances. These limits are also differentiated by size of area of residence. For example, using the revised
limits, the Poverty Line for a family of 4 in 1974 ranges from $5,527 in a rural area 10 $7,601 in cities of ½/million or more
people.

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Croll: There is no official poverty line in Canada.
There are basically four poverty lines, arbitrarily defined by
three independent organizations.
Statistics Canada's original poverty line was developed in
1961 and was based on 1961 knowledge of Canadian consumer
spending patterns. Essentially, a family lives in poverty if it
spends 70 per cent or more of its income on food, shelter and
clothing. This was the poverty line used by the Economic
Council in its fifth annual report in 1968, which recommended
the study on poverty.
*

(1440)

Statistics Canada developed a revised poverty line in 1973,
which incorporated more recent knowledge of Canadian consumer spending habits. Essentially, according to this, a family
lives in poverty, if it spends 62 per cent or more of its income
on basic essentials. This poverty line also takes into account
the fact that it generally costs more to live in large urban areas
than in rural areas.
The Senate Committee poverty line is based on average
Canadian family income, adjusted for income taxes paid as
well as for changes in family size, and it indicates that a family
is poor if its income is 50 per cent or less of the average
Canadian family income.
The poverty line of the Canadian Council on Social Development is based on average Canadian family income adjusted for family size. In terms of this a family is poor if its
income is less than 50 per cent of the national average.
To all intents and purposes, the Statistics Canada/Economic
Council's poverty line is obsolete. First, it makes no allowance
for family members beyond the fifth; second, the 70 per cent
criterion for basic necessities is no longer based on an accurate
picture of Canadian life. As the average family income in
Canada has increased, the proportion spent on food, clothing
and shelter has fallen. According to Statistics Canada's more
recent spending surveys, the average family spends closer to 60
per cent of its income on essentials.
People often ask why a given report has not been implemented, or, if it is implemented, why it was not implemented
sooner. As I will indicate to you in a minute, we are somewhat
responsible for this state of affairs ourselves. Beginning in
1957, our success in the field of investigatory inquiries has
been so good that everybody thinks these reports ought to act
like instant coffee. People expect that the day a report is
presented someone will say, "Fine, we will implement it."
Unfortunately, it does not happen in just that way, and I will
indicate to you why this is so.
Such things usually take time. We are by tradition gradualists. We have a record of taking measures, but we also have a
tradition of never having repealed a welfare measure that we
have once placed on the statute books.

I read to you slowly the statement of the minister, who said,
in effect, "We will start with those who are out of the labour
force, but we will also assist those who are in the labour
force." Well, there is no one else left. That is the whole show.
We do, of course, have guidelines.
Let me tell you why people expect so much from us. They do
not give us much credit, but nevertheless they do expect a
great deal from us. In 1957 the Senate changed its direction. It
embarked upon a course of conducting investigatory hearings,
and almost from the moment this policy was adopted it was
productive.
The first Senate special committee was the one on land use.
Those of us who were here at the time remember it well. It was
as a result of the recommendations of that committee that
ARDA, under the Agricultural Rehabilitation Development
Act, was set up almost immediately.
Next came the Special Committee on Manpower and
Employment, which was very successful, and it was as a result
of that committee's recommendations that the manpower
department almost immediately came into being.
After that came the Special Committee on Aging, which
was an instant success. This committee recommended that the
age for receiving the old age pension be reduced on a yearly
basis from 70 to 65. The government implemented this recommendation. The committee also suggested that there be an
additional income, and the government implemented that too.
When one looks around today and realizes that the basic
pension has been raised to $143.46 a month, that there is
$100.62 available by way of supplement, and that the maximum total is $244.08 for a single person, one must concede
that we have not done too badly.
Immediately after the Committee on Aging came the Special Joint Committee on Divorce. This was a very useful
committee. Its recommendations were generally accepted and
adopted, and as a result divorce was liberalized and
humanized.
Then came the report of the Special Joint Committee on
Consumer Credit and Cost of Living. It will be remembered
that Mr. Ron Basford was one of the joint chairmen of that
committee. Within a very short time after the committee
presented its report he was appointed minister in charge of
consumer affairs.
Senator Flynn: Was there any relationship between the two
events?
Senator Croll:
relationship.

Senator Flynn: He did not stay with that portfolio.
Senator Croll: If you will take the time to read the report
made by the Consumer Credit Committee some years ago, you
will find that many of its recommendations have been incorporated in legislation, particularly that respecting labelling.

SENATE DEBATES
Next came the Special Committee on Mass Media. The
report of this committee was an eye-opener for Canadians, and
it has been a textbook in every one of our universities since it
was published. It is the last word on the media in Canada.
Lastly, there was the report of the Special Committee on
Science Policy. This was the result of leadership in a field that
needed leadership-a field that was not too well understood.
Indeed, it is not too easy to understand all the things that go
on in it, and the committee undertook a difficult job. Nevertheless, the report has been recognized as something of value,
and that recognition has come from people who have competence and who have devoted themselves to this work.
There is also, of course, the report of the Poverty Committee, and in all modesty I must say that this brought hope and
dignity to many poor people while pointing the way out of
poverty. Moreover, it has been the most successful report in
parliamentary history. Beyond that there is not much I can say
about it.
Senator Flynn: Unbelievable!
Senator Croll: However, people still keep asking why reports
are not implemented immediately. Of course, you have to
understand what is going on in the country.
Senator Flynn: Tell us.
Senator Croli: Insofar as social welfare is concerned, we
began the century with the poor laws of Britain. That was all
we had. We looked after one another then, and we continued
in that way until 1927, when the old age pension came into
effect. From 1927 on we built up the welfare system in bits
and pieces, here and there, wherever we thought we needed it,
until we came to 1952 when we introduced universality for the
first time. That was a new step forward. We continued with
universality, with a few lapses here and there, until 1977.
e (1450)

What do all of these things mean? Well, I took you from
1900 to 1927, and that is 27 years; from 1927 to 1952, which
is 25 years; and from 1952 to 1977, which is another 25 years.
That is the way these cycles had to run in order for us to
mature. Nothing happens immediately. Do not forget that
when we moved from the poor laws to welfare, it was a long
step forward. When we moved over to universality, that too
was a great step. We are now moving into the guaranteed
income-part of it is already here-and that is also a very
important step. These things do not just come easily.
The present problem, of course, need not have arisen, and no
special allowance need have been necessary. We lawyers say
that hard cases make bad law, and these are hard cases. We
have provided for the spouse. When the husband or wife died,
there was no provision at all for the surviving spouse. When we
say, "You can go on welfare; there will be no destitution," we
forget one very important thing, that welfare is a gift but a
pension is a right. What we are doing now is harsh. I wish we
did not have to do it, but we must do it in order to bring in the
bachelor, the widower, and separated and divorced people, and
see to it that they are treated justly and fairly. So, we get back
to what we recommended originally, that need, not age, sex or

March 16, 1977

marital status, is what matters. So long as we deal with all
people on the basis of need, we are not likely to have that sort
of problem. What has caused all the trouble is that there were
gaps. What we have done in the past is fill gaps. We patched
and put on band-aids. We had quick fixes here and there;
nevertheless, they came apart. They seem to come apart more
quickly now than before.
I thought that by putting the act into effect in 1975 we were
doing something good. It turned out that it was not good,
although up to a point it was. When you find something just
will not work, there is nothing to do except correct it. In these
circumstances, I think none of us will walk out of this chamber
today without feeling a twinge of conscience about what we
are doing, but that will lead us to say, "Well, let us correct this
situation as soon as possible, and include those other people."
Once we do that we get away from this business of computerized compassion, where they punch a button and get something. There has to be more to this business than computers.
There has to be some heart in it. It is all right for the members
of the other place to say, "Don't do this; you are cutting out
these people." Well, in the short term I am sure that these
people will win themselves "brownie points" but, in the long
run, this will bring in other people who are not covered at the
present time.
I only repeat what has been said by myself and others, that
we are entering a new era-guaranteed income maintenance.
We have the minister's word for it. When that time comes all
of us will be glad. We are going to rid ourselves of a welfare
system that is muddled, expensive, humiliating and unfair, and
which has unfortunate effects upon welfare clientele. We need
an effective income maintenance policy which will require less
intrusion into the privacy of the individual person. It should be
made clear-and the minister attempted to make it clearthat we will not be "piggy-backing" on the welfare and
maintenance system. It will be an alternative. I do not say that
we will have a perfect solution at the beginning-far from itbut it is beyond question at this time that there is support in
the country for an income security systerm for those unable to
earn an adequate income. This will bring about a cash floor
under family income. That will be the next forward step in this
country's social security systerm which, upon completion, will
be as good as, and, in my opinion, much better than, anything
else in existence at the present time.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Senator Bélisle, debate adjourned.

HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO STUDY CAUSES OF
PERSONALITY DISORDERS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOURDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator McGrand that the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to
inquire into and report upon such experiences in prenatal life
and early childhood as may cause personality disorders or
criminal behaviour in later life and to consider and recommend
such remedial and preventive measures relating thereto as may
be reasonably expected to lead to reduction in the incidence of
crime and violence in society.
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell: Honourable senators, in rising to
support the motion of the Honourable Senator McGrand of
December 2, 1976, I wish to state that he is to be congratulated for persisting in this worthwhile endeavour against many
odds. He brought this matter to our attention on May 14,
1975, and again on December 2, 1976. In my view, the time
has come when the Senate should stop and look, and listen to
Senator McGrand.
Everything possible should be done to focus attention on the
number of juvenile delinquents, the number of minimally
brain-damaged children and the number of brain dysfunctions
in this country. These matters should be brought to the
attention of the public, to the attention of the government and
to the attention of the Minister of State for Science and
Technology so that funds can be made available to universities,
medical schools, psychiatric post-graduate schools and other
research institutions to ascertain whether there is any relationship between minimal brain damage at birth or in the early
years of life-prenatal, perinatal or postnatal-that influences
the mind of a child to the extent that it later could become a
juvenile delinquent and, at a later stage, a hardened criminal.
Some years ago our police were not always careful in
distinguishing between the diabetic who suffered from an
insulin reaction and a drunk, even though both persons oftentimes display the same symptoms. As a result, the unfortunate
and disoriented diabetic sometimes found himself in jail.
Today, due to advanced training, and also after some false
arrests, our law enforcement officers have become quite aware
of the similarity in symptoms, along with the extreme difference in causation. It is rare for police officers today to arrest a
suspected inebriate without first checking the possibility of a
diabetes-induced disorientation.
According to a book entitled Minimal Brain Dysfunction,
written by Joan Beck of the California Association for Neurologically Handicapped Children in Los Angeles, 20 per cent of
our school age population suffer from undetected brain
damage, better known as minimal brain damage or minimal
brain dysfunction. She also noted that there is a preponderance of male children affected by minimal brain damage in the

80003-34

ratio of six to one as compared to females. Similarly, in the
matter of juvenile delinquency, there is a preponderance of
males. A survey carried out in California in 1965 demonstrated that four out of five juvenile delinquents in that state were
males. A similar survey carried out in the same state in the
same year showed that the ratio of males to females with
minimal brain damage was six to one.
Just as we have trained our law enforcement personnel to
recognize the problems of the diabetic, we should be interested
in training them in recognizing the problems of children with
brain dysfunction or minimal brain damage and in trying to
differentiate them from other juvenile delinquents.
Although there is very little literature to suggest any relationship between brain damage and delinquency, there is no
doubt that many youngsters who have some minimal brain
damage or minimal brain dysfunction are often erroneously
seen as juvenile delinquents. We sometimes see children who
are hyperactive and hyperirritable, and who are constantly
annoying their parents. We see children who sometimes exhibit temper tantrums, who strike back, destroy their toys or
injure others, and in some cases this behaviour carries over
into adult life. Frequently, in these individuals an abnormal
electroencephalogram is found. Sometimes they even get epileptiform seizures, and sometimes disrhythmia in the electroencephalogram, all of which indicate abnormal brain activity.
The writings of Dr. Marvin Ziporyn, the jail psychiatrist of
Cook County, Illinois, suggest that the convicted slayer of the
eight student nurses in Chicago in 1966 had minimal brain
damage, and that this brain damage played an important,
although perhaps an indirect, part in the crime.
I do not say that all delinquents are brain-damaged, because
that would be ridiculous. It would be even more ridiculous to
suggest that all brain-damaged children are delinquents. But I
do believe that in many cases of juvenile delinquency there
well could be minimal brain damage or minimal brain dysfunction. Many children with minimal brain damage might
have induced visual impairment, and unless this is recognized
and treated in an adequate reading clinic it might well lead to
frustrations and to drop-out from school.
I do not believe that in all these cases children drop out of
school because of intellectual inability, but rather because of
frustration with reading problems. In fact, many of them
demonstrate average intelligence, and many score in a superior
range. If, however, the youngster becomes a school drop-out,
the road to the police station is clearly marked, and it is then
an easy journey to the juvenile courts and finally to some sort
of correctional institution.
I believe that we have reached the point at which we must
do whatever is possible to find out the causes of crime in this
country. I believe that there is a direct relationship between
minimal brain damage at birth or in the first three years of life
and juvenile delinquency in children. I further believe that
there is a strong relationship between juvenile delinquency and
criminal acts in later life. Therefore, if anything can be done
through research to prevent or treat minimal brain damage,

SENATE DEBATES
whether it be prenatal, perinatal or postnatal, it should be
done. In my view, there is a need for accurate statistics and
information relating to births-information as to whether
there was difficulty at birth, a vitamin deficiency before birth,
a lack of oxygen immediately after birth, and whether the
child suffered during the first three years of his life that might
influence his future development.

The Senate of Canada has an opportunity to meet this
challenge-a challenge, first, to inquire from the experts if, in
their opinion, there is a relationship between minimal brain
damage and juvenile delinquency. There is a challenge to the
Senate to find out from the experts how a minimally braindamaged child can be recognized by the proper juvenile
authorities. There is a challenge to the Senate to stir up public
interest, government interest and scientific interest and, perhaps, to add support to making funds available to universities,
medical schools, research institutions and others so that they
may find out why a boy of six becomes a criminal at twentysix. When we consider the cost today of keeping criminals in
penitentiaries for a lifetime, the cost of maintaining juvenile
delinquents in correctional schools, and the cost to our society
of young people growing up with untreated minimal brain
damage, we must sec that there would be tremendous savings
to Canadian taxpayers if some of these problems could be
solved at birth or immediately afterwards, and if those that
could not be solved could, at least, be treated so that the
children are able to function more effectively in this very
complex society. It is possible that many of them can be saved
from becoming juvenile delinquents or even criminals in later
life.
With these few thoughts I would like to add my support to
Senator McGrand's motion. I hope that it receives the full
support of the Senate, because we can no longer sit and do
nothing. The challenge is before us.
On motion of Senator McGrand, debate adjourned.
REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
CONSIDERATION OF SECOND REPORT OF STANDING JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, February 16, the
debate on the consideration of the second report of the Standing Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments.
Hon. Daniel A. Lang: Honourable senators, at the outset I
would like to express my personal appreciation, which I know
is shared by all of you, for the remarks of Senator Forsey upon
the presentation of this report. Certainly I wish to also express
my appreciation to Senator Godfrey for his contribution. In
Senator Forsey's case, I must say his remarks were, as usual,
erudite, entertaining, enlightening and, of course, for those
listening to the details they were certainly quite startling in
their revelations.

March 16, 1977

Senator Forsey's is a hard act to follow in this debate, but I
felt I should do so if only to underline the importance and
significance of the work of the Standing Joint Committee of
the Senate and House of Commons on Regulations and other
Statutory Instruments. The co-chairmen of that committee are
certainly to be congratulated for the work they have performed
since their appointment, and so are the members of the
committee from both this and the other place. They all deserve
our praise and appreciation.
I noted that Senator Forsey in his remarks again disavowed
his learning in the law, and I just wish to say that such
disavowal rings very hollow with me. I believe I can safely
observe that there is no non-lawyer in the country more
learned in the law than our friend.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Lang: I have generally a disinclination to join in a
debate on a report of a committee upon which I have not
served. However, as I said, I felt that because of the legalistic
nature of that report, and the parliamentary and legal procedures involved in the matters under its consideration, I might
be able to make some contribution, notwithstandirg the fact
that I am not a member of the committee. I had also some
concern that to the casual observer the subject matter of this
report might appear to be rather prosaic or tedious, and
certainly legalistic. Those descriptions might readily apply, but
I would like to disabuse anyone who, through seeing the report
in that light, fails to understand the significance of its contents
and, particularly, its importance to the maintenance today of
parliamentary supremacy within our governmental system and
the rule of law in our country.
The problems with which the committee finds itself faced
are not unique to this country. In fact, they are reaching
critical proportions in the United States, and certainly in the
United Kingdom. It might be useful if I refer briefly to some
observations that are current in the United Kingdom, the
United States and here at home.
Only last November, the lead editorial in the London Spectator dealt with a report of a committee of the House of
Commons concerning this very question of subordinate legislation, the proliferation of subordinate legislation and, indeed,
the proliferation of legislation itself. This editorial basically
urged the members of Parliament to take action on the report's
recommendations, and, in part, stated:
In our time, however, it sometimes seems that the sole
business of politics is the passing of laws, and in the last
ten years the activity bas become increasingly febrile. An
average of fifteen hundred pages is now added to the
statute book each year; frequently there is no time to
consider increasingly complicated modern legislation
thoroughly; even more frequently, as we observed last
week of legislation in the field of social welfare, parliamentary bills encapsulate political ideals that, quite
simply, cannot be achieved by passing laws. As Mr. John
Peyton, the Shadow Leader of the House of Commonswith his characteristic ability to call a spade a spade-

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

observed last week, many of those extra fifteen hundred
pages make up "an indigestible mass of verbiage."
I would suggest to honourable senators that that observation
could apply to much of our legislation in Canada and to most,
if not all, the subordinated legislation which flows from it, not
only in the federal system but in those of the provinces. The
editorial proceeds to express its great concern with respect to
the complexity of modern legislation and the poor drafting
which seems to be becoming increasingly prevalent. It goes on
to say that the House of Commons is simply incapable of
coping with all that modern government loads upon it, and
quotes Lord Denning's remarks which he made in recent
judgments concerning the imprecision of modern legislation.
So, the problem in England is not unlike that with which we
are faced here.
e

(1520)

In the United States, it becomes even more magnified.
There is a very interesting short article in the current Forbes
magazine, which was quoted by Senator Macnaughton in the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee this morning and
which I think is worth repeating in this chamber. It says:
An army of 100,000 regulators is to be found in Il
departments, 44 agencies, and 1,240 boards, committees,
and commissions of the federal government. Armed with
over 6,000 official forms, they comprise, in effect, a
fourth branch of government unforeseen in the Constitution. Their administrative decisions and regulations now
number in the trillions, according to (former) Treasury
Secretary Simon. Although such rule-making affects
every American, it is virtually immune from scrutiny by
the Executive Branch and increasingly beyond effective
control of Congress ...
It is estimated by White House experts that regulation
resulted in added costs totalling $130 billion in 1975,
which is more than $600 for every man, women and child
in the United States. The Government Accounting Office
calculated that $60 billion was sheer economic waste
because the regulations were defective! The complexity
and verbosity of government regulation is a source of
constant amazement. Consider that the Lord's Prayer
contains 56 words; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address has 268
words; and the Declaration of Independence includes
1,322 words. But a government regulation on the sale of
cabbages requires 26,911 words.
Honourable senators will recognize that malaise. Today at
home we have been seeing reaction among knowledgeable
people to our own problems, and probably no more authoritative a source could be found than the present Chief Justice of
Ontario who, on being inducted into that office, took the
occasion to say certain things. I quote from the Globe and
Mail as follows:
The federal government and the provinces are straining
the courts by passing a lot of unnecessary legislation,
Ontario's senior jurist said yesterday. Willard Estey,
sworn in as Chief Justice of the Ontario Supreme Court,

80003-34'/

used the ceremony at Queen's Park to raise the issue ...
Chief Justice Estey said that legislatures "have been
hyperactive" and are "cranking out any and all kinds of
legislation, whether it is needed or not."
That comes from a source which certainly has been subjected
to the pressures that this type of legislation puts upon our
judicial system and, I might say, that pressure is no less hard
on the parliamentary system.
Recently in the Canadian Bar Journal a Canadian corporate lawyer wrote:
A recent study paper prepared for the Canada Law
Reform Commission estimates that the federal statutes
alone create 20,000 criminal or quasi-criminal offences. A
similar number exists in provincial statutes ...
In the face of this mass of regulations, no man should
any longer be presumed to know the law. Such laws are
enforced by an army of civil servants whose livelihood
consists in enforcing them, regardless of the insignificance
of the contravention or the absence of damage ...
There were more public statutes in the 1950 Revised
Statutes of Ontario than were passed by all the parliaments of England up to the middle of the nineteenth
century.
So, honourable senators, I think this might paint some background to the task, the formidable task, facing the Standing
Joint Committee on Regulations and Other Statutory
Instruments.
In the words of the report itself, the committee's primary
function is to maintain watch on the subordinate law made by
delegates of Parliament. In its very simplicity, that statement
belies the vast scope and complexity of the activities of the
committee and the volume of legislation, both primary and
secondary, with which it has to deal.
Historically, it is interesting to note, Canada has come only
very recently to recognize the necessity for some form of
statutory supervision over subordinate law. In the United
Kingdom, recognition of the necessity to create a committee of
Parliament to deal with this problem first came, I believe, in
about 1948, and the equivalent steps were taken in Australia
some time during the 1950s. I must add that Ontario itself has
been equally tardy in coming to grips with this problem, but
that it did in 1971 with the passage of the Statutory Powers
Procedure Act and the Judicial Review Procedure Act.
The experience in other jurisdictions has clearly shown that
any mechanism set up by Parliament to supervise subordinate
legislation, and the exercise of delegated powers under statutory instruments, of itself is no panacea to the problem. It
takes years before the effectiveness of those mechanisms can
be brought to some sort of an acceptable level, and our
committee, as you know, has only been in existence since 1972.
It now faces, and will continue to face, what was experienced
in other jurisdictions during the start-up of these procedures,
namely, the reluctance on the part of the bureaucracy to
accept the audit and restraint procedures that are brought to
bear upon it. They will also initially, and I feel still do, suffer

SENATE DEBATES
from the failure of Parliament itself to appreciate the importance of this activity.
By way of background, I should like to draw to the attention
of the Senate a small book that was published, i believe in
1928 or 1929, in England by Lord Hewart entitled The New
Despotism. I know many honourable senators will be familiar
with it. It was certainly a bible when I was an undergraduate
in law school. I wish in many ways this book was compulsory
reading for anyone contemplating a career in the public service, and certainly absolutely compulsory reading for any
lawyer contemplating a career in the Department of Justice.
Lord Hewart perceived the danger early, and at a time when
the problem was arising in a post-war England. There was
then a 'proliferation of new statutes dealing with social matters, particularly social welfare matters and new taxation
structures.
His introductory remarks are still worth quoting and, in so
many ways, are as germane today as they were when he wrote
them. He says at page 17:
Writers on the Constitution have for a long time taught
that its two leading features are the Sovereignty of Parliament and the Rule of Law. To tamper with either of them
was, it might be thought, a sufficiently serious undertaking. But how far more attractive to the ingenious and
adventurous mind to employ the one to defeat the other,
and to establish a despotism on the ruins of both ... It is
manifestly easy to point a superficial contrast between
what was done or attempted in the days of our least wise
kings, and what is being done or attempted to-day. In
those days the method was to defy Parliament-and it
failed. In these days the method is to cajole, to coerce,
and to use Parliament-and it is strangely successful. The
old despotism, which was defeated, offered Parliament a
challenge. The new despotism, which is not yet defeated,
gives Parliament an anaesthetic.

e

(1530)

Honourable senators, I think some of the characteristics of
some of the trends that Lord Hewart mentions there will be
easily recognized in our own system. He also very accurately
dissects the bureaucratic mentality, and some of its characteristics are referred to in what he calls the "creed of the
bureaucrat", and it goes like this:
1. The business of the Executive is to govern.
2. The only persons fit to govern are experts.
3. The experts in the art of government are the permanent officials, who, exhibiting an ancient and too much
neglected virtue, "think themselves worthy of great
things, being worthy".
4. But the expert must deal with things as they are. The
"foursquare man" makes the best of the circumstances in
which he finds himself.
5. Two main obstacles hamper the beneficent work of
the expert. One is the Sovereignty of Parliament, and the
other is the Rule of Law.

March 16, 1977

6. A kind of fetish-worship, prevalent among an ignorant public, prevents the destruction of these obstacles.
The expert, therefore, must make use of the first in order
to frustrate the second.
7. To this end let him, under Parliamentary forms,
clothe himself with despotic power, and then, because the
forms are Parliamentary, defy the Law Courts.
8. This course will prove tolerably simple if he can: (a)
get legislation passed in skeleton form; (b) fill up the gaps
with his own rules, orders, and regulations; (c) make it
difficult or impossible for Parliament to check the said
rules, orders, and regulations; (d) secure for them the
force of statute; (e) make his own decision final; (f)
arrange that the fact of his decision shall be conclusive
proof of its legality; (g) take power to modify the provisions of statutes; and (h) prevent and avoid any sort of
appeal to a Court of Law.
Senator Flynn: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Is he sure the officials of the Department of Justice have
not read that?
Senator Lang: From the committee's report, I think I can
safely confirm that they have not, but they have learned the
techniques.
Senator Flynn: I think they have certainly read the last part
of it.
Senator Lang: Well, honourable senators, in fairness I
should mention that Lord Hewart does point out that in the
British civil service-and, of course, it is true in our ownthere are many, many public officials struggling within the
system who reject completely the creed that I referred to, and
indeed are probably quite aware of the mischief being perpetrated around them and are feeling quite helpless in their
struggle to change the trends.
Each year, as honourable senators will realize, the work of
this joint standing committee will be increasing. It will
increase as the volume of legislation increases or continues to
increase as it has over the past 10, 15 or 20 years, but, not only
that, it will increase as the subordinate legislation flowing
from those laws increases exponentially. To make matters
worse-and I think I do not hold this opinion uniquely-over
the past 10 years and certainly during the period since I came
to this chamber the quality of legal draftsmanship has been
seriously declining.
I now turn for a few moments to the report itself. As I do
not wish to go over again the ground so ably covered by
Senator Forsey in his address, I will deal only with a few of the
highlights and some of my reactions to matters discussed in
the report, particularly in relation to those forces the committee is finding itself pitted against in carrying out its mandate.
Senator Forsey made an excellent précis of the report, but the
report itself is a fine, full, detailed and almost legal document.
I would urge every member of this chamber to read it in order
to learn the details, the substantive details, contained therein.
The very nature of the subject matter of this report makes it
difficult to convey to a lay person; it is not easy to convey it to

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

someone who is just familiar with constitutional legal procedures and parliamentary procedures. What I consider to be
even more difficult to convey is the ever-present danger that
this report highlights, the ever-present danger to our parliamentary system. The disregard for the basic concept of the
supremacy of Parliament and the rule of law that appears in
this report is tragic. Whether this disregard is wilful or springs
from ignorance of these principles I cannot judge, but in any
event it certainly signals to me a real and present danger.
Notwithstanding the frustration that the committee obviously has experienced over the past couple of years, particularly in
the lack of cooperation and in what I call legal obfuscation
and, perhaps, downright ignorance-notwithstanding those
frustrations the report itself is couched in a moderate and
judicial tone, and it enumerates in detail matters of the utmost
concern to all Canadians, and particularly to those of us in
Parliament.
What I am really afraid of is that what is revealed in this
report is merely the tip of the iceberg, and that somewhere in
the dark recesses of our federal bureaucracy and unbeknownst
to us there are being ground out and formulated regulations,
directions, bulletins and orders which we will never learn
about, which will never be published even in the Canada
Gazette-all of it the very real stuff of governing a countryand we will not be near it. And I am terrified, too, that from
this report I must deduce that many of these directives,
memorandums, regulations, rules, et cetera, are made without
any basis in law.
e (1540)

Fundamentally, the committee is concerned with the following four abuses:
First, the exercise of bureaucratic authority over and beyond
the powers granted by Parliament under a particular piece of
legislation. This, of course, is referred to as a question of the
vires of the regulations. Senator Forsey himself dealt with it at
some length, and there is an excellent treatise on the matter in
the report itself.
Secondly, the committee is concerned with the exercise of
bureaucratic authority by persons other than those to whom
power was delegated by Parliament. This offends the legal
maxim delegatus non potest delegare. There is a very real
reason for that maxim and its enforcement because Parliament, in entrusting powers to designated persons or bodies, is
relying upon them, their judgment, and their expertise in
carrying out their powers, and not upon someone that delegated authority might feel could assume it from them and discharge it equally effectively.
Thirdly, the committee is concerned with the exercise of
bureaucratic authority under a pretended power of dispensation, that power neither being granted by statute nor having
any constitutional basis in the exercise of the royal prerogative.
Finally, the committee is concerned with the exercise of
bureaucratic authority pursuant to votes in appropriation acts.
These votes define and redefine the power to spend in ambiguous and confusing terms. They are carried forward, altering

509

the original purpose-in fact, legislating through distortion of
those votes and justifying that exercise or abuse as having been
condoned or authorized by Parliament. In a very real sense
Parliament is losing its control over the spending power
through misuse of these procedures in appropriation acts.
I am not sufficiently familiar with how these procedures
work to speak intelligently on them. I know that the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance is aware of this problem and is doing its best to check the abuses which the joint
committee has discovered.
The report enumerates many instances where these principles have been disregarded. I will not duplicate the report by
mentioning any of them this afternoon. However, I should like
the Senate to remember, when reading that report and the
enumeration of those abuses, that the statutory instruments
being examined by the joint committee are only those issued
since January 1, 1972. It boggles the mind to think of how
many statutory instruments and regulations were issued before
January 1, 1972 and which are still in full force and effect,
contravening the same principles as those with which we are
dealing today, and no doubt many of them are in existence
without any legal basis.
Even more serious than that concern-and that is serious
enough-is the concern over the obstructionism that the committee has encountered in the course of its investigations, and I
am afraid and sad to say that it appears clear from the report
that most of that must be laid at the feet of the Department of
Justice.
Honourable senators are aware that the full title is "Department of Justice and the Attorney General," and that the
minister is both the Minister of Justice and the Attorney
General of Canada. I am going to suggest this afternoon that
perhaps the root of this problem facing the committee may
well lie in the combination of those two offices in one minister
and the inclusion of both functions in one department. I
submit that such a combination is conceptually wrong and that
the distinction between the office of Minister of Justice and
that of the Attorney General is being lost.
Most honourable senators will recall the high honour historically accorded to the Ministry of Justice in this country,
and the distinction that the office conferred on its holder. I
think we would have to confess that that status is dwindling. I
am afraid that today the holder of that office, rather than
being, as he should be, the champion of the rule of law, is
becoming increasingly more concerned in justifying and
enhancing the function of Attorney General.
It is almost mortifying for me to stand here today and have
to remind people that the prime responsibility of the Ministry
of Justice is to ensure that the administration of public affairs
is carried out in strict accordance with the law. The secondary-I repeat, the secondary-responsibility is to advise the
Crown-I do not say department, but the Crown-upon all
matters of law referred to it. That responsibility must be
carried out in the most dispassionate, impartial and judicious
manner possible.

SENATE DEBATES
The Ministry of Justice in our system is, or should be, the
assurance to all that the government, in every respect and from
cabinet minister to the most lowly bureaucratic or administrative official, carries out its responsibilities in strict accordance
with the law. It is the minister's responsibility primarily to
ensure the rule of law in this country.
Let us compare that function with the function of the
Attorney General, which is to advise heads of departments
upon all matters of law connected with such departments and
to regulate and conduct all litigation for or against the Crown.
Honourable senators will see immediately that there are two
distinct roles in the department. While the Department of
Justice is responsible to see that the government obeys the law,
the Attorney General regulates and coordinates all litigation
for and against the Crown. The one function is quasi-judicial
and the other is merely that of an ordinary lawyer.
While the Department of Justice advises the Crown on
matters of law referred to it, the Attorney General advises
heads of departments upon all matters of law connected with
such departments. I think it is only fair to assume that in so
advising, the Attorney General might advise as to steps to be
taken to avoid the law-I did not say evade it-or to observe it
in a technical sense only, both, i presume, in the interests of
bureaucratic expediency. While the Minister of Justice, on the
one hand, advises the Crown in their mutual interest-namely,
assuring the rule of law in all our public bodies-the Attorney
General advises departmental heads as an ordinary solicitor
would advise his client. That these two functions are combined
in one department under one minister, in my opinion, denigrates the role of Justice and submerges it in that of the
Attorney General.
*

(1550)

While i have dealt, honourable senators, at some length
with this matter, I think you will forgive me for so doing if you
read the report itself. I think perhaps the report would be more
understandable if for the words "Minister of Justice" you
substituted "Attorney General". In many instances, the committee has found itself in an adversary position. It could only
find itself in an adversary position with a legal adviser of a
department, if that legal adviser was acting in his capacity as a
functionary of the Attorney General. Where is the Minister of
Justice? In assuring that the administration of public affairs is
in accordance with the law, the Minister of Justice's responsibilities are completely concordant with the objectives and the
mandate of the joint committee. One would assume that the
Minister of Justice would welcome the existence and the work
of this committee and would support its work-that he would
nurture the committee and assist it in every way possible-for,
in fact, the committe is carrying on a function for which the
Ministry of Justice primarily exists.
Senator Forsey referred to what he called "recorded messages". These are replies to queries by the committee and
directed to various departments and which, naturally, because
the matters are of a legal nature, are generally answered by
legal counsel to that department, whom I think in many cases
are seconded from the Department of Justice. To these queries

March 16, 1977

has come the reply, "To answer that question would involve
giving a legal opinion, which I am not permitted to do."
Another tactic mentioned in the report itself is a device used
by legal department advisers, namely, falling back on the
confidentiality of a solicitor-client relationship as between the
legal adviser and the department in question.
Honourable senators, in my opinion, these two pleas or
replies have validity only if the lawyer in question is acting as
a functionary of the Attorney General. If, in fact, he is a
functionary of the Minister of Justice, then they have no
validity at all. i might also point out that the solicitor-client
privilege is not the privilege of the solicitor; it is the privilege
of the client. The client is the one who is completely free to
waive that privilege at any time he wishes to do so.
I suggest that here we see a conflict of interest when these
two roles-that of Minister of Justice and Attorney Generalare combined in one department and under one minister. I am
afraid that if this situation persists, either in the physical
combination or in the attitude of mind of these officials, much
of the work of this committee will be frustrated, and Parliament will suffer as a result.
Honourable senators, there is so much in this report that i
could go on practically indefinitely. i am not going to do that
but, rather, i suggest a lesson we, as a Senate, might take from
the report, and that lesson is something like this: Primarily
today, more than ever before, the detailed scrutiny of bills by
our various committees is important. We have had, of course,
a unique capacity to scrutinize legislation in detail, and have
really proved the value of this institution in carrying out that
function. That function has become more important than ever
today. Accordingly, this area of our activity must receive our
attention as never before. Not only must we try our best to
ensure that legislation is drafted in as simple, comprehensible
and explicable a form as possible, not only must we increasingly guard against retroactivity and the conferring of unfettered
ministerial discretion-those matters that we have been historically concerned with-but we must increasingly watch over
the language of delegation contained in legislation. We must
increasingly insist that there be precise limits to subordinate
law-making power. We must guard against the use of language
which, in the opinion of the law officers of the Crown, would
permit both sub-delegation of rule-making power and the
power of dispensation in favour of individuals. We must ensure
that no enabling power confers upon the delegate the authority
to determine or declare the scope of its own delegated power,
or the true intention of the enabling legislation under which it
operates.
As I said, these are responsibilities that the Senate is
uniquely fitted to carry out. By way of example, i need only
mention the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, which
is now engaged in examining a bill which, in my opinion,
carries the potential of abusing all the principles discussednamely, the Borrowers and Depositors Protection Bill.
If I may, i would like to close on a rather personal note. I
share with many of you a common acquaintance with two men
in Canada today who, not being lawyers, have as keen and able

Match 16,1977

legal minds as most of my colieagues in the profession. These
two men have much in common. Both have an exquisite
command of the English language, and can articulate it to the
refreshment, enjoyment and envy of us ahl. But, rnost interestingly, they were both born in Newfoundland and, I would
guess, at about the saine tume.
Honourabie senators, you wiil quickly guess that one of
these gentlemen is Senator Forsey who, in bis address tbe
other night, delivered a most learned dissertation on the
history of the dispensing power, which conciuded in its abuse
by James Il and the resuitant Bihl of Rigbts of 1689. 1 suppose
some of us thought, "That's ancient history," and I arn quite
sure, from what 1 have heard, that many of the officiais in the
Department of Justice did not even know it was history at ail.
*(1 6W)

In iast Saturday's Toronto Star there was an article by the
other man, by coincidence deaiing aiso with the saine problem-the dispensing power-and putting it in the context of a
modern case with wbich most senators will be familiar, and
wbich was going on in England when I was in London in
January. The author of that article was Ernest Marshall
Howse, who is a former Moderator of the United Churcb of
Canada.
May I quote from that article and, because of its relevancy,
may I trespass upon your attention to quote it in extenso? It
bears completely upon the subject of our discussion this afternoon, and reads as follows:
An erninent English jurist. Lord Alfred Denning, bas
recentiy given a judgment, which, thougb at first littie
noted, may corne to be long remembered.
It is of the quaiity which couid make it a minor but
memorabie item in the heritage of freedom.
It brought a stern rebuke not oniy to the officers of a
powerful trades union, but also to no less a panjandrurn
than the attorney-generai of the incumbent government,
the chief iaw officer of the land.
It was an issue where the union of post office workers
bad decided on their own authority to cut off for a week
ail mnail and ail telephone calis to South Africa.
The action was iliegal; and the officers knew it. But
tbey concluded, as a spokesman put it, that the law
against obstruction of the mails was intended for highwaymen and footpads but not for themselves.
Tbey aiso shrewdly caiculated that the government in
its precarious position would not oppose them.
They were right. Samn Sitkin, the attorney-general,
refused to interfere. Further, hie warned the courts not to
interfere.
Tbe Court of Appeal defied the attorney-general, and
issued an injunction against the postrnen. (Which they
promptly obeyed.)
Judge Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, bluntly laid
down the principle that the law "must be obeyed, even by
the most powerful, even by the trades unions."
He specificaily stated that even the attorney-general
"bad no prerogative to suspend, or dispense with, the iaws
of England."

ENATE

Mi

Said Denning to Sitkin, "Be you neyer so high, the law
is above you."
Lord Denning was speaking in the grand tradition.
Indeed, bis action recails one of the most mernorable
scenes in the history of English law, and so in the history
of freedom.
It was in the reign of James I. Sir Edward Coke was
the chief justice of England.
James believed in the divine right of Kings. He went 50
far as to assert bis right to laws of bis own wiil, and to
judge whatever case hie pieased, in bis own person and
without right of appeal.
When the chief justice respectfuliy but firmly told the
king that he could not interfere with the iaw, the king
angrily replied, "Then 1 arn to be under the Iaw-which it
is treason to affirm."
Coke caimly repiied: "The king is under no man save
only God and the law."
Only God and the law!
In the classic conception, aIl citizens alike, the powerful
and the weak, even the makers of law, the legisiators and
jurists themselves, are equally under the law; and, even in
changing, iaw must stili be subject to Iaw.
One disturbing sign of the disintegration of our present
social order is the degree to which larger and larger
sections of the community feel that they themselves can
be arbiters of what iaws they may eiect to obey.
The notables of the Watergate scandai, no iess than
terrorists throwing bombs, crusaders threatening to biow
up pipelines, malcontents inciting arson and vandalisrn, or
picketers threatening whoever may oppose them-ail are
at one in their conviction that the law is for someone else.
Many years ago a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Feuix
Frankfurter, observed that if anyone in society couid
determine for himself what iaws he would respect, then
everyone else could do the samne; and this would înevitably
mean "first chaos, then tyranny."
Perhaps Lord Denning's rebuke to the postmen and the
attorney-generai wili have some influence in arresting the
chaos aiready incipient in our society and bring to those
who, in positions of power, have abused power, the
reminder, "Be you neyer so high, the law is above you."
Honourabie senators, in concluding 1 would like to say again
that the Standing Joint Committee of the Senate and House of
Commons on Regulations and other Statutory Instruments is
making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of the
rule of iaw, and that committee certainly merits our full
support and commendation.

THE ESTIMATES
MANPOWER DIVISION OF DEPARTMENT OF MANPOWER AND IMMIGRATIONREPORT ON REVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE

WEDNESDAY, March 16th, 1977
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance, in
obedience to its Order of Reference of Thursday, March 10th,
1977, has reviewed the recommendations contained in the
Report on Canada Manpower of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance appointed in the last session of
Parliament.
The Committee in the course of its review met with The
Honourable Bud Cullen, the Minister of Manpower and Immigration; Mr. J. Manion, Senior Assistant Deputy Minister of
Manpower and Immigration; Dr. D. R. Campbell, Deputy
Minister (Manpower); Mr. D. Toupin, Special Adviser to the
Senior Assistant Deputy Minister of Manpower and
Immigration.
In its report on Canada Manpower the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance stated as follows:
Parliamentary reports may be debated in the Senate
Chamber, but under present practice this is when the
process ends. The government takes from a report what it
wants, discards or ignores what it chooses, but there is no
way-other than by inferring from analysis of any subsequent changes in policy-of knowing what the government's reaction to it have been and why. This diminishes
the value of the report, limits the opportunity of a committee to learn on the job, and denies the Canadian public
the last and most important chapter of the study.
To fill this void, the Committee will invite the Minister
of Manpower and Immigration to comment on this report
and its recommendations, and in particular to explain
where and for what reason he and the Manpower Division
disagree either by letter or preferably in a public hearing.
The Committee believes the Minister will welcome the
opportunity to respond and that this would be an important step in completing the public record."
At the meeting held with the Minister it was revealed that
action has been taken or will be taken with respect to some 52
of the 56 recommendations made in the Report. Attached to
and forming part of this Report is the statement made by the
Minister to the Committee and the comments of the Deputy
Minister of Manpower and Immigration on the conclusions
and recommendations made in the Report on Canada
Manpower.
Respectfully submitted,
D. D. EVERETT,
Chairman

STATEMENT MADE BY THE MINISTER OF MANPOWER AND
IMMIGRATION TO THE STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON
NATIONAL FINANCE

I am pleased to have the opportunity today to thank personally the Honourable D. D. Everett and his committee for their
positive and constructive study of Canada Manpower programs and services. The report has already been, and will
undoubtedly continue to be, most helpful to the management
and staff of my department. It has proven to be most helpful to
me to have such a document to review shortly after I assumed
my portfolio.
Both I and my department are grateful to the committee,
not just for the many kind and complimentary remarks about
our work and programs, but for your clarity and candor in
pointng out where things need to be improved and the general
directions which you feel we should follow.
I will be tabling with you the department's very detailed
response to the many recommendations and suggestions which
the committee has made. As you can sec, action has been
taken or will be taken with respect to some 52 of the 56
suggestions we have identified. I will not, therefore, review
either the report or my reactions to it in great detail with you
today. I would rather take the time to deal with some of the
broad policy matters the report discusses.
We must, I feel, begin with the question of what the basic
manpower objective is. This has been stated many times in
many ways, but the clearest legislative statement is in Section
4 of the National Employment Service Regulations:
The aim of the Employment Service is the organization of
the labour market as an integral part of a program for the
achievement and maintenance of the highest possible level
of employment.
This objective, derived almost word for word from International Labour Organization Convention 88, is easy to state but not
so easy to achieve. To achieve those aims we must first know
what the labour market is and what the problems are.
I think we do now have a good understanding and grasp of
the basics of the labour market and the nature of the broad
problems. In recent years, we have succeeded in improving our
understanding of the causes of unemployment. Although a
precise measurement is difficult to obtain, the largest single
component of last year's 7.1 per cent unemployment rate was
the frictional/structural element at about four points; second
in importance were cyclical elements at a little over two and a

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

half points, and seasonal factors accounted for the small
remainder. Frictional unemployment is defined as the time
spent by those who are not working while between jobs or
searching for jobs. Structural unemployment results from a
mismatch-geographically as well as occupationally-between
the supply and demand for labour. In other words, frictional
and structural unemployment are not due to a deficiency in
demand but problems within the labour market itself. Aside
from the very important programs of job creation, Manpower's
prime focus is on the unemployment which is frictional or
structural or seasonal in nature.
The Employment Service
The prime instrument of the government for reducing frictional and structural unemployment is a dynamic employment
service and a well-modulated array of employment-related
programs. Both are essential-the programs to improve the
labour market and the place of individuals within it cannot
function without an effective employment service, and the
employment service must have the program tools to get its job
done.
I must say that one of the main messages which I drew from
your report is that we have perhaps done a better job of
establishing and running new labour market programs like
training and mobility and LIP and LEAP and Outreach, than
we have of strengthening the basis for all of that-the employment service itself.
The committee heard and reviewed considerable testimony
from employers. Many were complimentary about the service
they receive from us, but many had criticism to make of our
ability to find workers for them, or our ability to screen the
workers we sent to them, or our operations in general. We all
recognize that the people who are most satisfied are the ones
least likely to testify and I am grateful that the committee so
obviously took that bias into account. I must also say, though,
that I feel that these are areas in which we must try to bring
some major improvements, and I believe that a number of the
steps we are now taking will achieve that end.
My assessment is that, although we already have one of the
most effective employment services in the world, we can
certainly strengthen and improve it. I expect that the coming
integration of the Manpower and Unemployment Insurance
organizations will, by providing one-stop service for workers
and employers, be a major step along that route.
Some people may think placement is a simple task, but it is
not. Anyone who has hired others know that a perfect blend of
client qualifications and job requirements is infrequent. The
selection of a worker-or the worker's selection of a job-is
seldom based exclusively on purely mechanical qualifications.
It frequently involves personality, worker and employer attitudes and situations, work experience, desires, career paths,
and so on.

The manpower counsellor, either in the Job Information
Centre or at his desk, must deal with the world of the

employer and the world of the worker as they are. He can
counsel, he can advise change, but he cannot command it. He
must make the same difficult and subtle set of judgements in
referring people to work that the employer makes when he
hires. He must, though, make those referral decisions under
considerably more pressure and probably with less complete
information about the job than the employer has when he
makes the hiring decision. We cannot expect, and few employers would want, the manpower counsellor to refer only the one
person whom he feels is most qualified.
Although our Manpower Centres are a main factor in the
labour market and what we do often makes the difference
between employment and unemployment, between getting jobs
filled and having them go begging, we are not the only route to
a job or the only way to find a worker. The CMC system was
never designed as, nor should it be, the sole instrument of
placement in the marketplace. A full labour market operates
through many channels.
There is no reason why a public service should attempt to
replace what can be done satisfactorily through private channels. The role of the CMC is to make the market work, not to
do what others can do for themselves. Yet the CMC does far
more than fill gaps. It must be good enough to have an
accepted leadership role in uniting diverse elements. In each
community, the CMC should be-as indeed, it increasingly
is-the place to which workers and employers naturally turn
for help.
This does not mean that we should seek out placement
business that is being done as well without us. Volume is
important to our placement operations-but it is a means, not
an end. It is not in itself a measure of performance. Our
success is to be found, not in the number of placements we
record, but in the number of cases in which people and jobs are
matched better and faster than would happen without us.
In short, our primary function is to place the right people in
the right jobs. That is, fundamentally, what all our services
and all our various programs are for. We must, and will, place
renewed emphasis on this vital function. I believe this is very
much in line with one of the main themes of your report. I am
directing that we bend all our efforts to perform this central
task even better and that future evaluations report the effectiveness of our placement activities on the basis of the criteria
I have mentioned.
A key aspect of that renewed drive must be to provide even
better, faster and more effective service to the employers who
are our clients. Some eighteen months ago, my predecessor
provided the committee with our new "Standards of Service to
Employers". A review of the implementation of those standards shows that our CMCs have been making continuous
progress towards their achievement. The response of employers
to our efforts has been positive-our order cancellation rate
has been falling and we are filling more quickly an even higher
percentage of the job orders we get. Our officers have been
taking the committee's advice to get out of the office to sec the
employer and his operations-despite all the pressures caused

SENATE DEBATES

March 16, 1977

by rising numbers of unemployed, our employer visits are up
by more than 27 per cent over the level of two years ago.
When we do our job well, we meet the needs of employers
and job seekers alike. We do, though, need the active co-operation of employers and I am pleased to note the appeal that
your committee has addressed to them. I intend to strengthen
those bonds-we can help workers find jobs only by helping
employers fill them.

Local Employment Assistance Program is also being expanded
to increase its proven capacity to respond to the needs of those
who are disadvantaged in terms of labour force participation.
These expansions, and the establishment of a more permanent
planning horizon, will enable us to chart some new directions
for these programs to link them more closely to established
community organizations, including Boards of Trade and
Chambers of Commerce.

Manpower Training
Providing needed skills is an important way to improve the
match between supply of and demand for qualified workers,
and the Canada Manpower Training Program provides them.
I am in general agreement with the committee's findings,
especially regarding the recommendations suggesting a greater
emphasis on industrial training. An internal review of both the
institutional and industrial portions of the program confirms
the relevance of many of your views, and the new Employment
Strategy I announced last fall provided for an increase of $19
million in our Industrial Training Program.
My Department has already taken action on many of the
matters raised in the Senate recommendations. Some have
brought about adjustments in departmental priorities for 197778. Others are under consideration in our bilateral discussions
with provincial officials for a one-year extension of the Federal-Provincial Manpower Training Agreements.
For example, over the past three months, we have discussed
with the provinces, business and labour representation on
Manpower Needs Committees: the one-year-out-of-school
rule; the 52-week limit on training duration; and our concern
with making training more relevant to national and/or provincial labour market requirements. We have voiced your concern
and ours about the volume of federally-sponsored basic educational training undertaken through our institutional program,
and have indicated our intention to seek a greater emphasis on
skill training directly linked with specific employment opportunities, as opposed to academic upgrading.
To ensure a comprehensive approach to the examination of
our training programs, we have asked the provincial representatives to give us their views. We expect to have, by the
summer, a fully developed view of the necessary directions as a
basis for consultation with the provinces about changes in
training policy and possibly in the Adult Occupational Training Act itself. In this context, the Senate Report has proved
very valuable as a focal point for discussions.

Divergent Views

Job Creation
The activities of the Manpower Division in the area of job
creation are being refined and expanded. Building on the
success and experience of the seasonally-oriented Local Initiatives Program, we have introduced two new job creation
programs-Canada Works and Young Canada Works-which
will operate on a year-round basis for the next five years. The

I have dwelt at some length on the great utility to me of
your report and my general agreement with its views and
recommendations. There are, however, some areas-perhaps
generally of a more philosophical character-where there may
be some divergence of views.
Let me say very frankly that I do not accept the committee's
apparent feeling that Manpower does too much for the disadvantaged worker. Of necessity, our CMCs devote most of their
efforts to assisting the regular labour force member who is
unemployed, and to new labour force entrants. At the same
time, they must extend their services to all Canadians seeking
assistance to find work which will provide them dignity and
self-sufficiency. It is true that our services to the disadvantaged have been expanded and improved, but this is an area in
which we should be doing more, not less. As i have indicated
above, I feel we must strengthen our basic employment service
role, but not at the expense of help for the disadvantaged. The
"Statement of Canada" at the OECD meeting of Ministers of
the Manpower and Social Affairs Committee in Paris, in
March 1976, reflects these concerns. I am tabling this document and also the "OECD Recommendation on a General
Employment and Manpower Policy" which resulted from that
meeting. It corresponds very well with the directions in which
we in Canada must move.
i also find it difficult to accept the report's implication that
we should limit the role of the CMC to that of an "unemployment agency" and put our focus there. It is, I feel, precisely
that view on the part of some workers and some firms which
has sometimes tended to restrict our effectiveness in the labour
market. Our Manpower Centres must serve, and generally
serve very well, the employed as well as the unemployed, the
firm as well as the worker.
In a similar vein, I am convinced that we must provide
employers with the degree of screening that each one requires
in his individual circumstances. Some want us to do a final
selection which is just short of actual hiring; others prefer that
we carry out a pre-selection, still others really wish to see a
very broad range of applicants. We must, either in our Job
Information Centre or in our operations units, meet those
requirements well and precisely. Our counsellors must not
refer people unless they believe that either that individual fully
meets the requirements outlined by the employer, or they have
explained to the firm that its requirements cannot be fully met
under current market conditions. In the latter case, manpower

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

counsellors must seek the agreement of the firm to accept
referrals of people who can do the job, even though they do not
fully meet the firm's desired standards.
However great our responsibility to unemployed and other
job seekers, we must meet the key demands of the employer.
We must be frank with him when his desires do not match
market realities, and we must screen to the level specified on
each job order that we accept. We must do even better what
we now generally do well. We are, and we must be, an
employment agency, not an unemployment agency.

The Committee also heard from employers and associations
of employers, from the academic community, from private
placement agencies, from spokespersons for disadvantaged
workers, and others.
The comments and recommendations of the report range
over the entire spectrum of manpower programs and services.
In responding to the Senate, the Department agrees with the
vast majority of the Senate remarks. Detailed comments are
contained in the attached paper.

Concluding Comments
I believe that the Senate Report on Manpower contained a
very comprehensive description of the way we operate, how we
do our job and how we can do a better job. I have directed that
action be taken in a number of areas in accordance with the
specific recommendations you have made. In accordance with
the main themes of your report, we are making changes or
speeding up on-going changes, in our policy orientation. In
particular, we will give the employment service a renewed
emphasis. We will gradually slant our Manpower Training
Program towards industrial training. We plan, in co-operation
with the provinces, to reduce the earlier emphasis on basic
education training; and we will use available management
expertise from the private sector in job creation projects that
have solid community value.
In addition, we will bring about the integration of the
Department of Manpower and Immigration and the Unemployment Insurance Commission. Since the decision to separate the two was made in 1965, the insurance program has
played an ever-increasing role in the operation of the labour
market. Our manpower services have matured and been greatly strenghtened. Integration will allow a rationalization of our
two networks and the conversion of most service points into
one-stop centres; it will permit a streamlining of procedures
and documentation; and it will let us do a more comprehensive,
faster, and more systematic job of bringing jobs and workers
together. It will let us make substantial improvements in
services to both job seekers and employers.
It remains for me to reiterate my gratitude and that of my
department for the valued recommendations of the Senate
Committee. We are in a position to further improve services.
We will do so with vigor and determination, for the benefit of
all Canadians.

No attempt is made at assisting "unemployables". While

to new labour force entrants.
The Department is committed to assisting people whose
employability can be improved through manpower programs. This is not done at the expense of job-ready
clients. It is worth pointing out that there is no intent to
have manpower expenditures used as a substitute for
welfare payments. Therefore, in evaluating programs,
efforts are made to ensure that an appropriate balance is
maintained. This is an essential aspect of ongoing review

People are indeed selective. In response to this, the harmonization in the delivery of UI benefits and CMC
services has helped to structure job search activities. Now,
unemployment clients receiving UI benefits are exposed
to existing jobs. This helps change attitudes with the
result, as discovered in a detailed evaluation of harmonization, that those receiving UI benefits accept jobs much

service activities by two conditions. It cannot refuse to
assist any job seeker who registers and it must fill vacancies from persons registered with it. It follows that the
Division's first responsibility as a public service must be to
the job seeker and especially to the unemployed job
seeker."
(2) "To be effective, the Division must therefore seek
the understanding and cooperation of employers by
explaining the limitations which its role as an unemployment agency places on the services they can expect from
Canada Manpower Centres."
c) Comment
(1) On page 17, Dr. Raynauld is quoted as reporting to
the inquiry that "less than one in six job searchers find
employment through CMCs, although three out of four
contact the Centres". This supports the notion that a job
seeker must not limit his job search to simply registering
at a CMC. This fact is usually explained but must be
further emphasized to unemployed workers by manpower
counsellors and through the CJST.
(2) It would be inappropriate to limit the Department's
role to that of an "unemployment agency", particularly in
view of the fact that both the Division and the proposed
Canada Employment and Immigration Commission will
continue to serve as major instruments in the field of
manpower development, utilization, training and that of
income maintenance during periods of unemployment.
The need for improved cooperation between CMCs and
the employer community is, of course, recognized and
efforts in this area will be continued.

b) The Report States
"The employer who seeks workers should be given a
contact in the CMC who should be a manpower counsellor or a counsellor assistant. This is necessary to secure
the cooperation of employers and thereby to fulfil Canada
Manpower's responsibility to the job seeker.
The Committee recommends that the Division improve
arrangements for the receipt of job orders to ensure that
all relevant information is included and that the order is
an accurate description of the work and the working
conditions.
The counsellor contact handling the order should personally verify that appropriate action has been taken in the

CMC and that the employer is satisfied his job order bas
been given attention.
In order to keep the good will of employers, placement
officers should be assigned to a specific list of employer
clients. They should make every effort to become familiar
with their employer's current manpower requirements
through visits to the work site. Job orders from employers
should be the direct responsibility of the designated placement officer who should follow the order through every
stage from referral to acceptance or rejection of that
referral."
c) Comment
1. The standard of service to employers provides:
-that each employer be assigned "wherever practical" a
specific manpower counsellor who will be responsible
for delivery of services to that employer,
-that should the CMC experience difficulty in effectively providing service to an employer, the appropriate
CMC officer, together with the employer, will examine
the situation, discuss alternative approaches towards
solving the difficulty, and then implement the appropriate action,
-that there be prompt follow-up on orders,
-that an experienced manpower counsellor supervise
central order taking units,
-that each CMC have a quality control system.
2. The existing standards do not fully meet the Senate's
recommendations in that:
-The assignment of a specific manpower counsellor is
not mandatory,
-the designated manpower counsellor is not necessarily
involved in the follow-up.
3. In recognition of the fact that:
-each employer who seeks workers should be given a
counsellor contact in the CMC who should personally
verify that appropriate action has been taken,
-a number of counsellors will be involved in referring
clients to an employer if the employer uses the CMC to
recruit a number of different occupations,
-not all counsellors enjoy or are effective in dealing with
employers.
It is intended to assess the feasibility of the "Lead Counsellor" concept. The "Lead Counsellor" would:
-personally verify that appropriate action bas been taken
in the CMC and that the employer is satisfied that his
job orders are being given prompt attention.
-personally become familiar with the employer and his
work site.
4. With respect to order taking, the existing standards do
meet the Senate's recommendations.

SENATE DEBATES

a) Topic
5. Screening job orders in the JIC-page 25.
b) The Report States
"The Job Information Centre is an efficient method of
handling job-ready clients, thus leaving CMC personnel
more time for job seekers who require vocational counselling or training. The counsellor taking the job order
should be required to ensure that the employer completely
understands the limited screening of applicants likely to
be referred to him from a listing of his order in the JIC.
Referral forms should also indicate clearly that only
limited screening bas been given to the job seeker being
referred."
c) Comment
It is of no service or comfort to the employer to say that
clients being referred have not been effectively screened.
If a JIC counsellor doubts a client's job readiness or if the
counsellor is not in a position to carry out adequate
screening at a particular moment, the client should be
referred to a manpower counsellor for evaluation (testing)
and referral at that level.
The Department will deal with employers' dissatisfaction
with JiCs by informing employers of the trade-off between thorough screening and fast referrals, implied in
certain aspects of the process. Employers will be given the
opportunity to decide whether they wish to receive only
clients who have been fully screened.

needs and who should be directed to counsellors responsible for giving this assistance."
c) Comment
Instructions to this effect have already been provided. To
reinforce JIC effectiveness in this area as well as in
others, revised standards of service, incorporating these
principles, have been developed and will be issued to
CMCs shortly.
a) Topic
7. Placement officers and manpower counsellors-page 30.

March 16, 1977

b) The Report States
"The Division should, where possible, give explicit recognition to the functional division of duties performed by
counsellors in Canada Manpower Centres. Those directly
involved in the actual referral of job-ready clients to
specific job orders should be designated 'placement officers'. Those responsible for in-depth vocational and
employment counselling should retain the title 'manpower
counsellor'."
c) Comment
If the two functions were divorced, those who counsel only
would have very little knowledge of the labour market. On
the other hand, those who would deal exclusively with the
job-ready would priorize service to the job-ready. The end
result would be that only those who are job-ready would
receive effective placement services.
In addition, clients' needs are so varied and complex that
the categorization of service to them in rather simplistic
terms would be misleading. Moreover, the function
"placement" should not be viewed as a separate entity but
rather as a final step in the departmental "employment
counselling" process. Nevertheless, there is flexibility in
the role of the manpower counsellor as a result of a new
Position Description System adopted in 1975. This system
allows a certain degree of specialization in the manpower
counsellor role. For instance, in CMCs where the need
exists, positions can be described from a series of pre-written duty blocks to allow counsellors to specialize in
Employer Relations or Community Relations. In other
CMCs, where the need may be for counsellors to specialize in Employee Client Service (e.g. job placement counselling), a different series of duty blocks are selected and
the appropriate job description prepared.
a) Topic
8. Qualifications of counsellors-page 30.
b) The Report States
"The qualifications for an assignment as a 'placement
officer' in a Canada Manpower Centre should be a genuine experience in work, especially work related to one of
the occupations for which placements are frequently made
in that locality. 'Manpower counsellors' should have an
adequate specialized educational background for this responsibility combined with relevant work experience."
c) Comment
It is recognized that business and industrial experience is
essential to the proper discharge of the counselling as well
as the placement function. In recruiting new employees,
the Department seeks these assets. It is agreed that

March 16, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

precise knowledge of an employer's specific needs and the
requirements of an individual vacancy are needed in order
to make an effective referral.
It is felt that this added knowledge of a specific nature
can be gained only through more frequent and more
effective employer visits, and an improved order taking
facility. In industry, generally, staff in a personnel function do not have technical expertise of the area in which
they are staffing. Technical knowledge for the selection
process is usually acquired on the job and on selection
boards. This knowledge is provided by technical advisors
who work in the area of the vacancy.

b) The Report States
"Manpower counsellors should, as far as possible, restrict
their activities to the improvement of the job seekers'
employment potential and should refer clients requiring
guidance on personal problems to the appropriate
agency."
c) Comment
It is agreed that counselling should be restricted to
employment problems and personal problems should be
referred to other appropriate agencies. This has been
stressed in training courses over the years and more
recently emphasis has been given to it through the definition of the term "employment counselling". It is also
stressed in departmental directives (i.e. Manpower
Manual, Chapter 12, Circular 4-1) relating to the purchases of diagnostic services for difficult cases (where
personal problems are likely to be present) that such
diagnosis should relate to one's employment problems.

10. Smaller CMCs in urban areas-page 32.
b) The Report States
"In order to make large urban CMCs more effective, the
Committee recommends that smaller subsidiary offices be
established which would maintain contact with a central
facility. Such offices could more readily respond to local
needs while at the same time have access to information
about job opportunities and job seekers in the surrounding
area."
c) Comment
Agreed. This is valid and compatible with past and
planned activities. Large metro offices have been or will

be divided. The immediate creation of smaller CMCs in
urban areas is hampered by leases of three to five years
and by the added requirement that co-location with UIC
offices is to be arranged.

"For the same reason the Committee strongly supports
the Division's move toward the extension of the on-line
computer system in its urban CMCs. There are significant benefits to be derived from computerized recordkeeping which amply justify this expenditure. Not only
would routine paper work be reduced, but the link-up by
computer of CMCs in a large urban area would facilitate
the recommended extension of CMC service through
smaller neighbourhood satellite offices."

The first draft of detailed plans for the implementation of
the on-line system in the four largest metro centres across
Canada has now been completed.
a) Topic
12. Extended hours of service-page 36.
b) The Report States
"Canada Manpower Centres should be open at certain
times outside the usual hours of business so that job
seekers who are employed have access to the extensive
labour market information available in the Job Information Centres."
c) Comment
Agreed. Policy and current practices are accurately stated
in the following "In spite of the fact that each CMC has
the authority to determine hours of operation best suited
to their location, few are open beyond normal business
hours", found on page 36 of the Report.
Arrangements have been made in several CMCs to provide services outside the normal business hours. Such
extensions depend on the demand for service and the
availability of staff to work split-shifts or part-time.
It appears that it would be appropriate to extend the
hours of CMCs located where people congregate in the
evening, for example, shopping centres. A thorough
assessment must precede the future development of this
notion. This assessment will be completed shortly.

b) The Report States
"Those who use Canada Manpower Centres should be
offered a facility which would encourage comments on the
service. This could be a postal box number at the regional
or national headquarters of the Division. This facility
should be evaluated and the evaluation made public after
a reasonable trial period."
c) Comment
On page 38 of the report this recommendation is
explained as follows:
In dealing with over four million registrations a year,
standards of service-however well intended-will not
always be observed. It would assist the Division to
minimize the effect of assumed neglect if the client was
offered a facility for complaint. The Division has had
considerable success with the box number technique to
encourage its own enployees to make comments or
suggestions about their work. It is called Box (320).
The suggestions sent to it go to an office of the Division
in Ottawa. A similar facility could surely also be
offered to job seekers through well placed notices in the
CMC and in the literature about Manpower programs
given to clients when they register.
This is a very common practice in many organizations and
it is felt that it could be implemented without much
problem. A suggestion box could be placed in a strategic
location in CMCs. A procedure for reviewing users' comments and a system to prepare departmental replies will
need to be developed.
a) Topic
15. Increased promotion of mobility grants-page 44.
b) The Report States
"The Mobility Grants Program is an effective tool for
achieving necessary adjustments in the labour market.

March 16, 1977

The Committee supports the recent extensions of the
program and recommends that it be publicized more fully
to job seekers and employers alike."
c) Comment
At present, full utilization of the Program is being developed by:
-producing a new fact sheet for the Program;
-providing increased training to CMC counsellors on the
use of the Program as an effective placement tool;
-increasing the use of the clearance systems to obtain
maximum job vacancy exposure in CMCs and JICs.
It should be pointed out that the Canada Manpower
Mobility Program is designed to assist unemployed,
underemployed and about to become unemployed workers
who must move to find employment but cannot do so
unless they receive financial assistance. Thus, the Program is not a general transportation subsidy to assist
workers who are already mobile or who would move
without the assistance of a mobility grant. Therefore, as
mobility assistance is not a right that is available to all
workers who wish to move to employment, it is not
believed that outright promotion of the program, through
newspaper advertising or television should be undertaken.
Such methods would attract large numbers of persons to
the CMC who would not be eligible for mobility assistance. Instead, promotional efforts will be focused on
increasing manpower counsellors' knowledge of the Program in order that they will be more fully aware of its use
as an effective placement tool, and in developing publicity
within the CMCs.

16. Evaluation of the Special Job Finding and Placement

c) Comment
This has been done in cooperation with UIC. The direct
result of this evaluation was the introduction of the
Harmonization Program, which provides for a carefully
designed continuum of M&I-UIC services in which all
prospective claimants participate from the very beginning
of their claim-cycle. Initial operational statistics suggest
that the benefits derived from the Harmonization Program far exceed those of SJF&PD. The proposed integration of services is expected to result in further benefits at
lower costs.

Program must be continuously evaluated to ensure that
funds provided are in fact used only for this purpose."
c) Comment
The Outreach Program has indeed proved a necessary
complement to the regular delivery system of CMCs. Its
objectives are being reviewed to restrict the focus to the
hard-core unemployed.
To ensure that the program is effective, a thorough review
of Outreach projects is conducted on an ongoing basis.
The goal of these reviews is to assess whether the projects'
objectives are being achieved and whether funds are
utilized as reported. Corrective action is undertaken
where required.

18a. Services for hard-core unemployed-page 49.
b) The Report States
"The division must recognize that there is a limit to the
amount of hard-core unemployment that can be reduced.
Lack of employment is not the only difficulty faced by the
unemployed disadvantaged job seeker but it is the difficulty Canada Manpower can do something about,
through more efficient promotion and operation of existing services for counselling, training and placement."
c) Comment
The Department recognizes that there are limits to the
effectiveness of its efforts in this area. These limits are not
always easily determined, but it is not believed that the
Department has overstepped its mandate and has in fact
become involved in activities that are not employment
related only in an incidental manner. It is agreed that
manpower services to the hard-core unemployed must be
concentrated in the employment counselling, training and
placement areas.
Senate's approval of the recent measures taken to improve
services to the handicapped, by adapting existing programs and services, are appreciated. In the report, the
following were singled out:
1. the extension of mobility grants to bring job
seekers from isolated areas to CMCs;
2. the direct exchanges undertaken by CMC counsellors, welfare agencies and UIC offices;

3. the development of manpower policies through
consultation with Canadian Natives;
4. the delivery of programs and services through the
coordinated approach of the Community Employment
Strategy.
Efforts in these directions will of course continue.
a) Topic
18b. Employment for handicapped-page 49.
b) The Report States
"The Committee believes that many employers would
accept the challenge of opening new avenues of employment to the physically and mentally handicapped if
encouraged by Canada Manpower to do so. Improved
counsellor contact with employers should provide
increased opportunities to tell employers about this important community responsibility."
c) Comment
The Department is encouraged by the support that is
being provided by the Committee through this recommendation. This will influence employers' attitudes very
favourably. Cooperation from employers will be sought in
the manner suggested.
It may be of interest to add that the Department is
cooperating closely with the Public Service Commission in
developing measures to expand opportunities for the
handicapped within the public service. The Government
of Canada would thus play a leadership role in this area
and set an example for employers to follow.

making referrals. At the same time screening must be
sufficiently thorough that employers are not discouraged
from placing job orders.
In processing job orders counsellors must admit quickly
and frankly that they do not have suitable candidates
when employers' requests cannot be met. Underqualified
referrals should not be made by CMCs unless the employer explicitly agrees to consider them."
c) Comment
Present policy states that workers who do not meet the
minimum requirements, as stated in the job order, are not

SENATE DEBATES

to be referred to employers. It is further accepted as
departmental policy to advise the employer as soon as
possible if the CMC will encouter difficulties in filling the
job order. This directive is further strengthened by the
fact that should the CMC not be able to contact the
employer within a few hours after taking the order, a time
limit of 24 hours has been established as a mandatory
maximum period after which a CMC must communicate
with the employer.
Present departmental policy precludes the referral of
underqualified clients by manpower counsellors without
the prior consent from the employer to interview the
prospective candidate.

a) Topic
25. No expansion of CMC activity into temporary help

c) Comment
This recommendation is fully in accord with departmental
policy. In the federal-provincial training agreements, the
involvement of employer and union representatives is
provided for in order to secure their contribution to the
planning, implementation and assessment of training.
However, the extent of industry and labour participation
up to now is far from being satisfactory. Consequently, it
is intended to promote with provinces the greater involvement of employers and unions through such mechanisms
as the creation of a system of Manpower Training Needs
sub-committees which could more easily draw meaningful
inputs from business and labour, particularly at the local
level.
It should be pointed out that provincial training systems
and individual institutions generally utilize advisory committees of industry (and frequently labour) representatives to assist in the design and review of training courses,
thus helping to ensure the relevance of these courses to
employers' requirements.

b) The Report States
"The placement of job seekers who prefer part-time
employment is in general terms a proper responsibility of
the public employment service. It is presently fulfilled
through the operation of Farm Labour Pools and the
referral of job seekers to casual employment. However
Canada Manpower Centres should not set up separate
formal temporary help services for which they become an
employer of record."

"The Committee recommends continuation of the present

c) Comment
This requires further study as part of the CMTP Review.
Except for apprentices, our legislation requires that clients receiving institutional training under CMTP must
have been out of school for at least twelve months; no
reference is made, however, to their labour force status
during this period.
At present, it appears that this policy continues to serve a
useful purpose in ensuring that CMTP allowances not
provide an incentive for young people to leave school
prematurely. The current high rate of unemployment
among youth has resulted in suggestions that the "oneyear-out-of-school rule" be dropped, but it is believed that
vehicles other than institutional training would offer more
appropriate responses to this problem.
The Canada Manpower Industrial Training Program is
already developing or conducting numerous pilot projects
to attack youth unemployment. Trainees under this program need only to be one year past the provincial schoolleaving age; no minimum time out of school is required.

b) The Report States
"The Committee is disturbed by the fact that basic
educational training, an area which is essentially a provincial responsibility, is costing the Manpower Division in
excess of $100 million annually. The Committee recommends that this situation be reassessed and remedial
action taken if necessary."
c) Comment
Agreed.
Although the level of Basic Training for Skill development (BTSD) purchases each year has consciously been
reduced, BTSD still accounts for 25% of our current
expenditures on institutional training and is an area of
great concern in our current policy review. This matter
has been raised in discussions with the provinces because
it is believed that they should accept greater responsibility
for providing basic educational opportunities to adults.
As the Senate Committee recognizes, there will continue
to be a requirement for some form of BTSD in the
foreseeable future, but it is hoped that the scale of federal
expenditures on such training will be reduced significantly
without reducing the opportunities for adult workers to
develop their employment skills. Efforts will be made on
several fronts, including reemphasizing to our counselling
staff that BTSD must be provided only to those having a
clear requirement for upgrading to enter employment,
whether directly or through some type of skill training. As
well, it is believed that the entry requirements for many
skill courses could be reduced, and that, if necessary,
academic components could be built into the training.
Furthermore, particular attention is being paid to the
scope and effectiveness of Basic Job Readiness Training
and Work Adjustment Training for clients having special
needs. It is gratifying to note the comments of the Senate
Committee on the importance of these forms of training.

March 16, 1977

Manpower Training Program are more closely related to
current local labour market needs."
c) Comment
The Senate has implied here that courses are not now
related to labour market needs. This is an unwarranted
conclusion based on ambiguity of CMTP Follow-up
Survey data.
The problem of matching, both qualitatively and quantitatively training with labour market requirements is of
primary concern in any training program. It is worth
pointing out, however, that the employment rates
experienced by CMTP graduates and quoted in the
Senate Committee report compare quite favourably with
those for many similar programs in other countries. Moreover, there are technical problems in interpreting these
figures arising from the limitations of the methods used to
classify training and occupations-at least some of those
who appear to have obtained jobs unrelated to their
training may well be utilizing the skills their training gave
them.
Improving the responsiveness of training to labour market
needs may be achieved either through better planning or
through greater flexibility. Planning requires that manpower needs be forecasted accurately, and despite the
advances made through such techniques as COFOR and
FOIL this is still a very difficult task (as is acknowledged
internationally by, for example, the OECD). One key to
improved accuracy is the utilization of local expertise and
knowledge, such as we are attempting to tap through
emphasis on the involvement of employers and labour.
Increasing the flexibility of the training system to respond
to shifting needs has inherent limits; for training tends to
have high set-up costs which must be spread over adequate numbers of trainees if efficiency is to be achieved.
One solution, but by no means a universally applicable
one, is to utilize to a greater extent the training capabilitics of industries themselves, and our policy developments
are pursuing this possibility.
There is no single approach that can achieve the goal
identified in this recommendation. Rather, continued
efforts by both federal and provincial agencies are
required to improve the match between training and the
labour market.

The general spirit of this recommendation is already put

apply the specific proposal universally, however, would
not be feasible. Clients frequently do not return to the
CMC which referred them to training, making follow-up
by the original counsellor impossible. Moreover, the counsellor may not always be equipped or in a position to
assess the relevance of training.
Thus, while closer CMC follow-up of trainees should be
encouraged, the main responsibility for improving the
training itself should rest elsewhere-with the Manpower
Needs Committee system, the province and employer and
labour representatives.
a) Topic
32. Retention of 52-week rule-page 86.
b) The Report States
"The Committee supports the Division's view that the
so-called 52-week rule does not seriously impede training
for employment."
c) Comment
The limitation on maximum course length has undoubtedly served as an incentive for provinces to streamline
training programs and concentrate on essential elements
in course content. At the same time, however, there may
be a relatively small number of cases in which greater
flexibility in training duration would be desirable. These
would most likely involve training for urgently required
higher skill workers or special programs for clients with
serious employment problems requiring longer term training. The application of longer term industrial training
assistance to promote apprenticeship in certain shortage
occupations may also prove to be desirable. The identification of such instances requires the development of
suitable criteria and this question is being examined in
depth as part of the current overall review of CMTP.
It is believed, however, that the principle of restricting the
vast majority of training under CMTP to relatively short
durations should be retained.
a) Topic
33. Training allowances-page 87.
b) The Report States
"Allowances to support trainees are an integral part of
the CMTP. They are provided to encourage trainees to

complete the course of studies intended to improve their
employability. Referrals to training should therefore only
be made on that basis. The training allowance should not
be used to provide a temporary substitute for other forms
of maintenance."
c) Comment
While the allowance system and its application are under
close study with a view to eliminating any unnecessary
allowance payments and with a view to integrating better
allowances with other forms of income support, the
Department takes the position that the primary thrust
should continue to be in the direction of ensuring that
training itself is closely related to the employment needs
of individuals and the skill requirements of the labour
market. Income support through allowances should be
used only to facilitate such training and remove barriers
to undertaking it. The possibility that allowances could be
utilized as a substitute for other forms of maintenance can
only be a problem if the employment aims of training are
not asserted.
There is thus no disagreement between departmental
policy and the Senate Committee's recommendations on
this point.
a) Topic
34. Modification of provincial welfare regulations-page 87.
b) The Report States
"The Committee urges the Division through its representatives on the Manpower Needs Committee to seek
modification of any provincial welfare regulations which
inhibit participation in courses offered under the Canada
Manpower Training Program."
c) Comment
There is complete agreement that such disincentives
should be eliminated, and indeed this is one basic aim of
policy proposals now being developed. Discussions will be
held with officials of the Department of National Health
and Welfare to facilitate the participation of welfare
recipients in our training programs.
a) Topic
35. Increased funds for industrial training-page 94.
b) The Report States

c) Comment
Agreed in principle, but care must be taken to avoid
subsidy of ongoing employers' activity.
The Senate Committee's desire to see fuller use made of
the training potential of industry is shared. Moves in this
direction have taken place already. Further possibilities
are being examined as a part of the policy review now
being conducted. The Department is pleased to note,
however, that the Senate Committee recognizes both the
need for negotiations with the provinces on any such niove
and the continuing requirement for the expertise of the
present training institutions.
Potentially, a highly beneficial strategy lies in the integration of industrial and institutional training. This would
permit the strengths of each form of training to be fully
exploited. Pilot projects are now being considered to
explore various forms of integration or cooperation,
including assistance to employers for the purchase of
training from local colleges or vocational schools. This
latter approach could minimize the impact on the institutions of a shift in emphasis within the federal program,
while achieving many of the aims identified in the Senate
Committee report.
a) Topic
36. Institutional training in industry-page 95.
b) The Report States
"The Committee recommends the preparation of a pilot
training project to explore the potential of private industry to give trainees institutional style courses combining
practical experience with the theoretical background.
Such institutional training in industry might be commissioned on the basis of a review of competitive tenders
submitted by interested employers."
c) Comment
Agreed. This is present policy and many examples exist of
such courses already implemented.
This is in line with the concept of integration mentioned
in the preceding topic. Its essential difference from
present industrial training approaches taken by the
Department is that trainees are employees of the training
firm.
a) Topic
37. Control of expenditures on training (a)-page 96.

March 16, 1977

b) The Report States
"The Canada Manpower Training Program now absorbs
63 percent of total expenditures of the Manpower Division. The Committee recommends that strict control of
any future expansion be exercised to ensure that this
program is more directly related to the provision of
immediate opportunities for employment than it appears
to be at present. The justification for any future expansion should be fully explained to Parliament in the Annual
Report of the Department."
c) Comment
The Department also advocates careful control of training
expenditures and future expansion. Most of the training
purchased under the program is directly related to the
provision of immediate opportunities for employment.
Training purchases take into account the needs of the
individuals in local and regional areas in relation to the
labour market requirement. Manpower Needs Committees determine the courses required and are guided by the
Canadian Occupational Forecast Program for the intermediate range and the Forward Occupational Imbalance
Listing for the short range requirements.
Training of adults in courses more directly related to
immediate employment opportunities without considering
the longer term needs would be inappropriate and in
many ways in conflict with topic number 30 concerning
effectiveness and relevance of training to the needs of the
national economy.
Because the labour market needs are taken into account
when determining the volume and mix of training to be
purchased, the opportunities for employment are in fact a
prime consideration. However, to train adults for jobs
which are immediate and short term only is neither
efficient nor in the interest of the individual. On the other
hand, it is agreed that training should be carefully monitored so that training is not expanded in occupations
where a demand is not foreseen for several years and
where there is little likelihood of employment after
graduation.
a) Topic
38. Control of expenditures on training (b)-page 96.
b) The Report States
"To offset increases in the cost of mounting courses the
Division must concentrate on improving the effectiveness
of present manpower training. Courses offered should be
relevant to the needs of the economy. This is most likely
to result if more manpower training takes place away
from formal training institutions, on the job site using the
capacity of employers to provide courses."

SENATE DEBATES

c) Comment
This recommendation is endorsed fully and the Manpower
Training Agreements with the provinces make provision
for closer integration of institutional and industrial facilities for training purposes. Many Training Improvement
Projects are also directed to this end.
a) Topic
39. Student Manpower Centres supported-page 102.
b) The Report States
"The Committee recommends continuance of the Student
Manpower Centres because they provide a placement
facility for students seeking holiday employment as well
as assisting employers who require seasonal workers. It
also supports the public relations programs designed to
encourage employers to provide jobs for students."
c) Comment
Agreed. This recommendation supports the excellent work
done by CMCs for Students.
a) Topic
40. Annual reassessment of LIP-page 105.
b) The Report States
"The administration of the Local Initiatives Program has
been improved to the point where it has become a useful
technique for reducing the adverse effects of seasonal
unemployment. The Committee recommends that the LIP
program continue on a contingency basis subject to a full
annual reassessment."
c) Comment
The spirit of this recommendation is being implemented
in the development of the new comprehensive job creation
programs, particularly in the aspect of these programs
which will be operated on a year-round basis and which
will retain many of the best features of the Local Initiatives Program. The Canada Works Program, in its design
phase, has taken advantage of a thorough assessment of
the strengths and limitations of the Local Initiatives
Program as a technique for reducing the adverse effects of
seasonal unemployment.
a) Topic
41. Monitoring of applications for LIP grants-page 105.
b) The Report States
"The Committee recommends that in future applications
for LIP grants to initiate community projects which have
no clearly defined limits must indicate how the project
will be financed when the LIP grant has been spent. The

consultation and selection process for LIP grants should
be restructured to ensure that when a LIP project will
affect provincial or municipal governments they are given
an ample opportunity to reject the proposaI."
c) Comment
This is present policy and as there is more lead-time
available for the new year-round "Canada Works" program, more time will be available for consultation with
the provinces. This recommendation has been the subject
of criteria modification in the new program. It is of
interest to note that the proposed criteria for the "Canada
Works" program utilize almost the same terminology as
suggested in the Senate Committee Report when it
recommends that we distinguish between projects which
can be completed within a time limit and those which
cannot. In the case of the latter, the projects will be
required to demonstrate that they will not become a
burden upon either the community (through the creation
of a dependency) or upon other levels of government.
The problem which the Committee identifies in consulting
with provincial and municipal governments is less a problem of the non-existence of consultative mechanisms for
LIP than it is a problem of the time-frame within which
provincial review or municipal review of projects takes
place.
While it is anticipated that the first cycle of the new
"Canada Works" program will not represent much of an
improvement in this regard, it is clear that, for future
cycles of the program, the five year planning horizon will
enable an ample opportunity for program review on the
part of provincial governments. With respect to municipal
governments there is no formal mechanism for universal
consultation. However, municipal governments are frequently represented on the advisory boards and are also
consulted, in cases of possible effect, by program staff. It
is anticipated that, with the longer time-frame available
for implementation of the new programs, the Department
will be able to improve in this area.
a) Topic
42. Benefits of LEAP-page 107.
b) The Report States
"LEAP demonstrates the kind of controlled assistance to
the disadvantaged which the Committee feels is missing in
the Outreach Program. However, it is not enough to
establish the need for a LEAP project. A full and realistic
assessment of the possibilities for successful placement of
the participants should form an important part in the
preliminary planning."
c) Comment
Agreed.

SENATE DEBATES

At the present time, such an assessment takes place in a
general way, in assessing the feasibility of what is termed
a preparation project. It is clearly inappropriate to support such a project if the local economic/employment
conditions are such that there is no realistic possibility of
the participants obtaining employment after successfully
completing a period in the LEAP project.
In addition, LEAP Operational Guidelines provide that
submissions to the Provincial Review Board include "characteristics of participants and discussion of effect of
employment on participants during developmental phase"
(including participant turnover and follow-up information).
It should also be borne in mind that the clients LEAP is
designed to assist have, as a rule, a disastrous work
history and little apparent chance of success in the conventional labour market. Especially at the beginning of a
LEAP project, care must be taken to avoid "creaming"
whereby only clients likely to show success are taken on,
whilst those with more difficult problems continue to be
neglected.
As LEAP and Outreach have different objectives, direct
comparison of the Programs does not seem indicated.
a) Topic
43. Extension of LEAP-page 107.
b) The Report States
"The Committee recommends that contracts to provide
for the establishment and supervision of LEAP projects be
extended to suitable profit-making organizations which
agree to accept disadvantaged job seekers for a period of
training and possibly retain the trainee in employment at
the conclusion of the contract training."
c) Comment
It is agreed that the Committee's recommendation might
well be viewed as a subsequent step to LEAP participation, to provide for in-depth training and, in particular, to
increase the participant's opportunity for continued
employment.
Many of the LEAP participants, and indecd those for
whom LEAP has proven most effective, are those who
would experience difficulty in a regularly structured work
environment, or the more usual type of on-the-job training. The LEAP target group has been generally defined as
those with persistent difficulty in finding or keeping
employment. It is the root causes of these difficulties
within the individual or the individual's environment
which are addressed by the design of LEAP projects.
It should be pointed out that the existing Canada Manpower Industrial Training Program for Special Needs
Clients can provide for reimbursement of up to 85% of
wages paid to them during training. It may be, however,

March 16, 1977

that the greater flexibility of LEAP would be a useful
adjunct to this existent mechanism.
a) Topic
44. Contribution to Community Employment Strategypage 109.
b) The Report States
"The Committee recommends that the Division's contribution to the Community Employment Strategy be limited to direct placement, training and the Local Employment Assistance Program. Beyond that the Division
should confine its role to the co-ordination of the social
services provided by other agencies."
c) Comment
This recommendation cannot be accepted if the recommendation is read literally. Given the range of employability problems of the target population, it would be
inappropriate to confine the contribution of the Department to direct placement, training and LEAP. Since
many of the target population would fall into the category
of Level III clients, programs such as Outreach, Diagnostic Services and CMMP are just as relevant. Furthermore, it is jurisdictionally impossible for the Department
to coordinate social services. Finally, the role of community organizations (and the resultant funding implications) does not appear to have been considered in the
recommendation, and also in the text.
If one interprets the recommendation more liberally, in
keeping with the text of the Report, then it can be
accepted. The Committee does not seem to be querying
the basic objectives of CES nor its essential ingredients. If
the recommendation is interpreted as a general endorsement of the basic modus operandi of CES, i.e., improvements in the relevance and availability of employmentrelated programs and services, including those of the
Manpower Division, (or in other words the coordination
aspects of CES) to meet the needs of the target population, then it can be accepted with no difficulty.
The support which the Senate Committee seems to be
offering to CES seems a little inconsistent with their view
and that the Department has over-emphasized services to
the "disadvantaged". The same applies to LEAP. This
view derives from a lack of vigor in the use of definitions,
e.g., assuming that the "hard-core unemployed" are the
same as the "disadvantaged", and of statistics, e.g. the
table on page 7 which fails to give the percentage of the
unemployed who are at or below the poverty line. In
considering the Department's activities with respect to the
disadvantaged, it is important to bear in mind the nature
and characteristics of the clients, e.g., the fact that well
over half of them are relatively inexperienced and
unskilled.

49. Expanded public relations activity-page 127.

c) Comment
Agreed.
A prime responsibility of the Department is to create and
maintain the public awareness of the manpower objectives, programs and policies across Canada. In order to
achieve this dissemination of effective public information
on the department's services as well as promote its corporate image, it is essential that efficient national, regional
and local promotional campaigns be conducted. Two good
examples now in progress are the pilot "CMC in the
Community" campaign and the Canada Works Program.
Additional resources, human and financial, will be sought
to better reach these objectives. With increased funds
(present percentage based on program dollars for both
these campaigns is less than .5% of the overall allocation,
as compared with the average business sector ratio of
2.5%), it would be possible to carry out the advertising,
media relations, community and association relations, and
information market testing, necessary to continually

Prayers.

I look to the future of my adopted country with hope,
though not without anxiety; I see in the not remote
distance one great nationality bound, like the shield of
Achilles, by the blue rim of Ocean. I see it quartered into
many communities, each disposing of its internal affairs,
but all bound together by free institutions, free intercourse, and free commerce; I see within the round of that
shield the peaks of the Western Mountains and the crests
of the Eastern waves-the winding Assiniboine, the fivefold lakes, the St. Lawrence, the Ottawa, the Saguenay,
the St. John, and the Basin of Minas-by all these
flowing waters, in all the valleys they fertilize, in all the
cities they visit in their courses, I see a generation of
industrious, contented, moral men, free in name and in
fact-men capable of maintaining, in peace and in war, a
Constitution worthy of such a country.

ST. PATRICK'S DAY
TRIBUTES TO ST. PATRICK AND THE IRISH PEOPLE

Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, before we commence
our business perhaps I may be permitted to follow a tradition
that we have kept in this chamber for a good many years. It
has been the custom for one of usSenator McDonald: Or more.
Senator Grosart: -for one or more of us to remind his or
her colleagues that today, March 17, is the day of St. Patrick,
the patron saint of Ireland. It is a special privilege for me, as
one of the three members of the Canadian Parliament who
have the good fortune of having been born in Ireland, to
remind my less fortunate colleagues of that special favour of
providence and the foresight of our forefathers, and, of course,
our foremothersSenator Quart: Well, naturally.
Senator Grosart: -to put Irish blood in our veins, Irish
blood in our heartsSenator Buckwold: And some Irish whiskey!
Senator Grosart: -and perhaps a little Irish whiskey in the
cupboard for later on this day.
It is customary amongst us Irish on this particular day very
often to sing, "It's a great day for the Irish," but I think this
year, as in some years past, we will sing it with less
enthusiasm, because dear old Ireland now has her troubles. I
am sure that in this chamber, and beyond the walls of this
chamber, there are many Irishmen, Irish Canadians and
others, who will offer up a fervent prayer that in God's good
time Ireland will come through, once again, her present
troubles.
We are all conscious of the troubles that Ireland has at the
present time. I think it well to remind ourselves that in Canada
we have, perhaps, not what could be described as troubles but
problems, and in one way they are somewhat the same,
because theirs are problems relating to the constitution of that
land as ours are to our own.
For that reason, honourable senators, it occurred to me that
it might be appropriate to recall on this occasion the prophetic
words of one who was perhaps the greatest Irish Canadian of
all times, one of the seven Irish-born Fathers of Confederation,
Thomas D'Arcy McGee, who many years ago in 1860, in a
speech in Montreal, said what I think is prophetic for Canada
and for Ireland:
80003-35/

Hon. Andrew Thompson: Honourable senators, I rise also to
salute St. Patrick. Unfortunately, I cannot compete with the
eloquence of my honourable colleague, who has the added
distinction of being born in Dublin. My mother was born in
that city, and I feel very proud of my relationship with it.
e

(1410)

I rise to salute St. Patrick with all the exultation that is
surging within my Irish heart. In past years, sadly for me, I
have felt it has been a lament-indeed, sometimes it has been
a piercing, raging outcry, because I was born in Belfast and it
rings in my ears-for the ebb and flow of misery in my
mutilated, lovely island of green and mist. Previously, on other
St. Patrick's days, I have chosen melancholy silence to express
my feelings on this glorious day. But that has changed since I
recently returned to my former homeland. There I saw the
indomitable courage and deep compassion and, yes, felt again
the mystical, lyrical rhythm of Irish life, but now is revived the
crests of pride swelling that my ancestral roots are deep in the
land of Burke, Swift, Sheridan, Goldsmith, Wilde, Shaw,
Moore and Yeats.
A senator asked me before coming into the chamber, "How
can you be of Irish descent when there is no "O" before your
name?" I reply in the words of Sheridan who like many of my
race, and unlike the Scottish, would never have that quality to
become the president of any bank. Sheridan replied to that
question, "No family has a better right to an "O" than my
family for, in truth, all my ancestors have owed everybody."
The Leader of the Opposition-I hope he will not mind my
referring to his greetings to me on St. Patrick's Day, and may
I say that he is an exception to the rule of not having the "O"
before the name-graciously wrote to me something like this,
"You can lead an Irishman to water, but you will never make

SENATE DEBATES
a friend." I consider myself to be his friend, with all the
implications implied by that.
Last week I had lunch with His Excellency the Irish Ambassador and his first secretary, Mr. Jim Flavin. I may add that I
consider both of them also to be my friends. He gave me some
thoughts which he felt might be appropriate to express on this
day and, frankly, I would like to state them to the chamber.
He said he felt that, as a Canadian of Irish Protestant ancestry, I should take particular satisfaction in stressing the story
of St. Patrick, because St. Patrick belongs to no particular
faith or creed but is shared by all Irishmen, and, because the
Irish have a reputation for wandering, St. Patrick's Day is
celebrated by and with the Irish throughout the world.
Following on Senator Grosart's eloquent remarks, the
ambassador pointed out that conciliation is the keynote on this
particular St. Patrick's Day, because for people of diverse
religious persuasions, and even for those of no religion, the life
of St. Patrick is symbolic of the spirit of conciliation. I am sure
that all in this chamber have heard the familiar story of the
young boy who was taken to Ireland as a slave, made his
escape after years of suffering, and returned to devote his life
to the betterment of the people who had held him in captivity.
The moral of this simple story could, with advantage, be
heeded in these times of global anxiety.
St. Patrick's Day is, above al], a day of celebration, and in
Canada it serves as a reminder of the countless Irish immigrants and, indeed, the immigrants from all countries, who
have found a home here and who, in turn, have helped to make
Canada the great cosmopolitan country it is today.
That concludes the context of the message of Ireland's
ambassador to Canada.
Recently I read a book entitled Aspects of Irish Art-I had
been to the art gallery in Dublin, an art gallery which, I am
sure, Senator Grosart has visited as well-and the preface to
the book ended by suggesting that W. B. Yeat's definition that
Ireland was "like a naughty child delighted at being lost in the
great fair" really pointed to the fact that Ireland was one of
the remaining homes of humanism where the "strange fellow",
who finds it difficult to adapt in a bureaucratic society will
always be welcome. May Ireland always remain such a haven.
Senator Quart: Honourable senators, as a fifth generation
Irish-Canadian I would like to say that the wonderful speeches
made by my colleagues brought to mind a wish that I received,
on being appointed to the Senate, from our departed colleague,
the Honourable Senator Chubby Power, who, 1 am sure, is
playing a harp today in Heaven. His wish to me at that time
was: May St. Patrick hide you in the hollow of his hand so the
devil cannot find you.

CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
INQUIRY BY CRTC-QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, in reply to three
questions posed to me on Tuesday evening by the Honourable
Senator Smith (Colchester), I have obtained the following
documentation.
The first is a press release dated March 8, 1977, from the
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission. The second is a public notice dated March 14, 1977, from
the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Com-

In letters dated March 4 and 8, 1977, the Prime Minister
invited the CRTC to establish an inquiry as to the matter
of whether the English and French radio and television
networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
"generally, and in particular their public affairs, information and news programming", are fulfilling the mandate
of the Corporation as set out in the Broadcasting Act.
The responsibility of the Commission under the Broadcasting Act is to regulate and supervise the Canadian
broadcasting system with a view to implementing the
broadcasting policy objectives set out in Section 3 of the

SENATE DEBATES
Act. These policy objectives include specific goals for the
national broadcasting service.
The Commission has accordingly decided to undertake an
inquiry into the matters contained in the Prime Minister's
letter. The terms of reference of the inquiry and the
manner in which it will be conducted are under consideration by the Commission which will make an announcement in this connection as soon as it bas concluded its
deliberation.

CANADIAN RADIO-TELEVISION AND
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
Public Notice
Ottawa, March 14, 1977.
Comnittee of Inquiry into the National Broadcasting
Service
The Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications
Commission has determined that it is in the public interest to hold an inquiry into the manner in which the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is fulfilling its mandate, particularly with respect to public affairs, news and
information programming.
The Commission has as a consequence established a
Committee of Inquiry into the National Broadcasting
Service. The Committee will be presided over by Harry J.
Boyle, Chairman of the CRTC. The Chairman will call
on the part-time members of the Commission and a
number of other individual Canadians to assist him in the
inquiry.
In embarking on this inquiry, the Commission considers
itself duty-bound to safeguard three principles which lie
at the heart of the Canadian broadcasting tradition and
indeed of broadcasting in a free society.
The first is the principle of freedom of expression,
restricted only by specific legal requirements and
prohibitions.
Second, professional ethics and competence are paramount. Discrimination by reason of race, national origin,
colour, religion, sex, or political views has no place in
broadcasting.
And thirdly, the Commission reaffirms its commitment to
the principle of public broadcasting in Canada.
The Committee of Inquiry will report periodically to the
Commission, and will be asked to submit its final report
to the Commission before July lst, 1977. The inquiry is
being undertaken pursuant to the Commission's mandate
under s.15 of the Broadcasting Act, "to regulate and
supervise all aspects of the Canadian broadcasting system
with a view to implementing the broadcasting policy
enunciated in section 3 of the Act".
Section 3 reads as follows:

March

17,

1977

"3. It is hereby declared that
(a) broadcasting undertakings in Canada make use of
radio frequencies that are public property and such
undertakings constitute a single system, herein referred
to as the Canadian broadcasting system, comprising
public and private elements;
(b) the Canadian broadcasting system should be effectively owned and controlled by Canadians so as to
safeguard, enrich and strengthen the cultural, political,
social and economic fabric of Canada;
(c) all persons licensed to carry on broadcasting undertakings have a responsibility for programs they broadcast but the right to freedom of expression and the right
of persons to receive programs, subject only to generally applicable statutes and regulations, is unquestioned;
(d) the programming provided by the Canadian broadcasting system should be varied and comprehensive and
should provide reasonable, balanced opportunity for the
expression of differing views on matters of public concern, and the programming provided by each broadcaster should be of high standard, using predominantly
Canadian creative and other resources;
(e) all Canadians are entitled to broadcasting service in
English and French as public funds become available;
(f) there should be provided, through a corporation
established by Parliament for the purpose, a national
broadcasting service that is predominantly Canadian in
content and character;
(g) the national broadcasting service should
(i) be a balanced service of information, enlightenment and entertainment for people of different ages,
interests and tastes covering the whole range of
programming in fair proportion,
(ii) be extended to all parts of Canada, as public
funds become available,
(iii) be in English and French, serving the special
needs of geographic regions, and actively contributing to the flow and exchange of cultural and regional
information and entertainment, and
(iv) contribute to the development of national unity
and provide for a continuing expression of Canadian
identity;
(h) where any conflict arises between the objectives of
the national broadcasting service and the interests of
the private element of the Canadian broadcasting
system, it shall be resolved in the public interest but
paramount consideration shall be given to the objectives
of the national broadcasting service;
(i) facilities should be provided within the Canadian
broadcasting system for educational broadcasting; and
(j) the regulation and supervision of the Canadian
broadcasting system should be flexible and readily
adaptable to scientific and technical advances;

March 17, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

and that the objectives of the broadcasting policy for
Canada enunciated in this section can best be achieved by
providing for the regulation and supervision of the
Canadian broadcasting system by a single independent
public authority."
The Broadcasting Policy for Canada represents the goals
and values towards which the national broadcasting service must strive.
In this context, and in view of the time constraints, the
Commission bas determined that the Committee's mandate should be as follows:
1. The Committee will examine and take into consideration all representations from the public submitted
in response to this announcement. This appeal to the
public is based on the fact that the national broadcasting service in its entirety is owned and maintened by
the people of Canada;
2. The Committee will conduct interviews with members of the CBC and of the public in order to gain a
fuller understanding of how information and other programming is perceived by them, and actually carried
out;
3. The Committee will undertake research on specific
matters related to programming and scheduling, as well
as on the historical relationship between the French
language and English language services of the CBC;
4. The Committee may selectively analyze particular
programmes.
The public is hereby invited to submit in writing information and comment relevant to a proper assessment of the
manner in which the CBC carries out its mandate. Any
representations about specific programs that the public
may wish to bring to the Committee's attention should be
as factual as possible. The Committee would appreciate
receiving letters by April 15, 1977, and they should be
sent to the undersigned at 100 Metcalfe Street, Ottawa,
Ontario KI A ON2.
Lise Ouimet
Acting Secretary General
CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
Press Release
Ottawa:
AI Johnson, President of the CBC, responded today to the
March 14 announcement by the CRTC of the proposed
terms of reference of the "Committee of Inquiry into the
National Broadcasting Service".
"Parliament has empowered the CRTC to supervise the
broadcasting system," said Johnson, "and the Board of
Directors of the CBC accepts the inquiry under this
provision of the law. Moreover the CBC is anxious to
clear the air of the sweeping allegations which recently
were made in the political arena against the CBC. The

Board did, however, express some reservations concerning
the lack of precision as to the objectives of the inquiry,
and the manner in which it will be conducted."
The President said that he and the Board welcome the
fact that the Chairman of the CRTC, Harry Boyle, will
preside over the inquiry. "We are confident, as we said
before", said Johnson, "that Mr. Boyle is seeking out
people of the highest public and journalistic credibility to
make the independent, objective and professional judgments which this very difficult inquiry will demand."
The CBC also welcomes the statement of principles
outlined in the March 14 announcement by which the
CRTC bas said it will be guided in the conduct of its
inquiry. "These principles are utterly fundamental to the
preservation of the CBC and its independence from political interference. It is this independence which I as President have asserted unequivocally in the past few weeks,"
said Johnson.
The Board of Directors of the CBC recognizes that the
CRTC is not yet in a position to define its precise terms of
reference and manner of operation. However, the kind of
participation and cooperation which will be called for
from the Corporation will necessarily depend upon which
course or courses the CRTC's Committee adopts.
In its Public Notice of March 14 the Commission invited
the public "to submit in writing information and comments relevant to a proper assessment of the manner in
which the CBC carries out its mandate", and it asked that
"any representation about specific programs that the
public may wish to bring to the Committee's attention
should be as factual as possible". The CBC gathers that
the breadth and nature of the comments received will
materially influence the type of inquiry to be undertaken.
One possible course for the Committee would be to
investigate specific allegations that the CBC is guilty of
bias or lack of balance in certain of its news and current
affairs programs-allegations which in the political arena
at least, have been very vigorously pursued.
Specific complaints of this kind can only be judged in the
context of the totality of CBC news and public affairs
programs. Individual perceptions of a particular element
of a particular program cannot be judged in isolation, if a
fair judgment about alleged bias or lack of balance is to
be made: such perceptions must be examined in the
context of the whole program, then in the context of a
representative selection of the programs in the series
concerned, and finally in the context of the totality of
news and public affairs programs.
Another possible approach of the CRTC's Committee
would be to seek to make a judgment as to whether the
CBC is fulfilling those parts of its mandate which apply
particularly to news and public affairs programs.
To review in this way the whole of the CBC's mandate, as
it applies to news and public affairs programming, would
call for a quite different approach. In the judgment of the

SENATE DEBATES
Board of the CBC what would be required would be a
comprehensive review of the whole range of news and
current affairs programming, its scale and its content.
Such a review would, in the view of the CBC, be very
difficult to carry out in the time available.
A third approach would be necessary should the Committee decide that the information and comments submitted
to it required a full examination of all aspects of the
manner in which the Corporation discharges its mandate.
Such an examination, which could only be based upon a
detailed analysis of the entire range of CBC national,
regional and local programming in English and French
seems to the CBC to be clearly impossible in the time
available. Moreover it would tend to go over again much
of the ground covered by the February 1974 network
licence renewal hearings during which the CRTC extensively solicited public comment on CBC programming,
and it would anticipate discussion which will properly be
the subject of the next network licence hearings scheduled
for 1979.
The most any examination could produce at this time, in
the opinion of the CBC, would be a compendium of views
of the Corporation's programming received from interested individuals and groups. Such a compilation of public
perceptions might prove to be useful to the Corporation as
a form of interim representation prior to the formai
hearings in 1979. For in the final analysis the Corporation's programming is its witness, whatever the context in
which judgments are made.
In order not to abrogate the responsibility of the Corporation to Parliament for the decisions it takes, any judgment
the Committec might make would properly be referred to
the Board of Directors of the CBC, to be taken into
account by it in making the decisions it is called upon to
make under the Broadcasting Act.
"Whichever course the CRTC Committee finally settles
upon," said Johnson, "the Board of Directors of the CBC
is fully confident that the inquiry will be conducted with
the kind of thoroughness, objectivity, and professionalism
which is called for under the difficult circumstances
which confront the CRTC. For the future of the CBC,
and of public broadcasting in Canada, is at stake".

I will not comment on the answers, not having had a chance

advantage of Senator Langlois's kindness in saying that he
would take some further concern with the matter, if I did. I
must say, however, it seems to me that, if a question is asked in
this house, it is entitled to be answered here in such a way as to
be a direct answer rather than a repetition of an answer to
another question obviously dealing with the same matter but in

OLD AGE SECURITY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Rowe for second reading of Bill C-35, to
amend the Old Age Security Act.
Hon. Rhéal Bélisie: Honourable senators, I hope my Irish
Canadian friends will give me the green light to speak on this
their most celebrated day, but on a different subject.
Senator Flynn: Why not?
[Translation]
Senator Bélisle: Honourable senators, this being the first
time this year that I have had the opportunity to speak in the
Senate and take part in the discussion, I would like to congratulate Madam Speaker, who has been directing our proceedings for a few years. She has been discharging her duties
in the Senate and elsewhere with grace and charm. I feel that
she has considerably enhanced the prestige of the Senate in the
minds of Canadians generally and Ottawa residents more
particularly. I am pleased to sec you in the Chair as usual,
Madam Speaker, and I hope that all senators will be aware of
your understanding patience.
I would also like to congratulate the new senators who have
joined us since the last session. Two among them, namely,
Senators Ewasew and Rizzuto, are for me new faces and
names since I never had the opportunity to meet them before
their appointment to the Senate. This first contact was a real
pleasure for me and also for them, at least I hope so. I expect
that our dealings over the years will enable us to become better
acquainted and that through them the Senate will further
contribute to the public good.
Senator Marchand, of course, does not need any introduction. He surely stood out in the Canadian community when
playing his role in the other place. His first speech in the
Senate was for me a breath of fresh air. I liked it. I appreciated it. I knew he could make such a contribution. I hope he will
continue for many years to let the Senate benefit from of his
long experience, his wit and his charm.
Senator Steuart is a newcomer to the Senate, but he is
surely not unknown in western Canada. I hope that his health
will enable him to continue to serve western Canada and the
entire country.

March 17, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

[English]
Honourable senators, may I offer my congratulations to
Senator Rowe for the explicit way in which he introduced this
important bill. To follow Senator Croll is not an easy task.
When he was chairman of the Special Senate Committee on

Poverty I was always impressed by his knowledge of and care
for the needy and the poor. He and Senator Rowe had long
and distinguished careers in their respective legislatures of
Newfoundland and Ontario, and both were in the House of
Commons before entering this chamber.
Honourable senators, the question of old age pensions first
began to attract considerable attention during the session of
1906-07. The first legislative action of the Canadian Parliament in this field was the passage of the Government Annuities Act in 1908. This was followed by a series of committees
which studied the problems of the aged. In 1924 a special
committee of the House of Commons recommended that an
old age pension system be established for indigent persons
aged 70 and over; that the pensions be payable to British
subjects of at least 20 years' residence; that the maximum rate
be $20 a month; and that one-half the cost be borne by the
federal government. These resolutions were submitted to the
provincial governments in 1925, and were then embodied in a
federal bill which was introduced and passed by the House of
Commons in 1926, but which, let us note, was rejected by the
Senate. In 1927 the same bill was reintroduced and was passed
by both the House of Commons and the Senate.
The Old Age Pensions Act offered federal grants-in-aid to
any province which would pass enabling legislation and sign an
agreement with the federal government for the payment of old
age pensions. Under the agreement, administration was left in
the hands of the provincial governments. Under this program,
assistance was given to Canadian citizens or British subjects of
70 years of age or more, who met residence requirements and
qualified under a means test. This first pension program was
characterized by a wide variation in the extent of participation
by a province and in the application of the means test.
Thus, in 1950 a Joint Committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons was appointed to examine the subject of a
universal old age security system. A year later, the Old Age
Security Act was passed. This act, effective January, 1952,
provided flat rate benefits for everyone who met age and
residence requirements.
In 1963 a special committee of the Senate was appointed to
examine the problems involved in the promotion of the welfare
of the aged and aging persons. When the special committee
tabled its report in the Senate on February 2, 1966, its first
recommendation was that the federal government begin to
study the institution of an income guarantee program for all
persons aged 65 and over. There has been action on this
recommendation. Beginning in 1966 the qualifying age for old
age security pensions was reduced annually by one year so that
by 1970 the plan was universal for all individuals 65 years and
over, and in 1966 the guaranteed income supplement program
was introduced through an amendment to the Old Age Security Act. This program provides a supplement to pensioners

80003-36

with little or no income other than the old age security
pension. In 1972 legislation was passed that assured that
benefit levels would be fully adjusted once a year based on the
consumer price index. The idea of the price index is not new,
as it was advocated most forcefully by the former Leader of
the Opposition in the other house, the Honourable Robert
Stanfield. It is obvious that this idea of indexing wages,
salaries and pensions has great merit, because it was quickly
taken up by the Honourable John Turner, the former Minister
of Finance, after he attempted to refute it. A year later it was
announced that adjustments would be made quarterly, commencing in October, 1973.
There are now approximately 1.9 million old age security
pensioners, representing about 8 per cent of the total population, and I wish to emphasize that nearly 60 per cent of
pensioners now receive the guaranteed income supplement. In
other words, those who built the country are not rich; those
who made a large contribution to it need the supplement.
Before looking at the proposed amendments to the Old Age
Security Act, it is worthwhile summarizing the general terms
of eligibility as they stand at present. Currently a person must
have resided in Canada for at least 10 years immediately
before his application for the old age security pension is
approved or, if he has not resided in Canada during this entire
10-year period, he must (1) have been present in Canada
before this period and after the age of 18 for periods that equal
at least three times the length of his absences from the country
during the 10-year period; (2) have resided in Canada for the
year immediately preceding the date his application is
approved; or (3) he must have resided in Canada for a total of
40 years since the age of 18. If he meets this last requirement,
he does not have to be residing in Canada when he applies for
the pension.
e

(1440)

A pensioner who is entitled to the old age security pension,
and who has resided in Canada for a total of 20 years since the
age of 18, can continue to receive the pension whether or not
he resides in Canada; otherwise, he is entitled to the pension
for the month he leaves Canada and six further months only.
If he bas not returned to Canada at the end of that period,
payment is suspended but may be resumed when he returns.
A person cannot receive the old age pension until he reaches
the age of 65. A pensioner's spouse, who is between the ages of
60 and 65, may be eligible for a spouse's allowance upon
submission to an income test.
Bill C-35 has two main objectives and they are, first, to
provide a single eligibility requirement for the old age security
pension, and, secondly, to provide enabling legislation for
reciprocal agreements with other countries with respect to old
age security pensions.
Let me discuss the single eligibility requirement. Instead of
the present formula, whereby one may qualify for an old age
security pension in a number of ways, the pension will be
earned for each year of residency in Canada after age 18, up
to a maximum of 40 years. Partial pensions will be available to

order to purchase the necessities of life. After all, the person
has already proven the necessity of such an allowance. The
government should consider this aspect of the Old Age Security Act, and rectify this unfortunate situation.
Bill C-35 is a progressive piece of legislation, but it deserves
the criticism it has received in the two or three areas I have
mentioned, and I believe that the Standing Senate Committee
on Health, Welfare and Science should scrutinize the bona
fide request I have made. However, I would like to emphasize
the necessity of having adequate publicity of the proposed
changes so that members of the public will know and understand their rights in respect of old age security pensions.
Furthermore, it is imperative that the rules of this pension
system be fully explained so that the public will be able to
decide when and how to apply for pension benefits.

Canada, made a passionate speech on further welfare needs in
Canada, particularly of those who are in the grey zones and
those who may be caught by some exigencies of fate, especially
widows who are getting along in years.
There are a great many aspects of social welfare that still
need to be dealt with, and I say that in spite of the fact, which
I have publicly acknowledged on many occasion, that in my
view Canada has one of the most enlightened systems of social
welfare in the entire world. It is not the best. I think the best
would probably be found in two or three smaller countries,
such as New Zealand and Sweden, but certainly it is one of the
best; of the middle and larger countries I think it probably is
the best, and we can be proud of it. Many people from the
underdeveloped countries of the world, the so-called Third
World, are anxious to take up residence in Canada, and that, I
think, is a reflection of their recognition of the fact that,
among other things, we do have a very comprehensive system
of social welfare.
Having said that, I maintain that we cannot be complacent,
because all of us who have had experience of public lifewhich I think applies to everybody in this house-or, for that
matter, in professional life, must know that there are great
social and welfare needs in Canada that have not as yet been
dealt with effectively. As I have mentioned here on several
occasions, there are the needs of the battered, abused and
neglected children of Canada. What we are doing for them is
shamefully small, shamefully inadequate. What about the
wives who are battered, bruised and kicked from hell to
Hackney across Canada? What is being done about that

80003-36/

problem? I recognize that we can never have a perfect system
of society, humans being what they are and human nature
being what it is, but that does not mean to say we should not
try to do something about those grave areas of need.
I think it relevant to the point made yesterday by Senator
Croll, and perhaps to that made by Senator Bélisle today, to
add that, of course, we would all like to see additional consideration given to spouses. We know that many recipients of
the old age security pension are forced to live on that almost
entirely, and that in some cases the amount is inadequate. We
would all like to see more given. However, a point I neglected
to make yesterday when introducing the bill is that this is not
the time when Canada can afford to launch out on additional
major expenditures in the realm of social welfare.
The other day I asked some of the people who should know
what the costs would be if we were to implement some of the
very legitimate suggestions made by certain members in'the
other place. The additional cost would run immediately to
billions of dollars a year. As desirable as some of these things
are, and as great as our concern is, can we at this time in
Canada afford to launch out on vast new expenditures? I know
this is something we can argue. I know it is a matter of
priorities and we could argue it ad infinitum, but I mention it
now to indicate that all of us, in both this house and the other
place, recognize that these amendments are not a panacea for
all the needs of social concern that we see.
* (1500)

This bill is a step forward. I believe that fact is acknowledged by Senator Croll and Senator Bélisle. It is an improvement which, as it happens, will not cost us-certainly not
immediately-very much in the way of additional expenditure,
and that, in my opinion, is a very important consideration at
this time. It removes some of the inconsistencies and inequities
and what might be described as discrimination. Obviously, it is
wrong that one person after ten years can obtain a full pension
here while another Canadian-born citizen, for some reason
perhaps beyond his or her control, having spent 35 years in
Canada as an adult finds that he or she cannot get a pension.
That should be rectified, and this bill will go a long way
towards rectifying it.
As it happens, these amendments will not at this time, and
perhaps not in the foreseeable future, impose a significantly
heavy additional burden on the taxpayers of Canada. In my
opinion, that is a very important consideration.
I do not believe that I need to deal with any more detail at
this time. I appreciate the spirit in which Senator Bélisle has
spoken, also Senator Croll who, I regret, is not present at this
moment.
Senator Bélisle: Honourable senators, I would like to ask a
question of Senator Rowe, the sponsor of this bill.
I tried not to make as impassioned a plea as Senator Croll
made. He is known for that, and for the kindness he feels
toward the needy and the poor. However, Senator Rowe said
that we cannot afford this, but according to my information he
was either misinformed or the information given him was not

SENATE DEBATES
totally correct. I am told that so few widows would receive an
increase under this legislation that it would not cost more than
$2 million per year. If we have no money-and I am not
criticizing the program-how can we afford to spend $1 billion
through CIDA? How is it that it was reported in the newspapers yesterday that we are to give $500 million to needy
people?
In considering this legislation, can we not decide that there
is $1 million or $2 million that can be made available for those
poor widows? It is true that they are poor, and if a spouse dies
and the widower or widow, whoever it is, applies he or she
receives nothing except welfare. It is a fight between welfare in
the federal sense and welfare in the provincial sense, and one
level of government passes the buck to the other. It is in this
sense that I say the committee should study this bill. The
amount involved is so little. We have, as Senator Rowe said,
eliminated discrimination. Why should we not go a little step
further?
Senator Langlois: Who is closing this debate?
Senator Bélisle: I think you should be patient. I do not do
this too often, and I have always demonstrated much patience
in this chamber.

resolution from Canada which was adopted unanimously, and
I will refer to that resolution in more detail in a few moments.
Among the subjects reviewed by the committee, ail of which
are referred to in the appendix to Hansard of Tuesday,
February 1, was a resolution on science and the arms race,
which was purely a follow-up on the previous year's studies,
and a resolution on the rational development of the oceans. At
the spring meeting last year, Canada had been asked by the
committee to prepare a report on this subject, and that report
was prepared by M. Jacques Guilbault of the other place, who
had been vice-chairman of that committee but who, because of
his new functions, could not attend the last meeting. Nevertheless his report was received and adopted unanimously by the
committee, as it was by the General Assembly.

•

(1520)

This report essentially brought forward the same points that
were brought forward by Canada itself at the Law of the Sea
Conference, namely, to undertake steps regarding the early
ratification of the proposed 200-mile economic zone; to support the proposai for the creation of an international body
entrusted with regulation and management; to establish a
common heritage fund for humanity; and to establish institutions and mechanisms for the efficient control of trans-national corporations et cetera. We are ail familiar with this policy.
The proposai of Canada, as I said a moment ago, was adopted
unanimously by both the committee and the plenary assembly.
Following up on earlier work, resolutions on the control of
narcotics, technological development and unemployment were
brought up to date. Another resolution, again an up-dating of
the committee's work, on the challenges of modern society,
was brought forward with an addition at the request and
suggestion of France, particularly, and one or two other European coastal countries, urging the member governments of the
North Atlantic Alliance to work toward international regulation of the sea routes used by large bulk carriers of hydrocarbons with a view to reducing the risk of accidents and their
possible consequences to the coasts. So to those countries I say:
Welcome to the club. Their worries and ours have now been
identified.
One resolution which was brought forward by Canada, as a
result of Dr. Baumgardner's presentation, was on satellite
technology. The program has now been under way and Landsat scanners are at work. Landsat i was launched in 1972, and
Landsat Il was launched in 1975. Landsat III is to be
launched in the third quarter of this year, and Landsat IV is
scheduled for 1978. Proof was given to us that these satellites
can make the most thorough inventory of our land resources in
agriculture, in mining, and in a number of other fields. At the
moment, Landsat Il can be focused on an area of about 70
square miles, and it is claimed that Landsat IV, which will be
launched in 1978, will be able to focus on an area of four
hectares. It is almost impossible to believe the amount of
research-and instant research-that can be donc with these
mechanisms as far as resources, climatological changes and
changes in the standing of agriculture and anything of that
sort are concerned. They can be of tremendous value, not only

March 17, 1977

to the world at large but particularly to underdeveloped countries where the development of resources is an imperative
requirement.
Another aspect is that when we have this kind of instrumentation orbiting the world, those nations which are hostile to us
will immediately brand them as spying mechanisms. This is a
price we have to pay. Nevertheless, in the view of the Canadian delegation, this has to be attenuated as much as possible
because the value of the program itself is such that we should
make every effort not to let it drop.
So the Canadian resolution urges the member governments
of the North Atlantic Alliance, and the Government of the
United States in particular, to assure that there will be no gap
in the data flow; to move towards an operational global earth
resources information system which will provide on an equitable basis to ahl nations satellite data within a short time after
acquisition; to seek international participation to design an
international institutional framework to implement and
manage the equitable distribution of land and sea resources
data; and to design and implement educational programs to
assure the effective transfer of this information technology to
the developing countries. This initiative of Canada was again
adopted unanimously both by the committee and the plenary
session.
Honourable senators, I have already suggested that the
raison d'être of NATO is mutual and collective defence, and
that none of its members should lose sight of that fact. Senator
McDonald's contribution to this debate was therefore basic
and all-important. I thank him for, and congratulate him on
his speech. Senator McDonald has been our foremost spokesman for several years on the Military Committee, and he is
highly respected by the delegates of other countries. I congratulate him also on his selection to the Subcommittee on
European Defence Cooperation which will address itself vigorously to the question of standardization and interoperability of
armaments and equipment. I believe the Committee on
Science and Technology should also give priority and attention
to this program, and I pledge to draw its attention to it if I am
given the opportunity.
Senator McDonald also pointed out that we have no procedure in the Senate by which we can talk to our defence people.
Indeed, I made the same point myself a little over a year ago
when, in reporting on the Copenhagen meeting, I suggested
some means should be devised to ensure the annual appearance
before a committee of the Senate of the Minister of Defence
and his aides. There is in this chamber a large reservoir of
knowledge and experience in matters of defence, and surely it
should be put to productive use. According to my recollection,
since I have been in the Senate, the only discussion we have
had on defence has been on Senator McDonald's annual report
respecting the North Atlantic Assembly. I do not care to say
whether his suggestion or mine is the better, but I hope the
leadership of the Senate will consider them seriously, and soon.
Now, I cannot let Senator McDonald get away with ail that
he said, particularly his conclusions. He drew attention to the
fact that we have 74 generals, one for every 258.8 privates or

March 17, 1977

SENATE I )EBATES

624.5 privates and corporals. 1 do not question his figures
because they are probably right, but 1 suggest he may have
been on the fringe of misleading advertising when he presented
themn in that way. Let it be said that we have one general for
just over 1,000 men in our armed forces.
( 1530)

It depends upon your point of view, but, in my opinion, the
78,000 people serving in our armed forces cannot be a defence
force when you consider the breadth and width of our country,
and the spot duty our armed forces have to perform here and
there around the world. No, they are a nucleus of highly-efficient, highly-technical, and highly-trained force which would
form the backbone and the yeast of a much larger Canadian
force should there be a worldwide conflici in which we are
involved.
1 will concede that the proportion of officers to men may
seem ridiculous to somc, anid it may be considered extremely
costly to pay the wages of 74 generals and to keep replacing
them as they retire. Nonetheless, should a worldwide conflict

543

explode, and should we be in the position where it is necessary
to bring into the ranks of the armed forces 750,000 men over a
period of six or nine months, 1 would feel a far sight safer if 1
had in my back pocket 74 generals who are alert, ready,
trained, in shape and in position to do the job needing to be
donc at the time.
Another facet of the same argument is that there are career
officers who have spent years Iearning, training, gaining
experience and so on, and who have corne to the point at which
they could be made generals, and the question is: Should we
keep them at a Iower rank simply because we are not involved
in war? That kind of question is debatable, of course, but 1
suggest to you, honourable senators, that it strengthens the
argument put forward by Senator McDonald and myseif that
we do need a forum in this chamber in which to discuss and 10
debate defence matters.

NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL SESSION, WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA,
U.S.A.-DEBATE CONCLUDED

The Senate resume from Thursday, March 17, the debate
on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator McElman calling
the attention of the Senate to the Twenty-second Annual
Session of the North Atlantic Assembly, held in Williamsburg,
Virginia, U.S.A., from 12th to 19th November, 1976, and in
particular to the discussions and proceedings of the Session
and the participation therein of the delegation from Canada.
Hon. George . Smith: Honourable senators, in entering this
debate, I propose in due course to say a little about military
matters. I must express some diffidence at doing so in the
presence of so many distinguished former members of our
armed forces: sailors, soldiers and airmen. I hope that if they
disagree with me they will bear with me until I have finished
what I have to say, and I shall then be pleased to be told where
I have gone astray-not, I hope, with more vehemence than I
use myself, which may provide a reasonable amount of leeway.
Senator Hicks: Hear, hear.

Senator Smith (Colchester): It seems to me that I hear a
familiar voice. I should also like to say, as I begin, that I
believe we are all greatly indebted to those who have already
participated in this debate. It has, of course, ranged over a
diversity of subjects, a diversity which I have come to the
conclusion is necessary if we are to consider the many aspects
of international affairs with which NATO must necessarily be
concerned. For instance, a glimpse at appendix "A" to Hansard of Tuesday, February 1 of this year, published at the
request of Senator Yuzyk, will illustrate this diversity. The
table of contents of the appendix covers such items as education, cultural affairs, floor prices for raw materials and their
impact on international trade, energy supplies, joint strategy
for further economic development, control of narcotics,
common nuclear policy, rational development of the oceans,
the coming to power of Communist Parties, and many items
other than those more directly identified with military matters.
I venture to say that the wide scope of NATO concerns is
not always kept in mind, and that it is helpful to remind us and
the public generally, from time to time, how wide the scope of
these matters of concern is, and how important they are. On
this occasion, however, I wish to speak, briefly I hope,
although perhaps not so fervently as others do, on two or three
military matters only, and in particular on some points raised
by Senator McDonald and Senator Lafond. Both these distinguished colleagues of ours have considerable experience in
NATO affairs, as well as gallant wartime service in our armed
forces. They are certainly well qualified to speak of such
matters, and I congratulate them on their able and eloquent
contributions to this debate. I wish also to congratulate Senator McDonald on his election to the European Defence CoOperation Committee, a subcommittee of the NATO Committee on Defence. This is certainly a well-deserved recognition of
his knowledge, ability and interest in NATO, as well as, I
suspect, a tribute to Canada. I join with all senators in
expressing the conviction, most warmly and confidently, that
he will be a vigorous member of that subcommittee, and that
he will serve it with distinction to himself and with credit to
the Senate and to Canada. I am sure I was not alone in
listening with great interest to Senator McDonald's well documented and, as I have already said, eloquent speech of last
week. It was most informative, and I am glad to be able to say
that I support its main thrust, although I cannot support
everything he said.
I should like to mention first his emphasis on what he called,
and what is called in many NATO documents, the interoperability of NATO defence weapons and equipment. I want to say
that I think this emphasis cannot be repeated too often on this
point. I think he is right, not only because of the wasteful
extravagance which must result from failure faithfully to
follow this principle, but even more so because of the ever
present danger of difficulties and failures which will inevitably
occur in the use of weapons and equipment which are not
interoperable.
Consider for a moment what might be thought to be a
somewhat dramatic example of this kind of thing, but which

SENATE DEBATES
has nevertheless happened on other occasions and which could
well happen again. It will certainly illustrate my point. Consider the helplessness of a soldier facing an attacking enemy with
a perfectly good machine gun of his own nation and plenty of
allied ammunition which will not fit it. That is a simple,
perhaps dramatic, example, I say again, but one which is very
easy to understand and which I think clearly illustrates the
principle of interoperability.
Senator McDonald spoke of tanks, aircraft, air-to-ground
and ground-to-air rockets and other weapons, and pointed out
how far we have to go to achieve the proper degree of
interoperability. But, honourable senators, 1 want to say that
the importance of this principle does not begin or end with
weapons or weapons systems. A military force on land, at sea
or in the air, depends on its ability to move al] kinds of things
in all kinds of conditions. Interoperability must extend to all
pieces of equipment which are necessary to perform these
great feats of movement of stores, ammunition and people
which are so necessary for an effective military force. What
good is it, honourable senators, if your truck breaks down
because of a faulty fuel pump, for instance, and you have a
perfectly good fuel pump which turns out to be one that will
not fit because it was made by and for another nation. We can
go all through the multitude of items which must be available
in good working condition for any kind of military force to be
effective, and readily foresee what troubles are bound to occur
if there is not interoperability. Therefore, I want to add my
emphasis to what Senator McDonald said about this point.

(2020)

Of course, one must pay proper attention to a fair distribution of the economic consequences of interoperability, but one
must not let that attention, I submit, obscure the importance
of the principle itself. I trust our Canadian defence and
political authorities will keep it clearly and firmly in mind, and
do whatever they can to encourage our NATO partners to do
the same.
This brings me to another of Senator McDonald's ideas that
I would like to support-the necessity of some formal means
by which the Senate can communicate with Canadian defence
people. He suggested a joint Senate and House of Commons
defence committee, because he thought separate defence committees might lead to duplication and thus a waste of time and
effort.
Senator Lafond, as I understood him, agreed with the
general concept of a committee or a channel of communication, but tended towards the belief that a Senate committee
would be preferable. I do not profess to have sufficient experience of joint committees to know which course is better.
However, I have read some, at least, of the proceedings of the
committee of the other place on External Affairs and National
Defence. As a result of that reading, I tend to think the danger
of duplication and waste of time is not so great as might at
first have been supposed, and also that a Senate committee
might have the opportunity to explore somewhat different
avenues of interest. In any event, I certainly support the
general concept, and commend it for further and careful
consideration.

March 22, 1977

Now I reach a place where I must express my disagreement
with some views that Senator McDonald expressed last week,
and I do this with a great deal of regret. I am afraid I disagree
pretty strongly with him. He said-correctly enough, no
doubt, so far as the numbers go-that we have 74 generals.
Although he left himself room for flexibility on the subject, he
seemed to intimate pretty strongly that he thinks 74 generals
are too many generals. Senator Lafond put this matter differently, and in a way I much prefer because I think it is more
suitable to the circumstances. Honourable senators will recall
that Senator Lafond drew attention to the size of Canada, the
necessarily wide dispersal of our armed forces as they carry
out their tasks in Canada and in various parts of the world,
and the fact that these forces are really the nucleus of what
will have to be a greatly expanded force if, God forbid, we ever
face the threat of a serious armed conflict.
I believe we should not decide the number of generals we
need simply on the basis of how many are needed to command
our present strength of 78,000 all ranks efficiently. With
Senator Lafond, I think the test of their number should be
two-fold. First, how many generals, trained and ready for
command in battle, are we likely to need if, against our will,
we have to face the terrible reality of war? Secondly, what is
necessary in order to afford opportunities for reasonably
attractive careers so that a sufficient number of able, vigorous
officers will be well trained and ready to fill that need?
So, honourable senators, while I would join Senator McDonaid in trying to make sure that, as taxpayers, we get the best of
value for every dollar we spend on our armed forces, including
generals, I cannot accept the ratio of officers to other ranks as
any kind of valid measurement whatsoever of the efficient
spending of money to train officers for command and staff. I
think to do so would be indeed false economy, and if the
occasion should ever occur when we need such people we
would be left very much in the lurch, and feel very much the
sad result of that kind of neglect.
Senator McDonald gave voice to another thought that I feel
I must examine. I should like to read a couple of paragraphs
from his speech as reported at page 493 of Hansardof March
15, 1977, so I shall be sure of putting the whole of what he
said in this respect before honourable senators, and so that
there can be no question of my taking it out of context. In
mentioning Senator Austin's speech about NATO forces in
Europe, Senator McDonald used the following words:
He [Senator Austin] referred to the fact that the
western powers might be called upon to use tactical
nuclear weapons at an early stage of any such conflict. I
do not believe that tactical nuclear weapons will ever be
used, and I say that from the knowledge I have acquired
from trips abroad and the opportunities I have had to see
modern, conventional weapons being used in the field.
A war today with conventional weapons is unthinkable,
but you cannot even dream of a war with atomic weapons.
I doubt very much that in the circumstances which prevail
today tactical nuclear weapons will ever be used. Back in
1948, when NATO came into being, the United States

March 22, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

had overwhelming nuclear superiority. The United States
could dictate to the Soviet Union and any other country,
and no one would dare to argue with her. But the Soviet
Union, in a very short space of time, bas achieved at least
parity in both overall nuclear capability and tactical
nuclear capability. Knowing that, how can any nation
become involved in the use of tactical nuclear weapons?
If Senator McDonald was simply expressing his horror at
the thought of war, and particular horror at the thought of the
use of nuclear weapons on the battlefield, then I join him in
that horror and share it with him. I need hardly say that all
war is horrible, and with him I hope with all my heart that it is
banished from the earth. However, it seems pretty clear that
mankind bas not yet reached that stage of blessed progress
when we can realistically have confidence that NATO forces
will never have to fight. If that be so, and if we must at least
contemplate the possibility that they may have to fight, then
surely we must do our best to make certain they have available
weapons at least as effective as those we know their opponents
will have.
It may be, of course, that Senator McDonald was simply
saying that the two super-powers have so nearly reached a
parity of nuclear horror, both strategically and tactically, that
neither will ever venture to use their nuclear capability for fear
of retaliation-or saying, in other words, that a balance of
horror is a sufficient deterrent. If that is what he means, I
suppose he may well be right, although even that rests for its
validity upon the willingness and ability of both sides to
maintain that balance, both strategically and tactically. So,
honourable senators, I cannot refrain from asking the question:
Would it not therefore be imprudent to create an attitude that
the tactical balance does not matter very much because the
tactical weapons will never be used by an enemy? This, of
course, is a question of great difficulty-it is terrible indeed to
think about-but it is one which cannot be escaped. Again I
ask if it is wise to encourage the belief that tactical nuclear
weapons will never be used. Is it wise to foster the attitude that
it is safe for NATO to base its concept of defence upon that
belief? I cannot help but assert that I do not believe it is wise
or prudent to do so.
* (2030)

Honourable senators, allow me now to emphasize something
I said earlier. In spite of any criticism and any questions I have
raised, I repeat that I agree with the main thrust of Senator
McDonald's well prepared and eloquently delivered speech. It
was a valuable contribution to the consideration of the problems of defence which must be faced, and I congratulate him
warmly. I hope that he will agree with me that the price of
peace is not only eternal vigilance, as someone has said, but
also the means to fight, sufficient in quantity and quality, and
the will to fight for peace.
The Hon. the Speaker: As no other honourable senator
wishes to participate in the debate, this inquiry is considered as
having been debated.

HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO STUDY CAUSES OF
PERSONALITY DISORDERS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOURDEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator McGrand, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Norrie:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon such experiences in prenatal life and early childhood
as may cause personality disorders or criminal behaviour
in later life and to consider and recommend such remedial
and preventive measures relating thereto as may be reasonably expected to lead to reduction in the incidence of
crime and violence in society;
That the Committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical and clerical personnel as may
be required for the purpose of the inquiry; and
That the Committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate.- (HonourableSenator McGrand).
Senator McGrand: Honourable senators, I yield to Senator
Thompson.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Andrew Thompson: Honourable senators, I rise to
support the motion of Senator McGrand that the Health,
Welfare and Science Committee be authorized to study the
causes of personality disorders and criminal behaviour, and I
thank him for giving me the privilege of speaking ahead of
him. I am sure every senator admires the tenacity and determination with which Senator McGrand bas persevered with his
constant, dedicated commitment to this study. In my opinion,
he represents and symbolizes with that tenacity the granite of
his province.
In addition, we all recognize him as a deep humanitarian.
He is stirred to counteract, even if by only a small percentage,
the multitude of young people crowding through the turnstiles
to criminal life. In the United States that number has now
increased so that almost one in every six males will appear
before a juvenile court before reaching the age of 18. I thought
it rather significant that I was unable to get the number of
juvenile deliquents across Canada. That, it seems to me, points
up even more the need for the Senate, with its authority, to
look at some of the statistics and facts and this appalling waste
of human potential. If the proposed study were to result in a
decrease in crime of only one per cent, the cost involved would
be justified.
Senator Carter pointed out that the cost of crime in Canada
must now be in the order of something between $8 billion to
$10 billion annually. In the province of Ontario-and I got
this figure today-the custodial care for a juvenile delinquent
runs to almost $90 a day. That staggering cost is not hard to

SENATE DEBATES
understand when one considers that a study in Rhode Island
indicated that the average cost of keeping a boy or girl in a
reformatory for a period of two to four years is $ 100,000.
I congratulate Senator Carter and the Health, Welfare and
Science Committee for focussing more narrowly on the scope
of the proposed study. "To inquire into and report upon crime
and violence in contemporary Canadian society," to my mind,
would have required too widespread a study.
Like Senator Forsey, if I may associate myself with him and
the words of Saul on the road to Damascus-and perhaps I
may paraphrase a little- I am not almost persuaded; I am
persuaded of the validity of this study. I read the documentation produced by Senator McGrand, and the speeches of
Senator Carter, Senator Asselin, Senator Norrie and others on
this subject. I am persuaded. The eloquent and carefully
documented speech by Senator Bonnell must, surely have
aroused an intellectual curiosity, if not a stirring of conscience
and compassion, on the part of al honourable senators. Senator Bonnell, like other speakers, listed so many authoritative
studies that we cannot shirk this challenge. He put it, I think,
most succinctly-and I want to repeat his challenge to uswhen he said that surely this is the forum "to stir up public
interest, government interest and scientific interest and, perhaps, to add support to making funds available to universities,
medical schools, research institutions and others so that they
may find out why a boy of six becomes a criminal at
twenty-six."
I know that many honourable senators have viewpoints and
attitudes about the general causes of delinquency. Indeed, it is
a problem that has pervaded every society. A study carried out
by the United Nations indicated that in all industrialized
countries, crime and delinquency are on the increase. That
same study showed that convictions in Canada between 1900
and 1966 has increased almost a hundredfold. The delinquency
problem has plagued every society. Let me quote Socrates:
Our youths love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority and disrespect for older people. Children nowadays are tyrants. They contradict their parents
and tyrannize their teachers.
e (2040)
It is, as it has always been, a complex problem.
For several years after the war I assisted in the setting up of
probation officers in the province of British Columbia. I think
that they have-not because of my efforts-a very progressive
correctional system in that province. But I pursued my interest
in the corrections field, and at one time I was a consultant to
and co-ordinator of a course in corrections given at the University of Manitoba. Like most people, I have read-I must say
rather superficially-most of the research being published on
delinquency approaches and suggested remedies. I also had
very firm convictions about how we could deal with the
problem. I felt very strongly that we should focus more on the
parents, and endeavour to make them more responsible. I
thought that that might be a universal answer, until I had
looked at the studies which resulted from a magistrate's or

March 22, 1977

judge's decision to fine and reprimand the parents for what he
considered to be a lack of responsibility towards the juvenile
offender. Over a long period of time I discovered-and indeed
it has been shown statistically-that this really is not the only
answer to the problem, and I had to think of other approaches.
I was very fortunate when I was in British Columbia in
having the privilege of working under Magistrate Haig Brown,
who, I am sure, is known to my colleagues sitting in front of
me, and is probably known to many other senators because he
is a recognized authority on salmon fishing. In addition, he
had an outstanding sensitivity towards the juveniles who came
before him, and he too was perplexed. I think that anyone who
is working with juveniles must honestly admit that we do not
have all the answers. Some people will suggest that the problem is caused by environment, while others will suggest it is a
question of heredity, but there has been little research done on
this. I know there is a common feeling abroad that a greater
severity in punishment would deter delinquency. But with
respect to severity of punishment-and looking towards my
lawyer friends-I reach back to Item 195 of the Code of
Babylon, which stated that if a son should strike his father his
hands should be cut off. I suggest to you, honourable senators,
that probably in Babylon they still had the problem of juvenile
delinquency, no matter how severe the punishment meted out.
The Hebrews modified that harsh punishment, and specified
flogging as the punishment for disrespect to a father. Blackstone in the 18th century chronicle gave one particular example of a boy of eight who was hanged for setting a fire in a
barn. I am sure I am speaking for every member of this house,
and indeed for every Canadian, in saying that we do not want
to reach back to punishments of such severity. Yet, honourable
senators, I am old-fashioned enough to think that the majority
of delinquents need a firm deterent, but, of course, therc are
always the exceptional cases.
I think, for example-and it haunts me-of when I was a
probation officer on Vancouver Island. I remember one little
girl of about twelve who was considered to be incorrigible. She
came before the court, and I suggested to the magistrate that
what she needed was more parental discipline. The magistrate
was, as many magistrates are, totally perplexed in trying to
deal with this child who was constantly getting into trouble, so
he suggested to the father, a sturdy, well-built logger, that he
should take this child home and discipline her more severely.
I followed this case. The father, who was frustrated and
disturbed by the fact that one of his three children was
incorrigible, explained to me that with reluctance he had tied
her to a chair and had beaten her with a strap. I saw the welts
on the child's body, and as I delved more deeply into the case I
learned that this was not the only occasion that this type of
punishment had been administered. In the past it had been
administered on several occasions.
What haunts me, honourable senators, is not only the fact
that I advised the magistrate to call for more severity, but
when in later years, after I got to know the girl and helped,
perhaps, in getting her established in the community and away

March 22, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

from the family home, she would write to me and I found she
was unable to spell properly. This kind of thing was mentioned
by Senators McGrand, Senator Bonnell and others, who pointed out that an inability to spell sometimes points to mental
retardation or some kind of brain damage.
On reading other studies, I find I have some skepticism
towards them. I have looked at a number in which people tried
to prove that all criminals are either mentally retarded or
superior. It has also been suggested in others that their condition stems from their racial or national background, or that it
is the economically deprived groups which produce most delinquents. I think that many of these studies are fuzzy, normative, and narrow; that they are not at all scientific. After all,
when we ask what is delinquency and terminology of delinquency, surely it is what the law says it is. When I read Senator
Lang's speech last week about the myriad of laws and regulations, I thought we should be studying the non-delinquent
rather than the delinquent. Coming back to the seriousness of
this, we must consider the terrible human tragedy and the
enormous cost involved.
As I speak I cannot help recalling again cases of young
people with whom I worked on Vancouver Island, and who I
thought had a bright future. I think of one young chap in
particular who seemed to have a daredevil attitude and who
was getting into difficulties with the law. His father, a respected businessman, could not understand why his boy would not
settle down like the others. This boy could not spell either and
that may be significant, although it could be just a matter of
his not having studied sufficiently. However-and this is going
back 30 years-I saw that boy sentenced to the penitentiary.
He was from a middle-class home, and could have been the son
or grandson of any one in this chamber. On the way to jail he
was raped three times. In the course of his incarceration I saw
him several times, and I noticed how the shock had affected
him and could see the breakdown of his personality which
resulted from it.
Honourable senators, Senator McGrand, with great humanitarian cause, has something of value here. He has a
perception which is worth investigating-indeed, we should be
challenged by it. There are authorities who say that we should
look at this problem, because doing so may give us one of the
answers-not all of them, as Senator McGrand agrees-to
understanding perhaps a small proportion of the thousands of
young Canadians who are entering our jails. Senator McGrand
has tenaciously and doggedly documented such a challenge.
Whether we are skeptical or convinced, the problem, in financial and in human terms, nevertheless demands that we look at
it. I therefore support the motion.
On motion of Senator McGrand, debate adjourned.

Statutory Instruments-(Honourable
Senator Lafond).

THE ESTIMATES
CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE
COMMITTEE ON SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (D)-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 15, the consideration of the report of the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on the supplementary estimates (D) laid
before Parliament for the fiscal year ending the 31st March,
1977.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, on the report of
the National Finance Committee on supplementary estimates
(D) I have two comments: one specific, the other more general
in nature. The one specific item I should like to draw to the
attention of the Senate concerns the fiscal transfer of $396
million. Since the supplementary estimates totalled $930 million, this item, representing something in the order of 44 per
cent of the total amount required by the government, becomes
the most important one.
When we considered the supplementary estimates in committee, I wondered why such a requirement existed and whether perhaps there had been an error in the estimate or in the
calculations made for the main estimates. I was surprised to
learn from Mr. MacDonald of the Treasury Board that,
indeed, there had not been any miscalculation. I should like to
quote now from page 11:23 of the report of the National
Finance Committee, issue No. 11, Wednesday, March 9, 1977.
I said:
I have a question on the Fiscal Transfer Payments
Program. In his opening statement the minister explained
that this amount results from the present legislation.
That is, the legislation which will expire this year to be
replaced by Bill C-37, if it passes as it is now before the other
place.
I should like to know why it was underestimated to the
extent of $395 million?
The minister replied:
It was the whole question in the final negotiations of
arriving at a satisfactory settlement of the revenue guarantee. I do not think it was an underestimated amount.
I then said, "But the legislation was not changed," and Mr.
MacDonald of the Treasury Board replied:
You may remember an argument between the provinces
and the federal government as to the basis on which the
revenue guarantees were to be paid. Because of the complexity of the details, the act gave power-

SENATE DEBATES
I an not too sure if this is correct, but this is the way it reads.
-gave power under regulations, and the federal government was pursuing the idea that it would proceed on one
basis. The provinces wanted to hold to the original regulations and the federal government was seeking to amend
the regulations so as to reduce federal exposureI will end the quotation there because the rest does not make
sense to me. In any event, I then said:
If I understand correctly, you had proceeded under
certain types of regulations up to the current fiscal year,
and then the federal government tried to change the
formula by regulation, and it is on that basis that the
original estimates were made. Then when you did not
succeed in having the new regulations acceptImplying acceptance by the provinces.
-you had to correct your calculations. It was quite an
endeavour by the federal government to save that amount
of $395 million. Of course, you cannot blame them for
trying.
It is disturbing to note that the government in its dealings
with the provinces in the matter of fiscal arrangements is not
above trying to pull that kind of trick. The government had
proceeded on a certain basis over the four years of the
five-year term. Then, in order, as Mr. MacDonald explains, to
reduce the spending of the federal government or the transfer
of payments to the provinces, the federal government tried to
change the regulations or the basis of calculations so that it
could pay $396 million less to the provinces. Well, there is no
way they could get away with that. This explains why there
are often difficulties in the matter of fiscal arrangements
between the federal government and the provinces. This
explains why we have seen confrontations at virtually every
conference involving the federal and provincial ministers of
finance. The Senate must take cognizance of what has transpired here, because it proves that a spirit of confrontation
exists and that the federal government is trying to control
everything in respect of provincial fiscality.
Needless to say, we shall have occasion to deal with this
matter when the new legislation is before us, but I thought it
was something worth thinking about while we wait.

(2100)

My second comment is in relation to the nine $1 items in the
supplementary estimates which amend existing legislation
through the device of a supply bill. The report in this connection makes the usual comment that we have been dealing with
this thing for a long time. It says:
The committee recommends that the continued and
expanding use of this method of redressing inadequacies
in basic legislation and in program planning by departments be vigorously scrutinized by the Treasury Board.
In my opinion, it should be scrutinized not only by the
Treasury Board but by Parliament. This brings me to the
comment I made on a previous comparable occasion about the
inadequacy of Parliament to control government expenditure. I

March 22, 1977

repeated, in fact, what the Auditor General had said in his last
report to the effect that he was deeply concerned that Parliament, and indeed the government, had lost or was losing
effective control of the public purse. In support of this view I
offer you the comments of the Honourable Robert Stanfield
who, in a lecture given at Acadia University at the beginning
of February last, said:
Parliament is not fitted for controlling the kind of
alI-pervasive government we have today. It cannot cope
with it effectively. This would be so even if the House of
Commons had not lost financial control of government
back in 1965 when it accepted a time limitation on the
consideration of estimates. When I entered the house in
the fall of 1967, the consideration of estimates seemed to
me a farce, because ministers were answering only questions they chose to answer, knowing that because of the
time limitation they no longer had to give satisfactory
explanations in order to get their estimates passed. I
found an emasculated House of Commons which was still
capable of greatness on occasion, but which was no longer
in effective control of the public purse.
I quote from a later passage in the same lecture:
Under current conditions, there is no way of getting back
that unlimited power to delay estimates. No government
would agree to that. The government hasn't enough parliamentary time now to get its legislation passed. But even
if-and this is a basic point-Parliament somehow
regained its old power to control the purse, it could not
effectively control the manifold operations of the contemporary government in Ottawa. The cabinet cannot exercise such control. How could the members of the House of
Commons?
I should add: how could the members of the Senate?
I want to relate those comments first to the fact that this
device, the $1 item, which amends existing legislation, is one
which is definitely intended to bypass Parliament. In the other
place there is a time limit on the consideration of estimates; so
when the allotted time is exhausted, they bring in the supplementary estimates with those $1 items which amend legislation
and there is no opportunity to deal with those matters as they
should be dealt with-that is, by separate legislation.
I hasten to add that some progress has been made in the
fight against the use of this dangerous device. Only today the
Speaker of the other place ruled that at least two of these $1
items had to be removed from the estimates and would have to
be brought before the house by way of special legislation. He
chose only two, but in doing so he was following the decision
made by Mr. Lamoureux in 1971. Honourable senators will
recall that I had occasion some time ago to deal with this
problem with regard to our own rules and in connection with a
report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance.
I wish merely to give honourable senators a preview of the
discussion which may take place on a more suitable occasion

March 22, 1977

DEBATES
Marc 22,1977SENATE

and shall comment only on the Senate's ability to deal with
estimates. Even if we have more time than has the House of
Commons in which to undertake this task, 1 stili do not think
the time available is sufficient. 1 agree that the National
Finance Committee does an excellent job when dealing with
specific problems, such as it did last year when it considered
the Manpower estimates. It brought down a report which was
very useful. But 1 do not believe that the Senate is equipped to
scrutinize closely every item of the main estimates or the
supplementary estimates. Also, 1 feel certain that the House of
Commons would resent any resistance by us to adopt or pass
those estimates, or any endeavour by us to cut some items
from the estimates because we were dissatisfied with them or
were opposed to the principle underlying any of them.
1 do not know what we can do beyond what we have been
doing recently to exercise better control over the estimates. 1
don't know what kind of mandate we might give the National
Finance Committee-or, for that matter, any other special
committee-to enable it to deal more knowledgeably with the
estimates or with a supply bill.
1 amn aware of the reticence of the Deputy Leader of the
Government when it cornes to referring a supply bill to committee or challenging the legality of any part of a bill. 1
remember well his conviction that the Department of Justice is
infallible. But that conviction is not shared by Senator Forsey
and several others of us who have had just as much experience
with that department as Senator Langlois. If we were 10 give
the National Finance Committee, or any other committee, the
task of finding a way whereby the Senate could be more
effective and hehpful to the House of Commons, which is in no
way really able to deal with the responsibility of controlling
the public purse, we would be doing something worthwhile for,

and useful to, the Canadian public. Were that committee
eventually to find such a way, we would have achieved something of singular importance to the welfare of ail Canadians.
The Hon. the Speaker: As no other honourable senator
wishes to participate in this debate, this order is considered as
having been debated.

The Hon. the Speaker. Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Burchili: H-onourable senators, Senator John Macdonald and 1 were among a large group of passengers who

criticism of Air Canada these days that 1 thought it only

Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a second time?
Senator Langlois: With leave of the Senate, later this day.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have no serious
objection to second reading proceeding later this day, but I
want to point out that this bill reached me only a minute ago.
Senator Langlois: The amended bill.
Senator Flynn: I realize that. I would prefer to wait until
tomorrow. If it is more convenient, however, for the acting
leader to procced today, I will not object. I tried to get the bill
earlier today but was unsuccessful. I have not had time to read
it, and I am sure most honourable members are in the same
position.
Senator Langlois: I do not want to be insistent about this
request, but I think it would be more convenient if we could
proceed with the introduction of the second reading today, and
the debate could be adjourned until tomorrow, which would
give everybody time to have a look at the bill as amended by
the other place.
Senator Flynn: Agreed, but by the same token, when would
the acting leader say this bill is needed? I do not think it could
reccive royal assent before next week in any event. I think we
are going to have interim supply, and the target date for both
bills would likely be March 31. Is that not correct?
Senator Langlois: I do not agrec with the suggestion that
the target date for these two bills is March 31. As honourable
senators know, the pay day at the end of a fiscal year, like this
one, is spread over three days in order to avoid a rush against
the banks by civil service employees, and those three days are
March 30, March 31, and April 1. The cheques are dated
April 1 because they fall in the new fiscal year. No prudent
treasurer of any organization would issue a cheque before the
money has been authorized by his organization, and this also
applies to government.

Senator Asselin: Is it our fault?
Senator Langlois: We cannot expect these cheques, even if
they are dated April 1, to be mailed on Wednesday if this bill
has not been passed by Parliament.
Senator Flynn: Would you have liked this bill to have been
passed yesterday?
Senator Langlois: We should like it passed by Tuesday
evening, if possible. That would enable the department to issue
the cheques and mail them across the country by Wednesday,
even though they will be dated April 1. We need interim
supply before Wednesday. Later on today, after adjourning, I
intend to discuss this with the honourable Leader of the
Opposition. I had a preliminary discussion with him last night
without having this information 1 am giving now as to the
spread of the pay over a period of three days. I intend to
discuss that with him further later this afternoon. As I say, I
am not insisting on going ahead this afternoon, but I think it
would be more convenient, not only for me but for the house.
It would not prevent honourable senators from getting full
knowledge of the bill before the debate is pursued further.
After I have made my introductory speech on second reading
the debate could be adjourned until tomorrow. If so, honourable senators on both sides of the house would have until
tomorrow to peruse this amended bill, which merely strikes out
two items, with no other change from the original bill which
we have had in our hands for some time.
* (1410)

Senator Flynn: Yes, I know.
Senator Langlois: Therefore, I suggest that consideration
should be given to my request that we proceed later today,
upon completion of the Orders of the Day.
Senator Flynn: Would the Acting Leader of the Government
agree to have this bill, or any other supply bill, referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance in order that
we might go into all these difficulties to which he makes
reference? If the acting leader agrees to that, I will withdraw
any objection.
Senator Langlois: The honourable leader knows what the
position has been in the past. It is not that I want to be
strong-headed about it, but this would be a repetition, because
the estimates upon which the bill is based have already been
carefully studied in committee and we have considered a
report on which the debate was terminated only yesterday
evening by my honourable friend. I see no purpose in sending
these estimates back to the committee from which they have
just been received. It has been the practice of this house to
avoid these repetitions. In view of the amendments made in the

March 23, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

other place, the honourable senator is possibly in a better
position than previously to make such a request. However, as I
said earlier, these amendments, following the Speaker's ruling
in the other place, merely strike out two $1 items. There is no
other change in the bill; we will be considering a bill which is
amputated by the deletion of two $1 items; that is all. In my
opinion this is not sufficient reason to send this bill to the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance and merely
have a repetition of what took place when consideration was
given to the original bill.
Senator Flynn: It was not our intention to review the
estimates proper. However, the wording of the bill with respect
to the problems underlined by the deputy leader pertaining to
cheques being issued and the authority provided in the bill
itself, not in the estimates, should be considered. We must find
out what the real problem is with regard to cheques issued
under the authority provided in the bill or in the interim
supply bill. The reason for my request is that this cannot be
discussed in the National Finance Committee on the estimates
proper. It has to do with the wording of the bill itself. That is
what I want the committee to look into, not the estimates. I
have no desire whatever to repeat what has already been done.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I should like to
correct the impression that the honourable Leader of the
Opposition seems to have, unless I misunderstood what he
said. When he refers to pay cheques, as I did a little earlier, he
should understand that I was not referring to this bill. This has
to do with the interim supply bill only, not this bill at all.
Senator Flynn: I wish to know, then, is there any problem
with respect to the cheques to be issued under this bill?
Senator Langlois: There is no problem.
Senator Flynn: No problem at all?

wording of the bill in committee, and that is what I wish to
discuss. If there is no rush, why not place the bill on the
Orders of the Day for second reading tomorrow?
Senator Langlois: As I said a few moments ago, if the
Leader of the Opposition withholds leave to proceed later this
day, then the matter will be dealt with tomorrow. I shall not
take the responsibility for that.
Senator Flynn: If, as you say, there is no problem, then I do
not have to take any responsibility.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Senator Flynn: We will allow the acting leader to explain
the bill.
Senator Langlois: I will do my best.
On motion of Senator Langlois, bill placed on the Orders of
the Day for second reading later this day.
DOCUMENTS TABLED
Senator Langlois tabled:
Report of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation,
including its accounts and financial statements certified
by the Auditor General, for the fiscal year ended April
30, 1976, pursuant to section 33 of the Freshwater Fish
Marketing Act, Chapter F-13, and sections 75(3) and
77(3) of the Financial Administration Act, Chapter F-10,
R.S.C., 1970.
Report of the Minister of Transport on the administration of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1976, pursuant to section 20 of the said
Act, Chapter 26 (1st Supplement), R.S.C., 1970.

Senator Langlois: No.
Senator Flynn: Then we can wait.
Senator Langlois: No. There are two bills and the confusion
probably arose from the fact that when my honourable friend
made his observation about this bill he referred to the interim
supply bill, and I replied that the deadline for that bill is
Tuesday because the cheques must be mailed on Wednesday.
Senator Flynn: Then what about this bill?
Senator Langlois: There is no relationship between it and
the cheques.
Senator Flynn: There is no problem?
Senator Langlois: None at all.
Senator Flynn: Then we can wait.
Senator Langlois: It is not a question of waiting; it is a
question of rehashing what we have already gone through in
committee.
Senator Flynn: Not at all. Whether or not my honourable
friend likes it, Bill C-44 and supplementary estimates (D)
constitute two different things. We have not considered the

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
RESOLUTION OF U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PROTESTING
CANADA'S ANNUAL SEAL HUNT-QUESTION

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I should like to call
the attention of the Senate to a headline in this morning's
Montreal Gazette, as follows: "U.S. House urges Canada to
cease 'cruel' seal pup hunt." According to the article, a
resolution was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives
calling for an end to the seal hunt in Canada.
According to my understanding, the seal hunt is carried on
under government regulation with quotas provided for
conservation.
Senator Asselin: Shame!
Senator Argue: The seal hunt provides a substantial part of
the livelihood of a number of Canadian citizens living in the
Atlantic provinces.
I would point out to those who feel that this hunt constitutes
a cruel and unnecessary act that millions upon millions of
calves, and other livestock, have been slaughtered in Canada

SENATE DEBATES
over the years, and such slaughter will continue. These are
crocodile tears that are being shed.
For my part, I think the resolution passed by the U.S. House
of Representatives was mistaken and uncalled for. I ask the
Acting Leader of the Government to present to the Senate, as
soon as possible, a statement of government policy with respect
to the seal hunt so that it may constitute an answer to the
allegations contained in the resolution passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, on reading the
article in question, one might be impressed by the fact that it
mentions that this resolution was passed by the House of
Representatives, but it seems that at the time the question was
put the attendance was about 50, which does not appear to be
any better than the record of this place-perhaps even worse,
considering the number of representatives.
a (1420)

Senator Argue: Ten per cent.
Senator Langlois: However, this is an important question,
and I think the Minister of Fisheries and the Environment, the
Honourable Roméo LeBlanc, some two weeks ago made a full
statement when he was interviewed by Mr. Weber, a Swiss
millionaire who is financing these groups opposed to the
hunting of seals. But this is not a very urgent matter because
the present season is almost over, and no immediate change
will be made. Perhaps it is a question we shall have to worry
about again about one year from now. In the meantime I shall
endeavour to get a full statement from the minister concerned,
and make a complete report to this house.
Senator Denis: As a supplementary question, may I ask the
acting leader if this man who is against the seal hunt is not the
owner of a factory making artificial fur?
Senator Langlois: My honourable colleague is apparently
referring to Mr. Weber who has been promising the establishment of an artificial seal fur industry in Newfoundland to
compensate Newfoundlanders for the loss sustained as a result
of banning the killing of seals.
Senator Argue mentioned that crocodile tears were being
shed, and I would point out that one of those shedding tears is
indeed a very good looking crocodile. I am referring, of course,
to Brigitte Bardot.
Senator Flynn: I protest. I have never noticed any resemblance whatsoever between Brigitte Bardot and a crocodile. I
can't understand where the acting leader got such an idea.
Senator Langlois: It is a matter of taste.
Senator Argue: Only by way of tears.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO STUDY CAUSES OF PERSONALITY
DISORDERS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator McGrand that the Standing Senate Com-

March 23, 1977

mittee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to
inquire into and report upon such experiences in prenatal life
and early childhood as may cause personality disorders or
criminal behaviour in later life and to consider and recommend
such remedial and preventive measures relating thereto as may
be reasonably expected to lead to reduction in the incidence of
crime and violence in society.
Hon. Fred A. McGrand: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I wish to
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator McGrand
speaks now, his speech will have the effect of closing the
debate on the substantive motion before the house.
Senator McGrand: Honourable senators, in closing this
debate I want to make reference to a few things that have
taken place since I introduced my motion on December 2,
1976. Apparently across this country a number of people read
Senate Hansard, because I have received a great deal of
support from many sources. I have a letter from the Quebec
Association for Children with Learning Disabilities, another
from the National Indian Brotherhood, another from the Tree
Foundation of Canada, and another from the Canadian Association for Children with Learning Disabilities. The president
of this organization wrote to me, "I hope you will allow us to
print your speech to the Senate in our news sheet 'the Post' ".
I had a letter from Dr. Morris Reznick who was the first
president of the Ontario Association of Children with Learning Disabilities. He had helped with the preparation of a brief
presented in May 1969 to the then Minister of National
Health and Welfare. Unfortunately, no action was taken.
I have a letter from the I.O.D.E. of New Brunswick, accompanied by a copy of the brief that they presented to the New
Brunswick government.
There is a definite connection between learning disability
and juvenile delinquency. Ian R. Culligan, Superintendent of
the Youth Training Centre in Fredericton, New Brunswick,
writes:
As the only institution in the province of New Brunswick
responsible for the "case, custody and treatment" of
juvenile delinquents, the problem of children with learning disabilities is certainly a serious concern to us.
A study on learning disabilities in the medium-security
institution by Acadia University in 1972 states that in the
maritime provinces, according to an Acadia University study
completed on the inmate population of Springhill medium
penitentiary, 67 per cent of the inmates suffer from a specific
learning disability. The superintendent of Father Flanagan's
Boys' Home at Omaha, Nebraska, states that practically all of
the young criminals coming to that institution have learning
disabilities.
Dr. Burton White of Harvard University, one of the original
researchers in the field of learning disabilities and minimal
brain dysfunction, writes in his book, The First Three Years of
Life, as follows:
After 17 years of research on how human beings acquire
their abilities, I have become convinced that it is to the

March 23, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

first three years of life that we should now turn most of
our attention. My own studies, as well as the work of
many others, have clearly indicated that the experiences
of those first years are far more important than we had
previously thought. In their simple everyday activities,
infants and toddlers form the foundation of all later
development.
Honourable senators, I do not think that it is necessary to
present any further evidence that the study which I have
proposed is justified and necessary, if Canadians are to grapple
with this problem in the future. Work in this field bas been
handicapped, because Canada is one of the few countries in
the western hemisphere with no federal department of education. It is well known that the majority of children with
learning disabilities do not become criminals, but that criminals, as children, have had learning disabilities. Learning
disabilities are five times more common in males than in
females, and crime among males is much more common than
among females.
i asked the director of the Tree Foundation of Canada to
give me more information on the ratio between male and
female children in the area of learning disabilities and in
crime, and also for some more information on the ratio
between children with minimal brain damage who become
criminals and those who do not. I was told that that work had
not been done because there was no money to do it. They
hoped to get some private foundation to supply the money
until the time comes when the governments in Canada, both
provincial and federal, agree to fund this undertaking. For this
reason it is all the more necessary that the Senate should
devote some time to this study.
The Globe and Mail of February 19 carried an article on
the visit of the Health, Welfare and Social Affairs Committee
of the House of Commons to a British Columbia penitentiary.
The following is a quotation from the analysis of that visit:
In the past five months alone, there have been three
directors at the pen, and the high turnover itself was
indirect proof of the horror stories heard by the committee of M.P.'s investigating Canadian prisons-stories of
prisoners being raped and killed by other convicts, or
being beaten by guards.

(1430)

The problem of running our penal institutions grows worse
as the years go by. A few days ago I read that Canada had to
build many new penitentiaries to meet the emergency. Conditions get worse; they do not get better. Reformers in the
nineteenth century had three objectives: the abolition of slavery, the abolition of capital punishment, and the abolition of
torture in institutions. If honourable senators read the speeches
made in those days by those favourable to the abolition of
capital punishment they will find that they stressed that the
death penalty only degraded those involved and the society
that condoned it. Those in favour of capital punishment
stressed that it was the only deterrent available in society. We
are now near the end of the twentieth century, and the
arguments have not changed between those for or against the

death penalty. The same old reasons are given because
research into the making of a murderer has not been done, and
until the public knows more about it than it does now the
debate will go on in Parliament at about five-year intervals.
If the death penalty is justified, if it is the best deterrent,
then we should not stop with the hanging of convicted murderers. Would it be proper to determine juvenile delinquents who
show evidence of becoming murderers, and eliminate them at
an early age? By doing so we could remove thousands of
potential criminals, but we might destroy our fragile civilization. Is it possible to make that selection at the age of three
years? That is one approach that we could take. Another is to
remove, at an early age of the child, those influences which
produce criminal tendencies.
About a month ago I listened to a conversation on television
between Patrick Watson and Dr. Robert McClure. Most of
Dr. McClure's professional life has been spent in the jungles of
Africa and the Amazon, and among the headhunters of
Borneo. They discussed the great advances in medicine over
the past 50 years. Watson asked, "What is the greatest need in
medicine today?" and Dr. McClure replied, "Better preventive
medicine." I am sure that had Dr. McClure been asked what
was the greatest need in crime control, he would have replied
"Better preventive criminology."
Those of us who favour this study by the Standing Senate
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science are convinced that
the results of the study would stimulate activity where it is
most needed. Education is a provincial responsibility carried
out under the jurisdiction of school boards. In some cities
attention has been given to the child with minimal brain
dysfunction; in others nothing has been done. There is no
machinery in government to deal with the problem child until
he or she is a problem to society. The problems of these
children involve more than one discipline, more than education, health and justice. They involve the depth of our natural
culture and the depth of its humanities.
Most advocates of this study believe that some parliamentary body should make an in-depth study of this field and that
the Senate of Canada is best qualified to do this. How should a
committee of the Senate proceed in this study? It should invite
those who have already made a special study of this problem
and those who have a special interest in it to present facts and
suggestions. There will be no difficulty in finding such people.
There are many in Canada and some in the United States, and
they are all anxious to appear.
The first national conference on learning disabilities will be
held in Ottawa from October 27 to 29. It would be good for
the prestige of the Senate to have an input at that conference,
an exposure which the Senate badly needs.
Health and welfare today involve more than the prevention
of smallpox and the introduction of old age pensions. Those
were the issues of the 1920s. In my view, the Standing Senate
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science should be interested in what is on the horizons of today and the horizons of

SENATE DEBATES
tomorrow. Minimal brain dysfunction is on the horizons of
today.
If il is a function of the Senate to look after the rights of
minorities, I would point out that these physically and psychologically traumatized children are the most neglected minority
in Canada. Why does a boy of six, with a psychological
trauma, become a psychopathic killer at the age of 26? I asked
that question in May of 1975. I asked it again on December 2,
1976. I am glad that Senator Bonnell mentioned it on Thursday last, and that Senator Thompson mentioned it again last
night.
That is what this study is all about.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, il is moved by
the Honourable Senator McGrand, seconded by the Honourable Senator Norrie:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon such experiences in prenatal life and early childhood
as may cause personality disorders or criminal behaviour
in later life and to consider and recommend such remedial
and preventive measures relating thereto as may be reasonably expected to lead to reduction in the incidence of
crime and violence in society;
That the Committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical and clerical personnel as may
be required for the purpose of the inquiry, and
That the Committee have power to sit during adjournments of the Senate.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Motion agreed to.
LUMBER INDUSTRY
EFFECT OF TARIFF ON IMPORTATION OF SOFTWOOD
PLYWOOD-DEBATE CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 10, the debate
on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Burchill calling the
attention of the Senate to the tariff on the importation of
softwood plywood and the serious effect it is having on the
Canadian plywood industry.
Hon. Louis-J. Robichaud: Honourable senators, it has been
quite some time since this inquiry was introduced in the Senate
by our distinguished and esteemed colleague, Senator Burchill.
I intended to speak last Thursday, St. Patrick's Day, in order
to congratulate him because, apart from everything else, he is
an Irishman-a fact that I will prove as 1 proceed.
I would also like to congratulate another Irishman, although
I am once again doing it in somewhat belated fashion. This
time refer to Senator McGrand, and I congratulate him not
only on the delivery of his remarks this afternoon, but also on
the substance of those remarks. We all realize that Senator
McGrand is a great humanitarian. He is an Irishman, as some

March 23, 1977

of you may know, but he is also a former Minister of Health of
New Brunswick, having served in that capacity from 1944 to
1952. In fact, he has the distinction of being the first Minister
of Health in any jurisdiction in the British Commonwealth.
That is quite a distinction, and I pay him respect on that
account.
To return to our other Irishman from Miramichi, I do not
think I will be contradicted if I say that we all respect him as a
senator, as a great lumberman, and as a great New Brunswicker. His origin dates back to 1820, when his family moved from
Ireland to the beautiful Miramichi in New Brunswick, probably in order to survive as was the case with so many others.
In those days the backbone of the economy of New Brunswick was, as it is today, the forest industry. In 1857 Senator
Burchill's grandfather established a company on the Miramichi called George Burchill and Son, and since that time-that
is, for 120 years-this company remained in the hands of the
same family. George Burchill, the originator, was followed by
two of his sons, one of whom had the same name, George. The
other, I think, was named John. Those two were replaced by
Senator Burchill who, while he has not yet been replaced, is
very well seconded by his son, whose name is also John. For
120 years these people have struggled to build an economy in
New Brunswick, particularly on the Miramichi, which is well
known for the quality and quantity of its salmon, and also for
its forest industry. The Burchill company has struggled over
the years. At first they were just purchasing logs, having them
processed in a sawmill that did not belong to them, and
exporting them to Ireland and the United Kingdom. Then they
purchased a planer, and they developed over the years. They
had to go through a very serious depression. Like all of us, the
Burchill company suffered considerably in those days, to the
point where they simply had to buy raw pulpwood and pit
props in order to survive during the war years which followed
the depression, but survive they did.
*

(1440)

In the early 1950s, under the able leadership of Senator
Burchill, the company developed a plywood plant. That was
their start in the softwood plywood industry. This is why in
December our colleague introduced his inquiry calling our
attention to the tariff which he felt affected his company, and
many other companies as well.
I am not sorry for having delayed speaking on this subject
because we had the good fortune last week of being able to
listen to an expert in the field of softwood plywood, Senator
Bell, and she certainly enlightened us as to the magnitude of
the problem-a problem that is not restricted to softwood
plywood. It is the whole forest industry of this country which is
at stake at the moment. I do not know how many documents
on this subject I have gathered since December of last year,
but I am not going to bore honourable senators with all of that
information this afternoon. However, I intend to conclude by
making certain recommendations.
The problems facing the forest industry will assume proportions that are almost beyond measure, unless we face up to
them. There are so many jurisdictions involved-the municipal

March 23, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

ernment of Ontario is doing something about reforestation, as
are some other governments. There is a good tree farm at
Petawawa, which is quite near. Last year i was instrumental in
having small trees distributed among you, all of which came
from the farm at Petawawa.
Perhaps this is an appropriate time to announce that the
week commencing May 1 will be National Forest Week in
Canada, and I have been asked to invite all honourable
senators to visit the tree farm at Petawawa. There is to be an
organized tour and everybody is invited. Everything will be
organized, and we will see what is being done there. Perhaps
what is being done in Petawawa is a miniature of what should
be done all over the country. We need a national reforestation
policy.
I can see some honourable senators looking at me anxiously.
I know there are committee meetings scheduled for this afternoon, and I will be as brief as possible.
The studies by the Agriculture Committee, headed by Senator Hazen Argue and Senator Hervé Michaud, have impressed
me. Agriculture is of extreme importance to this country, but
to me forestry comes first. I do not want to offend the
agriculturists, but when I consider industries in terms of
dollars and cents, forestry comes first after mining. i am
wondering if a Senate committee could not make an in-depth
study of the utilization of the forests and trees in this country.
I have thought of a number of subjects that could be
incorporated in the terms of reference. For instance, there is
the problem of tariffs, which was raised by Senator Burchill.
That could be studied in depth, not only for the plywood
industry but for the whole of the lumber industry. There is also
the control factor, and provincial jurisdictions. Our forests are
a natural resource which belongs to the provinces, and given
cooperation between the provinces there could be a transfer of
some trees when that is more economical. For instance, in the
northern part of New Brunswick we import trees from Quebec
and Maine, while from other parts of the province we export
trees, so everybody benefits. A study of that type of exchange
along the 49th parallel and between provinces could be beneficial. We must also consider the quality of the logs.
Senator Burchill told me last week that his company had
closed its plant to instal new equipment. That is a big problem.
Most of Canadian industry has outmoded equipment. I do not
say this in order to complain, but it is a fact that outmoded
equipment is preventing industry from achieving its full potential. Senator Burchill said that his company is renewing all its
equipment. Some months ago they laid off 250 men, but they
hope to re-open in the first week of July with modern equipment and put those 250 men back to work. If that were done
all over the country, backed by an export policy, it would be
tremendously helpful to the economy. That is another problem
that could be studied.
What about the transportation of logs? I am informed that
e (1450)
K. C. Irving, for instance, believed in this concept of refor- we are shipping railway ties to the United States when we
estation. The latest statistics I have show that he or his could be using them ourselves to better advantage. Perhaps the
associates planted or transplanted 30 million trees. The Gov- CNR and CPR should be investigated in this regard.

jurisdiction, the provincial jurisdiction and the federal jurisdiction-and there are the companies which own private lands
and crown lands all over the country. Numerous studies have
been made over the years in an attempt to solve some of these
problems, but they were fragmented. They were localized to
one jurisdiction, or were made by one industry, like the
plywood industry, trying to solve one problem. I read a document to the effect that before the Burchill company launched
this plywood mill on the Miramichi, they had to go to the
Scandinavian countries and certain other parts of the world
because there was nothing in Canada which could give them
guidance. They had to go abroad. That is what can be called a
fragmented study. Two or three years ago a study was made in
New Brunswick on the utilization of wood fibres. It was a good
study, but again it was fragmented. It took into account one
particular area of the country, and did not embrace a national
policy.
Unless we wake up, we are going to lose our export markets,
not only in the United States but in the world, and that would
be a tragedy because our exports of forest products are second
only to our exports of minerals. Forest products help our
balance of trade.
I should like to quote a paragraph from a publication of the
Canadian Forestry Association. I despise statistics because I
have never been a mathematician, but these figures are
revealing:
Wood grown in Canada's forest annually produces a
harvest of some 4½ billion cubic feet. The logging and
manufacture of this material provides employment for an
estimated 300,000 workers who receive $2.8 billion in
salaries and wages. Since Canada has more timber than is
needed to satisfy her own requirements, a large part of
these forest products are exported to bring in over $4½
billion worth of revenue representing some 18% of total
domestic exports. A favourable foreign trade balance is
therefore heavily dependent on forest production.
I am informed by the director of the Forestry Directorate of
the Department of the Environment that Canada could employ
a million people directly or indirectly in the forest industry.
Governments at all levels and industry spend only $50 to $60
million annually in conservation and reforestation, and there
are from 50 to 60 million acres of land in our country that are
underlogged, and that could be used for reproducing other
trees. It is hard to believe how much we could do for the future
of this country if we only put our heads and our resources
together. This is an industry that produces a billion annually,
and yet we spend only $50 or $60 million on it. Considering
the fact that the resource is renewable, this is almost incredible. It approaches insanity in a country as highly civilized and
sophisticated as ours to spend only that amount of money,
when we know we could build so much for the present and for
the future.

SENATE DEBATES
Another matter is the conversion to the metric system. I
remember that some years ago we wanted to export some
finished wood from New Brunswick to Europe. I went to the
Maritime Lumber Bureau at Amherst and asked them what
they thought about it. They said it was impossible because of
the system of measurement under which the wood in Canada
and in the United States was cut, but that we would have to
convert to the metric system in order to export to Europe. We
should study the effects of a conversion to the metric system.
We must utilize our forest resource to the fullest extent.
Some years ago only the trunk of the tree was used, and the
rest was burned. Since then enormous progress has been made,
and it seems to me that even the needles of coniferous trees
could be utilized in some way, and that might be determined
by studying the matter.
There could be a study of the variation in building codes in
Canada, the United States and other countries. Let us make
that study to find out how much they can be standardized.
Then there is the relationship between the west and the east.
British Columbia and eastern Canada are where the large
manufacturers of finished wood products are, but there is very
little consultation between the two areas. This could be studied. Budworm infestation could be investigated, and also joint
programs for reforestation research.
I believe that if a committee of the Senate were appointed to
undertake such studies it would have the cooperation of the
Canadian Lumbermen's Association, the Canadian Forest
Association and ail other allied associations. I could name
perhaps fifteen or twenty other associations which would be
involved in this. It would also have the fullest cooperation of
the provincial governments, the Forestry Directorate of the
Department of the Environment, the forestry faculties of the
Universities of British Columbia and New Brunswick-they
are the only two such faculties in Canada-and the pulp and
paper industry. Such a committee would have everybody's
cooperation, and its study and report on such matters as I have
mentioned could lead to a national forestry policy which would
be beneficial to ail of us, particularly to our children, and to
the economy of Canada.

having been debated.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1977
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Langlois moved the second reading of Bill C-44, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1977.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill introduced today
provides for supply for the final supplementary estimates for
1976-77. These estimates were tabled in the Senate on March
8, and referred immediately to the Standing Senate Commit-

March 23, 1977

tee on National Finance. They were discussed in committee
two days later with the President of the Treasury Board and
his officiais. At that time, Mr. Andras expressed considerable
satisfaction in saying that the government's restraint target for
1976-77 was being more than achieved. It was over a year ago
that the government published a figure of $42.15 billion as the
amount within which total spending will be kept, notwithstanding contingencies of many sorts which could intervene.
That would have been a 14 per cent increase over the total
expenditures for 1975-76.
With the tabling of these final supplementary estimates, and
taking into account non-budgetary items not in estimates, we
find ourselves within the 14 per cent limit and, correspondingly, within the growth of the gross national product. These
supplementary estimates now under consideration total $930
million, containing voted items of $494 million and revisions of
statutory items of $436 million. The larger voted items are as
follows:
First, $195.5 million for Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation to change the method of financing the corporation
from a calendar year 1o a fiscal year. In effect, this adds the
three months of January, February and March 1977 to the 12
months foreseen when the 1976-77 main items were tabled.
Secondly, $100 million for various measures in the energy
sector, such as the conservation and renewable resources development programs in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island; deficiency payments on the Sarnia-Montreal pipeline;
and additions to regional electrical intercommunications in
Manitoba.
Thirdly, $71 million to purchase a further 2,000 grain-hopper cars, thus increasing the fleet to 8,000 cars.
Finally, $85.5 million in debt write-off of interest due on the
loans to Atomic Energy Canada Limited for the prototype
reactors at Douglas Point and Gentilly.
The largest statutory item in the supplementaries is the
$396 million transfer payment to the provinces under the
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.
Last evening the Leader of the Opposition referred to this
item, and was critical of the explanations given in committee
by the Assistant Secretary to the Treasury Board. Although
the honourable senator is not in his seat-I know he is absent
on official business-and since he will be returning before the
debate on these supplementaries is completed, I will provide
further information, in the knowledge that if he is not satisfied
he will be present at a later time to either rebut the remarks 1
am about to make or seek further information.
Senator Grosart: You may be sure of that.
Senator Langlois: I am sure of that, yes, quite definitely.
The increase in the fiscal transfer payments can be
explained as follows: First, I should mention that the equalization payments for 1976-77 were decreased by $77.2 million.
This was a reduction because of a revision in the revenue base
according to data which became available after the main
estimates. There was also a reduction of $110 million due to
equalization for prior years. It was originally assumed that

March 23, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

house do not allow honourable senators to cite the debates of
the other place, except for statements of policy made during
the same session by a minister of the Crown. However, I would
summarize it by saying that the Speaker of the other place
cautioned honourable members not to take any of his decisions
as a precedent. That can be found at page 4222 of the
Commons Hansard. In his ruling, he referred at length to
decisions rendered by his predecessor, the Honourable Mr.
Lamoureux, in 1971.
The other item which was struck out was also under the
heading of Industry, Trade and Commerce, vote 77d, which
comprised the following two items:
(a) To increase from $750,000,000 to $2,500,000,000
the amount set out in Section 26 of the Export Development Act; and
(b) to increase from $750,000,000 to $1,000,000,000
the amount set out in Section 28 of the Export Development Act.
The act, which is chapter E-18 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1970, limits the amount of insurance and guarantees
which the Export Development Corporation can give to either
agencies or individuals seeking assistance from it. That limit
under the original act was set at an aggregate of capital and
the amount credited to the surplus account of the corporation,
and the act was amended later on to change the limit from
$500 million to $750 million. The item which was struck from
supplementary estimates (D) would have increased the limit
from $750 million to $2.5 billion.
Paragraph (b) of Vote 77d would have increased from $750
million to $1 billion the amount set out in Section 28 of the
Export Development Act. That, again, has to do with the
limits of insurance and guarantees which the corporation can
give to agencies or individuals seeking its assistance in connection with exports to other countries.
These two amounts, I might add, can hardly be considered
e (1510)
as being appropriations. The item in question would have

there was $50 million owing for prior years but, in fact, there
is to be a recovery of $60 million, the total change being due to
new data with respect to the revenue base.
I wish to add at this time that these negotiations which take
place with the provinces in order to establish these transfer
payments are very complicated, because they are based on
many various data. I fail to understand why reference was
made in committee to regulations. In my opinion, the word
should have been "negotiations," because these transfer payments with the provinces are finalized through the process of
varied and complicated negotiations every year, as the data
upon which they are based changes from year to year.
The addition of $583 million contained in these supplementary estimates, which is the difference between the $360
million originally planned and the revised amount of $943
million in the present estimates, is due to the fact that the
main estimates were prepared when the outcome of negotiations with the provinces was quite uncertain. With respect to
the negotiation concerning the substitution of a new formula
under regulations for the calculation of revenue guarantees for
personal income tax and corporation income tax, the $360
million was not assumed to be correct, but merely an indication of the government's continuing commitment. So there was
no trick played there upon anyone. It was because the information and the data were not available that this estimated
amount of $360 million was chosen to be included in the main
estimates.
I pass now to the 52 $1 items, which are described in the
new explanatory section which now appears in the supplementary blue book. The attention of honourable senators is drawn
to these new explanations. They will be found to be helpful and
quite adequate for any honourable senator wishing to further
understand the contents of the blue book. I should add at this
time that of the original 52 $1 items, two were struck out
following a ruling by the Speaker of the House of Commons.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, it is my intention to
move the adjournment of the debate. Having regard to the
discussion which took place earlier, perhaps 1 should assure
honourable senators, as 1 have assured the Acting Leader of
the Government, that 1 will be prepared to proceed tomorrow.
1 would not like there to be any suggestion that this is in any
way a delaying tactic. 1 arn sure honourable senators realize, in
view of the very full statement we have had from the acting
leader, that this is not quite the usual situation we are faced

March 23, 1977

with when these deadlines corne so close to our discussion of
legisiation towards the end of the fiscal year.
It may also provîde an opportunity for the Leader of the
Opposition to engage in some discussion as to how we might
expedite the matter before us, because it involves not only this
bill but others, as weII as the study of the main estimates for
the comning fiscal year which is yet to take place in the
National Finance Committee.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
ADJOURNMENT

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(g), I move that when

SENATE DEBATES
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Monday
next, March 28, 1977, at 8 o'clock in the evening.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Senator Asselin: Explain.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I should like to give
the reason for this motion and also the schedule of work in
store for us next week.
It will be necessary for the Senate to meet Monday night in
order to complete the items remaining on the order paper and
to deal with the interim supply bill which has not yet reached
us. I should point out that there is considerable urgency with
respect to the passage of Bill C-45, the interim supply bill
covering the three-twelfths of the main estimates for 1977-78.
Those estimates are now before the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. It had been expected that Bill C-45
would pass the House of Commons tonight, but just before the
adjournment of that house last night an order was made
deferring any division demanded in relation to Bill C-45 to
Monday evening, March 28. Of course, if there is no division,
the bill could pass tonight. On Monday evening we shall
continue with Bill C-44, and Senator Thompson will move
second reading of Bill C-37. On Tuesday we shall have Bill
C-45.
I should now like to give a brief summary of the work
scheduled for our committees next week. The Committee on
National Finance will meet on Tuesday at 10 a.m. to examine
the main estimates for 1977-78. On Wednesday the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee will meet at 9.30 a.m. to
hear witnesses on the white paper on banking legislation, after
which it will proceed to the subject matter of Bill C-16. It will
meet again at 2.30 p.m. for the same purpose. A meeting of
the Agriculture Committee has been set down for 3.30 p.m.
Wednesday, or when the Senate rises, and Mr. Whelan, the
Minister of Agriculture, will give evidence on the beef industry
in Canada.
On Thursday the National Finance Committee will hold
another meeting on the main estimates for 1977-78 at 9.30
a.m. At 3.30 p.m., or when the Senate rises, the Agriculture
Committee will continue its inquiry into the beef industry. Mr.
Lessard, the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion, will
appear before the committee. Also on Thursday the Standing
Joint Committee on Regulations and other Statutory Instruments will meet at 3.30 p.m.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I wonder if I could
ask the Acting Leader of the Government whether 1 understood him correctly when he said that the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance would meet on Tuesday and
again on Thursday to discuss the main estimates which have
been referred to that committee. If it takes until Thursday
morning for that committee to report on the main estimates,
what program does the acting leader see for the passage of the
interim supply bill which, according to our custom, if not our
rules, should not be considered here until we have the report of
the National Finance Committee on the main estimates? Does

March 24, 1977

he envisage the National Finance Committee's concluding its
consideration and bringing in its report before Thursday?
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, to place this question in its proper perspective, I should say that it has never
been the practice of this chamber to await the report of the
National Finance Committee on the main estimates before
passing interim supply, because interim supply does not release
any item from the main estimates, which are open to discussion and to further reference to the National Finance
Committee.
0

(1410)

The committee meeting Tuesday is to give honourable senators a chance to have a look at these main estimates, of which
we will be asked to pass three-twelfths on the same day. But it
is not necessary, in my view, to have a report of this committee
before we do so. As I said previously, we are not releasing any
of the items of these main estimates, which are open to further
discussion and consideration by any Senate committee even
after the passage of the interim supply bill. I hope this is the
information that my honourable friend wanted, but h am
prepared to supplement it if necessary.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I would agree with
the statement made by the Acting Leader of the Government
that it has not been the custom of this chamber to await the
report of the National Finance Committee on the main estimates before we pass interim supply. However, it seems to me
that we should wait for such a report, because the National
Finance Committee is the committee on which we rely for a
general statement that the main estimates are in order, with
whatever qualifications that committee wishes to make. It does
not make much sense, without having the report of the National Finance Committee on the main estimates, that we are
prepared to say, "Go ahead. We will give you one-quarter of it
anyway."
I would therefore hope that if not in this case then at least
on future occasions the leadership of the government in this
place will insist, when references are made to the National
Finance Committee of such important matters as the main
estimates, that that committee deal with them far more speedily than they have done in this case. The National Finance
Committee, of which I am a member and so I must take some
of the responsibility, received the reference in February, and
we are now in the position of being within one week of the
deadline and we will be dealing with it only on Tuesday.
I hope that the management of the Senate will in future
insist that this process be speeded up so that senators will have
at least a week to digest the report of the committee before
being asked to approve expenditures under the main estimates.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, in my open and, I
hope, frank way of dealing with matters of this kind, I am
ready to admit that the point raised by my honourable friend is
well taken. In this case the Senate itself is to blame, because
these main estimates were referred to the National Finance
Committee almost two weeks ago. There is no reason whatsoever why they have not been dealt with. But, as the honourable

SENATE DEBATES

March 24, 1977

senator bas said, we are faced with a deadline. As I explained
yesterday, starting Wednesday, March 30, and continuing on
to March 31, cheques have to be mailed to public servants
across the country, and these cheques cannot be cashed before
April 1 because they fall into the following fiscal year. For this
reason we cannot expect that the Department of Supply and
Services can issue cheques before authorization has been given
for this payment by Parliament. That is why we are faced with
a deadline. In this case my honourable friend was right in
pointing out that we are at fault in this place, because we
should have dealt with these estimates before now. I strongly
suggested yesterday to the clerk of this committee, the chairman and vice-chairman being away, that we should at least
have a go at these estimates before I introduce this bill in the
house on Monday evening, or probably on Tuesday now. That
is why a meeting has been set for Tuesday morning. I have
tried to arrange to have the minister present, but unfortunately
he had a previous commitment which he could not set aside. I
have arranged, however, to have the Secretary of the Treasury
Board read a statement from the minister, and other officials
of the department will be present to answer any detailed
questions.
I regret this unfortunate situation, but I am afraid we will
have to live with it. I hope it is not going to set a precedent.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I agree entirely with
what the Acting Leader of the Government has said, and I
certainly will not press the point that we should change the
traditional practice in respect to the first interim supply bill
this particular week. The reason I rose was that I hoped the
acting leader, who has, I am sure, the same concern as we have
on this side of the chamber about these matters, will treat this
as a case in point and try to prevent it happening again,
certainly in the near future.
Senator Langlois: You may depend on my taking care of
this in the future.
Motion agreed to.
IMMIGRATION
PERSONS LIVING IN CANADA UNDER DEPORTATION ORDERS OR
CONTRARY TO COURT RULINGS-QUESTION

Senator Ewasew: Honourable senators, may I draw the
attention of the Acting Leader of the Government to an article
that appeared in the Montreal Gazette this morning, entitled,
"Civil servant cites immigration mess."
In the Department of Manpower and Immigration there is
apparently a public servant by the name of Boris Domazet,
who claims that there are some 70 persons under deportation
orders who should not be, and more than 1,000 persons who
have been admitted to Canada contrary to court rulings. Mr.
Domazet alleges:
-that the branch of the department for which he works
is a "whole mess" fraught with discrimination, patronage
and deliberate oversight, Domazet says his investigations
80003 -372

have revealed errors overlooked by senior branch officials
for 12 years.
Mr. Domazet says that he made a report which apparently
has disappeared from the department, and he has now filed a
petition in this respect with 20 members of Parliament.
My question to the deputy leader is: May we have a copy of
that petition?
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I shall take this
question as notice and endeavour to have a copy of this
document furnished in due time.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1977
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of the Honourable Senator Langlois for second reading
of the Bill C-44, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service for the financial year ending the
31st March, 1977.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, the discussion
of this bill, which arises out of the supplementary estimates
(D) for the current financial year, that is, the year ending on
the 31 st of this month, bas sorme relation to the discussion that
took place a few minutes ago, though only to the extent that
we are once again in what we have called "the time bind,"
which is a matter upon which I am not going to elaborate at
this time. I am quite sure that the Leader of the Government
and the Deputy Leader of the Government are as much
concerned about this situation, which arises from time to time,
as we are in this group.
It is my pleasant duty to congratulate the acting leader on,
as usual, a thorough-going and excellent presentation of legislation. I particularly congratulate him on the fact that he went
beyond the normal information given in a bill of this kind, for
the very good reason that this is not the traditional appropriations bill that we expect. That is because it has been amended
in two important items or votes since it was considered by the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. Normally it
has been the practice to accept the report of the National
Finance Committee on the basis that it has considered the
estimates on which an appropriation bill of this type is based
and has reported to us. When I adjourned the debate yesterday
afternoon I said that I hoped the government might provide an
opportunity for us to discuss a way in which we might expedite
the passage of this bill in keeping with what this house judges
to be its duties and responsibilities in an important matter of
this kind. Some discussions have taken place, and I believe
that the Acting Leader of the Government is prepared, under
the extraordinary circumstances of this bill, to move that it be
referred to a Committee of the Whole House at some time in
the near future. He has been good enough to advise me that
that is a decision that has been reached, and for that I thank
him.
* (1420)

I can understand the reason for the acting leader's agreeing
to this. It is because, as I said, this is an unusual bill. It comes

SENATE DEBATES
to us with two important amendments which, in some ways,
may be far-reaching and may affect the whole concept of the
relationship of the estimates to an appropriation bill. I am
quite sure that all senators agree with me that these last
minute demands on the Senate to pass bills-not only this one,
but the appropriation bill that follows the examination of the
main estimates-do not make for a satisfactory manner in
which to proceed. However, as I have said, the agreement of
all here is so general that it is not a matter which I should
labour at this particular time.
In dealing with Bill C-44, Senator Langlois gave us an
explanation of its more important provisions including, for
example, the basic figures with which we are dealing-something in the order of $494 million of expenditures for which a
vote is required, and another $436 million which is made up of
statutory items-items for which provision is already enacted.
So we are dealing with a vote of something like $500 million.
Senator Langlois also referred in his excellent, if somewhat
optimistic, outline to the efforts the government has been
making to restrain expenditures. Some of us feel that the
restraint has not gone far enough yet. On the other hand, I
have to acknowledge that certainly the President of the Treasury Board and his immediate predecessor have made it very
clear-at least to me and, I hope, to the National Finance
Committee-that they have been making strenuous efforts to
restrain expenditures of government departments and agencies.
With respect to the comparisons we were given by the acting
leader of the projections of restraint, the relation of the
increase in the budget to the increase in the gross national
product is useful but, of course, not entirely comparative. This
is so for the very good reason that the figures put before us in
the blue book and appropriation bills are far from being the
whole record of expenditure anticipated by the government.
However, that may be a matter we can discuss on another
occasion.
Senator Langlois gave us a rundown of the major increases
in items of expenditure required in these supplementaries, and
an explanation of why in each case. He also dealt with the
matter of the federal-provincial transfer payments, and the
problem that the revenue on which they are based is not known
at the time of the main estimates. This is a matter that
Senator Flynn, the Leader of the Opposition, raised, and on
which Senator Langlois gave us quite an extended explanation
from the government side. I imagine that later Senator Flynn
will have something to say about it, so I will leave that to him.
Senator Langlois then dealt with what he called the 52 $1
items. It is in this peripheral area that we have the changes
that have been made to the bill as it is presented to us today,
compared to the bill on first reading in the House of Commons
and reference to our National Finance Committee. Senator
Langlois has made it quite clear that this is not the place to
debate a ruling of the Speaker of the House of Commons. It is,
however, germane to our discussion here because it has made
amendments to the bill necessary, and it is not merely a
procedural issue. It is not trivial. In line with Senator Langlois'

March 24, 1977

caution, I will not quote the Speaker of the other place, but
rather summarize what he said, which was to the effect that he
proposed to "set aside" these two $1 items, and that this was
far from merely incidental to their procedure. He said it
touches on the very fundamentals-on the very right of Parliament to function. This is a strong statement. He also saidand again I am paraphrasing-that this matter before us at
this particular moment touches on the right of Parliament to
function, the right of Parliament to examine the spending
estimates, and so on.
There has been some confusion on this in the press reports,
and perhaps on a superficial reading of the debates and the
ruling. I repeat that I do not intend to discuss the ruling as to
whether it is good or bad, but merely point out that in his
ruling the Speaker made it quite clear that he was not concerned merely with $1 items. In fact, he was not concerned
that these two particular cases which he ruled against were $1
items. He made it very clear that it did not matter whether
they were $1 items or $100 items. The basic principle was
whether Parliament has the right to legislate in the broader
sense in an appropriation act, and he made a distinction
between the right of Parliament to act by enacting legislation
and the right of Parliament to implement that legislation by
authorizing the expenditure of money in an appropriation bill.
I will say no more than that on this, except that when we go
to committee it may be a time, when the minister is there, to
ask him if it is now the policy of government, particularly in
the area of amending legislation, not to attempt to legislate
particularly by using $1 items or other votes in appropriation
bills.
As Senator Langlois said in his summary, the Speaker
merely cautions that his ruling should not be taken as a
precedent. I accept that, but I think that any careful analysis
of the debate and the ruling will indicate that what the
Speaker was saying was that, of the ten items which had been
brought to his attention as possibly being beyond the power of
Parliament to pass in this particular bill under the Standing
Orders of the House of Commons, he had selected only two,
and the basis of his selection was that these are two votes in
which there is a clear statement that their effect would be to
amend legislation. Again I emphasize that he said it does not
matter whether they are $1 votes or $1 million votes. As the
intention was to amend other legislation, Mr. Speaker said
that he proposed to set them aside.

(1430)

In the bill hefore us, of course, these two items have been set
aside, but this is of particular interest to the Senate because, in
refreshing my own memory, I went back as far as 1969 to a
hearing of our National Finance Committee and its report,
and to the statements made in the chamber, which suggest
that the ruling now made by Mr. Speaker is the proper way to
proceed in such matters. Members of that committee will, I
am suré agree with me that for years we have drawn attention
to what we have called an improper device-that is, the use of
appropriation bills to enact or amend legislation. It may be a
matter of semantics, of course, because it can be immediately

March 24, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

said that an appropriation act is, in one sense of the word,
legislation. That argument has been used over and over again
to justify this method of enacting legislation, but now at least
we have this ruling and the hope that in future there will be a
distinct separation between the authority given by Parliament
to the government to act in the usual type of bill and the
authority given to the government to spend in an appropriation
bill. I am sure, if this does become the policy of the government in the future, it will resolve many of the differences and
solve many of the problems that occur in the other place and
here when these kinds of items appear in appropriation bills.
The other general details of the appropriation bill before us
have been examined carefully by the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance, and it is therefore unnecessary for
me at this time to discuss them further. That report has been
presented and debated.
I suppose the remaining major item is the ticklish matter of
the revised base of the transfer payments under the federalprovincial legislation. This is more important than might
appear on the surface to some, and I hope it will be the subject
of discussion in the Committee of the Whole, or will at least be
the subject of questioning of the minister or his representatives
on that occasion. I hope the Acting Leader of the Government
will be in a position before we adjourn for the weekend to
inform the Senate when the meeting of the Committee of the
Whole will take place. I know be will have some problems in
arranging it, but it would be useful to know that before we
adjourn to next week.
With those few observations, which I might say would have
been much longer had it not been for the undertaking by the
acting leader to allow us to discuss this further in another
forum, I will say that we on this side, unless there is some
other senator who wishes to speak, are prepared to see the bill
receive second reading today. I say that on behalf of the
Leader of the Opposition, if that is the wish of the Acting
Leader of the Government.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: It may seem odd and perhaps
improper for an obscure backbencher on the government side
of the bouse to make any comments on this matter, but I
merely want to endorse fully and to emphasize strongly what
the Deputy Leader of the Opposition bas just said about this
business of enacting substantive legislation by supply bills.
I think it is an outrageous and iniquitous way of proceeding.
I think it is very much to the credit of the Senate that our
National Finance Committee and the Senate itself have
repeatedly denounced this and demanded that the practice
should be dropped. But I think the time has now come when it
may be necessary for us to go even farther perhaps than we
have done in the past on this.
I read the proceedings in the other place. Of course one
cannot quote from them. I do not intend even to try. But they
impressed upon me again the iniquitousness of this way of
proceeding. Thanks to the rules that now prevail in the House
of Commons on the subject of consideration of estimates, it is
exceedingly difficult there, in fact very nearly impossible, to

get the kind of discussion on the estimates that ordinarily took
place under the old rules, the time-honoured committee of
supply and the procedure which had been used until a comparatively few years ago. The fact that it is impossible, or
virtually impossible, to get adequate debate on these things in
the House of Commons, I think places upon the Senate and
upon the National Finance Committee an extra responsibility
which that committee and this house are, I think, in a position
to discharge very thoroughly.
It means that we need to scrutinize these items much more
carefully, even more carefully than we have in the past. We
probably need to debate them fully. I should go farther and
say that, if need be, we should be prepared to amend or even to
reject appropriation bills which contain this kind of provision.
Of course, somebody will say that we have no right to
amend or to reject money bills. The fact of the matter is that
we have done so over and over again in the past-not in the
recent past, but over and over again in a not very distant past.
If the people's rights are not being adequately defended in the
other place, then I think an extra responsibility falls upon this
house.
I want to make reference to two particular items in the bill,
the one dealing with the establishment of Rail Canada and the
one dealing with the transformation of the Seaway debt into
equity. Both of these, it seems to me, are matters of major
importance. One of them, the Rail Canada proposal, is a
major development in transportation policy, and that it should
be enacted into law, or even partially enacted into law-I
know there is something there about incorporation under the
Corporations Act, or something of the sort-but that this
should be enacted into law or even partially enacted into law
by a device like this I think is simply scandalous.
Honourable senators may recall that when Loto Canada was
being established last year I and others protested against this
method of proceeding. We got, finally, a debate on that, which
made it much more satsifactory, of course, but that merely
illustrates my point that I think we ought to have debates on
these things and on the principles of them.
When the matter comes before the Committee of the
Whole, as I gather it will, I hope this will be driven home to
the minister and to any officials who may be appearing,
because it is really, in my judgment, wholly subversive of
parliamentary government that matters of this importance,
particularly, shLould be dealt with as items in a supply bill.
And, of cour ., when it comes to some of these $1 items which
undertake to amend existing legislation and that sort of thing,
then the case is even more flagrant.
I felt I could not remain silent when this was going on,
because I certainly did not come here to be a yes-man for
anybody, and I think it is incumbent upon any senator who
feels as strongly as I do about this to say his piece and to make
clear that in spite of his general support of the administration
he is not prepared to countenance this kind of procedure.

Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I wish to inform the Senate that if
the Honourable Senator Langlois speaks now, his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate on the motion for the
second reading of this bill.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, in closing the
debate I wish to thank my honourable friend, the Acting
Leader of the Opposition, for his kind remarks in relation to
my introduction of this measure in the Senate. Putting aside
my personal and innate shortcomings, I always endeavour to
do my best, which I think is a bare minimum, in the discharge
of my duties in this chamber. I do hope-and I might be
presumptuous in saying this-that I will never fail my colleagues in that respect.
Having said that, I am happy to inform the Senate that,
following discussion with Senator Grosart yesterday, I am
agreeable to having this bill referred to a Committee of the
Whole, and I propose to so move as soon as it has received
second reading.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

PROPOSED SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE MATTERS
OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO ALL CANADIANS-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Cook calling the attenton of the Senate to matters of interest concerning Labrador and also to the
desirability of establishing a Special Joint Committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons to examine matters of mutual interest to ail Canadians whether they
reside in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada-(Honourable
Senator Petten).
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, with leave, I
should like to speak to this inquiry now.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, after the admirable
speech which the Honourable Senator Cook delivered on this
subject, and the excellent intervention of the Honourable

March 24, 1977

Senator Desruisseaux, and possibly others whose names escape
me at the moment, it may seem what the Anglican prayer
book calls a work of supererogation for anyone else to speak.
When I was speaking to some people on this subject last
night, I said I was going to speak in the Senate this afternoon
on it and I should probably be doing little more than adding
footnotes to what Senator Cook had said. On reconsideration,
I am inclined to think that I may go well beyond footnotes. It
is difficult to avoid doing so if one attempts to discuss this
question at ail.
I hasten to add that I propose to deal only with a very few
points-which I trust will not be repetitive of what Senator
Cook bas said, though occasionally I may trespass in that
re.gard-a very few points which I think are of fundamental
importance in this whole question of the relationship of the
.present Province of Quebec to Canada and the possibility of its
becoming an independent foreign state.
The first thing I want to do is to state clearly the answer, as
I see it, to the request I get repeatedly from people for an
answer to the question: "Can Quebec or any other province,
legally separate from Canada under the present Constitution?"
To that, the answer is, in my judgment, a flat and unequivocal no. No provincial legislature has any powers except those
which are granted to it by the British North America Act. To
the best of my recollection, those powers are contained in
sections 92, 93 and 95.
Section 92 explicitly begins:
In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make
Laws in relation to MattersAnd the various matters are enumerated.
Section 93 begins:
In and for each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to Education, subject and according to the following Provisions:And then, of course, the guarantees, or what the Fathers of
Confederation hoped would be the guarantees, for the separate
and dissentient schools of the Roman Catholic and Protestant
minorities of the Queen's subjects.
Section 95, of course, gives the Parliament of Canada and
the legislatures of the provinces concurrent jurisdiction over
agriculture and immigration, but with an explicit provision
that in case of conflict the Dominion legislation shall prevail.
I defy anybody to go through the British North America
Act from end to end with a fine-tooth comb, to go through ail
of the amendments with a fine-tooth comb, and find any
warrant whatever for the assertion that any province can
legally secede from Canada under the present Constitution.
The next question I am apt to get is: "Well, is there any
constitutional way in which a province could secede from
Confederation?" And I think the answer to that is yes. But it
is an answer which involves a rather elaborate procedure, only
a very little of it a matter of strict law; most of it a matter of

March 24,1977

DEBATES
Marc 24,1977SENATE

and everybody else was ardently in favour of it, or at ail events
in favour of it, or if my native province of Newfoundland were
the sole objector, the Parliament of Canada migbt go abead
anyway saying, "Well, at least we've got a general consensus."'
1 proffer that qualification of wbat Professor Lederman said
witb a proper diffidence, recognizing that he may very well be
rigbt and that unanimous consent would be necessary for an
amendment permitting any province to leave Confederation.
The next point that arises is: Is there any likelihood that tbe
Parliament of Canada could get the consent of aIl the provinces, or, even if it could, would go abead to ask for such an
amendment witbout knowing the terms on which secession
would take place and embodying them in the amendment?
To that my answer would be, "Certainly not." It seems to
me that you are not likely in any circumstances to get any
amendment of this sort passed by the Parliament of Canada
for submission to the British Parliament unless the terms had
already been worked out. 0f course, 1 hasten to add that in my
judgment no terms can be worked out, no negotiations can
take place, unless M. Lévesque gets a majority in bis plebiscite. Strictly speaking, it wouldn't be a referendum because, as
constitutional lawyers know, under the decision of the Judicial
Committee in the Manitoba Initiative and Referendum Act
case, no province bas power to hold a referendum properly so
called. AIl it can do is bold a plebiscite, getting an expression
of opinion. It cannot, as it were, pass a law by referendum.
Well, assuming that M. Lévesque gets a majority in bis
plebiscite-and 1 immediately say absit omen, God forbid, à
Dieu ne plaise; 1 couldn't hope more ardently than 1 do that he
would not get such a majority-but assuming that he gets it,
tben, it seems to me, a period of very tougb negotiation would
follow, a period of negotiation in wbich each side would be
governed strictly by what it considered its collective interest,
its national interest; and the problems wbich would arise are
staggering, both in size and in complexity. 1 shahl mention just
a few of them.
One very obvious one, whicb would brîng in the United
States, incidentally, is, of course, the wbole future of tbe St.
Lawrence Seaway. 1 felt that was a pretty complicated and
a (1450)
Does that establish one of the conventions of tbe Constitu- difficult problem. When 1 read the cbapter on tbe subject by
tion, one of the customary rules according to which the Professor Jackson, in a book called One Country or Two,
1
country is governed? The senior professor of constitutional law issued by McGili-Queen's Press two or tbree years ago,
of Queen's University, in decided that 1 had been extremely simplistic and naive; tbat, to
in this country, Professor Lederman
a speech in Halifax last weekend, of wbich be was kind enough use tbe words of the Queen of Sheba in scripture, "The haîf
to give me a preliminary copy, said flatly: Yes, it does. It had not been told unto me;" that the difficulties were complex
would be constitutionally impossible for Parliament to seek an and huge beyond my wildest imaginings. There is one problem
amendment to the British North America Act dealing with a that would be a very difficult one to deal witb, 1 tbink.
Then, of course, you have, in the second place, the question
matter like this wîthout the consent of ail the provinces.
With great respect, 1 arn a littie inclined to make a reserva- of the division of the national assets and the national debt; and
very possibly the views of tbe Government of Canada and tbe
tion on tbat point. 1 used to share Professor Lederman's
opinion. After some discussion witb various constitutional government of tbe coming-into-being independent state of
lawyers, whose opinion 1 value and respect, 1 was inclined to Quebec might diverge very widely indeed. 1 tbink it is not
bedge a little bit; and 1 sbould be inclined now, 1 think, to say inconceivable, for example, that the Government of Quebec
that if, for example, the province of Prince Edward Island, to would be inclined to say, "Well, a considerable part of tbe debt
of Canada bas been incurred in military expenditures, notably
take the very smallest province, objected to an amendment,

constitutional custom on wbich, of course, there is sometimes
room for some difference of opinion.
There are, as honourable senators will recali, various matters in the Constitution which can be changed by an ordinary
act of the Parliament of Canada. Under the provisions of
section 91, head 1, of the British North America Act, Parliament could, for example, abolish the monarchy or abolish the
Senate, to take two glaring examples, by a simple act, just as
easily as Parliament can amend the Food and Drugs Act or the
Criminal Code. But section 91, bead 1, carefully excludes from
the amending power granted to Parliament in 1949 a variety of
higbly important, capitally important, subjects, notably the
powers of the provincial legislatures. So that it seems to me
quite clear that we could not, in this Parliament, by an act
change the British North America Act to allow for the secession of any province. It follows, therefore, that the legal power
to do so rests stili in the British Parliament, wbicb, bowever,
acts simply as a rubber stamp for any request by the Parliament of Canada.
Ever since 1871, with perbaps one mînor exception, no
amendment bas been made to the British North America Act
by the Parliament of the United Kingdomn, except on request
from the Parliament of Canada, usually in the form of an
address from botb bouses asking the Queen to submit to the
Parliament of the United Kingdom the necessary legisiation.
Since 1930 there bas grown up a practice in regard to
amendments to the British North America Act which directly
affect tbe provinces, a practice of Parliament asking for sucb
amendments only with the consent of ail of the governments of
the provinces concernied. In 1930, wben the natural resources
were returned to the prairies provinces and a small body of
land to the Province of British Columbia, the four western
provinces were consulted and gave their consent before Parliament passed the address asking for that change in the British
North America Act. In ail the other cases since 1930, where
the interests of the provinces bave been directly concerned,
directly affected, action by Parliament in the form of a joint
address to the Queen bas taken place only after ail the
provinces bave consented.

SENATE DEBATES
during two wars, with which a great many of us disagreed, and
we don't sec why we should have to shoulder this burden which
in effect was imposed upon the country by the English-speaking majority, and therefore we want to sec that part of the
debt, as far as we are concerned, cut down; we would rather
not assume any part of that."
We might find also that the Government of Quebec expected to get a much larger share of the national assets, whether
situated within the confines of Quebec's territory or otherwise,
than the Government of Canada thought suitable. It seems to
me you would have a very difficult question there, a very
difficult problem to resolve.
Then, of course, there is the question of exactly what would
constitute Quebec for purposes of this secession. I don't want
to sound inflammatory or extreme, but I do think that this' is a
real problem, and it is a real problem partly because it has
been raised by the Parti Québécois itself, and raised in more
than one form.
As Senator Cook pointed out, it has been raised in relation
to the Labrador boundary, and the view which the present
Government of Quebec takes, to the best of my belief, is that it
does not recognize the judgment, the award, of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in 1927. It doesn't regard that
as law-an attitude that strikes me as convenient but a trifle
bizarre. I have never noticed any tendency on the part of any
government of Quebec to reject the judgments of the Privy
Council which in effect enlarged the powers of the provinces;
but this appears to be a theory "If you don't like a judgment,
then it really isn't binding on you." That I find a little difficult
to take, a little difficult to accept. But that question, I think,
would undoubtedly arise.
You would almost certainly have the Government of Quebec
asking for either the whole of Labrador or at least for a very
large chunk of it, and I think it quite safe to say that the
Government of Newfoundland would strongly object to this. In
fact, I went so far, when I was asked a question about this on
the radio, as to say on that subject, "Every Newfoundlander in
the world would spring to the defence of the Labrador boundary and all the dead ones would rise from their graves and join
us." I didn't mean nesessarily by force of arms. I said
"defence" not necessarily in the physical sense, but I shouldn't
entirely rule that out either. My fellow countrymen from
Newfoundland are a very tough crowd and I shouldn't want to
answer for what they might do if they got thoroughly angered
by something of this sort. Anyway, the problem is likely to
arise.
Another part of this problem with the boundaries is, of
course, the question of the territories which were added to
Quebec in 1898 and 1912. Those territories had been part of
the Hudson's Bay territory purchased by Canada with Canadian moncy from the Hudson's Bay Company, and it seems to
me quite conceivable that the Government of Canada would
argue, as one of the members of the constitutional committee
some years ago did when this matter came up, that those
territories were given to Quebec as a province of Canada, and

March 24, 1977

if it became an independent foreign state then that was a new
ball game.
One parenthetical note on this was supplied to me a few
days ago by someone who had looked up the statistics of
population for Ungava in 1912. 1 am sorry to say that I can't
remember the exact figures he gave, and I haven't attempted
to verify them, but they were something like this, that at that
time in the Territory of Ungava there were a considerable
number of Eskimos-Inuits they are called nowadays, of
course-and Indians, and then certainly less than 10 of each of
the other categories he mentioned; I think it was something
like four French Canadians, two English people, two Scotch
people and one Irishman-something of that sort. Anyway, the
whole European population was microscopie. The main population of the territory was Inuit or Indian. Of course, that does
not settle the question but it is one factor. If there were a
proposal by Canada to hang on to that territory, then it would
not be possible, I think, to say, "Oh, but this has been from a
time immemorial part of the patrimony of Quebec; this has
been from time immemorial part of the homeland of the
French Canadian people."
* (1500)

Then you have another factor in this border business-this
boundaries of Quebec business for the purposes of the hypothetical negotiations-and that is that you might very easily
have a substantial part of the population of Quebec voting no
in a referendum or plebiscite on separation, even though the
majority of the citizens of the whole province voted yes,
saying, "Yes, we want to separate." This is not simply a thing
of my own imagining, because we all know that there are
certain associations which have been formed recently in Western Quebec and on the Island of Montreal which have said in
effect that if Quebec secedes from Canada, they want their
particular part of Quebec to secede from Quebec and stay in
Canada. And this could raise a problem because you could
perfectly well, it seems to me, have the possibility of considerable sections of even old, pre-1898 Quebec saying, "No, we
don't want to secede."
I had an inquiry from Dr. Shaw, the member of the
Legislative Assembly of Quebec who is one of the people
promoting this idea, as to the constitutional position in the
matter, and I said, "Well, there is nothing to prevent you
seceding from Quebec if you can get the consent of the Quebec
legislature. Under the British North America Act, 1871, the
Parliament of Canada can diminish, increase, alter in any way
the limits of any province provided the legislature of the
province consents." I said, "Of course, that looks as if you
were stuck, because obviously the legislature of the province is
not likely to consent." "But," I said, "on the other hand,
substantially the position is also that the province of Quebec
cannot secede from Canada without the consent of the Parliament of Canada. So it is not quite such a dead stymie for you
as it might appear." I will come back in a moment to this
particular aspect of the thing in a slightly different context.
There is a further factor which might enter into the discussion of boundaries. I was looking over, just yesterday or the

March 24, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

day before, the draft program of the Parti Québécois, drawn
up by the present Quebec Minister of Education, Maître
Jacques Yvan Morin, and I was astonished-I had read it
before, but I had completely forgotten it-I was astonished to
find an article in the draft constitution for the state of Quebec
which provided for the annexing by Quebec of contiguous
territories of Ontario and New Brunswick inhabited by
French-speaking people. Now I think you can make an argument on-what shall we say?-a basis of natural law or
self-determination on various high moral principles, or what
are claimed to be high moral principles, at all events, for
saying that if there is to be an independent francophone state,
then it should include not only the territory of the province of
Quebec, however that may be defined, but also the contiguous
areas of Ontario and New Brunswick inhabited mainly by
French-speaking Canadians, though, of course, if you are
going to make that argument, it seems very difficult to deny
the right of certain parts of the province of Quebec to secede
from Quebec simply because they don't want to be part of that
independent state of Quebec. So that you might very easily
have a strong irridentist feeling in the Government of Quebec
in these negotiations, and the Government of Quebec might
very well say, "Well, it is all very well to talk about the
territory of Quebec as it stands, but after all the French
Canadian 'nation' has now extended well beyond the boundaries of Quebec and we want to have our separated brethren in
the other provinces nearby"-I don't suppose they would
attempt to do anything about the remoter parts of the country
and the small French Canadian minorities there-"we want to
have our separated brethren in the contiguous territories
united with us in one great, glorious, francophone independent
state."
Now I said I would come back to the matter of possible
secession or excision of certain parts of the present province of
Quebec from Canada in a slightly different context. That
context is what seems to me the necessity, the absolute necessity, of having a corridor linking the Atlantic provinces with the
rest of what will remain of Canada. That corridor, of course,
might go up through Ungava, assuming that Canada was able
to retain Ungava, or it might go through the southern part of
the province, assuming that the majority of the people in that
part of the province were desirous of remaining in
Confederation.
I don't know the answers to these things, and I am not
prepared to suggest answers. I merely raise these problems
because it seems to me that they are very grave, difficult and
complex problems, and I think that one of the main arguments
that M. Lévesque has been making both in Quebec and outside
of it is the ease with which this transaction could be negotiated, the simplicity of it, and the general spirit of brotherly love
which would reign over the proceedings. I should hope there
would be brotherly love, but I feel a trifle skeptical about the
extent or depth of it. I am afraid that a good many people
would be angry or frightened and when people are angry or
frightened they often behave in unreasonable ways. But one
way or another, I think that this question of a corridor uniting
80003-38

the Atlantic provinces with the rest of Canada would be one
that would have to be discussed and one to which there would
have to be some solution. Exactly what kind of solution there
would be, I don't know. i don't think it would do simply to say,
"Oh, we'll give you the right to fly across our territory, in
whatever circumstances may be defined by treaty," or something of that sort.
There are just two other things I want to say this afternoon
on this subject; one has to do with what appears to be M.
Lévesque's trurmp card or one of his trump cards, economic
association with Canada. That is proffered to the population of
Quebec and to the population of the rest of Canada as
something of almost infinite reassurance: "You don't need to
worry about economic problems, you don't need to worry
about economic dislocation, you don't need to worry about a
fracturing of the intricate economic web which binds the
different parts of Canada, the Canadian common market,
together because we will negotiate an arrangement for economic union, economic association with the rest of Canada." I
am not quite sure what the contemporary version of the terms
of this association as promulgated by the Parti Québécois may
be, but originally, as I read it, they proposed that tariff policy,
monetary policy, and transportation policy should be governed
by a joint board or boards made up half of Canadian representatives and half of Quebec. There would be a common
tariff, a common monetary policy and a common transcontinental transportation policy which would be governed by this
board or boards.
Some years ago, shortly after the Parti Québécois was
founded, there was a student conference at the University of
Winnipeg, at which M. Lévesque was the star turn. By force of
circumstances, unavoidable circumstances, I arrived just too
late to hear M. Lévesque's speech. I think I heard probably the
last sentence, or something of that kind. I don't recall now.
Anyway, almost immediately we adjourned into a huge gymnasium about as large as this chamber, where I found myself
sitting cross-legged on the floor beside M. Lévesque. Very
respectfully I said to him, "M. Lévesque, there's one question
I'd like to ask you. It has to do with this proposed arrangement
of yours for economic association with Canada." I then set out
to him what I understood to be the 50-50 proposal on these
three subjects. I said to him, "I do not really see how this
would work, because it seems to me clear that the Quebec
government would be almost certain to want an increase, and
perhaps a pretty stiff increase, in the common tariff on textiles, boots and shoes and other products of Quebec industries,
which are in difficulties, or likely to be in difficulties; whereas
the Canadian delegation might say, 'Oh, no. We don't see any
necessity for that at ail.' They might say, 'After all, as long as
you were in Canada, these were our industries too. They were
Canadian industries. But now they're not, so we don't feel the
same responsibility about them at aIl.'
* (1510)

I said to him also, "It seems to me that with regard to
monetary policy, in the light of the prevailing tendency for
Quebec to have a much higher unemployment rate than

SENATE DEBATES
central and western Canada, you would probably want to have
the common monetary policy take a much more expansionary
turn in order to deal with your unemployment problem. It
seems to me possible, on the other hand, that Canada might
say, 'Oh, no, no. We don't want any more expansionary
monetary policy. That might lead to more inflation, which
we're very much afraid of.'" I said, "I don't see how it would
work. It seems to me that each party to this agreement would
have an absolute veto on things that the other party regarded
as essential, or very nearly essential. I don't think it would
work. I think the thing would blow up."
To my flabbergasted astonishment, M. Lévesque replied,
"Oh, not necessarily 50-50; one-third, two-thirds." Well, if I
had been sitting on a chair I should probably have fallen off,
but because I was on the floor I couldn't fall any farther, but I
said to him, "Well, M. Lévesque, you've been complaining for
years that you were always in a perpetual minority of onethird in all decisions. I don't think you're correct, but this is
the complaint I understand you to have made. If you accepted
an arrangement like that you would be in a perpetual minority
of one-third, locked in tight." At that point the bell rang, we
were summoned back to the plenary session, and I never got an
answer. That is putting the thing in rather stark terms, but it
seems to me that it is putting it in terms which need to be
considered.
What the precise current proposal of the Parti Québécois is
on this economic association, I frankly don't know; but there's
certainly that danger, that you might get an arrangement
which would enable either party to veto what the other
wanted. And I think that my fears about the divergent interests of the two parties have been accentuated since I was
putting these questions to M. Lévesque some years ago,
because a matter of a week or so ago I saw, from somebody in
the west-not an individual, and not apparently a collection of
mere crackpots, but some body with some claim to standing
and representativeness-something like this: "For years those
blankety blank, unspeakable so-and-so's in Ontario have been
skinning us with their high tariffs, and they've been able to do
it because the Ontario members in the House of Commons
have had the support of the Quebec members on this matter;
but once Quebec gets out they won't have that support any
more. Ontario will be in a minority. We in the west will team
up with the Atlantic provinces, who have also been skinned by
Ontario, and just watch us do the skinning."
l'm putting it in more picturesque terms than they did, but
that was the substance of it. So I think it's perfectly possible
that in any economic arrangement or any economic association
such as the Parti Québécois appears to envisage, you would
have a very strong feeling on the part of the Canadian
government, backed by this probable low tariff majority in the
House of Commons, to bring the common tariff down at
exactly the moment that the Quebec state would be asking to
have it put up.
Similarly with monetary policy. It is highly unlikely, in my
judgment, that in the foreseeable future, with the inflationary
tendencies which are, I think, endemic in our society now, the

March 24, 1977

Canadian half of the thing would consent to a markedly
expansionary common monetary policy. They would say, "Oh,
no, no. We don't want to risk any more inflation. We've had
enough of that already, thank you. If we go in for an expansionary monetary policy on the scale suggested by you people,
then we shall be in the inflationary soup, and properly in it."
I therefore think that this wonderful, magic phrase about
economic association needs to be very, very carefully scrutinized, both by the people of the province of Quebec, and by
the people in the rest of Canada, because the reassurance
which it appears to offer is a completely false reassurance. It's
an illusion.
There are two other things I want to say. I might perhaps
sum them up as one thing. I hope that we are not, any of us,
going to be led away or taken up the garden path by certain
magic words or phrases. One of these is "flexibility." The
other is "decentralization."
First I want to deal briefly with flexibility. Some people
appear to think that flexibility is one of the cardinal virtues;
that it is an absolute. These people, I think, might well propose
that our national animal should be the jelly-fish. I can't accept
that point of view. It seems to me that if you're rigid or if
you're flexible, the value, the rightness or wrongness, of your
rigidity or your flexibility, depends on what it is you're being
rigid or flexible about. If somebody comes to me and says,
"My dear fellow, that tie of yours is a ghastly mess and it
really sends me up the wall, and unfortunately I have to sit in
the same chamber with you . . ."-I am assuming it is an
honourable senator that would approach me in this fashion"...

and really, you know, it's disturbing my whole mental

make-up. Do you think you could possibly change it?" my
answer would be, "Why, certainly. I am perfectly prepared to
be flexible about that." But if anybody-and of course this
would exclude any honourable senator, l'm sure, though there
may be moments when some of you get annoyed enough with
me to feel a little like this-came to me and said, "Come on up
to the top of the Peace Tower," and when I got up there said,
"Now, look. Your very existence sends me round the bend, and
the only way you can possibly restore my sanity, or preserve it,
is to jump off," I would say, "Sorry. I have to be rather rigid
about this."
I think, on this matter of rigidity and flexibility, the value of
either of these two attitudes depends on what you are being
rigid or flexible about. I get tired beyond measure of people
who repeat the word "flexibility" in the same way that the
proverbial old lady repeated that blessed word "Mesopotamia"
which she had found in the Scripture and from which she said
she got such infinite help, strength and comfort.
There may be room for various changes in our Constitution;
there may be room for flexibility on certain things; but let us
be quite clear about those specific things on which we think
such flexibility is possible.
I may add at this point that I don't think the question of
either flexibility or decentralization is something that's going
to have the smallest effect on M. Lévesque or on the Parti

March 24, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Québécois in general. I don't think the word "compromise"
occurs in their lexicon, and quite reasonably and properly and
logically, from their point of view. I'm not complaining about
that; I simply say it's a fact to be faced. I noticed that Mr.
Douglas Fullerton, in the Toronto Star some little time ago,
said we should have a compromise between M. Lévesque and
Mr. Trudeau. Well, i don't know in what ivory tower he's been
living for some years, but that seemed to me to be one of the
most foolish remarks I'd ever heard in my life, and a remark
unrealistic to the point of infinity.
The other great word is "decentralization." If anybody
means by "decentralization", decentralizing central government departments and agencies, then that seems to me a quite
reasonable idea. There may be limits to it. I think there are
some things you couldn't very well send out to the west or to
Come-By-Chance or Empty Basket, Newfoundland. There are
other things which could be dispersed across the country, and I
think this is part of the present government's policy. Sometimes it may be applied with a little less circumspection, and a
little less consultation than may be advisable, but I think it is a
policy which is not at all novel and I suspect it is one with
which a great many people in most political parties in this
country would agree. But if you are talking about handing over
powers of the central Parliament to the provincial legislatures,
then I become much more skeptical.
• (1520)
The Joint Committee on the Constitution some years ago
looked at this problem very carefully. It travelled all across the
country; it sat in 47 different places, large and small; it heard
all kinds of witnesses, learned and unlearned, sensible and
verging upon the lunatic. We had one man who arrived with a
revolver, and was prepared to shoot up the committee. The
Mounted Police were able to take him away. We had some
other people who, though not quite at that stage, were of
rather doubtful mental balance, shall we say. We had men and
women and old and young; we had all kinds of people appearing before us. As a result of our deliberations we concluded
that certain things which now came within the jurisdiction of
the Parliament of Canada could very well be transferred to the
jurisdiction of provincial legislatures.
My recollection is that we said the parts of the Criminal
Code dealing with lotteries and Sunday observance could be so
transferred and there were good reasons for doing so, because
there were different views in different parts of the country on
these questions. We thought, also, that the whole field of
marriage and divorce could very well be transferred to the
provinces, always, of course, with some sort of a full faith and
credit clause, so that you wouldn't find that someone who got
married in New Brunswick legally according to the laws of
New Brunswick, on moving to Manitoba discovering that he
was living in sin in that province and that his children were all
illegitimate. But those were two things which we felt could be
very easily transferred to provincial jurisdiction. Now there
may be others.
We also suggested, I think, a widening of provincial jurisdiction in the matter of family allowances, something that I think

80003-38'½2

has since been settled by administrative and legislative
arrangements between the Province of Quebec and the Government of Canada. But we also felt that there were certain
things within provincial jurisdiction which in modern circumstances might, perhaps, better be transferred to the jurisdiction
of the Parliament of Canada. One of them was control over
securities and exchange legislation. Another was, of course, the
control over prices and incomes, though there our recommendation was so obscurely drafted that it was very difficult to
make clear sense of it. In fact, I remonstrated when I saw it in
the draft and said to the chairman, Dr. MacGuigan, "This is
really muddy beyond description; it won't do, you know," and
he said, "No, I quite agree with you, but this is what the
committee decided and I am afraid we're stuck with it." But
the intent of the thing is fairly clear, that there should be a
greater degree of centralization, in the opinion of the committee at that time, a greater degree of centralization in the
control over prices and incomes, and I don't think that the
recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada by any means
entirely invalidates what we proposed on that.
Now, one of the things that have been suggested more
recently for decentralization in this sense of handing over
power to the provinces has been communications, and there I
am not well enough informed to be very positive. My impression is that it should be possible to make some adjustments
there, and that, in fact, in certain recent matters like the
agreement with the Province of Manitoba the Government of
Canada has been moving in that direction and has shown itself
disposed to the somewhat flexible, shall I say, evidently considering that in these particulars it was not giving away anything
essential.
Something has been said about immigration, also-more
power to the provinces in immigration. Well, again there may
be room for something there. I have been under the impression
that the arrangements which had been made available to all
the provinces were taken up only by Quebec for administrative
collaboration and administrative devolution, you might say;
the presence of Quebec goveriment agents in immigration
offices abroad, where they were available for consultation and
for guidance and so forth. I was under the impression that
sufficient had been done that way, but I am open to conviction
that more can be done without destroying anything essential to
the government of the country as a whole, without violating
the national interest.
A third field that has been suggested is urban affairs and
that really staggers me, because in the first place the provinces
already have exclusive jurisdiction over municipal institutions
and, unless I am much mistaken, the only reason the Government of Canada got into the picture at all on urban affairs was
because of the anguished cries the municipalities were voicing,
cries which came to us on the Constitution Committee in
strident tones and repeatedly, anguished cries that the provinces were being so stingy and niggardly with their municipalities, especially the huge metropolitan municipalities which had
enormous demands upon their resources and most inadequate
resources to meet those demands. The municipalities said,

SENATE DEBATES
"We have got to have some help; we can't get what we need
from the provinces. We have got to have some help from the
central government." They even talked about changes to the
Constitution to make some of the metropolitan areas city
states in the federation, as il were, give metropolitan areas
provincial status, rather like the city of Vienna in the Austrian
confederation.
We got a series of proposais on this, and it seems to me that
it's out of that kind of situation that the intervention, such as it
has been, by the Government of Canada in urban affairs arose.
Money was provided, research facilities were provided, advice
was provided to the municipalities simply because they found
themselves stuck, found themselves caught by the constitutional authority of the province in a frightful financial bind. So I
do not know how much further decentralization you could
make in urban affairs than you have got already, though, i
suppose, you could simply say, "Well, the Government of
Canada will shut down on everything to do with urban affairs
and leave the thing strictly to the provinces with their exclusive
jurisdiction over municipal institutions." That would be possible, but I am afraid it would raise for the municipalities,
especially the metropolitan areas, quite as many problems as it
solved. But I don't want to sound as if I am saying nothing
could be donc beyond even the areas that I have mentioned,
which seemed to me, perhaps, the most promising ones for
decentralization.
I don't sec how much more could be done in view of the fact
that we now have in Canada one of the most highly decentralized federations in the world. Professor Simeon, the head of
the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations at Queen's University, has said in an article which appeared in the Ottawa
Journal and, I think, elsewhere as well, that we have either the
most decentralized confederation in the world, or very nearly.
It is possible, I think he said-and if he didn't say it someone
else with some capacity did say it recently-it is possible that
Switzerland is slightly more decentralized, on paper at least,
though perhaps not in fact, than Canada. The recent agreement between the Government of Canada and the provinces on
financial matters I think carried that decentralization further.
Professor Simeon, in fact, said, "If you examine the history of
the last ten years you will sec a massive transfer of resources
and real power from the central to the provinces." So that just
to wave a wand and sing "decentralization," in my mind, is as
futile as to wave the other wand and sing "flexibility." You
have got to get down to something specific and definite and
say what it is you think can be donc without injury to the
national interest, or even with benefit to the national interest.
Now, there are many other things that could be said about
this. Some of them have been said by other honourable
senators, in this chamber and out, and they are of vast
importance. I have been talking about constitutional aspects
and some of the economic aspects because of what we call in
French, I think, déformation professionnelle. I have been
engaged for a good part of my life in dealing with constitutional matters and to some extent with economic matters, so I have
emphasized those. I am reluctant to go much outside the

March 24, 1977

extremely limited field of my competence. i do not mean,
however, by this to downgrade in any way the importance of
the other factors to which reference has so often been made
and with every justification. For example, the overmastering
necessity for the people in the predominantly English-speaking
provinces to accept the French fact in Canada, to accept it
wholeheartedly, to accept the utmost possible degree of bilingualism and biculturalism and to do it not grudgingly or of
necessity, for the Lord loveth a cheerful giver. I couldn't
believe in that more strongly than I do, and the only reason I
have not emphasized it in what I have been saying this
afternoon is that it has already been so adequately dealt with
by others better qualified, and also because I think it ought to
.be taken for granted in any discussion of this subject.
a (1530)
And I conclude simply with this, that one thing that has
frightened me in much of the discussion which has taken place
has been the extraordinary emphasis ail across the countrywell, very nearly all across the country-on provincialism and
the extent to which people, particularly the western provinces-Alberta and British Columbia perhaps, if I could judge
from some observations I made there last fall-seem to consider the central government and Parliament as, "Oh, well, yes,
minor conveniences which we ought to have. Yes, of course,
it's nice to have running water in the house, but we could get
along without it. A pump out in the garden would really do.
The province is what really counts. The central government-well, it is a bit of a convenience and there are a few little
things it can do which would be rather hard for the provinces
to do separately." This alarms me. There seems to be a decline
in the feeling for Canada-a feeling which I thought was
strong in most of the population, and I think was strong in
most of the population a few years ago. This frightens me. i
hope that there will be a concerted effort ail the way through
the discussion of this subject by those who do not believe in the
separation of Quebec-a concerted effort to emphasize the
importance of the concept of Canada, to emphasize the glories
of our history, the greatness of our destiny, the magnificent
future which surely awaits us if we can manage to use our
heads and our hearts-our hearts in union with our heads.
The Toronto Globe and Mail some weeks ago had an article
by two economists on the economic costs of decentralization,
and the kind of decentralization they thought of, and based
their calculations on, was a decentralization which would have
given us 10 mini-states with 10 tariffs and 10 banking policies,
among other things. Then they said, "Weil, of course, the
central authority would have to have the power to act as a
referee on these tariff and banking matters-monetary matters." I asked a question in the correspondence columns of the
Globe and Mail a few days later as to what exactly the powers
of the referee would be. It didn't seem to be very easy to define
them, and I wound up by saying I found it difficult to believe
that many people would leap to their feet to sing:
O Canada! Beloved referee!
Of customs dues and banking policy.
With glowing hearts we've seen arise,

C-44, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service for the financial year ending the 31st March,

Chair.
Pursuant to rule 18 of the Rules of the Senate, the Honourable Robert Andras, P.C., President of the Treasury Board,
was escorted to a seat in the Senate Chamber.

The Chairman: Honourable senators, the Senate is in Committee of the Whole on Bill C-44, intituled: "An Act for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1977."
Shall discussion of the title of the bill be postponed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Chairman: Clause 1. Shall clause 1 carry?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, while we are considering clause 1, I believe it would be in order for me and those on
this side of the house to congratulate, first, the acting leader.
His flexibility in having agreed that this bill be referred to
Committee of the Whole, if not to a standing committee of the
Senate, is laudable and a considerable improvement. I am not
of the opinion that we should in all circumstances refer bills of
this nature to the Committee of the Whole or to a standing
committee. However, I believe that the principle had to be
affirmed and I am pleased that after fighting for many years I
seem to have convinced the acting leader of the value and
propriety of this procedure.
Secondly, I wish to welcome the President of the Treasury
Board. We are very pleased to have him and his officials with
us tonight to answer questions on this bill. He may find it so
interesting here as to want to join us permanently.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Chairman: Clause 1. Shall clause 1 carry?
Senator Grosart: May I ask one question Mr. Chairman,
with respect to clause 1, which identifies the bill as Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977? May I ask the minister if it is the
intention in the near future to change this type of designation
from Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977, to Appropriation Act
dealing with 1976?
Senator Flynn: 1976-77.
Senator Grosart: Yes, 1976-77; it is always very confusing.

Hon. Mr. Andras: Senator, I am told for the first time that
it has been the practice for a very long time that the appropriation acts are numbered according to their chronological
appearance in the calendar year. This is my first exposure to

SENATE DEBATES

that, as a matter of fact, and I would be inclined to agree that
since it is a matter dealing with the fiscal year 1976-77 it is
not the best of titles. Perhaps, jointly, we can make some
recommendations.
Senator Flynn: I should inform the minister that this problem has been discussed several times in this place. In my
opinion it is confusing to base the title on the calendar year
rather than on the fiscal year. If anything could be done with
respect to that, it would be very helpful.
The Chairman: Shall clause 1 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Clause 2. Shall clause 2 carry?
Senator Grosart: Mr. Chairman, there are some questions in
connection with this bill that would not necessarily arise out of
a clause-by-clause examination. That being so, I wonder if we
might be allowed to ask some general questions respecting the
fact that this bill, in its present form, has not been considered
by the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. As a
result of the amendments that have been made to the bill,
there are certain fairly broad policy questions that the minister
might wish to speak to.
The Chairman: Honourable senators have heard the request.
In my opinion, so long as these questions do not relate to
matters of policy but, rather, to matters of detail, then this
would be an appropriate time to put them.
Senator Grosart: Mr. Chairman, I am not quite sure what
you mean when you distinguish between a question of policy
and a question of detail. Surely in Committee of the Whole,
given the presence of the minister, the most likely questions to
be asked are policy questions.
My first question arises out of the fact that two amendments
were made to the bill subsequent to its being reported upon by
our committee. I am sure the minister is aware that it has been
the practice-a practice which is certainly convention, and
perhaps almost the rule-in this place that we do not consider
appropriation bills unless they have been reported on by the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. I make that
point because this bill, as it is presently before us, has not been
reported on by that committee.
The minister, I am sure, is well aware of the background of
the amendments. While it would, perhaps, not be appropriate-and I certainly do not intend to do so-to debate a ruling
of the Speaker of the other place, nevertheless it was a ruling
in the other place that brought about a very fundamental
change in the bill.
As I said the other day, the Speaker of the other place
referred to this as a fundamental matter. It was not simply a
matter of procedure; it was fundamental to the whole relation
of the estimates to an appropriation bill, and all bills which
might be described as pure or strict legislation and appropriation bills.
I think it is appropriate to say that the reason for the
amended bill was a ruling-and I am trying to be very careful
with my language now-that amendments proposed in an

appropriation bill be set aside because they were clearly
amendments to other legislation. Treasury Board itself bas
identified some seven votes which constitute amendments to
current legislation. It is the decision of Treasury Board that
they are amendments. Two of thern were set aside by the
amendments that have been made to the bill.
I would therefore ask the minister if it is the intention in the
future not to present amendments to other legislation through
appropriation bills.
Hon. Mr. Andras: I do not think I am in a position to give
that guarantee, senator, in the broad sense that you are asking
for it-and I do not imagine you are asking for the first time. I
am not sure whether we can even discuss the ruling in the
other place, but I am told that it was accompanied by the
comment that the ruling in question was not to be taken as
precedent.
By way of general comment, I would say that wherever it is
possible, the government would prefer to proceed with due
recognition of the need for Parliament, both houses, to give
full examination where there are significant policy implications.
As I said in the House of Commons, fundamental to all of
this is the need to examine our procedures in much more detail
and much more depth. It is not just a question of $1 items.
Rather, it is a question of our procedures and what is involved
in getting action taken while striking a balance between being
able to govern and allowing the parliamentary process, the
democratic process, to have full sway.
Senator Grosart: I have two questions arising out of the
answer the minister has just given. In one instance the minister
said that in the ruling given in the other place the Speaker said
that it should not be taken as a precedent. I would hope that
the minister would not infer from that that the Speaker had
any doubt about his ruling. He said that ten cases had been
presented to him, six were on the point of order raised, and be
was only ruling on two which were clearly identified in his
mind, and by the language in the bill, as being amendments to
legislation. So, to suggest that the Speaker had any doubt
about his ruling is to read something into his statement that is
not there. Obviously, he was saying, "I am not ruling on the
other eight, but it should not be assumed, because I have
selected two and ruled on two, that I am agreeing that the
other four, six or eight--depending on which objections are
taken-are in order." That is obviously what the Speaker
meant when he said that his ruling was not to be taken as a
precedent.
Perhaps I could also ask the minister, because he referred to
$1 items, if the fact that the ruling also said very clearly that it
was not limited to $1 items will be taken into account in any
policy decision. The ruling made it very clear that the objection was to any kind of an amendment to other legislation in
an appropriation bill. I am asking the minister if be is assuming that the policy question-and I assume he must decide as
President of the Treasury Board-is not limited to $1 items in
this context.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, if I may interject at
this time, I am afraid that if we pursue this discussion we will
be infringing the rules of this house by discussing a ruling of
the Speaker of the other place, which would be quite improper.
I am very interested in the discussion, but I do not think it is
proper to carry on with it. We are asking the minister to
interpret a ruling of the Speaker of the other place, and some
are assuming that the ruling means such and such, and I do
not think we are allowed to do that. I do not want to interrupt
Senator Grosart, but I do not think we should be discussing
this ruling in this place at this time.
Senator Grosart: Since this is a point of order, perhaps I can
reply. I thought I made it very clear that we were discussing
the amendments. There are two amendments before us, and in
discussing these amendments surely we must ask the minister
to indicate why the amendments were made, and whether they
were made on the initiative of the Treasury Board. In effect,
the Treasury Board amended the bill. Surely, Mr. Chairman,
it is in order to ask why, and to discuss the reasons behind
those amendments. It is the first time in many, many years
that an appropriation bill has come to us with such
amendments.
I agree with the acting leader that to enter into a discussion
as to whether the ruling is correct or incorrect would be out of
order, but surely it is not out of order to ask the minister to tell
us what is behind the amendments that he himself has put
before us.
Senator Flynn: I would add, honourable senators, especially
since the matter raised by Senator Grosart was dealt with by
the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance, that we
objected to that and asked that the Treasury Board look into
this question. I think this is our first opportunity, and our best
opportunity, to ask the minister to state what his policy is, and
what his attitude is, with regard to the insertion of these $1
items. The decision of the Speaker of the other house merely
reinforces the viewpoint expressed by our own committee.
Hon. Mr. Andras: Senator, I would say it was a very
important reinforcing, and was really the cause of the deletion.
Therefore, the amendments were the result of the Speaker's
ruling. But I think, with respect, I already attempted to say
this in my earlier response to Senator Grosart.
Senator Flynn: With some hesitation.
Hon. Mr. Andras: I think I made my statement with some
reservations.
Senator Forsey: Mr. Chairman, if I may ask a supplementary-I am afraid of the thing getting past this point and I
want to ask a supplementary to the question that Senator
Grosart raised. Surely the minister can give us-what was the
term used?-a guarantee not to do again what the Speaker
ruled out of order in the other place.

•

(2020)

Hon. Mr. Andras: With the greatest of respect, Senator
Forsey, I would find some difficulty in giving such a guarantee, because that would immediately lead me to reflect upon

March 28, 1977

the ruling of the Speaker of the House of Commons, and I do
not think I can do that.
Senator Forsey: Oh, wellHon. Mr. Andras: Well, it is a very circuitous problem, and,
based on my own feelings about it, which is all I can convey, I
would have that hesitation. One has to examine each of these,
and the precedents behind it. For one thing, I have not had an
opportunity to digest fully the reasoning behind the ruling,
which I do not question, of course.
Senator Grosart: Again, I should like to ask the minister, no
matter what reluctance he may have to answering Senator
Forsey's question, whether be can answer the question as to
the relationship between the five clearly designated amendments which are still in the bill, and the two which the
Treasury Board itself took out because of the Speaker's ruling.
There are five left. I can read them to the minister, but I am
sure he knows what they are. The Treasury Board, in the
statement it gave in Appendix I to its presentation, which
appears in the proceedings of the National Finance Committee
for March 9 at page 11:7, said that seven of these items amend
legislation. The Speaker ruled on two, and those two have
become the subject of amendments to the bill before us. So I
am asking the minister if it would be the intention in the
future to treat those other five in exactly the same way.
Hon. Mr. Andras: Well, senatorSenator McDonald: Time will tell.
Hon. Mr. Andras: Yes, time will tell. There seems to be
some confusion-at least, in my mind. Treasury Board did not
amend this bill. These items were ruled out as a result of the
proceedings in the other house. They were ruled out. Had they
not been ruled out, I should probably be scolded here because
they would have been in the bill before you now.
Senator Grosart: They were set aside.
The Chairman: Honourable senators, may I try to throw a
little light on this question. Rule 34A of the Rules of the
Senate states:
The content of a speech made in the House of Commons in the current session may be summarized, but it is
out of order to quote from such a speech unless it be a
speech of a Minister of the Crown in relation to government policy. A Senator may always quote from a speech
made in a previous session.
I have tried to be as generous as possible with my honourable
friend, because clause 2 deals with $493,648,110. One could
almost consider that the particular section.
I am just trying to give the minister a little time, if be wishes
to answer. This may be the first time he has considered this.
Senator Grosart: That is hard to believe.
The Chairman: Perhaps he bas an answer-if so, that is
fine; if not, we can proceed.
Senator Grosart: Mr. Chairman, with all respect to what I
take was a comment and not a ruling, I have been very careful

March 28, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

not to quote the Speaker in the other place. I have not quoted
him once since this committee meeting began. I have summarized, which is exactly what our rules permit us to do.

Senator Flynn: It is in the schedule. Clause 2 of the bill
refers to the schedule. It is $396 million.

The Chairman: The Honourable Leader of the Opposition.

Senator Flynn: It is in the schedule. There is no doubt about
that, because we discussed it.

Senator Flynn: If I may, I should like to leave this question
aside, honourable senators, because I am sure we will not be
able to get either a more definite or clearer answer from the
minister. I do not wish to refer to the estimates, since they
were dealt with in committee. But in his speech the other
night, the sponsor, the acting leader, tried to correct or to
clarify-and I do not think he achieved his purpose-the
question of the item of $396 million for transfer payments to
the provinces. If he would, I should like the minister to
enlighten us on this matter.
In committee, my understanding from Mr. MacDonald of
the Treasury Board was that this considerable amount was not
an underestimation of the amount payable to the provinces.
Rather, it resulted from the fact that a certain set of standards
had been changed over the last year, the final year, of the
present legislation governing federal-provincial fiscal relations,
a change either in the regulations or the method of calculation.
Up to that point the provinces had been able to count on a
formula with which they had lived, which was all they could do
under the fiscal legislation. That was changed in order to try to
save $396 million. But when the provinces objected, they did
not go back to either the regulations or the formula.

e

(2030)

The Acting Leader of the Government the other day-I am
sorry I was not present-tried to explain that it was not the
same kind of formula, and that there were always new discussions or negotiations each year under the legislation. This
brings up another question that is more important: Are there
negotiations each year under the legislation which is applicable? It would be a rather peculiar situation if you had to
renegotiate each year during the five-year term in which the
legislation was supposed to apply and still end up with this
huge difference of $396 million. I hope that the minister will
be able to explain exactly what happened, why it was that the
federal government thought it could save $396 million when
finally it ended up having to pay it out to the provinces.
Whether it be by regulation or a formula, I do not care, but
whether we have this leeway under the legislation is something
that is very important since we shall soon have to consider new
legislation which will apply for the next five years. I am
wondering whether the new legislation, like that which is about
to expire, will afford the federal government the kind of
latitude in calculation, and negotiation, which will result in
such huge differences in the amounts thought due. I wonder
and worry about this because it can't help but lead to further
confrontation between Ottawa and the provinces.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West): May I ask the Leader of
the Opposition, before the minister replies, whether the item
he is discussing is in the schedule to the bill or in the bill itself.
Would he indicate where it is?

The Chairman: Supplementary estimates (B), I think.

Senator Langlois: I am afraid the Leader of the Opposition
is looking in vain. This is a statutory item. It is not in the
estimatesSenator Flynn: It is in the total amount. It is encompassed
in the total amount.
Senator Langlois: You will not find it there.
Senator Flynn: If we cannot find it in the bill, then we will
find it in the speech of the Acting Leader of the Government
the other night, because he specifically referred to it. Honourable senators will have to read the acting leader's speech. It is
probably clearer than the bill itself anyway.
Senator Phillips: You will need better authority than that.
Senator Flynn: Well, I do not know. If I have no other
authority, that becomes the best.
The Chairman: Honourable senators, I do not have the
speech in front of me, and I do not propose to read it. We
might be here all night.
Shall clause 2 carry?
Senator Flynn: No, certainly not. I would ask the Chairman
to be patient with us, if he wants us to be patient with him. I
have put a question. I would like to have an answer.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West): Perhaps, when the minister is answering, he can clarify the point that we do not seem
to have had clarified yet, namely, where this figure of $396
million actually arises. Perhaps it was referred to in the speech
made by the Acting Deputy Leader of the Government, but
that is scarcely the authentic place to look for a figure of this
magnitude. I would think, as the acting leader said, it might
very well be a statutory item; if so, then is it covered by the
$493 million plus that is to be voted through this bill?
Senator Flynn: The report of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance deals with the item of $396 million as
being the most important transfer payment to the provinces.
You can find the question under discussion at page 11:17 of
issue No. 11 of the committee's proceedings. In the report of
the committee you will see a reference to this item as being the
most important one.
Senator Langlois: Mr. Chairman, if I may comment on this
matter, I should like to say that I do not challenge what the
Leader of the Opposition has just said. This item was discussed
in committee, but it is not shown in the estimates as a separate
item. That is all I said, and I mentioned that figure because
Senator Flynn had mentioned it himself in his speech. He
indicated that this was apparently a trick played on the
provinces-he used that expression, at any rate-but I had
information to the effect that this was not a trick at all. I think

SENATE DEBATES
I supplied the information but this will not be found as a
separate item in supplementary estimates (D).
Senator Flynn: Even if it is not, it is included in the total
amount we are called upon to vote.
Senator Langlois: It is not in Bill C-44, either.
Senator Flynn: Have you changed the amount? The report
on supplementary estimates (D) asks for $930 million, out of
which $396 million is for transfer payments to the provinces.
Do you say that this bill now does not ask for that?
Senator Langlois: In the total, yes, but not as a separate
item.
Senator Flynn: If it is in the total, then it is very proper for
me to ask the question of the minister, and I do not see why he
should not be able to reply to it.
Senator Langlois: You may reply to it, if you want.
Senator Grosart: Particularly, Mr. Chairman, since we are
dealing with clause 2, which clearly refers to the amount set
forth as the total amount of the supplementary items. Clause 2
definitely brings this matter in, and that is the clause we are
dealing with.
Hon. Mr. Andras: Honourable senators, I will leave the
procedural battle to others who are much more professional at
it than I am. Meanwhile, I will do my best to give some
explanation as to the inherent question of the amount and how
it was arrived at.
When this payment authority was established in regulations,
there was set up for forecasting purposes an econometric
model to calculate the amounts. Then, five years later, there
was available, of course, the actual experience. We then had
actual amounts experienced as opposed to the forecast of the
econometric model which was in the regulations.
Senator Flynn: The regulations under the act?
Hon. Mr. Andras: Yes. These dealt with a forecasting
requirement which was based on, as I call it, this model.
Finally, in the end, as you realize, this was reaching a stage of
unprecedented negotiation for fiscal transfers under the program changes negotiated, I believe, in December.
The econometric model forecasting is built into the regulations, with a higher amount in terms of advantage to the
provinces. The two amounts were discussed, and there was a
great deal of negotiating going on which was complicated by
the adjustments to the tax points that were also part of that
major negotiation related to the same package. So there was
no deception. There was no error in that sense. There was
certainly a difference between the econometric model amounts
and the actual costs, as illustrated by experience, but all this
was discussed and negotiated between the finance ministers,
and, as I recall, between the first ministers, in the final
analysis, to arrive at a difficulty but, I understand, satisfactorily negotiated package on behalf of the provinces. One or two
said they thought they should have done better; others, I think,
when they got home from the bank, were quietly smiling.
There certainly was not any deception in it whatsoever.

•

March 28, 1977

(2040)

Senator Flynn: In any event, I understood the hope of the
federal government was to pay $396 million less. In the end, it
had to pay $396 million more.
Hon. Mr. Andras: No, as President of the Treasury Board, I
am always encouraging my colleagues to get by with less than
whatever they think they need. We did not go in there with
any deliberate intent. There were two different sets of figures.
Then, with the complexity of the negotiations on the tax
points, at the end another set of figures was put on the table.
To sum it up, if I recall correctly, for 1977-78 government
expenditure, as a result of all of this negotiation, will be
reduced by some $975 million. Before anybody leaps to a
conclusion, between there and the tax point exchange the
provinces have got about $1.4 billion. I would like to be on the
receiving end of that kind of a deal any time.
Senator Flynn: Will that problem continue with the new
legislation that is before us?
Hon. Mr. Andras: No. I took licence and gave the honourable senator a little more information than perhaps I was
strictly called upon to give, and for which I hope I will not be
chastised.
Senator Grosart: I suggest we stand clause 2, Mr. Chairman, because if the committee, in its wisdom, decides later on
to make an amendment to one of the other clauses, we are
going to be put in the position of having already approved the
payment of the vote items here. I think we should stand it until
we decide what we are going to do with the other clauses.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Chairman: Clause 3.
Senator Flynn: Not on clause 3, no.
The Chairman: Shall clause 3 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Clause 4.
Senator Flynn: On clause 4, Mr. Chairman, I should like the
minister to explain exactly what the practical effect of this
clause is. I have been wondering for a long time not only about
supplementary estimates, but also about main estimates and
interim supply-what authority is given under this act to the
government? We are four days away from March 31. Let us
say that this bill receives royal assent on March 31. It will
mean that these items may be paid in the next 30 days, I
understand, before April 30. That must mean that all of these
amounts are already committed. That is the first question I
would like the minister to answer. Are they already
committed?
Did the minister hear my question? My first question was:
Are not all these amounts already committed? There are only
four days left. What would be the position of the government
with regard to the people to whom commitments have been
made if the bill were defeated?

March 28,1977

Marc 28,1977SENATE

Senator Croil: You will not get that cheque at the end of the
month; tbat's aIl.
Senator Flynn: 1 amn not worried; because tbere is no
commitmnent to me.
Hon. Mr. Andras: I think the horrible answer is obvious.
Tbe government would have outstanding bills wbich it would
flot be able to pay. Tbat is, of course, not unprecedented in
terms of supplementary estimate amounts or timing. The
particular clause to which tbe bonourable senator referred, I
arn told, is a standard clause that is contained in aIl sucb bills.
It does not bave any specific effect on the results in terrns of
moneys appropriated here. I amn referring to clause 4, witb
respect to which bie asked tbe question. Tbere would be great
embarrassment if we did not bave authority to bonour the
comrnitmnents that bave been made in tbe amounts referred to
in tbîs bill.
Senator Flynn: I arn very curious because I can understand

tbe difficulties. I can understand tbe practical solution you
bave to adopt. But suppose the bill is defeated and the Prime
Minister calîs a general election, could you get Governor

General's warrants for these items?
Hon. Mr. Andras: Yes, tbat is correct. But those, too, would
ultimately bave to, be approved.
Senator Flynn: Even if Parliament bad refused to pass the
bill?
Hon. Mr. Andras: Yes, I believe that is correct. We would

get Governor General's warrants.
Senator Flynn: What are we doing here?
Hon. Mr. Andras: I have often wondered wbat I arn doing
bere.
Senator Grosart: May I ask the minister if any of this
money bas been spent? The Leader of the Opposition asked
wbetber tbe amounts were committed. Has any of this rnoney

been spent?
Hon. Mr. Andras: Tbe items tbat would bave been provided

for a contingency vote authorized in prior main or supplementary estimates, and whicb are now being transferred for information purposes into appropriations here, not only could have

been but most likely have been spent. There was authority, in a
general sense, out of a contingency fund. Now tbey are tidying
them up in ternis of their exact purpose.
Senator Grosart: Is the minister saying that expenditures
bave been made tbat were not authorized by Parliament, and
bie is relying on a contingency fund? Is that what the minister
is saying?

Hon. Mr. Andras: No, that is flot wbat I arn saying. I arn
saying, senator, in response to your question as to whetber any
of tbis money bas been spent, that the answer is yes. Tbe
authority for that spending was the allocation of rnoney from a
contingency fund, authorized at some previous stage but which
is now being clearly indentified as to its purpose.

Senator Grosart: Is the minister saying that there was a
contingency fund of some $490 million?
Hon. Mr. Andras: No, I arn answering the bonourable
senator's question. That is tbe sum that could bave been and,
in fact, probably was spent.
Senator Grosart: Could the minister give us an indication of
what percentage that is of tbe total? Tbe reason I ask the
question is tbat it would be interesting to know what percentage of this $493 million of votes is going to be spent in tbe next
montb.
Hon. Mr. Andras: In round figures, senator, about $34
million. That is tbe temporary allotment from vote 5, which is
a contingency vote previously autborized by Parliament.
Senator Flynn: 1 have a supplementary question. Wbat
about the items which are statutory? Does the government
send out cheques before it gets the approval of Parliament?
Senator Grosart: Tbey do not have to be voted.
Hon. Mr. Andras: Tbe statutory amounts carry full authority by virtue of the statutes wbicb contains reference to them,
and tbey are included in tbe supplementary estimates as a
matter of information, not for seeking furtber appropriation.
Senator Flynn: It is a matter of appropriation only. Thank
you.
a

(2050)

Senator Grosart: I wonder if tbe minister would explain the
significance of this sentence in clause 4(l):
Wbere an item in tbe Estimates referred to in section 2
purports to confer autbority to enter into commitments up
to an amount stated therein or increases the amount up to
which commitments may be entered into under any other
Act or where a commitmentAnd so on. Has this been relied on as the authority to increase
the actual expenditures by $1 or other votes in tbe appropriation bill?
Hon. Mr. Andras: The answer is no.
The Chairnian: Shail clause 4 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairnian: Clause 5. Shaîl clause 5 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairnian: Clause 6.
Senator Grosart: Mr. Minister, one of the reasons very often
given for the urgency wîtb which we are asked to pass these
appropriation bills, comning up to a deadline sucb as we are
approaching now-and it is the reason given on this occasion-bas been that we had to get the bill passed because it
took several days to get the cbeques out. Could the minister
give us some indication about tbe time scbedule requiring a
bill to be passed by Parliament several days before tbe deadline? That question leads to another. If the bill bas to be
passed witb tbis urgency, why is it not possible for the govern-

SENATE DEBATES
ment to bring in these bills in time to give proper consideration
to them?
Hon. Mr. Andras: With respect, I do not think that reason
for urgency would apply to this bill. The interim supply bill,
Bill C-45, affects the authority to send out cheques.
Senator Flynn: Will you come back for that one?
Senator Buckwold: Do you like the minister that much?
Hon. Mr. Andras: This bill is required because of the close
of the fiscal year, not because of an urgency to get out the
cheques.
Senator Grosart: I agree, but I ask the question because in
this case there is an extra month allowed after the end of the
year to pay the bills. Cannot something similar be done with
such bills in future so that we are not faced with this situation?
Hon. Mr. Andras: Of course, it would be more justifiably
convenient for both houses to be able to deal with the matter
earlier, but it concerns the final supplementaries, and for very
practical and sound reasons it has to wait until almost the last
moment to close off our final requirements so that we complete
the fiscal year. We could argue about a few days, but I very
much doubt whether you could get it very far in advance of the
time we have. I have not looked at previous years, but I suspect
they would be the same. It is a little different with the interim
supply bill.
Senator Flynn: We will question you about that when we
deal with Bill C-45. I hope the minister will want to come back
for that.
The Chairman: Shall clause 6 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Clause 7. Shall clause 7 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: We now revert to clause 2, which we stood.
Senator Grosart: Are we going to deal with the schedule?
These are the actual votes, the amounts we are asked to pass.
The Chairman: I suggest we try to finish clause 2.
Senator Grosart: My point in suggesting that clause 2
should be stood now is that if the committee, when dealing
with the actual votes, decided in its wisdom to recommend that
one of these votes should not pass, if we have passed clause 2
we would be in the position of having voted the amount and
subsequently saying that we are not going to vote it. That is
why I suggest we should stand clause 2 until we have gone
through the schedule.
The Chairman: I am not trying to enforce anything; this is
merely a comment at the moment. It seems to me that it would
be better procedure to get rid of clause 2, which I understand
incorporates the schedule.
Senator Grosart: But then we will have passed ail the votes
and there would be no sense in looking at the schedule.

March 28, 1977

Senator Flynn: I would draw the attention of the chairman
and the Senate to the problerm that I think Senator Grosart is
indicating. Earlier Senator Hicks said he would like to vote
against any amount going to the CBC. He was wondering if
this could be done and I said I would tell him the way to do it.
I suggest the way to do it is by voting against the item in the
schedule concerning the CBC. Then, of course, we will have to
amend clause 2 to reduce the total amount by the amount we
have voted against. This is why I think Senator Grosart's
suggestion is most reasonable and logical. I am sorry that
Senator Hicks is not here tonight. He has missed a very
interesting opportunity.
Senator McDonald: Is not the proper procedure to ask at
this time, "Shall the schedule carry?"
Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator McDonald: If there is a question on the schedule it
can then be taken up. I do not think it would be in order to
take the schedule item by item.
Senator Flynn: We did not ask that. Anybody could move
an amendment to the schedule.
The Chairman: Honourable senators, in order to assist
everyone here, since our purpose is to get as many facts as we
can-we know about the urgency of the bill, but that should
count only to a lesser degree-I will call the schedule. Shall
the schedule pass?
Senator Grosart: There are some questions I should like to
ask about the schedule. They concern specifically the votes I
referred to earlier, which are: vote 15d under Agriculture; vote
L45d under Energy, Mines and Resources; vote 30d under
External Affairs; vote 50d under National Health and Welfare; vote 85d under Secretary of State; vote LI Id under
Supply and Services; and vote 40d under Transport. These are
the votes that the Treasury Board itself has designated as
clearly amending existing legislation.
Senator Benidickson: How many items?
Senator Grosart: Seven are identified here. Six were the
subject of the point of order raised in the other place. Ten were
brought to the attention of the Honourable the Speaker in the
other place. I am limiting my discussion tonight to the seven
that were identified by Treasury Board itself as clearly amending legislation. My suggestion is that if no other senator wishes
to question any of the items, Mr. Chairman, you might call
these, and then I would ask my questions. I do not think it will
take long.
The Chairman: I was waiting to see if the minister had any
comments to make.

•

(2100)

Hon. Mr. Andras: Senator Grosart, I am informed that aIl
the items to which you refer in supplementary estimates (D)
are, in fact, amendments to previous appropriation acts, which
are totally legitimate.
Senator Forsey: That doesn't make them any better.

SENATE DERATES

Senator Grosart: If I may say, Mr. Chairman, to the
minister, that is exactly the answer I expected and hoped for,
because I am now going to ask him what would be the
difference between an amendment to a former appropriation
act and an amendment to an act which was not an appropriation act in view of-if I may put it this way-the changed
rules of the ball game in the other place, if not here? What

would be the policy difference between the presentation of an

appropriation bill, which I believe makes it a proper question,
by the President of the Treasury Board?
Hon. Mr. Andras: I regret the delay, senator; I honestly
must have misinterpreted or misunderstood the question. I
really do not see the purport of it. I do not see the policy
implication. I am not attempting to evade it, but I really do
not understand it.
Senator Grosart: I was trying to put it in the form of a
question. I am afraid to explain it, as I cannot put my
explanation in the form of the question. My point is that we
have been told over and over again and this is, in effect, the

rationale just given, that these were amendments only to
former appropriation acts. We have been told over and over
again that an appropriation act is an act of Parliament. About
that there is no question. On the other hand, what is the
position if there is an amendment to an appropriation act

where the appropriation act itself has amended other legislation, or has improperly legislated under the new interpretation
of the Standing Orders of the House? The reason I ask this is

that this may cause the officials of the Treasury Board, if they
wish to go into it in depth, a great deal of trouble, assuming
that the policy of the Treasury Board is to accept the reasons
behind the deletion or setting aside of these two items, which
are amendments to the bill. Now, with respect, I say that they
are amendments to the bill. The government has amended the
bill by bringing it to us in this way. The Speaker has set them
aside, but the effect is to amend the bill. It is not the sane bill
that came before us. I repeat, if that is accepted as government
policy then it is not within the competence of the other place to
amend the legislation in the non-appropriation-act sense. What
happens to all the appropriation bills which have been beyond
what would now be regarded as the competence of the House
of Commons? In other words, you cannot go on forever saying
you will amend it because it is only an appropriation bill as
long as we have an acceptance of this new concept that it is not
within the competence of the House of Commons to amend an
act of Parliament in an appropriation bill.
Hon. Mr. Andras: I am really at a loss to respond, Senator
Grosart, because returning to our previous exchange there has
been placed on the record here one interpretation of the
Speaker's ruling which may not be the sane interpretation as
may be placed upon it by others. I certainly do not intend to
get into a discussion on that, because I would be very much out
of order to go further in commenting on the Speaker's ruling.
However, to make a statement, I do not see where the question
of the illegitimacy of the previous appropriation acts comes
into the picture, because they have been approved. Those
amendments to the appropriation acts, which then themselves

are acts, have not been ruled out of order and I do not know
where the illegitimacy to which the honourable senator has
referred comes into play. We are not here amending an
amendment which was ruled out of order in any place, so far
as I know. It becomes very convoluted, but if I follow the
senator correctly I believe he is dealing with a rather hypothetical case, because I do not think anything has to be
amended here that has not been approved on some occasion in
the past by Parliament.
Senator Grosart: Perhaps again I have not made myself
clear. I agree entirely with what the minister has just said, that
any appropriation act, no matter what it did in the past, no
matter how wrong or improper it was, is now the law. This is
an act which has been passed by Parliament. However, I was
suggesting that in its wisdom the Treasury Board may wish to
ask if it makes sense to go on amending an appropriation act,
which, in effect, set up Loto Canada or CIDA, or which
actually established a crown corporation. This is a situation we
face in this bill and I am suggesting that it makes no sense to
go on just amending appropriation acts. I suggest to the
minister that there is a very definite responsibility on the
government to proceed to tidy up that situation by introducing
legislative action where an enactment in the sense of the ruling
in the other place has been made by providing that these
should be set up under a "regular" act of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Andras: Senator, I believe what has been presented to me is that there should be a change in presenting this
type of items, be they $1 items or others. In any case, where
they have related to a previous appropriation act or amendment thereto which has become part thereof I do not see the

illegitimacy. However, I think through it all the senator is
saying that he would like to see us get away from this type of
item. I go back, then, to my very first answer: I believe that is
really rooted in some fundamental changes in procedures, at
least on our side of the operation.
Senator Grosart: The whole point of my discussion has been,
hopefully, to bring about some fundamental changes on your
side of the operation.

Hon. Mr. Andras: When I say "our side of the operation,"
senator, I am referring to the other place, not the government.
Senator Grosart: I was referring to both.
Senator Flynn: I should like to hear the minister with
respect to one aspect of the question posed by Senator Grosart.
Let us say that some of the provisions of the estimates were
not being taken off, such as the authority to pay remuneration
to the member of the National Design Council. Let us say it
were being included in this bill. What would have been the
effect of the passage of this bill? Would it be only for the
current fiscal year? Can you really amend an act in a permanent manner with a bill whose main clause-clause 2 in this
case-provides that "from and out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund" you are authorized to spend so many million dollars
for the fiscal year 1976-77? How could you amend in a
permanent fashion legislation through a bill which only grants
supply for the current fiscal year?

Hon. Mr. Andras: It is permanent in terms of the purpose of
the authorized vote.
Senator Flynn: I am not so much concerned with the
amount as I am with the authority. The authority is permanent, is it?
Hon. Mr. Andras: Unless otherwise stated in an amending
vote under a supplementary estimate. It could be described as
having an expiry date, in which case it would, but in other
cases it would be a permanent authority unless rescinded by a
subsequent amendment. To give you some indication of the
precedent for that principle, since 1969, through $1 items, the
other place has raised statutory financial limits affecting the
Freshwater Fish Marketing Act, the National Housing Act,
the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, the Canadian Film Development Corporation Act, the Canada Student Loans Act,
the Canadian Dairy Commission Act, the Cape Breton Development Corporation Act and the Saltfish Act.
Whether or not one accepts that as proper practice in one's
own mind, the authority and precedent is established through
its actual acceptance by Parliament.
Senator Flynn: But it has never been challenged, to your
knowledge?
Hon. Mr. Andras: It has certainly been discussed.
Senator Flynn: But has it been challenged before the courts?
Hon. Mr. Andras: I do not believe so.
Senator Flynn: Are amendments by way of supply bills
included in the revised statutes?
Hon. Mr. Andras: Yes, they are.
Senator Flynn: I would be interested in seeing how that is
done. It is a most fascinating subject.
Hon. Mr. Andras: The specific authorities to which I
referred by way of example of actual acts being amended
would be contained in the revised statutes. I am also told that,
to our knowledge, there has not been a challenge in the courts
on this point.
Senator Flynn: It is interesting, because such amendments
contained in supply bills are not properly worded. They simply
amend to a certain extent. I would be interested in knowing
how the amendment regarding the renumeration of the members of the National Design Council would have been worded
had it not been deleted. That amendment would require the
addition of a section to the act, whereas the supplementary
estimates simply refer to such an amendment through a "notwithstanding" clause. How are such amendments then incorporated in the revised statutes, or a consolidation?
Senator Forsey: The minister says it is established practice.
I suggest it is high time it was disestablished.

March 28, 1977

Hon. Mr. Andras: I am sorry, I missed Senator Forsey's
question.
Senator Flynn: He will repeat it.
Hon. Mr. Andras: You have a point, Senator Flynn. Some
of these, as evidenced by the wording, would obviously not be
of sufficient continuing significance or continuing authority as
to be incorporated. Others most certainly would. They would
be carried as an outstanding and significant item in the revised
statutes. It would depend very much on the nature of the
amendment contained in the supplementary estimates.
I am sorry, I did not get Senator Forsey's question.
Senator Forsey: I am afraid it was not a question. It was
merely an irate comment.
Hon. Mr. Andras: I am sorry I missed it.
The Chairman: Senator Grosart.
Senator Grosart: Mr. Chairman, in view of the general
answer that the minister has given on the votes that I listed,
that they are-as I knew-all amendments to appropriation
acts, I would be satisfied to accept that answer for all of them
if the minister could now, or at a later time, provide us with a
list of the amendments to legislation other than appropriation
acts that appear in the bill before us. To give an example of
the type of thing I am talking about, vote Id on page 10, Post
Office, states:
To extend the purpose of the Post Office Vote 1,
Appropriation Act No. 3, 1976, to authorize, notwithstanding the Olympic (1976) ActAnd, again, on page 15, vote 52d, paragraph (a):
(a) to deem VIA Rail Canada Inc., a railway companyHere we have the case of the incorporation of a crown
corporation. It goes on to say "pursuant to section Il of the
Railway Act," and one would wonder if it is.
Again, on page 18, vote 45d, Veterans Affairs, employees of
certain private companies are, in future, to be "deemed," in
spite of another act, to be public servants. There are a number
of these provisions.
On page 16, vote L 116d is to "deem" $624 million as such
and such. Then, of course, there are the "notwithstandings."
On page 14, Royal Canadian Mint, which comes under the
Department of Supply and Services, vote 27d:
To authorize, notwithstanding Section 4 of the Royal
Canadian Mint Act and Sections 4 and 5 of the Currency
and Exchange ActThese would seem to me to be clearly amendments to acts
other than appropriation acts. Perhaps the minister would
undertake to provide the committee, in due course, with a list
of those which Treasury Board itself regards as amendments
to acts other than appropriation acts.
Hon. Mr. Andras: I will certainly give that undertaking,
Senator Grosart. I would point out that we had considered that
we had made this information available to the National
Finance Committee. If you are indicating that because of the

March 28,1977

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

changes on two items tbat is not satisfactory, we will certainly
provide a furtber Iist.
Senator Grosart: The reason is tbat in the information given
to us, unless my reading of it is incorrect, amendments to
apppropriation acts are flot specifically separated from amendments to other acts in tbe schedule.
Hon. Mr. Andras: My understanding is tbat tbere are two
separate schedules. Scbedule D deals witb amendments to
appropriation acts and scbedule E deals witb tbe otber category. Perhaps that does separate tbem. as tbe honourable senator
requests.
Senator Grosart: Unless my reading is incorrect, it does flot
specifically state that a given amendment is an amendment to
sucb and sucb an act, wbicb is tbe information I wîsh to have.
Hon. Mr. Andras: I sec.
The Chairman: Is there further discussion?
Senator Forsey: Yes, Mr. Chairman-or sbould I say hionourable senators? I am a littie uncertain, we do tbis Committee of tbe Whole so seldom. Before tbe scbedule passes, I want
to reiterate my very strong objection to item 52d on page 15
dealing witb VIA Rail Canada Inc., and the item LI 16d on
page 16 dealing with the St. Lawrence Deep Waterway debt.
It seemns to me tbat botb of tbese are bigbly important,
substantive pieces of legislation which simply ougbt not to
appear before Parliament in tbis form. Under tbe rules of tbe
otber place, as I understand them, tbere is really very little
opportunity, if any, to discuss tbese things properly, and tbcn
they are presented to us bere as part of an appropriation bill. It
seems to me most improper, and if I could get any support for
il 1 should like to move the deletion of both of these from the
schedule, if tbat is in order. As I said tbe otber day, it seems to
me scandalous, iniquitous, outrageous and wholly subversive of
parliamentary government that this sort of tbing sbould be
done by $1 items in legislation of tbis kind.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Is Senator Forsey presenting a
motion?
The Chairman: Weil, bie was making a statement. I did flot
hecar any motion.
Semator Forsey: I say if I could get a seconder I would move
a motion to delete both tbose items.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I will second it.
Semator Grosart: Wbat would the motion be?
Senator Forsey: To delete, if that is the proper phraseology,
the items, I bave mentioned: item 52d on page 15, dealing witb
VIA Rail Canada Inc., and item LI l6d on page 16, deahing
with the St. Lawrence Deep Waterway.
The Chairman: Would you submit your motion in writing,
please, so we can be absolutely certain of tbe wording? It
would assist the Chair to have tbe motion in writing, wbicb
would only take a minute.

Senator Forsey: Very well.
e(2120)
Senator Lang: Mr. Chairman, while we are waiting for that
motion, I wonder if I migbt say sometbing. By this bill, of
course, the minister is asking us to approve the expenditure of
$493,648,l110. I want to congratulate the minister on flot
baving any cents on the end of it.

An Hon. Senator: Not having wbat on tbe end of it?
Senator Lang: C-e-n-t-s. In Bill C-45, wbich 1 know it is flot
appropriate to mention now, we are asked to approve "five
billion, one bundred and thirteen million, two hundred and
eigbty-six tbousand, seven bundred and ninety-six dollars and
forty-two cents."
Mr. Chairman, I have been on the boards of many private
and public corporations-and this includes the University of
Toronto-which have bad to approve expendîtures and appropriations, and 1 have neyer seen forty-two cents on the end of
amounts that great; not even bundreds of dollars. I object to
this as being an insult to my intelligence, because it imputes an
accuracy to these figures wbicb is not there. I do not mind the
minister and bis officiais comîng before us and saying, "We
would like $500,000,000," but I do not like their asking for
$493,648,l110. I do not tbink there is any degree of accuracy in
that at ail, but it imputes accuracy. When I see an amount of
over $5 billion ending up witb 42 cents, then it becomes
absolutely ludicrous.
Let us be bonest about tbis. We are not children; we are
grown-up and we know bow difficult it is to estimate tbese
figures. I say to them, "Corne in witb a block figure. We do
not care whetber you are 82 cents out. We are flot talking
about 82 cents. Let us not bave this sort of absolutely fictitious
sense of accuracy wbicb you cannot impute to an operation of
tbis size."
1 thougbt I migbt just take this opportunity, wbile tbe
minister is appearing in front of us, to appeal to him, and
tbrougb bim to bis officiais, to be bonest witb us and flot to
botber us witb 42 cents, or even witb $110. We don't care
about that. We know tbere is al sorts of slack in tbe system,
and if you bring us round figures I tbink we can deal witb
tbemn a lot more easily and realistically.
Senator Forsey: Mr. Cbairman, may I point out tbat the
minister is trying to meet this point because in the text of
clause 2 it says, "four bundred and ninety-three million, six
bundred and forty-eigbt tbousand, one bundred and eleven
dollars," and when you get down to the figures, tbey end up
witb $110. It is evidently an attempt to meet Senator Lang's
point by sbowing that there is a leeway of one dollar tbere.
Hon. Mr. Andras: Mr. Chairman, if 1 migbt just respond to
Senator Lang, I see bis point totally. The peculiarity of an
interim appropriation bill is that you bave to do it tbat way, as
ridiculous as it may seem, because of tbe fact that tbe bill's
basic arithmetic is tbree-twelftbs of tbis, four-sixteentbs of
that, and six-twelftbs of the other, and that kind of tbing. Tbe
round blocks of figures to which the senator is referring are, in
tbe main, blocks to wbicb these fractions and percentages are

SENATE DEBATES
applied to get the interim supply. This always refers ta a
fraction of the total we have ta spend. Sa it is simply a resuit
of the application of thase fractions, and it is flot an attempt ta
suggest that we are that deadly accurate, except that the
computer works very well.
Senator Lang: Couldn't we Jet it go at the nearest
$ 100,000,000?
The Chairman: 1 have a motion ta put.
It has been maved by Senator Forsey, seconded by Sen.
Smith (Colchester), that item 52b and item LI 16d in it
Schedule be deleted.
Senator Grosart: What are the pages?
The Chairman: Item 52d, page 15, and item LIll6d, page
16, in the Schedule. It is moved that they be deleted.

Senator Flynn: My abjection was that yau said, "Those in
favaur will please say 'yea', and then, -Those in favaur please
say 'nay'." You then said, "The 'nays' have it," and I dan't
know what that meant.

Senator Flynn: Mr. Chairman, 1 just want ta say, despite
the fact that we have had perhaps a few wards that were nat
entirely necessary, that I think the exercise has been a worthwhjle one, and I hope the acting leader will occasionally agree
ta aur doing it again, and give us the pleasure once more of
having the President of the Treasury Board with us.

SENATE DEBATES

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2,1977
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second reading of Bill
C-45, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service for the financial year ending the 31st March,
1978.
He said: Honourable senators, before the Senate met tonight
I caused certain tables to be distributed, and I hope you will
find them helpful. The first table is entitled: "Interim Supply
for April, May and June, 1977." It gives the items of this bill
presently before us. The second table is entitled: "Supply,
1977-78, Appropriation Act No. 2, 1977," and it is the resumé
of the bill we presently have before us. The third and last table
is entitled: "Estimates, 1977-78," which gives separately the
items to be voted, the statutory items and the total for
budgetary and non-budgetary items. I hope these tables will be
of some assistance to honourable senators in their consideration of this bill.
I should now like to deal with the bill itself. The main
estimates for 1977-78 on which this bill is based were tabled in
the Senate and referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on February 17, 1977. These estimates have
not yet been discussed in committee, but, as honourable senators know, there is a meeting of the National Finance Committee at ten o'clock tomorrow morning at which time we will
have our first go at these estimates, and I can assure you that
before we are called upon to give final approval to the 1977-78
estimates our National Finance Committee will have had
ample opportunity to discuss them and to report to the Senate
thereon.
As honourable senators know, of course, none of the items
contained in these estimates will be released by the passage of
Bill C-45. The 1977-78 estimates total $44,582 million, consisting of budgetary expenditures of $41,145 million and nonbudgetary expenditures of $3,437 million. The bill now before
us is the first interim supply bill for the 1977-78 fiscal year,
and will release a general proportion of three-twelfths of the
votes in these estimates. There are, however, additional proportions for 21 items to which I will refer later. The total
expenditures proposed by this bill are just over $5,113 million.
The proportions requested in this bill are intended to provide
for all necessary requirements of the public service to June 30,
1977. This bill is in the usual form of interim supply bills and,
as I have already indicated, in no instance does it request
release of the total amount of any item. In general, the 21
votes which require additional proportions may be grouped as
follows:
(a) Votes for which additional sums are required to
finance programs until forecast revenues are received
later in the fiscal year:
Regional Economic Expansion

Vote 25

Supply and Services

Votes

Transport

Votes 65 and 90

1 and 15

(b) Votes which provide payments required to cover
accounts maintained on a calendar rather than fiscal year
basis:
Votes 40 and L75
Transport
(c) Votes for which additional portions are required
because payments are greater in the first quarter of the
fiscal year:
Vote 5
Communications
Votes 1, L50 and
Energy, Mines and Resources

Vote 50

Votes 5 and 10
Treasury Board
Clause 5 of this bill would grant borrowing authority of $7
billion, and provide for the cancellation of all outstanding and
unused borrowing authority established a year ago at $6
billion. This borrowing authority has been included in the bill,
as usual, to authorize the issuance of treasury bills, marketable
bonds and non-marketable bonds including Canada Savings
Bonds for the financing of the ordinary operations of the
government, including non-budgetary cash requirements such
as loans and advances to crown corporations, and to meet
requirements of the Exchange Fund Account.
As honourable senators know, this borrowing authority is a
requirement of section 36 of the Financial Administration Act
which provides that no borrowing authority should be authorized unless approved officially by Parliament. I will dispense
with giving the chamber the reasoning behind these requirements of the Financial Administration Act, but I should like to
give a list of the borrowing authorities provided for previous
fiscal years.
In 1969-70 the borrowing authority was $2 billion. In
1970-71 it was $3 billion. From 1971-72 down to 1973-74 it
was $3 billion. In 1974-75 it was $5.5 billion. In 1975-76 and
1976-77 it was $6 billion. As we know, of the last $6 billion,
only $5.126 billion was used, and as provided for in the bill
before us this authority would lapse with the passing of this
interim supply bill.
That concludes my introduction of the bill. If honourable
senators wish any further information, I shall be glad to
provide it. I am in the hands of honourable senators.

•

(2140)

Senator Grosart: Could I ask the Acting Leader of the
Government what he means by saying that none of these items
will be released? My understanding is that if this interim
supply bill is passed, Parliament will have authorized vote by
vote, item by item, authority to spend some $5 billion. What
does the acting leader mean by saying that it will not be

SENATE DEBATES
released? 1 hope he is flot going to say that it means that we
can stili discuss it, because we can discuss anything.
Senator Langlois: It means that the whole of the items are
flot passed. We are passing only three-twelfths of the items of
the main estimates, with additional proportions of 21 items
which 1 singled out and described in my introduction. Since we
are voting only portions of these items, none of such items is
released. 1 meant it in that sense.
Senator Grosart: Is the acting leader actually saying that if
we pass this appropriation bill we are not giving absolute and
complete authority to spend every cent of that $5 billion?
Senator Langlois: Three-twelfths of the estimates.
Senator Grosart: 1 am asking why the acting leader says we
are not releasing these amounts.

Marcb 28, 1977

Senator Langlois: We are not releasing any items.
Senator Grosart: 0f course we are. That is the only way we
can vote money. The Acting Leader of the Government has
only to look at the bill and he will see that we are asked to vote
specific sums in specif ic votes against spccif ic items.
Senator Langlois: This bill covers only part of the items of
the main estimates. We are not releasing any of those items
individually; we are authorizing only three-twelfths of the
individual items.
Senator Grosart: That is not so.
Senator Flynn: It is perhaps a bad choice of words. 1 move

On motion of Senator Flynn, debate adjourned.

ARGENTINA
UNITED NATIONS WATER CONFERENCE

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may 1 take this
opportunity to say bow good it is to be back. Two weeks ago
tbe Prime Minister asked me to lead the Canadian delegation
to the United Nations Water Conference in Argentina. I bave
returned bappily and safelyHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Seuiator Perrault: --only to discover that during the past
two weeks matters in this chamber proceeded extraordinarily
well-better, perhaps, than at any other time this session. As
Leader of the Government here it causes me some personal
concern that tbings went so well in my absence.
Senator Flynn: We missed you.
Senator Perrault: It is very kind of the Leader of the
Opposition to say that. In any case, I do want to tbank tbe
deputy leader, Senator Langlois, for bis excellent work when I
was in Argentina. Indeed, 1 wisb to tbank ail tbose wbo filled
in and belped out. I appreciate it very mucb.
Let me add that from tbe Canadian standpoint tbe conference was a success. We bad an outstanding delegation of
Canadians from every province, from coast to coast. I can say

in ail candor that Canada's delegates made some of the
outstanding contributions to tbis important conference on
worid water resources.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, perbaps I sbouid have
waited until tbe question period to say tbis, but in view of the
statement made by tbe Leader of the Government 1 tbink it
would be more appropriate for me to say now that we are
pieased to sec tbe leader back. We beard tbat tbere were some
bombings and other revoiutionary incidents while bie was in
Argentina. We were led to wonder wbetber they were in any
way related to his presence tbere, but we concluded tbat tbey
could flot bave been.
Everytbing went very well in the Senate during tbe government ieader's absence. I do not know if it was because of tbe
leader's absence, but tbe deputy leader did acquire some
mucb-needed flexibility. As a result, we made progress in a
number of areas.
1 sbould be pleased to bave tbe Leader of the Government
confirm wbat bie said about tbe speecb of tbe representative of
tbe Province of Quebec on the Canadian delegation. Tbe
Prime Minister said it was higbly improper for Mr. Léger to
make the statement hie did. On tbe other band, the Leader of
tbe Government is quoted in tbe press as baving said that bie
approved Mr. Léger's statement. 1 sbould lîke to know how
tbose two statements can be reconciied.
Senator Perrault: If bonourable senators deem it appropriate, 1 shaîl endeavour to answer that question.
First of ail, Mr. Léger's statement was presented to me prior
to being made to tbe United Nations conference. Secondly, at
no time before any UN microphone, meeting, or officiai
Canadian press conférence did Mr. Léger purport to speak
only for the Province of Quebec. Tbe statement to one of the
committees by Mr. Léger was receîved by me and federai
officiais before its presentation to the conference. Indeed, some
suggestions were made by federal authorities about the contents of bis speech. Similariy, the text of my speech to tbe
plenary session of tbe conference, delivered in English and in
FrencSenator Flynn: Wby not?
Senator Perrault: -was discussed tboroughly witb representatives from ail provinces, including Quebec. That is not to
say tbat private interviews may not have been given by Mr.
Léger and by others to reporters or before microphones flot
known to me. But, certainly the text of Mr. Léger's officiai
speech as a Canadian deiegate was seen and approved by me,
and the ternis and conditions of the national delegation were
met-at least in an official sense. However, 1 cannot comment
on any other statements or interviews that may bave been

March 29, 1977

SENATE DEBATES
given by Mr. Léger or other delegates from Quebec, either
inside or outside, the United Nations Water Conference site in
Argentina.
Senator Flynn: Perhaps it would have been better had the
Prime Minister communicated with Senator Perrault, even if it
had meant his having to phone him in Mar del Plata before
commenting on Mr. Léger's speech.

•

(1410)

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, a valid and significant point was made by the Prime Minister, however, when he
expressed his view that when national delegations go abroad
there should be agreement as to what those delegations represent and say. We really have to speak in concert and unity as
Canadian representatives when we go abroad, which I believe
was the thrust of the Prime Minister's remarks. Again it
should be said that this recent UN Water Conference was
marked by some outstanding contributions from our Canadian
delegates, including representatives of the provinces. There
was some excellent technical expertise from Ontario, the prairie provinces, the Atlantic provinces, British Columbia and,
certainly, from the province of Quebec.
Senator Flynn: Oh, yes; I would hope that you would not
forget British Columbia in saying that.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, may I be permitted
to thank the Leader of the Government for his appreciation of
my efforts during his recent absence, and also the Leader of
the Opposition who made reference to my flexible attitude
during that time? May I be allowed also to express the hope
that the Leader of the Opposition will be absent some day so
that his deputy will acquire some more flexibility, which might
also reflect upon him at a later date?
Senator Flynn: I have never had a more flexible deputy than
Senator Grosart. I do not know what you expect.
Senator Langlois: A lot.
Senator Buckwold: Is another word for your deputy's flexibility "disjointed"?

NATIONAL SYMBOLS
DISTRIBUTION TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT-QUESTION
ANSWERED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators will recall that on
Wednesday, February 23, Senator Riley made an inquiry with
respect to a supply of flags or lapel pins for members of the
Senate. Today I received the following letter from the Secretary of State of Canada:
Thank you for your letter of February 25, concerning
the distribution of flags and lapel pins to senators.
I am pleased to confirm that the necessary arrangements have been made to introduce senatorial allotments
of these national symbols on April 1.
The quotas available at that time to senators will be the
same as for members of the House of Commons; that is:
50 flags 3' x 6', 200 flags 3" x 6" with desk stand, and 500
lapel pins.
In order to make senators aware of these allotments
and of the procedures for obtaining them, I intend writing
to all senators with full details, prior to April 1.
I am sure we all wish to thank the Honourable the Secretary
of State for his cooperation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
MEETING OF COMMITTEE CANCELLED

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I should like to
announce at this time that the meeting of the Standing Senate
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science scheduled for this
afternoon when the Senate rises has been cancelled.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1977
THIRD READING

Senator Langlois moved the third reading of Bill C-44, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1977.
Hon. George I. Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, if
you would bear with me for a very brief time, I should like to
make one or two comments on two items covered by the bill
before us. They will not be novel comments, but they should, I
feel, be made at this time.
I refer specifically to vote 52d on page 15 of the Schedule
and vote Lll6d on page 16. Vote 52d relates to VIA Rail. I
believe the full name is VIA Rail Canada Inc. Why, incidentally, the "Inc." has to be part of the name, I do not know.
One would have thought they would have used the well
recognized Canadian designation if it was the wish to show it
as a corporation. However, that is not the subject matter of my
comments.
I want to make the point that this is a matter of great
national importance and, as such, it seems to me it is not
something which should be done in the relatively obscure way

March 29, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

of being one of many items in this type of supply bill. It seems
to me to be of such importance that there is no reason why it
should not be done by way of a separate piece of legislation. In
fact, there is every reason why that course should have been
followed. This is truly a matter which should be the subject of
wide national debate, the subject of all of the legislative
processes which enable interested and knowledgeable persons
to make a contribution to the content of the legislation. This,
surely, is a matter that should be the subject of debate in both
houses, as well as study by committees of both houses.
I do not rise to criticize the Minister of Transport. I am
perfectly willing, for the limited purposes of this discussion, at
any rate, to agree that no doubt he and his departmental
officials are very competent and informed people. But here is a
matter of moving persons, en masse, throughout the various
parts of this country-a task which has baffled the ingenuity
and efforts of all who have set their minds to it, with very few
exceptions so far. Given the difficulties we face respecting the
energy required to move people from one place to another, the
possibility of doing so successfully by rail is surely one of the
most important features involved in the economic use of
energy.
There was a time-and many here, I am sure, still remember it-when people used the railways of this country as one of
the main means of travelling from one place to another. I have
been a user of the railways from a very young age, and over
the years I have watched, not merely the decrease in the
number of people who use this mode of transportation, but the
deterioration in the facilities and the quality of facilities which
the railways make available for this purpose.
While I have heard-and, no doubt, will hear again-the
allegation made by the railways that such deterioration was
primarily due to the fact that people forsook the railways, I
cannot help but think that there is a great deal to be said for
the opposite view-namely, that, as the years went by, tbe
railways deliberately, or if not deliberately, carelessly, allowed
the attractiveness of their passenger service so to deteriorate
that people simply gave it up in disgust. The matter of being
on time, the comfort of the facilities, and schedules which
would meet the convenience of the travelling public rather
than that of the railways themselves-a multitude of things of
this kind we could sec, and I am sure many honourable
senators have seen, deteriorate under our very eyes from year
to year.
* (1420)

I do not know a better or more efficient means of moving
people-provided, of course, that there is a reasonable amount
of convenience involved-than by rail. I do not know a better
way of conserving energy and yet getting people to where they
want to go and back again. It seems to me that it needs much
more than a mere perfunctory effort to persuade people to use
the railways again in the national interest. It needs something
very special; it needs something more than a perfunctory item
in a supply bill. It needs the best minds and the best efforts of
all interested people. It seems to me that if ever there was a
matter which ought not to be dealt with in such an obscure

and-well, I cannot think of a word strong enough that would
still be parliamentary, so I shall just repeat the word
"obscure"-way, this is it. I want to protest with every ounce
of vehemence I can muster that this ought not to be done. It
does not give Parliament a chance and it does not give the
public a chance. It is completely and utterly the wrong way to
deal with important matters.
Senator Forsey: Hear, hear.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I should like to add that when
one thinks of the great investment in roadbeds for railways,
how much money has already been invested therein, and how
much money has to be invested from year to year if we are
going to keep up with the trend of moving people by highway,
one cannot help but come to the conclusion, altogether aside
from the problem of saving energy, that with these many
thousands of miles of railway roadbeds lying there ready for
use, or in such a condition that they can be made reasonably
ready for use without tremendous expenditure, here is something which ought to receive the very greatest attention and
something which ought to be compared in cost with the cost of
trying to continue to move people by highway.

Leaving that aside for a moment-in fact, leaving it entirely
aside insofar as my remarks today are concerned-I would like

to say something of a fundamentally similar nature about the
item on page 16 which, in effect, forgives the amount of
$624,950,000, the principal amount of the indebtedness of the
St. Lawrence Seaway Authority to the government. Here
again is a matter of great public importance and public
significance, and I think all the remarks I made in reference to
the other item, as to the impropriety of dealing with such a
matter in such an obscure way, are indeed applicable here.
While I do not oppose the bill, and do not call upon anyone
else to oppose it, I do want to voice a most emphatic objection
to dealing with these matters of great importance in such a
way.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2,1977
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Langlois, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Petten, for the second reading of Bill C-45, intitled: "An
Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money

for the public service for the financial year ending the

31 st March, 1978".-(Honourable Senator Flynn, P.C.).
Senator Langlois: Stand until later this day.
Senator Flynn: Are you sure, senator? This is Bill C-45, the

interim supply bill, which we are dealing with now; not Bill
C-37, which is to come later this day when we are to have the
pleasure of listening to Senator Thompson.
Senator Thompson never had the opportunity to experience

first hand or criticize this type of legislation with a provincial

SENATE DEBATES
interest to protect. He was the Leader of the Opposition in his
province and not the premier. We on this side will have a
former premier reply to him, which should prove rather interesting. In the meantime, I am dealing with interim supply.
Senator Thompson: May I say that had I been premier it
would have been a happy compromise.
Senator Flynn: It is difficult to have a position more enjoyable than the one I hold here, so I suppose the same thing
would hold true for Senator Thompson.
Honourable senators, Bill C-45 is an interim supply bill, an
appropriation bill. As a general rule, appropriation bills are
strange devices because they ask Parliament to vote supply
before Parliament has had occasion to make a decision, if
indeed it has a decision to make, on the main estimates. Of
course, if the main estimates could be studied fully and
approved before the beginning of the fiscal year, which in this
case is only two days away, there would be no need for interim
supply. The main estimates, however, are tabled only about six
weeks before the beginning of the fiscal year. That does not
give sufficient time to the other place, nor to the Senate, to
study them in depth and make enlightened decisions. So we
must look upon the approval which is sought of us as a request
for us to make an act of faith in the government.
Some years ago I suggested that it looked somewhat like the
airline advertisement which says: "Fly now and pay later." We
are being asked to "approve now and discuss later." But what
will be the use of "discussing later",? What we now approve
can and will be spent by the government and there will bc no
way of coming back on our decision.

March 29, 1977

in this respect as merely that of criticizing, of airing grievances
and frustrations.
Senator Benidickson: Asking for more money.

Senator Flynn: And very often asking for more money while
criticizing the government for spending too much. But in the
end nothing much is changed in the estimates prepared by the
government.
That is why I say that in this respect I think our job, if we
are realists, is akin to that of a watchdog. We complain and
try to influence the government; and the government, in turn,
tries to influence the bureaucrats. But control of public spending is an illusion in these times. That was made clear by the
Auditor General and is generally recognized. It need not be
the case, but it is.
In this particular instance we are asked to vote, generally
speaking, three-twelfths of the total of the estimates for the
current year commencing Friday. Secondly, in other items we
are asked to vote additional supplementary sums. That is the
way I read it, at least in the explanation. The bill is not too
clear about this. But since three-twelfths-that is in paragraph
(a) of clause 2-is mentioned as representing $4.803 billion, et
cetera, I suppose that paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g)
add to it. Paragraph (b) says:
-eight-twelfths of the total of the amounts of the several
items in the said estimates set forth in schedule AThat would amount to eleven-twelfths, practically the whole of
this particular schedule. Paragraph (c) says:
-six-twelfths of the total of the item in the said estimates

specific answers to our questions.
Before 1 resume my seat 1 would ask the Deputy Leader of
the Government to tell us wby it is so urgent to pass this bill.
The situation is always the same. The fiscal year is going to
end two days from now, on Thursday. You wiIl remember that
at one point, on a previous occasion, tbere was a question of
the cheques flot going out and people waiting to be paid, or the
cheques going out and being refused by tbe banks, whicb 1
tbink wouid have been very silly on the part of tbe banks.
These difficulties reflect poorly on tbe efficiency of Parliament. But it is certainly not the Senate's fault. Thes bis

situation is due to the slow pace of tbe House of Commons, or
to a miscalculation on the part of the goverfiment leader on tbe
other side, I prefer flot to discuss at tbis time. It seems,
however, absurd that we should always be put in the position
of having to vote tbis kind of bill in a burry for fear of being
accused of deiaying salary cheques to public servants. On this
one point 1 sbould like the minister, or at least an officiai of
tbe department, to offer an explanation. 1 would, therefore,
invite tbe goverfiment leader to agree that after we give second
reading to this bill we spend, let us say, an bour or baif an
hour with tbe minister or an officiai of the department in
Committee of tbe Wbole or before the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance.

In my presentation of tbe bill 1 tbougbt 1 bad indîcated quite

March 29, 1977

The Senate was accordingly adjourned during pleasure and
put into a Committee of the Whole on the bill, the Honourable
Senator Macnaughton, P.C., in the Chair.

to give us an explanation of why the proportions are different
in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g).

The Chairman: Honourable senators, the Senate is in Committee of the Whole on Bill C-45, intituled: "An Act for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1978."

Senator Langlois: I partly answered this question last night
when I gave the reasons for these additional proportions being
requested. If the honourable senator wishes me to give a
detailed explanation for each item, I am ready to do that.
Senator Flynn: Try.
Senator Langlois: The first is vote L55, which is loans to
finance the purchase of a heavy water plant. An additional
eight-twelfths is required to cover the installment due on April
1, 1977, to Canadian General Electric Company Limited with
respect to the purchase of a heavy water plant at Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia.
The next one is under Regional Economic Expansion, and
concerns the Cape Breton Development Corporation, vote 25.
This is a payment to the Cape Breton Development Corporation for capital expenditures in rehabilitating and developing
its coal and railway operations. An additional eight-twelfths is
required, as usual, to cover capital expenditures for the coal
division in the first three months of the fiscal year. The full
appropriation will represent 25 per cent of the 1977-78 capital
budget. The balance is to be financed by surplus funds, which
will not be available until later in the year. Parliament votes
money to the corporation on the basis of its net requirements
rather than its gross requirements.
The next one is vote 90 under Transport, and concerns the
Great Lakes Pilotage Authority, Ltd. An additional eighttwelfths is required to cover operating expenditures in the first
three months of the year, as Parliament votes funds to the
authority on the basis of net annual requirements rather than
gross requirements. The revenues of this authority are earned
only during the shipping season, which is approximately nine
months, from April 1 to December 1, while operating expenditures are incurred over the fiscal year of twelve months, and
those revenues which are earned in April and May will not be
collected until 45 to 60 days following.
Senator Flynn: That is much better than last night.
Senator Langlois: It is more detailed, of course.
Senator Flynn: You merely recited the items last night.
Senator Langlois: The next such vote is under Treasury
Board, vote 10, for government contingencies and centrally
financed programs, student summer and youth employment.
An additional six-twelfths is required to provide funds for
student summer and youth employment. Due to the seasonal
nature of this item, heavy payments are made during the
interim supply period.
The next one is under Finance, the municipal grants program, for grants to municipalities. An additional four-twelfths
is required to provide for the large payments of grants in lieu
of taxes made in the first three months of the year, in
particular to Ottawa and Toronto.
I go on to schedule D, Communications, vote 5, capital
expenditures. An additional three-twelfths is required to

Shall discussion of the title of the bill be postponed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Chairman: Clause 1. Shall clause 1 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
Senator Grosart: With respect to clause 1, Mr. Chairman, I
should like to repeat the comment I made yesterday about the
numbering of these appropriation bills, and to suggest again
that the Treasury Board or the government consider a revision
of this numbering so that this appropriation bill, which is the
first appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1977-78, does not
appear as Appropriation Act No. 2. I raised the point yesterday when we had the designation "Appropriation Act No. 1,
1977," which dealt with the previous fiscal year. The minister
at that time said that this information was new to him, but
that this was the prevailing situation. I raise the matter again
at this time in the hope that something will be done to change
this system of numbering. I do not see any reason why the bill
we had yesterday should not have been designated as an
Appropriation Act numbered for 1976-77, and why this bill
should not be designated "Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977-78."
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I can give you my
assurance that consideration will be given to the suggestion
that appropriation bills be numbered in the sequence of their
presentation to Parliament within the fiscal year in relation to
which they are being introduced.
The Chairman: Clause 2. Shall clause 2 carry?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, the deputy leader said
last night, since we are not asked to vote the full amount of
any item for the whole fiscal year, that all the items remain
subject to discussion by the Senate. He used the expression
"are not realized". I agreed with that, but this is not my point.
In today's committee meeting Senator Benidickson raised
the matter and said that the Senate can, either by Notice of
Inquiry of a general nature or by Notice of Inquiry of a
specific nature, discuss any kind of items in the estimates, even
after they have been passed in their entirety. I have no
problem with that.
The only reason I mention this is because the point was
raised this morning in committee, and made last night by the
deputy leader, that we are free to argue or air our differences
about any item in the estimates at any time. I should specifically like the deputy leader to tell us why in paragraph (b) we
are asked to vote eight-twelfths additional of the estimates set
forth in schedule A rather than threc-twelfths, which is the
general rule in such a bill. At the same time I should like him

enable a payment of $9 million, due April 1, 1977, for an
experimental communications satellite.
Also in schedule D, under External Affairs, Canadian interests abroad, capital expenditures of an additional threetwelfths are required to cover the cost of completing the
purchase of additional chancellery facilities in Paris, France,
in the spring or early summer.
Senator Croll: If I heard you correctly, when you referred to
municipal grants you made particular reference to Toronto
and Ottawa and the need for turning over money to them. It
seems to me unusual that they should be singled out. What
about the other cities? Are they not in need in the same way?
Senator Langlois: The cities of Toronto and Ottawa call for
very large payments, much larger than those to other municipalities. These large payments must be taken care of early in
the year.
Senator Croll: I suppose in the case of Ottawa it is the
taxation of public buildings which makes the amount so large,
but why would there be a difference between Toronto and
Vancouver, or Winnipeg and Montreal? Why would there be a
difference there?
Senator Grosart: Because they have got three-twelfths for

that.
Senator Langlois: The reason is, as I said, that these are

larger payments than usual. That is why we need more than
three-twelfths to take care of them.

In schedule F, under Energy, Mines and Resources, the
administration program, vote 1, an additional one-twelfth is
required to cover the rental and maintenance cost, payable on
April 1, 1977, for the departmental computer.
Senator Flynn: What the deputy leader has said this afternoon is much more informative than his speech last night. At
that time he merely recited what was in the bill.
Senator Langlois: I went a little further than that, but then
we were not in committee and I had no departmental officials
with me.
Senator Flynn: I am not disagreeing; I am not saying you
should have told us everything about it. I merely suggest that
the Senate is better informed than we would otherwise have
been.
Senator Langlois: I am very happy if I have been able, for
once, to convince and satisfy the Leader of the Opposition.
Senator Crol: Not convince.
Senator Langlois: It is not an easy task.
Senator Flynn: It is not easy, but you are succeeding gradually; you are becoming much more effective.
Senator Langlois: Thank you very much.
The Chairman: Shall clause 2 carry?
Senator Grosart: I suggest that we stand clause 2, for the

reason I gave last night, that we are coming to some specific
votes which may or may not entail a full vote of supply. If the
80003-39

committee should, in its wisdom, recommend amendments, we
shall be in the impossible position of having voted the total
supply, or a proportion of the supply, and then having to go
back and reverse that decision.
The Chairman: Is it agreed that clause 2 shall stand?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Chairman: Clause 3. Shall clause 3 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Clause 4. Shall clause 4 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Clause 5.
Senator Flynn: I understand what the deputy leader said last
night about the borrowing authority. I should like to know how
this amount of $7 billion was arrived at, or how it was
estimated. I appreciate, as he said, that the amount which was
not borrowed last year will lapse. This requires, for the year
commencing on Friday, authority to borrow $7 billion by way
of securities or otherwise. I was wondering if the deputy leader
could enlighten us on the estimate that was made, and how
this figure was arrived at.
0 (1500)
Senator Langlois: To answer the last part of my honourable

friend's question first, I would refer him to paragraph (2) of
clause 5 of the bill, which reads as follows:
All borrowing powers that are authorized by section 5

of Chapter 90 of the Statutes of 1974-75-76 and are
outstanding and unused and in respect of which no action
has been taken by the Governor in Council pursuant to
section 37 of the Financial Administration Act shall
expire on the date of the coming into force of this Act.
Senator Flynn: I agree with that.
Senator Langlois: As to the first part of Senator Flynn's
question, I understand that the estimate of $7 billion was
arrived at through the development of an expenditure program
or plan by which the government forecasts its revenues and
receipts, and the government would expect to have to borrow
the difference. That is how the figure of $7 billion is arrived at
as the required borrowing authority for the present fiscal year,

which will commence on Thursday.
Senator Flynn: Is there any anticipation of a deficit?
Senator Langlois: I understand that it is almost impossible
to answer that question at present, but it will be made much
clearer when the budget is presented later this week.
Senator Flynn: You are asking us once again to make an act
of faith.
Senator Langlois: Life itself is an act of faith. Every day we
live in the hope of being alive the next day.
The Chairman: Shall clause 5 carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Clause 6. Shall clause 6 carry?

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall the schedules A, B, C, D, E and F to
the bill carry?
Senator Grosart: With respect to the schedules, Mr. Chairman, specific reference is made to a number of votes in the
main estimates under two headings, as follows:
(a) Votes for which additional sums are required to
finance programs until forecast revenues are received
later in the fiscal year.
And:
(c) Votes for which additional portions are required
because payments are greater in the first quarter of the
fiscal year.
The reference is to 21 votes, and I would ask the Deputy
Leader of the Government to tell us which, if any, of these
votes, if this bill passes, is granted complete or full supply.

March 29, 1977

Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall I report the bill without amendment?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

The Hon. the Speaker: The sitting is resumed.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

Senator Macnaughton: Madam Speaker, the Committee of
the Whole, to which was referred Bill C-45, an act for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1978, has
considered the said bill and has the honour to report the same
without amendment.

Senator Langlois: The answer is none of them.
Senator Grosart: Would that apply, for example, to the
Treasury Board vote 10? That is the one which applies to the
student summer and youth employment program. Are we told
that only part of that vote is required?
Senator Langlois: We are only asking for nine-twelfths of
this vote.
Senator Grosart: How long will that carry this program?
What is the anticipation-to June 30?
Senator Langlois: Up to approximately the end of June.
Senator Grosart: So that nine-twelfths total vote will be
expended, and the anticipation is that it will be expended by
June 30 and there will then be only three-twelfths left for the
remainder of the summer; is that correct?
Senator Langlois: That is correct; quite correct.
The Chairman: Shall schedule A carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS
AND ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS FINANCING BILL,
1977
SECOND READING

Hon. Andrew Thompson moved the second reading of Bill
C-37, to provide for the making of certain fiscal payments and
of established programs financing contributions to provinces,
to provide for payments in respect of certain provincial taxes
and fees, and to make consequential and related amendments.
He said: Honourable senators, in introducing this bill I
apologize for the fact that it is a rather heavy one to digest
and, at this time, after the long discussion we have had I crave
your indulgence as I attempt to explain it. The bill has been
described as one which surely could capture the esoteric
imagination of chartered accountants and actuaries. There are
algebraic formulae and cube roots worked into its clauses. It is
a very complex document, and it deals with such notions as
measurement of fiscal capacity, methods of calculating cash
entitlements, escalation factors and tax rate changes. Yet these
are essential features of the new fiscal relations being proposed. Fiscal relations between different levels of government
are inherently complicated, and there is no alternative in
writing them into the law.

The measures incorporated in this bill are an integral part of
the framework under which Canada will be governed over the
next year.
Senator Flynn: Over the next five years.
Senator Thompson: Yes, the next five years. Basically, the
bill proposes fiscal arrangements to provide for the transfer of
a large part of national fiscal resources from the federal to the
provincial governments. That fiscal transfer, over the coming
fiscal year, will amount to $8.5 billion, about $3 billion of
which will be in the form of an increased share of personal
income taxes, with the rest being in the form of cash payments. That transfer represents more than one-sixth of the
current total federal budget, and is roughly a sum equal to the
1965 federal budget. It will provide funding for four vital
national programs-revenue equalization, hospital insurance,
medicare and post-secondary education. Every Canadian,
regardless of the region in which he or she lives, through the
equalization payments program will be assured a reasonable
level of vital public services without being forced to pay much
higher taxes than the national average. In other words, it is a
vital program in reducing, as much as possible, regional disparities, and I think all honourable senators would agree that
such a policy is fundamental to the preservation of national
unity.
Financial stability will also be maintained through the sharing of fiscal areas, the revenue stabilization program and the
guaranteed personal income revenues. What is as significant as
the stupendous sums of money involved is the fact that such
programs represent federalism at work. Bill C-37 is the culmination of many months-indeed, in some cases, years-of
intensive federal-provincial discussion and negotiation. As I
look across at the former premier of Nova Scotia, I am sure
he, like the present premiers and the Prime Minister, and the
people who worked on such legislation, looks upon this bill as a
strong indication that federalism will work. There are bound to
be differences between the federal government and the provinces and, indeed, amongst the provinces themselves. The
federal government must preserve sufficient fiscal resources to
redistribute income to persons and regions, to stabilize the
economy, and to continue to help finance the services, in all
parts of the country, which Canadians need and deserve. The
provinces argue for more fiscal elbow room and basic autonomy. They claim that the federal government intruded into
areas of provincial jurisdiction through the use of its spending
power, and that the shared-cost programs, in particular, had
distorted provincial expenditure priorities and that this, in
turn, forced the provinces to provide high cost programs where
equally effective lower cost alternatives would serve as well.
I do not think there is much argument that, without the
exercise of the federal spending power in the areas of health
and post-secondary education, we would not have the excellent
national standards which currently prevail in all provinces. I
should like to give credit for that to all parties in Parliament. I
think, for example, of the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker
who initiated, in many ways, the hospital insurance program
80003-39/2

EAE

when he made the arrangement whereby one province could
receive costs from the federal government. When I talk of
medicare, I think of the establishment, again by the Right
Honourable John Diefenbaker, of the Hall Commission.
So I think that all of us, regardless of our political persuasion, agree that the spending power of the federal government
did play a significant part in connection with the setting of
health standards across Canada.
Bill C-37 represents an accommodation to provincial
demands, increasing their fiscal room and providing them with
increased opportunity to determine their own priorities in these
areas. Indeed, we have seen the evolution of such fiscal
arrangements between the federal and provincial governments
over the past 10 or 20 years in providing greater fiscal freedom
and autonomy. The provinces have developed a wide array of
distinctive and effective programs, increasingly under their
own control.
It is important that recognition be given to the interdependence of all parts of the bill when discussing its overali impact.
There is a danger of focusing on one area exclusively. In
reading the debate which took place in the other place, I felt,
in some cases, that that very thing did take place. For example, one could focus completely on the impact of the transfer of
tax points, arguing that such a transfer is unfair to the poorer
provinces. But that ignores the provision of the equalization
factor whereby a special equalization payment brings the
province with a lower tax income up to the national average.
There are some who have suggested the bill will mean that
national standards of health services will suffer as a result of
more provincial autonomy in that area. However, we should
not lose sight of the fact that the basic requirements of the
federal government in connection with health services will
remain, and those requirements are, as I am sure honourable
senators are aware, the administration by the public authority,
universality, comprehensiveness and portability from one province to another. Those standards will be maintained.
I have faith in the provincial administrations. The health
program is well established in Canada, and I believe that the
electorate of the various provinces will ensure that the level of
hospital and medical services to which they are entitled and
accustomed will be maintained.
The provinces accepted the established program formula
because, in absolute dollar terms, all provinces are projected to
benefit from this formula compared to current arrangements
extended.
I should like now, with your indulgence, to take each of the
10 parts of the bill. Part I of the bill outlines the new
equalization formula. The present formula expires on March
1, 1977-which emphasizes the urgency in having the measures proposed in this bill enacted. I might say I was interested
in the development that took place with respect to this bill
prior to its arrival in the Senate. If I may, I should like to give
a chronology of the federal-provincial meetings. As the honourable Leader of the Opposition has suggested, we should be
wondering why such important bills as this come to us almost

SENATE DEBATES
on the eve of the risk of finances not getting out to the
provinces.
On April 1, 1976, there was a meeting of finance ministers
to review federal-provincial fiscal arrangements. That was
followed by a meeting of first ministers on June 14 and 15,
which was followed by further meetings of finance ministers
on July 6 and December 6 and 7. On December 13 and 14,
there was another meeting of first ministers, and on February
1 and 2 of this year there was a finance ministers' meeting,
and at that final meeting details of the new arrangements were
confirmed.
* (1520)

There was hard bargaining, as there should be in a Confederation, as between provinces and the federal government and
as between provinces and provinces, and the matter did not get
down to final acceptance until February 1. That means that
from that time there has been a lot of work done, and a lot of
quick work done, on the part of the department.
Now, coming back to the new formula-that is, the equalization formula-it will apply for five years, starting on April
1, 1977. I should like to repeat, because I think it is worth
emphasizing, that the purpose of equalization is being maintained, of course, and it is of very great significance and
importance, and that purpose is to ensure that all provinces
can provide reasonable standards of basic public service without having to raise their taxes above the national average.
Seven provinces at present receive equalization payments, and
I am sure all honourable senators are aware of them. They are
the four Atlantic provinces, and Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. It is estimated that equalization payments of about
$2.5 billion will be made to the provinces in the fiscal year
1977-78. In per capita terms, that means the following distribution to the provinces: Newfoundland, $479; Prince Edward
Island, $577; Nova Scotia, $416; New Brunswick, $394;
Quebec, $200; Manitoba, $194; and Saskatchewan, $41.
Senator Flynn: Are you speaking of equalization payments
there?
Senator Thompson: Yes.
Senator Flynn: Then I think there was a mistake as far as
Quebec is concerned. I think the amount is $1,292.
Senator Thompson: I am speaking just of the equalization
payment, and it is $200 per capita. Perhaps I did not make it
clear that it is a per capita figure. So far as Ontario, Alberta
and British Columbia are concerned, their fiscal capacity is
above the national average, and they do not receive such
equalization payments.
There are four essential differences to the new equalization
formula. In the first place, the revenues to be equalized have
been reclassified and redefined to better reflect what the
provinces are now taxing. For example, there are now 29
categories of groupings where before there were 22. And this
provides for a particular focus on certain revenue bases which
have increased in significance in recent years, and they could
be anything from lotteries to payroll deductions, and so on.

March 29, 1977

Secondly, the treatment of natural resource revenues has
been changed. Commencing with 1974-75, provincial revenues
from natural resources have been only partly included in
equalization, and this has been in order to avoid a sudden and
unwarranted large jump in the cost to the Canadian taxpayer
of equalization programs.
It is proposed to continue to limit resource revenues subject
to equalization, but to do so in a more consistent manner. At
present, revenues from non-renewable resources, except for oil
and gas, are equalized in full. Oil and gas revenues are split
into two parts-basic and additional. Basic revenues, essentially revenues up to 1973-74-and that was the year after which
there was a large increase in the world prices of oil and gasare equalized in full. Additional revenues are equalized to the
extent of one-third. Now the new formula-and this provides a
more generous allocation of funds-provides that one-half of
all revenues from non-renewable resources will be equalized.
All provincial revenues from renewable resources will continue
to be equalized in full, as they are at present.
Thirdly, changes have been built into the formula to reduce
existing possibilities for a province to influence its equalization
entitlements by its own actions. In particular, new revenue
sources covering both corporate income taxes and revenues
derived from government business enterprises have been established. And the objective of this new grouping is to prevent a
province's equalization entitlement from being significantly
increased as a result of the province's acquiring a privatelyowned profit-making corporation. Here I am looking at one of
the honourable senators from Saskatchewan, and perhaps we
would think of potash as just one example of this.
Finally, a partial ceiling has been built into the equalization
formula for all natural resource revenues, and this has been
done, as I am sure all honourable senators will recognize, to
guard against a rapid increase in the cost of the equalization
program resulting from such events as worldwide shortages or
restrictions of supply that can affect resource revenues particularly. The way it is being done is by providing that the total
amount of equalization payable in respect of all natural
resource revenues may not exceed one-third of the total equalization. The level of one-third is somewhat above the existing
level and is unlikely to become applicable unless there is a very
substantial increase in provincial revenue from oil and gas.
Part Il of the bill provides for a renewal of the fiscal
stabilization program for a period of five years, commencing
April 1, 1977. It will replace the present one which expires on
March 31, 1977. The purpose of revenue stabilization is to
protect provinces from sudden, year-to-year losses of revenue
as a result of a severe downturn in the national economy or in
their own economies. In essence, the program provides that
where the total revenue of a province in any year is lower than
its total revenue in the preceding year, it will receive a
stabilization payment equal to the shortfall.
The reason for the comparison between the two years is on
the basis of common tax rates and structures. However, where
the reduction occurs in respect of natural resource revenues,
stabilization is applicable only if, and to the extent that, the

March 29, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

reduction exceeds 50 per cent of such revenues for the previous
year. This latter provision, the 50 per cent threshold, has been
added to prevent the possibility of making substantial stabilization payments to resource-rich provinces whose revenues
could fall from present or future high levels as a result of the
climbing volumes of production or reductions in the prices of
resources. It would not make sense to the Canadian taxpayer
to underwrite resource revenues, given their historical tendency to reach peaks from which sharp declines occur. The rapid
increases in such revenues are for the most part unexpected;
their subsequent declines are foreseeable. They should be
planned for by the provinces which are fortunate enough to
have such resources and, indeed, such is the case if you look
again at Alberta and Saskatchewan-and I am thinking of the
Heritage Fund in Alberta. While no payments have ever been
made under the stabilization program, it has proved useful to
the provinces when they have gone to the capital markets to
raise funds.
e

(1530)

Part III of the bill provides for continuation of the authority
in the present act for the federal government to enter into tax
collection agreements with the provinces. The only significant
change here is that for the first time there is provision for
bringing the two Territories within the tax collection agreements. Under these agreements the federal government collects on behalf of all provinces, except Quebec, the provincial
personal income taxes they levy. It also collects on behalf of all
provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, the corporation income
taxes that they impose. It does so at no cost to the provinces,
except for a small fee in the case of some provinces for the
administration of special rebates.
This tax collection system, as I am sure every senator will
understand, has been used as the main tool to keep federal and
provincial tax systems in harmony. The two provinces not
party to the agreement have shown a willingness to keep their
systems similar to the federal system, thus preserving
harmony.
Part IV of the bill provides for a new limited revenue
guarantee program-which I believe the honourable Leader of
the Opposition was discussing last night-a program which is
intended to avoid serious disruption to provincial financial
planning as a result of federal tax policy changes in the year in
which they are effective. Its purpose is to encourage the
maintenance of a common tax system across Canada. Provincial personal income taxes under the tax collection agreements
are applied to federal basic tax. So, as a result, any policy
change that reduces federal basic tax alters provincial tax
collections. The guarantee will apply to all personal income tax
changes announced after the beginning of a tax year and
effective in that year. The guarantee will pay for any such
provincial revenue losses as a result of federal policy that
exceed 1 per cent of federal basic tax in the province. The
change in revenues will be estimated by the provinces, and,
where the potential loss exceeds 1 per cent of the federal basic
tax, a payment will be made. The 1 per cent is designed to

597

avoid the necessity of making payments for small and unimportant changes.
The province of Quebec, as honourable senators know, both
defines its own income tax law and collects its own income tax.
Thus, it is not automatically affected like the other provinces.
However, Quebec has indicated its interest in making its tax
system conform with the national system, and it has asked to
be included in the program. If Quebec makes changes in the
tax system similar to the federal changes in the same year, it
will be eligible for a guaranteed payment.
Part V of the bill authorizes the federal government to share
with the provinces 20 per cent of the yield of a special federal
tax of 15. per cent on the pay-out by corporations of undistributed surplus on hand at the end of their 1971 taxation
years. The provisions of this part of the bill are simply a
continuation of the arrangements provided for under the existing act.
I come now to Part VI of the bill, which contains the new
provisions for the financing of established shared-cost programs. In essence, the present cost-sharing arrangements for
hospital insurance, medicare and post-secondary education are
replaced by a formula under which federal contributions will
no longer be tied to provincial expenditures. I think we can
recognize that some people criticized this by suggesting that
perhaps the federal expenditures were really decided by the
provincial capitals-in other words, the federal budget was
going to be decided by provincial capitals.
The objectives of the new arrangement were outlined by the
Prime Minister last June at the meeting of first ministers.
Perhaps I could repeat these. They are, first, to maintain
across Canada the standard of service to the public under
these major programs and to facilitate their improvement;
second, to put the programs on a more stable footing so that
both levels of government are better able to plan their expenditures; third, to give the provinces flexibility in the use of their
own funds which they had been spending in these fields;
fourth, to bring about greater equality among the provinces
with respect to the amount of federal funds they receive under
the programs; and, fifth, to provide for continuing joint policy
discussions relating to the health and post-secondary education
fields.
The new established programs financing arrangements, as
defined in Part VI of this bill, will help to achieve each of these
goals. The need for a detailed accounting required under the
cost-sharing formula for hospital insurance, medicare and
post-secondary education will be eliminated. I think on both
sides they will be very glad to sec the end of that detailed
accounting, because it was a source of irritation and resentment between the two levels of government for some time. The
federal contributions to the provinces will now take the form of
cash payments and the transfer of tax room to the provinces.
The federal contribution to the provinces under this part of
the bill will come to more than $6 billion in the next fiscal
year. The basic cash contribution for established programs
financing for 1977-78 will equal 50 per cent of the national

SENATE DEBATES
average per capita contribution for all three programs in the
base year, 1975-76, multiplied by the population in each
province and escalated in line with the growth in the Canadian
economy since that year. The tax transfer will consist of 13.5
personal, and one corporate, income tax points plus associated
equalization.
Since the provinces already have 4.357 personal, and one
corporate, income tax points for post-secondary education
under Part VI of the present bill, the increased tax transfer to
the provinces will now be 9.143 personal income tax points.
The value of the tax transfer varies widely among the
provinces. Therefore, in the interest of achieving greater equality of treatment among the provinces, transitional adjustment
payments will be made to ensure that the value of the tax
transfer is at least the equivalent of the value of the basic cash
contribution, and in this way provinces will receive as much in
tax revenues and cash as they would receive if the entire
federal contribution were in the form of cash.
I should also note that the current shared-cost payments
also vary widely from province to province on a per capita
basis. Accordingly, levelling adjustments will be made in order
to achieve further equality of provincial treatment. These
levelling adjustments will assure all provinces equal per capita
payments after five years. Provinces now above the national
average will be levelled down in five years, and those now
below the national average will be levelled up within three
years.
a

(1540)

The bill also makes provision for the extended health care
services program. Under this program certain new health
programs, as well as certain services now cost-shared under the
Canada Assistance Plan, will be financed by means of an equal
per capita cash grant of $20. This program has the advantage
of ending all open-ended cost-sharing arrangements in the
health care field, and of making it easier for the provinces to
provide less costly but equally effective services across the
whole spectrum of our health care system.
I might note at this point, honourable senators, that the bill
provides that any proposed amendments to these new arrangements which would have the effect of lowering a province's
entitlement could only be implemented after three years'
notice unless, of course, the affected province agrees to the
change. Moreover, it provides that such notice will not be
given for at least two years. This provision assures the province
of long-term stable financing.
I turn now to part VII of the bill, which replaces the
Established Programs (Interim Arrangements) Act. This act,
which was passed in 1965, provides for the special contracting
out arrangements with Quebec. In the mid-1960s the federal
government offered the provinces an arrangement whereby
they could accept responsibility for financing certain sharedcost programs in exchange for a federal tax abatement.
Quebec was the only province to take advantage of the federal
offer.

March 29, 1977

Under the new fiscal arrangements the special abatement
will be reduced to take account of the federal tax reduction of
9.143 per cent. Thus the special 24-point abatement to the
Quebec taxpayer will be reduced by the general tax reduction
of 9.143 to 14.857 points. That will leave him in the same
position after as before the federal tax cut.
Part VIII of the bill authorizes the federal government to
enter into reciprocal taxation agreements with the provinces
effective October I this year. These agreements will provide
for the two levels of government to pay each other's consumption taxes. The reason for such agreements, as I am sure some
honourable senators are aware, is that there has been uncertainty and dispute between provinces and the federal government concerning the paying of such taxes. To date, six provinces have agreed to enter into a system of reciprocal taxation
with the federal government respecting consumption taxes.
Part IX of the bill provides for the necessary authority to
make regulations pursuant to the new act, and for the recovery
I referred to a few moments ago.
Part X contains consequential amendments to other legislation. It provides for the reduction in federal income tax rates
to which I alluded earlier as part of the established programs
financing arrangements.
Honourable senators will be relieved to learn that that ends
my review of the main provisions of the bill. They reflect the
accord reached between the federal government and the provinces following extensive and intensive discussions during the
past year and a half. It is very complex legislation-certainly
it is for me and, I think, for all honourable senators. It is
highly sensitive to the great diversity in our Confederation. In
its essential purposes this bill is concrete evidence of the ability
and the will within our federal system to accommodate our
original differences in a manner that enhances the strength
and well-being of the entire federation.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I wonder
if I might ask Senator Thompson a question with reference to
part VI of the bill and his phrase "levelling adjustments," by
which I understood him to mean that certain adjustments
would be made so that the amount per capita received by each
province under part VI would eventually be exactly the same. I
found some difficulty in understanding that when I read the
bill and the debate in the other place-and, indeed, when I
asked for an explanation during the meeting of the National
Finance Committee this morning. It may mean, of course,
exactly what it says, in which case no further explanation is
required; but everyone seems to indicate that it does not mean
quite that.
Senator Thompson: I do not know whether the honourable
senator wishes me to go into detail with respect to how the
levelling adjustments affect each province.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I do not want to press Senator
Thompson unduly. I wondered whether he could add any
explanatory words to what he has already said.
Senator Thompson: One of the questions which may be in
the minds of honourable senators with respect to levelling up is

March 29, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

why the low average provinces are not immediately levelled up
to the national average? The Government of Canada thought
originally that a period of adjustment was advisable. It proposed the move towards equal per capita opportunities to be
spread over five years. However, in response to provincial
requests, low average provinces are to be brought up to the
national average in three years. An immediate shift to the
national average for lower provinces would mean that there
would be larger revenues for these provinces, and they had not
worked out how they would integrate those larger revenues in
the programs. I do not know whether I am answering the
question, but perhaps it could be raised when the bill goes to
committee and we have the officials before us.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Perhaps that would be the best
thing to do. I propose shortly to move the adjournment of the
debate. What troubles me is that no one seems very clear as to
whether this levelling-up process will mean that the poorer
provinces, because they receive more under the formula now in
existence, will be levelled down, and thus receive less per
capita than they do now; and that the so-called wealthier
provinces, which now receive less under the formula, will be
levelled up so that they will receive more.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators,
there are a couple of questions I should like to ask. While I did
not hear the whole of Senator Thompson's remarks, those that
I did indicated that he was introducing a very complex piece of
legislation. Any legislation which deals with fiscal sharing
between the provinces and the federal authority, as we know
from our experience over the years, is very complicated
legislation.

•

(1550)

Senator Thompson bas earned the gratitude of all of us for
the painstaking way in which he has introduced this bill. In the
main, insofar as the subject matter of the bill allows him to do
so, I think be has also done it very clearly.
The point raised by Senator Smith is a perfectly valid one. It
has always seemed to me, and I am sure to all honourable
senators, that in this matter of attempted equalization of
grants to the provinces for certain programs in the fields of
health care, education, and perhaps others, the objective or the
purpose that all seek to achieve is a national average that will
apply across the board in all provinces on a per capita basis.
As Senator Smith said, however, sometimes the absolute
requirements of universities, or even of medical establishments, in smaller provinces are greater than what could be
worked out through the application of a formula which would
impose a national average on a per capita basis.
I take it, from what Senator Thompson has said, that the
provinces have conferred and collaborated extensively with the
federal authority to reach the formulae which have been
embodied in this legislation, but I think the point raised by
Senator Smith is one which we should investigate thoroughly
in committee, because it is important to the smaller provinces
that are perhaps at some risk with regard to the amount of the
absolute grants or transfer payments, or even point concessions, that they achieve through this bill.

599

There is one problem, however, in connection with this type
of legislation that has bothered me for a long time. I may be
simplistic about this and there may be a very good reason for
doing it this way, but, certainly, when it is done this way, the
complicating factors are greater than if it were done in a more
direct way. Senator Thompson, as I understood his remarks,
said that some of the benefits that are to flow to the provinces
for these programs are to come from the withdrawal by the
federal authority from certain areas of the taxing field. In
other words, there are certain tax points that are to be given
over to the provinces, whereby they can levy the tax to do the
job that is required.
Then there is the aspect of the benefits that a province is to
get, which will flow from the cash grants that the federal
government is to make to the provinces on the basis of the
formulae set out in the bill. This means, of course, that the
federal authority, which bas no revenue or money of its own
except what it collects from tax sources, is going to tax for this
money and, in turn, hand it over to the provinces. I often
wonder why, in this field of federal-provincial relations, it
could not all be done one way or the other. Personally, I think
that a withdrawal from the field of either personal income tax
or corporate income tax, or whatever other element of the tax
field is to be turned over to the provinces, might be a way of
achieving a result that would be similar to the one that would
take place if there were this mix. Instead of this mix of cash
grants for one part, and withdrawal from the fields of taxation
for other parts, it might be that the federal authority would
feel it should retain a certain control over the ability to tax for
these purposes, since it is the central and dominant authority.
Also, it may be that the provinces do not want the full
authority to tax in these fields, because the imposition of
taxation by government is always a difficult exercise. It creates
political problems for the government; it makes it possible for
people to criticize a government for overtaxing in certain
fields, and for having extravagant ideas about what should be
done in connection with some of the programs that are to be
affected by this proposed legislation.
It seems to me that these are considerations which we might
well carefully examine in committee. I hope this bill is referred
to one of the standing committees of the Senate if it receives
second reading. h look forward to cross-examining the witnesses at that time, and, if the minister is there, to discussing
some of these points with him.
Senator Thompson: To answer the question put by Senator
Connolly, one of the things which I see as a benefit when room
is being given to the provinces in the tax-sharing field is that
the provinces themselves are going to be taxing for services
which they provide. The harmony between the federal government and the provinces does not arise solely from handing over
to them some of the tax field. The tax fields of some of the
provinces are not as remunerative as those of others. For
example, Prince Edward Island gets $4 while other provinces
get $10, so there has to be a mixture of cash payments, and I
think that this combination is one of the illustrations of
compromise in Canada. You will recall, perhaps, that the

SENATE DEBATES
treasurer of my own province asked for 20 tax points alone,
and nothing else. Naturally, there were other provinces which
said, "No, hold it. This is not fair. The richer provinces are
going to do very well out of it, but the poorer ones may not do
so."
Senator Grosart: On a point of order.
senator closing the debate?

General, will proceed to the Senate Chamber to-day, the
29th day of March, at 5.45 p.m., for the purpose of giving
Royal Assent to certain bills.
I have the honour to be,
Madam,
Your obedient servant,

Senator Langlois: He was answering a question put by
Senator Connolly.
Senator Grosart: He was not. He was making a speech.
May I ask Senator Thompson if the provinces agreed to the
provisions of this bill?
Senator Thompson: I think the answer is yes. Certainly
there were conflicts over some parts of it but, on the whole,
there was agreement by the provinces.
Senator Flynn: Did they have a choice?

e

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Senator Thompson: Yes, I think they did. They could, for
example, have held up the hospital program. The very fact that
they took 18 months over it shows that this was not something
that was pushed on to them. There were 18 months, or even
more, of hard bargaining, and this indicates that it was not a
case of one party saying, "Take it or leave it." If that had been
the case, the federal government, as I suggested, could have
done this 18 months ago.

At 5.45 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Senator Grosart: My question-and I think it is susceptible
of a yes or no answer-was: Have all the provinces agreed to
the provisions of this bill?

ROYAL ASSENT

Senator Thompson: I would say yes.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I think I
had better move the adjournment of the debate pretty quickly.
However, I did hear the phrase "co-operative federalism" from
the other side of the house, but it appeared to me that in
relation to this bill "compulsory federalism" might be a more
appropriate expression.
I now move that this debate be adjourned.
On motion of Senator Smith (Colchester), debate
adjourned.

The Honourable Wishart F. Spence, O.B.E., Puisne Judge
of the Supreme Court of Canada, Deputy of His Excellency
the Governor General, having come and being seated at the
foot of the Throne, and the House of Commons having been

pleased to give the Royal Assent to the following bill:

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS
AND ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS FINANCING BILL,
1977
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Thompson for second reading of Bill C-37,
to provide for the making of certain fiscal payments and of
established programs financing contributions to provinces, to
provide for payments in respect of certain provincial taxes and
fees, and to make consequential and related amendments.
Hon. George I. Smith: Honourable senators, 1 thank you for
your very warm welcome. I hope, when I am finished, you will

not be equally glad to know that I have finished, and I hope
you will not regret that I have spoken.
I wish to mention a couple of things that have nothing
whatever to do with this bill, and I hope no one will object. I
heard some moments ago that perhaps tomorrow, or at some
future time, we would have a clearer conception of the metric
bill. I must say that seems to me very much like a pious hope
that is unlikely to be fulfilled. Although it may be perfectly
clear to many, including some of my colleagues, I am not at ail
sure that when my tenure in this place is over I shall have a
clear conception of that bill.
The other point is that I understand that some committees
to which I belong may sit during the sitting of the Senate this
afternoon, and I just wish to express to them my sympathy for
the fact that they will, therefore, have to miss the eloquent and
useful contribution that I proposed to make.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I should like to begin by congratulating Senator Thompson on his presentation of the
government's position in support of this bill. I recognize without any reservation that he must have given to that presentation a great deal of study and hard work. In a moment I shall
explain, perhaps at greater length, why I think that. I appreciate the manner in which he presented this bill. This is complex
legislation, and in my opinion he presented it very well indeed.
I say again that I congratulate him, not only on his presentation but on the great amount of energy I know he must have
expended in preparing that presentation.
I am forced to express some dissent from some of the views
he placed before us, but I want him to know that in so doing I
am not in any way quarrelling with what he said, but rather
with the people whose activities resulted in the formulation
and presentation of this bill to the other place, and in due
course-rather belatedly-to us.
It is indeed a difficult and complex bill, but there is no need
for it to be so. I think Senator Thompson's comment in this
respect-and I am sorry to see these eminent gentlemen going
to committee having to be deprived now of the benefit of my
dissertation-1 think that his description of the bill as one
which would capture the esoteric imagination of chartered
accountants and actuaries is absolutely correct. But I cannot
possibly think of anybody else whose imagination could conceivably be captured by this bill, or of anybody else who could
really understand it except possibly some who over a long
period of years have been brought up and nurtured on, and
have experienced, the workings of the various federal-provincial fiscal arrangements acts which have been in effect over the
last 20 years.

March 30, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

The honourable sponsor said-and I do not disagree with
him-it is unfortunate that in such a bill it should be necessary
to include algebraic formulae and cube roots, but I do find
some sadness in my heart to realize that immediately after
saying that lie commented that there was no alternative to
writing them into the law, meaning that there is no alternative
to writing the law so that people cannot understand it. I
disagree with him most vigourously, not because I wish to
disagree with him but because I disagree with the proposition
that there is no alternative to writing a law so that people
cannot understand it. I believe that parliamentarians should
not accept with complacency the concept that complexity and
obscurity are inevitable in the legislation that we consent to,
that we pass and eventually ask be given royal assent. I believe
that the time has come for al] parliamentarians, at all levels, to
be prepared to stand up and say that if we do not understand a
bill we cannot expect the people whom it affects to understand
it, and we will not foist it upon them.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
e

(1410)

Senator Smith (Colchester): Somehow, over the years we
have allowed draftsmen-and they are able, honourable,
decent and well-meaning men and women-to develop a
jargon and a system of their own which, beginning at a time
and from a base which could be understood by lawyers, at
least, as well as accountants and some other trained people,
has got now to the point where my honourable friend who
presented this bill to us for our favourable consideration has to
say that it captures the esoteric imagination of accountants
and actuaries and, by implication if not in fact, say he does not
understand it, we do not understand it, and we should not
aspire to understand it, but let it go because it is inevitable. In
my opinion, that is indeed a sad commentary on what many
people are now beginning to say is the ascendancy of bureaucracy over democracy, that we are rapidly becoming subject, in
a very real way, to the rule of bureaucrats rather than the rule
of democrats-and as I am not in the United States, it is safe
for me to use that term.
I say again, it is important that they be restrained from this
method of drafting the law so that no one can understand it
but themselves, though perhaps specially trained accountants
and lawyers can understand it sufficiently to argue among
themselves as to what it means.
Senator Phillips: How much training do they require?
Senator Smith (Colchester): A very great deal. Surely this is
one of the symptoms of today that makes government more
and more remote from people, that causes people to have less
and less sympathy with their government-and particularly, if
I may say so, ours, and perhaps that sympathy, or lack of it,
will be displayed in due course.
Surely if governments want to be close to the people, and
hope people understand what they are doing, they should insist
that the legislation which they present to Parliament should be
understood by themselves, should be capable of ready understanding by the legislators to whom it is presented, and should,

with a modest amount of effort, be understood by the subjects
to whom it applies.
I venture to say that asking draftsmen to put legislation in
an understandable form is not asking too much. Surely he who
has the greatest command of language is the person who can
explain difficult concepts so that all of us can know what that
concept is and what its results are likely to be, or at least may
be.
In my opinion, there is here a challenge, first, to the
draftsmen to devote themselves to a kind of drafting which
tells the story of what the law means so that you and I can
follow it, and so that others to whom it applies can follow it;
and also a challenge to those of us who have to pass upon draft
legislation and to seek royal assent to it, to ensure that we can
understand it. It is therefore also a challenge to us to reject it
when we do not understand it. It is no longer an acceptable
method of procedure for parliamentarians to say, "Well, I do
not understand it, but I guess Bill does. He thinks it is all
right, so let it go." That is a dangerous concept, one that has
led to the undoubted situation where governments of most
political stripes in democratic countries have reached the point
where they are not really in touch with those whom they
govern and to whom the legislation applies.
I believe that any legal concept, whether or not it imposes a
tax or deals with the transfer of payments between governments or between persons, can be expressed in simple language. I do not believe there is any legal concept that cannot
be so expressed, and I think it is time we all looked very
carefully at that proposition. At least, if upon examination
honourable senators do not agree with it, they might come to
the conclusion that it bas a good deal of validity and should
have very few exceptions to it.
*

(1420)

When we must use, as Senator Thompson quite correctly
said, formulae and cube root calculations to express relationships between governments and between governments and
people, we have indeed come to a pretty pass. I am not now
criticizing our educational system, but how many of us are
proficient at utilizing algebraic formulae to determine our
everyday actions? Do we use algebraic formulae to determine
what we shall buy, what we shall sell, or what course of action
we shall follow? Of course not. If somebody said, "Before
making this decision you had better get the cube root of 125"
we would tell them where to go, and perhaps some of us in
more vigorous language would tell them something else. Why
should we not have the sane attitude towards those who draft
for us and present to us this kind of law to impose upon our
people?
Honourable senators, do you want to be told that your taxes
or your government expenditures are going to be determined
by algebraic formulae or cube roots, or some other form that
you don't understand? I would ask you, if you will, to turn, for
what I hope will not be very long, to one or two provisions of
the bill just to illustrate my point. I know that every senator
has read these provisions and I hesitate to ask you to do so
again, but perhaps you might indulge me enough to turn to

SENATE DEBATES
page 21 of the bill and look first at the reference to the Income
Tax Act. I could look at many different parts of the bill for the
same reason, but this one will illustrate my point. Looking at
page 21, clause 20(2)(a), in order to know what it is all about
you have to turn to the Income Tax Act, because paragraph
(a) says:
75% of the amount, as determined by the Minister, that
would be derived from a tax, computed in accordance
with the Income Tax Act.
So you cannot look at this bill and know what that means. You
have to determine what the tax would be computed in accordance with the Income Tax Act, and that is not an easy job in
itself. The Income Tax Act is another act that I would not be
able to commend for its clarity. As you go down the page you
see the Income Tax Act mentioned at line 40 and line 47, and
in many other places in the bill.
Looking at this bill to calculate the very important things it
means to governments, and therefore to people, one cannot
even understand what it means; you have to turn to another
act. Just turn over the page and look at the left-hand column
on page 22. One can see the same thing in the right-hand
column if you wish to read it in French. After outlining how
this thing shall be computed, this payment, this obligation, the
bill goes on to say:
equal to the product obtained by multiplying
by the tax otherwise payable, within the meaning of
paragraph 120(4)(c) of the Incone Tax Act, under Part I
of that Act on those incomes;
Who here knows what that means?' Will Senator Thompson
volunteer to tell us? Do any of those documents, which I am
sure he read so carefully before he made his presentation to
the Senate yesterday, give him the information? I venture to
say he could look for many and many a long day and night
before he found that answer. Yet that is only one small sample
of the complexities we find in this bill which means so much to
our governments, and therefore to our people.
Honourable senators, I am about to leave this point, you
will, I suppose, be glad to know, but before I do so I should
like to pose this question and try to answer it.
What should be the philosophy in drafting legislation, and
what should be the philosophy of legislators in passing or
rejecting it? Should the philosophy be that as long as it is
understood by a select and very specially trained few it is all
right, that we should let it go and somebody will know what it
means? Or should the philosophy be that it must be understood by the people who have to live by it, by the people who
have to bear the burdens it imposes? Again I ask: Is it any
wonder that people feel helplessly caught up in things they do
not understand when we foist upon them this kind of legislation. My answer is that it is no wonder they feel that way.
Surely it is time parliamentarians at all levels began to say, "If
I don't understand this I won't pass it," and send it back to the
draftsmen, telling them, "When you can tell the story so that I
can understand it I will try to exercise my judgment upon it."
Incidentally, perhaps I should here say, just in case you think I

March 30, 1977

am going to vote against this bill or urge other senators to vote
against it, that the circumstances are such that I have no
choice but to support it, and I have no choice but to avoid
asking others not to support it.
I pass now to another point. I should like to draw your
attention to another basic objection to this bill. For about
twenty years now we have noticed a new development in
legislative decisions. Here we are dealing with a form of
legislative decision that has been made outside Parliament,
over which Parliament has absolutely no effective influence or
control, over which legislatures throughout Canada have had,
and will have, no effective influence or control. It is legislative
decision by a federal-provincial conference, which by its nature
includes only first ministers and two or three selected ministers
from each province.
* (1430)

I say it is no use asking Parliament to make any substantive
change. Parliament now, in relation to this kind of legislation,
is simply a rubber stamp which is useful only for imprinting
upon the bill those formalities which make it law. It cannot
change any substantive part of it, and it will be of no use for it
to try. I say in the last 20 years or so we have been witnessing
the development of this kind of extra-parliamentary legislation, over which Parliament and legislatures have no control. It
is a new kind of law-making in Canada. I do not mean it is
new today, because it has been developing, as I say, over 20
years. I repeat that it has no contribution by Parliament or by
legislatures; it has no contribution by people; and it has no
contribution by organizations which are well informed and
well able to contribute useful views to the manner in which
federal-provincial relations should be established and carried
on from the point of view of what is good for the people.
The supporters of the government, contrary to most situations-at least, I hope most situations-have no opportunity to
make a contribution. The opposition, certainly, has no opportunity to make a contribution. Indeed, no member of Parliament, unless he be in the Privy Council or the Executive
Council as the case may be, has any opportunity to make a
real contribution to this kind of legislation. The rights of
Parliament and of legislatures-when I say "Parliament," I
really include all legislative bodies-are being eroded and, I
believe, have been almost completely eroded in connection
with this kind of legislation-that is, legislation dealing with
relations between the federal government and the provincial
governments. Thus the rights of people to speak and to decide
through their elected representatives are being eroded or
avoided completely. Democracy, as I thought I knew it and I
suspect and believe all senators thought they knew it, is being
completely avoided and, being avoided, thus is eroded.
What happens? Here I do not speak from the standpoint of
any guessing game; I know what happens. I participated in
those happenings over a great many years. What happens is
that the first ministers, as I said, of each government and two
or three others, perhaps, having taken the advice of their
colleagues in government, perhaps having noted the views of
the members of the legislature and perhaps not, perhaps

March 30, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

having noted the views of the public and perhaps not, sit
around a table-it used to be over in the West Block and now
it is down in the old Union Station-and decide the fate of the
country in a couple of days. Even that may well be an
exaggeration, because those decisions may be made not there,
but at a dinner table at 24 Sussex Drive. I am now not
complaining about the present Prime Minister; I am just
saying that is what happens. I have been there under more
than one prime minister.
Senator Flynn: You are lucky.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Well, I am not sure. There is
one I would have preferred to have been under for a long time.
Now, you may ask me, honourable senators, and with a
good deal of validity, "What are you making a fuss about
now? If you were there all those times, why did you not make
the fuss there?" Well, it would have been very much like
trying to make a fuss now. That was the way it was done and
that was the way one realized it was going to be done, corne so
and so or high water. A good many of us did not like it and I
was one of them but then, as now, that was the accepted way
to do it. So I took part in that way, because that was the only
way that one could. But surely, honourable senators, there
must be a better way, one that is more consistent with the
supremacy of people through their representatives and more
consistent with the rights of Parliament and the legislatures.
Surely, at least, there should be a previous debate in those
institutions as to the principles their representatives shall
follow as they sit around the bargaining table-and that is
what it is-at one of these conferences. Surely governments
should receive the clear instructions of the legislature they
represent, or the Parliament they represent. Thereby they
might receive the instructions of the people of Canada as to
the parameters within which they may bargain. It should also
be clearly understood that the decisions reached are, indeed,
subject to confirmation by Parliament and the provincial
legislatures. This would not only give the people of Canada
some real voice through their representatives, but would prevent further erosion of the rights of Parliament and legislatures, at least in this respect.
In my opinion, it is also very important that it would surely
help to strengthen the stand of smaller provinces, because it
would tend to encourage a general understanding throughout
the country of what is being done, what is at stake and whose
ox is being gored. It might result in better decisions, better
arrangements, fiscal and otherwise, and better government. It
would, at least, bring matters out into the full light of public
knowledge.
I hope that clock was well advanced before I started; I
notice it is getting along.
Senator Buckwold: It seems to be awfully slow.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I thought it probably did,
although I must say, speaking for myself, the time has gone
rather rapidly.
I corne now to another point, which in my opinion is of very
great importance and where I have to disagree with Senator

Thompson, not because I think he said anything he did not
believe, or said anything which was not well founded upon the
information which was given to him, but because I think it is
incorrect. I say this in criticism of the government's position,
not that of Senator Thompson. In his speech he said, in
effect-and I am paraphrasing a little, but I believe this to be
the impression he wished to convey, and did convey-that the
bill before us represents something to which the provinces had
agreed. Now, I do not intend to base my disagreement on an
allegation that the provinces did not agree in the sense that
finally they said, "Well, what's the use? We had better take
it," but I am going to say that there was no true agreement, no
true willing meeting of the minds.

e

(1440)

Before I embark on those comments, which I think show
there was no such meeting of minds, perhaps I should ask
honourable senators to look at page 600 of yesterday's Hansard, where Senator Grosart asked Senator Thompson a question related to this. Senator Grosart said:
May I ask Senator Thompson if the provinces agreed to
the provisions of this bill?
And Senator Thompson replied:
I think the answer is yes. Certainly there were conflicts
over some parts of it but, on the whole, there was agreement by the provinces.
The record continues:
SENATOR FLYNN: Did they have a choice?
SENATOR THOMPSON: Yes, I think they did. They
could, for example, have held up the hospital program.
The very fact that they took 18 months over it shows that
this was not something that was pushed on to them. There
were 18 months, or even more, of hard bargaining, and
this indicates that it was not a case of one party saying,
"Take it or leave it." If that had been the case, the federal
government, as I suggested, could have donc this 18
months ago.
SENATOR GROSART: My question-and I think it is
susceptible of a yes or no answer-was: Have all the
provinces agreed to the provisions of this bilI?
SENATOR THOMPSON: I would say yes.
Let me say again that I am not going to dispute the
technical accuracy of that answer, and I repeat that I have no
doubt at all that Senator Thompson gave it in absolute good
faith. But I say that in many cases if there was agreement,
then there was agreement under duress; it was the kind of
agreement that those who agreed or some of those who agreed,
if they did, did so not willingly or because they thought it was
fair, but because they thought there really was no other
alternative whatever. In support of this, let me refer to a
number of articles in the press in December 1976, not because
I am advocate of believing everything you read in the pressin fact, on another occasion I might argue that one should take
it with a very large grain of salt, and indeed I would be
prepared to say the same about these articles, but when there
are so many and all of them saying the same thing, as you will

SENATE DEBATES
sec, there is some reason to believe that there is probably a
measure of truth in what they say.
The first I would like to refer to is from a paper with which
I am, of course, very familiar, the Chronicle Herald of Halifax, dated December 14, 1976, and it starts out by saying on
the front page in a large red headline: "Financial Talks
Deadlocked," and a lesser headline: "Ottawa May Take Unilateral Action," and then in the third paragraph it says:
Federal negotiators were spreading the word Monday
nightThat would be the night before
-that unilateral action may be in the cards unless the
provinces soften their one for all-all for one stand on
long-stalemated tax talks.
And then follows a considerable dissertation along that line.
On December 15 there was an article in the Montreal
Gazette which quoted Mr. Lévesque, Premier of Quebec-and
Quebec was a province of Canada then as it is now-and it
said in a minor headline: "Quebec 'gypped' in new revenue
deal: Lévesque," The lead paragraph reads:
The federal government pushed the provinces into a
new revenue-sharing pact yesterday, despite angry protests by Quebec Premier René Lévesque that Ottawa was
stealing $1 10 million a year from the province.
It seems to me that it would be pretty hard to say that Mr.
Lévesque was expressing willing agreement to the provisions of
this legislation.
Then on the same day the Toronto Globe and Mail had an
article which said more of the same thing under a minor
headline: "Quebec robbed, Lévesque says of conference."
Under another headline, the Globe and Mail referred to some
comments by Darcy McKeough, the Provincial Treasurer of
Ontario, who certainly did not indicate any very great
enthusiasm for what had happened.
Then the Ottawa Citizen, on December 15, 1976-the page
does not appear to have a number, but it is a quite prominent
page-had a headline: "Brief, bitter flare ends money talks,"
and underneath that: "Spirit of Scrooge discerned in PM."
Senator Perrault: Bah, humbug!
Senator Smith (Colchester): There is also a photograph of
the Premier of British Columbia, with the caption: "Bennett
blew his stack." In the accompanying article the following
appears:
Mr. Bennett blew his top when Mr. Trudeau suggested
that premiers were something less than good Canadians
for opposing the federal offer on tax redistribution.
Later, Mr. Bennett rebuked his fellow premiers for not
fighting the federal proposals hard enough, telling reporters "if you come to the conference on your knees you are
always on the floor."
This was the day after the conference. Well, that still does
not look like agreement, certainly not willing agreement, to
me. The day after the conference the premiers of two of our

March 30, 1977

major provinces are quoted in this fashion in the same paper
on the same day.
Senator Perrault: They are not very demonstrative, that's
all.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Who is not demonstrative?
Senator Perrault: Some of the premiers.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Apparently, Premier Bennett
was, and I did not notice any inhibitions in the remarks of Mr.
Lévesque.
In the same paper-that is, the Ottawa Citizen--of the
same date, and on the front page, there appeared this headline:
"Premiers head home cursing federal government." That does
not look as if they are saying, "Everything is rosy, boys."
Senator Perrault: It must be a Tory newspaper.
Senator Smith (Colchester): It says "premiers," and I don't
think there are too many Liberal premiers in Canada, so it
cannot refer to those. In addition, I did not know that the
Citizen was particularly partial to Tories. However, I may
learn. In the article it says this:
Unhappy premiers went home Tuesday from a two-day
federal-provincial conference with $680 million in additional taxing power and grants but complaining they were
short-changed by the federal government.
Does that sound like "willing agreement"'?
The premiers, some bitter and dismayed, accused Prime
Minister Trudeau of intransigence and inflexibility for
refusing the tax-sharing deal they unanimously demanded.
Well, honourable senators, I don't know how much reliance
one can place on such articles, but I do notice that some
provinces have revised their rules of evidence so that evidence
of newspaper articles may be given in court for certain purposes. While, as I say, I reserve the right to be as skeptical as
anyone about press reports, I find it pretty hard to bring
myself to believe that all these reports would have occurred the
day after the conference if things had been as rosy as Senator
Thompson was informed.
* (1450)

However, I do not rely entirely on newspaper reports. Yesterday the Minister of Finance of Nova Scotia made his
budget speech to the Legislature. While I do not have an
official copy of it, I took the trouble to telephone Nova Scotia
and have read to me some of what seemed to be the relevant
portions of that speech. Subject only to the accuracy of what
was reported to me over the telephone, and my ability to see
that it was properly recorded, one of the paragraphs that the
minister used when bringing down his budget officially to the
Legislature of Nova Scotia is as follows:
I may also add that the decline of revenue guaranteed
payments to the province reflects the intransigence displayed by the federal government in allowing this important revenue item to end with the expiry of the 1972
Fiscal Arrangements Act on 31 March, 1977.

March 30, 1977

Does that look as though this province, or its Finance Minister,
who was certainly present at the conferenceSenator Perrault: He was one of your students in Nova
Scotia.
Senator Smith (Colchester): -assented
Leader of the Government say?

to it? What did the

Senator Perrault: He was one of your students.
Senator Smith (Colchester): He was not one of my students.
He was one of my greatest critics. I suppose 1 have spent more
hours defending myself against his criticism than against the
criticism of any half dozen persons in Nova Scotia. Here,
unsolicited by me, and unknown to me until he made it, is his
comment:
-the
decline of revenue guaranteed payments to the
province reflects the intransigence displayed by the federal government in allowing this important revenue item to
end with the expiry of the 1972 Fiscal Arrangements Act
on 31 March, 1977.
I continue the quotation:
In future provinces will be insulated for one year only
from any income tax losses resulting from changes to
personal income tax introduced by the federal government. It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that these new arrangementsAs I understand it he is speaking of a wide range of
arrangements.
-replace the 50-cent dollar for new health and higher
education programs, and while the immediate result is not
unfavourable, unless costs are contained to the new revenue levels the result must inevitably be the increase in
provincial taxation in future years.
While I suggest all this leaves the question very much in
doubt-that is, the question whether there was any really
willing agreement by the provinces, and one could resort to
many other quotations if one wished-I think it is not unreasonable for me to ask, and ask very seriously, whether there is
any real evidence that this agreement we are now asked to
sanctify by legislation was reached willingly by the participant
governments or whether it was forced upon them, and whether
it is not true that many of them at least agreed under duress.
On another point, as I understood Senator Thompson, he
said that these arrangements-I suppose he referred particularly to tax points or tax room vacated by the federal government and allotted to the provinces-represented a great triumph of decentralization and that it indicated the willingness
of the federal government to decentralize.
I suggest that the best that can be claimed for this is that it
is a decentralization of the right to raise taxes. To me it seems
simply an effort by the federal government to make sure that if
someone has to raise taxes it will be someone else, and that
does not seem to me to be something that a member of this
house or the House of Commons from any province should
rejoice about.

There is another serious matter that seems to remain in
doubt. Honourable senators will recall that yesterday I asked
about the real meaning of the levelling provisions in clause 21
of the bill, and especially the portions which appear on pages
21 and 22 of the bill. I asked whether it meint that the
levelling process would be of such a nature that it would likely
increase the costs of individual provinces. My question will be
found on pages 598 and 599 of yesterday's Hansard. I should
like to refer to that briefly, because it sums up my problem,
which I hope is not the problem of some provinces but which I
believe may well be. Here is part of my comment on page 599:
What troubles me is that no one seems very clear as to
whether this levelling-up process will mean that the
poorer provinces, because they receive more under the
formula now in existence, will be levelled down, and thus
receive less per capita than they do now; and that the
so-called wealthier provinces, which now receive less
under the formula, will be levelled up so that they will
receive more.
As I understood Senator Thompson, he was not prepared to
answer that question categorically.
The more I look at this, the more it seems to me that there is
grave doubt about what it means and the more the feeling
within me grows stronger and stronger that it means that the
advantage to the less wealthy provinces inherent in the present
formula-that includes not merely my province but, I should
think, some seven of the provinces of Canada-is going to be
wiped away.
While I think it may not be appropriate to move any
amendments at this stage of the bill, I should think that if this
bill goes to committee, as no doubt it will, it might well be
appropriate to move that it not be reported by the committee
until there is a schedule presented, to be attached to it and
form part of it, which shows how this levelling process would
likely affect, and perhaps indeed would absolutely affect, each
of the provinces of Canada over the duration of this legislation,
which is five years.
Honourable senators will be happy, I am sure, to know that
I am reaching the end of my dissertation. I want to say a word
or two about the importance of the equalization formula.
Some of those who are present will undoubtedly recall the
bitter battles waged by the provinces over a period of 20
years-perhaps longer than that-to obtain some kind of
equalization formula. Under the regime of Prime Minister
Pearson-I give him full marks for this-a tax structure
committee was appointed. It went into this problem at great
length and came up with a formula that is the basis of the
formula in today's legislation and in the legislation now before
us. Perhaps I am unduly prejudiced by the fact that I participated in those deliberations, but at least we did get that
committee to accept a proposition that had never before been
accepted. It was that every province of Canada should be put
in a financial position to supply to its citizens a level of public
services at least equal to the national average without a greater
than national average burden of taxation.

SENATE DEBATES
* (1500)

While the committee was unable, because the federal government was not prepared to adopt the principle completely, to
go all the way towards adopting that principle, it did go a long
way. I should just like to tell honourable senators that when I
asked the then Minister of Finance, who was chairman of that
committee, why the committee report was not prepared to go
all the way to accept that principle, including, as it now has,
the ability to raise taxes by taxes on real property he said,
"Well, we just can't pay for it." In later years, however, they
have come to adopt the principle very nearly in full. There are
still some modifications of it and some parts of it that can be
improved.
While I criticize parts of the bill-and you have heard me
criticize quite a number of things today-I do want to emphasize that whether or not the equalization formula is satisfactory, equalization is a fundamental necessity for keeping Canada
together. It is a fundamental necessity to enable the less
wealthy provinces of Canada to provide a reasonable degree of
public services to their citizens without an unreasonable degree
of taxation. I therefore want to emphasize as vigorously as I
can that, whether or not one agrees with the equalization
formula in the bill, one should unreservedly adopt the principle
of equalization as a fundamentally necessary requirement for a
united Canada.
Honourable senators, I wish to thank you for listening so
patiently to me. I tried to do something I have not donc before,
except on rather minor occasions, and that is to speak without
any text. I can readily sec by the clock that that was a poor
decision, because when one has a text one knows when to end,
but in speaking without a text, and not watching the clock as
well as I should have donc, I have been a greater burden upon
your patience than I otherwise would have been. I accordingly
thank you even more than I would ordinarily for your patient
attention.
Hon. Henry D. Hicks: Honourable senators, I should like to
participate briefly in the debate on second reading of this bill.
I have followed all these negotiations over the past several
years with a great deal of interest because of my own experience, having, like Senator Smith (Colchester), been on the
other side of the negotiating table some years ago on federalprovincial fiscal arrangements. I must frankly confess that
because of my involvement in post-secondary education at the
present time I shall focus my attention on the effect on
post-secondary education that these legislative changes may
have.
I noted with interest the projections made in the background
paper prepared for the Federal-Provincial Conference of
Finance Ministers, held December 6 and 7, 1976. They
showed, rather interestingly, that the support of these established progranis by the federal government had increased
gradually from the 1972-73 fiscal year to the 1976-1977 fiscal
year from a total for the shared programs in health and
post-secondary education of something like $2.99 billion to
$5.5 1 billion. Interestingly enough, the percentage of the gross
national product that those figures represented remained

March 30, 1977

almost constant during the period, falling from 2.84 per cent to
2.80 per cent.
A projection, which is not very well documented in this
paper, was made as to what would have happened if the
present formula were continued until 1981-82. It showed that
the gross amount of money would have increased from the
current year's $5.4 billion to $8.686 billion, and that did
represent a slight increase in the proportion of the gross
national product, to 2.89 per cent. If you take the figures for
post-secondary education only, I am sorry to say that the
percentage of the gross national product fell continually during
the period of the past five years, and was projected to fall even
more in the five years to 1981-82. In 1972-73, the post-secondary education proportion represented 0.966 per cent of the
gross national product. In the current year it is estimated to
represent 0.958 per cent, which is not much of a drop, but,
disconcertingly to those concerned with post-secondary education, to project the present arrangement to 1981-82 the figure
for post-secondary education drops to 0.838 per cent of the
gross national product.
On the other hand, the new formula, showing the same
projection, would indicate that by 1981-82 the three sharedcost programs would take 3.2 per cent of the gross national
product, being about $1 billion more than would be paid to the
provinces under a continuation of the present arrangement.
At first sight one would take heart at these figures and say
this is a good thing if it is going to make available for these
established programs moneys representing both a larger share
of the gross national product and, at the same time, moncys
representing about $1 billion in additional funds to support
these programs. The catch, of course, is that this money will be
made available under the arrangements with the provinces
contained in this bill without any guarantee that the moneys
will be used to support the particular programs concerned.
This is what worries me about this legislation.
In his speech on second reading, Senator Thompson referred
to the objectives of the new arrangements, which were set out
in a paper first delivered at the June federal-provincial conference, and repeated at the one held in the fall. I need not read
that again. Senator Thompson listed them verbatim at page
597 of Hansard. I want to refer to two of them and express my
reservations on whether in fact these changes will achieve the
objectives that have been stated. The third one is:
-to give the provinces flexibility in the use of their own
funds, which they had been spending in these fields.
This is fine; certainly we should give the provinces flexibility in
the use of funds by transferring moneys to them with no
strings attached. However, the moment we do that we play
down the federal presence in these fields and play down the
influence which the federal government will have on the
policies relating to medicare, hospital insurance and postsecondary education. Frankly, this worries me. There ought to
be a federal presence, and in my opinion the federal government is giving it away to the provinces, which I am not sure is
necessary. We saw what happened when the present formula

March 30, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

for financing the post-secondary educational institutions
became operative in 1967. A number of provinces, of which
Nova Scotia was one, actually reduced over a three-year
period the amount of money in absolute dollars which they
were putting into post-secondary education. I believe a similar
situation existed for a longer period than that in British
Columbia. So, while we give the provinces greater flexibility in
the spending of these dollars, we withdraw the federal presence-a presence which I think has almost invariably been a
beneficial influence in support of these important programs,
important to virtually all the people of Canada. So I have some
fears that the objective of giving the provinces greater flexibility may be only at the expense of undermining the necessary
support for programs which in my opinion are vital to the
continued development of Canada and the health care and
education of its citizens.
* (1510)

The fifth one of these is the next on which I wish to
comment. It says ". . . to provide for continuing joint policy

discussions relating to the health and post-secondary education
fields." There have been developed over the years meaningful
policy discussions in relation to the health fields, and I suspect
that these may continue. However, I point out to you that
there have been virtually no federal-provincial discussions
relating to the federal presence in post-secondary education. I
believe it is an idle hope for the federal authorities to believe
that by handing over all the money to the provinces with no
strings attached and at the same time saying that, in the
national interest, they now wish to develop their input into
post-secondary education by having more meaningful conferences and discussions with the provinces, they will be very
successful in exerting any real influence. I am afraid that the
old adage of he who pays the piper calls the tune will apply
here and the provinces will be even less willing and less ready
to discuss the problems of post-secondary education with
federal authorities than they have been previously. Frankly,
this worries me, because my experience in the field of postsecondary education has been to observe that the federal
presence was just as valuable, just as responsible, and sometimes more so, and just as understanding of the problems of
the universities, as that of the provincial governments whose
interests seem to fluctuate more than those of the federal
government. So I am a little worried that these objectives may
achieve something other than the stated purposes in the document from which I have just read.
Finally, I am also a little bit worried by some of the federal
thinking as reflected in a speech which the Minister of Finance
made to the Canadian Tax Foundation in Vancouver on
November 23, 1976. He resorts to a nice argument; I suppose
that whoever thought of this must have been the apple of the
minister's eye, at least for a while. Perhaps he thought of it
himself. However, he says in this speech, referring to giving
the provinces greater flexibility in the spending of their own
money:
If a province spends a dollar under medicare, for example,
it receives a matching federal dollar. If a province finds a
80003-40

way to save a dollar, it gives up a potential dollar of
federal sharing. The consequences for the provincial
budget of spending the dollar are eased because a federal
dollar is forthcoming. But when a dollar is saved at the
initiative of a province, a federal dollar is "lost" in a
sense. A formula that "untied" the federal contribution
from actual spending by the province would tend to
reverse the situation and encourage a more efficient delivery of services.
Well, I would not have concluded in the same way as the
minister did. I would have concluded it by saying that it might
very well tend to reverse the situation, but whether it would
encourage a more efficient delivery of services I have very
much doubt. I would be afraid that it would encourage the
neglect of the provision of services as effectively as it might
have been.
At another point in the same speech he used the expression,
referring to the same subject, that there would be:
-every expectation of agreeing to a more flexible and
less costly arrangement long before 1980.
That is in connection with health care programs. Well, I do
not think that if an arrangement is less costly it will be more
flexible. On the contrary, it is more apt to put the services in a
straitjacket because of the lack of funds and I suggest that
those two quotes from the minister may, perhaps, give away a
little more than the minister intended of the real intentions of
the federal government. I am worried that the federal presence
will not be taken note of in these arrangements and that, while
the provinces may succeed in getting just as much or, indeed,
if we can believe the projections in the December paper from
which I quoted earlier, a little more money for these established programs, there is no guarantee that the programs
themselves will be improved by these arrangements.
I certainly must support the bill at this stage and, indeed, I
have confidence that, generally speaking, the bill may result in
an improvement of services. However, I shall watch very
anxiously in the years ahead to see how effectively the federal
government can maintain its presence, particularly in postsecondary education and how the flexibility which is accorded
to the provinces will, in fact, be used. Whether it will mean
that money which has been traditionally transferred to the
provinces in the expectation that it would go for the support of
these established programs now may be pulled back to support
other programs in which provincial ministers from time to time
may have more interest is a very real fear that I have. I hope
that I am wrong and that the future will see a confident
development of these important programs, important to all the
people of Canada.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, in speaking
to Bill C-37 1 have the feeling that I am speaking to something
that has already occurred, a fait accompli or however you
would like to term it. Provincial budgets are drawn up, I
presume, on the basis that a certain number of the provinces
will receive grants, and the majority of the provincial budgets
have already been drawn up or presented. Within 48 hours

SENATE DEBATES
from now the federal Minister of Finance will be presenting
the federal budget, and 1 hope that he at least gave some
consideration to Bill C-37 in drawing up that budget. This fact
that the federal budget will be presented within 48 hours
presents an unusual situation. Perhaps, honourable senators, it
is not that unusual. We in the Senate are often accused of
rubber-stamping, or being required to rubber-stamp, whatever
legislation comes to us. I would like to point out that in the
case of Bill C-37, not only is the Senate required to rubberstamp it, but the House of Commons has rubber-stamped it. I
am not so sure that that is any deviation from the usual
pattern. Also, the provincial legislatures have had to rubberstamp it. No longer can anyone say that the Senate rubberstamps legislation; every other legislative body in the country
has rubber-stamped it.
Actually, honourable senators, if you stop and think about
it, this has not been a bad year for the Trudeau government. It
has now reduced the Senate, the House of Commons and the
ten legislatures to rubber-stamping their will. Perhaps that is
part of the new economic order that Trudeau was advocating
last year.
I wish to thank Senator Thompson for his introduction of
Bill C-37, and the presentation of his interpretation of it. I
cannot say that I accept wholly, one hundred per cent, his
interpretation, but I have no hesitation in saying to my good
friend that I wish I had his delivery when presenting a difficult
subject, and on that I congratulate him.
* (1520)

Senator Smith has dealt with a number of subjects which I
intended to deal with. I do not enjoy rising and repeating an
argument that has already been made. However, Senator
Hicks rather surprised me when he rose and participated in the
debate. For some reason, we on this side really do not expect
anyone from the government side to speak on a bill. I realize
that on many occasions government supporters are unhappy
with legislation, and occasionally someone will voice objections. Honourable senators, I have great fun counting the
number of occasions in which a Grit senator has voiced
objections to government legislation and has turned up to vote
accordingly, but I have yet to be able to give anyone a mark in
that regard.
I should like to point out that Senator Hicks, as president of
the university from which I graduated, used to review my
marks. I now enjoy the situation where I can review his
performance.
Senator Hicks: He really was before my time, honourable
senators.
Senator Phillips: Senator Thompson, in introducing the bill,
tried to relate it, as much as is possible with a technical bill, to
the ordinary everyday situation, and I was thinking how I
could continue in that vein. At this time of the year most
people turn to the hockey playoffs, and comparing Senator
Thompson's introduction, or, more specifically, Bill C-37, to a
hockey game, I can only conclude, honourable senators, that

March 30, 1977

the honourable gentleman scored a penalty shot on an empty
net when the referee did not call for a penalty shot.
The sponsor of the bill, in reply to a question by Senator
Grosart, stated that there was agreement from the provinces.
Far be it from me to question a very definite statement such as
that, but I am left in the difficult situation that I either have to
question Senator Thompson or Premier Lougheed of Alberta. I
would like to quote from a statement in which Premier Lougheed, as president of the premiers' association, summarized the
meetings in these words:
All the provinces are of the view that the proposal is
inadequate, but a number of the provinces felt they were
left with no alternative but to accept it.
Yesterday, Senator Smith described or, perhaps more accurately, referred to Bill C-37 as compulsory federalism. I would
compare it, honourable senators, with Stalin's saying, "Chairman Mao has accepted communism." It is interesting to note
that for the first time the provinces presented a united opposition to the federal proposals. The opposition was not presented
because of Premier Lévesque of Quebec, but rather because
the other nine premiers joined with Premier Lévesque in
presenting opposition to the federal proposals. Honourable
senators, I think this point alone merits consideration.
If you sec me referring to a sheaf of handwritten notes,
forgive me, honourable senators. This morning at breakfast I
told my better half that I was throwing away my prepared
notes, and would make several headings as I listened to the
debate today and speak on them. She said, "Well, that's fine, I
know you enjoy doing that, but don't be as long-winded as you
usually are." I shahl keep looking at my notes and attempt to
delete things as I go along.
If I may return to the idea that there was agreement
between the federal government and the provinces, I have to
say there was no agreement. The provinces entered the final
negotiation-that was the one in December-saying they were
being short-changed by $900 million, and that is not a small
sum, honourable senators. This attitude continued throughout
the conference which was held in what I have in the past
referred to as the third Parliament building-that is, the old
railway station. There was no consensus until the final evening.
The last item left on the agenda was a dinner at the Prime
Minister's residence. During that dinner the Prime Minister, in
what I suppose could be called a poker game between the
provinces and the federal government, upped the ante-that is,
one point personal income tax, plus one point corporate income
tax. I shall have more to say about the corporate income tax
later. After that there was no time, no room, for negotiation; it
was, "Take it or leave it. The conference is over." I think that
the provinces will have more than indigestion following that
meal.
* (1530)

I would remind honourable senators that the clans of MacDonald and Campbell had some misunderstanding following a
banquet, and the bitterness has lasted for years. I hope this is

March 30, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

not the case today. There is enough bitterness and confusion in
Confederation as it is.
There is a myth or falsehood propagated by the federal
government that the provinces, under this new act, are being
more generously treated. We have repeatedly heard government spokesmen refer to the transfers that are going to the
provinces. I sometimes wonder, honourable senators, if the
Liberal government has not studied the Hitler-Goebbels
regime, because they seem to orchestrate everything with all
the skill used by Goebbels.
I should like all honourable senators to have a look at the
charts presented to the House of Commons committee. This
information was asked for by the honourable member for
Kingston and the Islands. The charts must have been prepared
by the same people who prepared the erroneous information
that was conveyed in that multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for the Anti-Inflation Board. I would ask honourable
senators particularly to look at chart 1, which shows the EPS
cash and tax transfer. In the fiscal year 1977-78 this is shown
as $6,460,000,000. Actually they go into all the detail, but in
view of Senator Lang's remarks the other night, I shall limit it
to round figures. In the year 1981-82 it is $10,457,000,000. On
the surface this appears as an increase, as a result of the
transferral of the 13.5 personal income tax points plus one
corporate income tax point.
Honourable senators, what happens if we allow for an
increase in GNP-and the bill ties the transfers to the provinces to GNP-plus inflation? I allowed for a 6 per cent
increase in inflation and a 4 per cent growth in GNP. Perhaps
I was low on inflation and high on GNP, but by compounding
those figures we arrive at a figure of $10,405,000,000-which
is almost identical with chart number 1.
This clearly illustrates that the provinces are not receiving
an indexed transfer over the five-year period. They are essentially tied to the tax transfer of the past year.
I should like to ask the sponsor of the bill what rate of
inflation and growth in the GNP was assumed when those
figures were calculated? It is only fair to compare his alleged
increased transfers to the provinces with other government
expenditures.
Five years ago the cost of servicing the national debt was
$444 for the average taxpayer; last year it was $822 per
average taxpayer, which is almost double. The question then
is: Did the transfers to the provinces double during that
period? They did not.
Both Senator Smith and Senator Hicks have referred to part
VI of the bill. They have both referred to hospitalization and
secondary education, and therefore I shall shorten my
remarks. Before I do so, however, I wish to point out that I
make no apology for equalization, nor do I make any apology
for asking for equalization.
I would illustrate my remarks by referring to a couple of
things in my personal life. Take life insurance premiums. The
corporate income tax of those insurance companies goes to the
province of Quebec. Recently I bought a new car. The corpo-

80003-40/2

rate income tax of the automobile company goes to the
province of Ontario. Without customs regulations and protection I could have bought the same car in the United States for
$600 to $800 less. Therefore, I do not feel that 1, as a
representative of the Atlantic provinces, am asking for any
benefit. I honestly feel I am entitled to it.

•

(1540)

The sponsor of the bill, Senator Thompson, stated that the
transferral of the income tax points plus one corporate income
tax point would give the provinces greater flexibility. I made
some notes as he spoke, and he referred to flexibility, improvement, efficiency and so on. I cannot accept the view of Senator
Thompson that the tax transfer conveys more money to the
have-not provinces. He was honest enough to point out that it
is not really 13.5 tax points that are being transferred; it comes
down to about 9.13, if I remember the figures correctly. For
post-secondary education the provinces already have certain
tax points.
I wonder how someone who is getting less money will be
more efficient, more stable, able to improve standards, and all
the other nonsense that we have heard from the government? I
would just remind honourable senators that last year the
members of the Senate and House of Commons did not receive
a cost-of-living increase. Were we more efficient last year
when we did not receive the increase? If so, I do not think the
members of the Senate or House of Commons, or anyone else,
should have accepted that pay increase this year.
The Prime Minister, in a press release on June 14, 1976,
stated that the tax transfer was a problem; the have-not
provinces would not be able to maintain their present standard
if this was carried out. Yet in December 1976, the Prime
Minister proceeded with that policy, and in late March 1977
we are asked to approve it.
Yesterday Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) asked certain
questions about tax transfer and tax points. I appreciated his
questions very much. I would ask this further question: If it is
possible to transfer tax points without the so-called federal
strings attached, why is it not possible to do the same thing
with cash payments?
On looking at my notes, I am wondering if I missed this
point, which I particularly want to emphasize. A tax point is
not the same in each province. In my own province of Prince
Edward Island a personal income tax point is worth $4; in
Senator Thompson's province it is worth $10. No doubt the
honourable senator would say, "We will equalize them to the
average level." The provinces, in their negotiations presentation wanted this equalized to the level of the highest province.
As Senator Smith asked yesterday: Could someone please
clarify what happens to those below the average line and those
provinces above the average line?
I should point out that five provinces did not agree to or
accept the changes outlined in clause 6 of the bill. Five
provinces out of ten were given until February 15 to agree or
disagree. The five provinces did not agree, and on February 15
the Minister of National Health and Welfare notified those

SENATE DEBATES
five provinces that the federal government was proceeding on
its own. I believe "unilateral action" is the term usually
applied.
If I might digress from the strict context of Bill C-37, I
would point out that we have listened to all sorts of political
theorists who argue that we should or should not repatriate the
Constitution, as the case may be, say there must be some
protection for the provinces. It is all very fine for Mr. Lalonde
to say, "I have the approval of five provinces with the majority
of the population in Confederation." If that is to be the new
scheme, I am not so sure that I will not have doubts about
Confederation.
S(1550)

This point alone makes clause 6 suspicious. It is a retreat
from the basis of equalization. It is one to be watched and
studied very carefully in the future. Again, I fail to see al] the
benefits mentioned by Senator Thompson in his introduction
of this bill yesterday. I am not so sure that I wish Confederation to proceed with the Napoleonic retreat that the government has exhibited in clause 6 of this bill.
Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, I should like to
adjourn the debate.
Senator Grosart: No, there are other speakers.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, if I have permission I
wish to speak now.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
[Translation]
Hon. Martial Asselin: Honourable senators, I had prepared
some notes concerning the substance and the technicalities of
the bill before us but since that work was donc very well by
Senator Smith, Senator Hicks and Senator Phillips, I will put
aside the remarks I had prepared about the bill itself. Rather,
I should like to give you my idea and views on the political
situation that Canada is now going through.
I think that in the month of February-February 18-the
leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons,
speaking about the bill that is before us, summed up the
problem by saying this:
We accept the arrangements which are before us, but we
do not accept the atmosphere which has characterized the
relations between the governments of this country for the
last decade, arrangements of conflict, of confrontation
and of controversy.
And he went on to say:
If we are to retain the strength and the integrity of this
nation, we must restore a sense of co-operation and of
partnership.
Honourable senators, I think that quotation has a very great
significance and that leads me to ask you as well as myself
about the kind of federalism Canada is living now.
First, do we live in a unitarian state whose decision making
powers belong only to the central government? Do we live in a
federalist system in which all components participate in the

March 30, 1977

direction of major decisions both politically and economically?
Or do we face an aggressive, provocative, inflexible federalism
which is now creating and has created in the past that tension
between the provinces and the central government? And what
about that wave of regionalism which is spreading across the
country?
Is that not a strong enough indication to state that Canada
in 1977 will have reached a state of political maturity such
that its constitutional parameters in which we live now are
obsolete, rejected by the majority of the people of Canada?
What we need, I think, in this country now is that breath of
clean air, that new oxygen which would give us a new start and
characterize our evolution in all areas and meet the requirements of a modern country such as Canada is now. That brings
me to some reflections concerning the new Canada we would
all want to build together.
Honourable senators, several people were scandalized and
are still haunted by the results of November 15 last when
Quebec put its faith in the Parti Québécois. You will remember that during the election campaign I rose here in this house
and cautioned honourable senators against a possible result in
favour of the Parti Québécois and I predicted at the time that
the Parti Québécois might get 35 per cent of the electoral vote
on November 15. The final result was 41 per cent. I did not
feel it was a pessimistic prediction because, of course, I have a
rather optimistic frame of mind but I had pondered over the
idea that nationalists in Quebec could one day explode to the
point of electing an "independentist" government, a government whose object is to make Quebec independent. But I
would never have thought that the nationalism to which we
had referred so many times in the past, this Quebec nationalism, would be achieved with so much strength and conviction.
I recall, when I was a young member of the House of
Commons, we often laughed about concepts of equality of the
two cultures, we made a mockery as well of these slogans
relating to two majorities, to a two-nation principle, to the
motion of the two founding nations. We said and repeated to
ourselves: We must ignore these facts or fight them. Some
governments have decided to ignore them, but others have
decided to fight them by confronting, I repeat, by confronting
the provinces with an inflexible, uncompromising and often
aggressive form of federalism. We have seen in the past that
there were numerous meetings with the provinces, always with
the same feeling of frustration. We have seen in the past that
economic decisions were taken unilaterally by the federal
government without consulting the provinces on extremely
important issues. We have seen in the past that they refused on
many occasions to give the province of Quebec the means to
ascertain its own identity in the cultural field and in communications and immigration areas. As a federalist, I think it is a
bad thing for us to remember this fight which French-speaking
Canadians began to wage last summer and are still waging
today because we would like to have not the privilege but the
right to fly aircraft and speak in French whenever we are
flying over the province of Quebec.

March 30, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

I do not wish to dwell on this sad moment of our history
because I am convinced that the attitude taken by some
federalists in this conflict is one of the main reasons which led
Quebecers to act as they did on November 15, 1976, and to
say to themselves: we are tired of fighting for the recognition
of our rights in Quebec. Besides, the gens de l'air are still
facing that same problem. Instead of ruling on this issue, they
simply set up a commission to ascertain whether it was possible to fly an airplane and speak French in Quebec; whether
Quebec pilots or pilots generally could fly over Quebec territory without speaking French. As I said, I believe that is what
caused the deep frustration which Quebecers felt when they
decided to vote for the Parti Québécois on November 15.
We often hear about decentralization. How many times has
it been said that the provinces should have areas under their
exclusive jurisdiction, and instruments, levers which they need
to achieve the goals of their governments. They do not want to
speak about decentralization. Of course after November 15 the
Prime Minister of Canada could not miss the opportunity to
say: "Well, listen, we will be more flexible in future. We will
try to listen more closely to Quebec." But i say that these
statements are, in my opinion, too little and too late.

Provincial priorities have been ignored when the provinces
came here to meet with the federal government at federal-provincial conferences to discuss economic, cultural and political
priorities. In general, provinces have always met with refusals.
However, there has often been talk of constitutional reform.
Yet in 1970 this government decided to establish a joint
committee of the House of Commons and the Senate to study
constitutional reform. This was the Joint Senate and House of
Commons Committee on the Canadian Constitution.
In 1972, this committee submitted a report after visiting all
large centres in Canada, after hearing all organizations interested in this issue and all municipal councils and public
agencies.
The joint committee presented a report and submitted to the
House of Commons an impressive number of recommendations which, in my opinion, were useful and necessary for
Quebecers and Ontarians alike to feel more at home within a
new and revised Constitution. Since this document tabled in
the House of Commons contained, in our opinion, no chapter
on Quebec in the sense that there was no mention of Quebec
within a new Confederation, a new Constitution, Pierre De
Bané, member of Parliament for Matane, and myself, wrote a
minority report to try to inform our colleagues of the House of
Commons and the Senate about the position of Quebec
because, as I said, we believed that this report was incomplete
since it did not deal with the question of Quebec, while the
need for constitutional reform itself was, in our opinion, at the
source of the dissatisfaction of Quebecers. We therefore prepared a minority report at the same time as the majority
report. Of course, we were not allowed to table the minority
report at the same time as the majority report in the House of
Commons. Still the minority report was given relatively wide
distribution throughout Canada.

In this minority report, we also made recommendations
meeting the aspirations of Quebecers. I remember that we
discussed the need for an authentic constitutional reform.
With your permission, I would like to read one or two paragraphs from the report to show how important it was to submit
this report. We said:
Some may claim, through ignorance or to justify themselves, that within the present Constitution Quebec can
act more or less as it pleases within its areas of jurisdiction and that it is up to the province to take care of all the
areas it is entitled to.
Today we can hear federal politicians who will say: Well,
Quebec has all it needs in the Constitution, let it use it, and
then it will be able to meet its aspirations.
This argument, which those who worry about possible
changes may find reassuring, is (in our opinion)
misleading.
We find ourselves in the following situation. On the one
hand, the Quebec community wants to assert itself, find
its identity and operate under the full margin of freedom
it enjoys within the Canadian structure; not only is this
position strong, it is (and I repeat) here to stay. On the
other hand, the basic legislation of our country, the
Constitution, which should set the rules of the game and
to which we should be able to refer in case of conflict, is
out of date, antiquated both in its form and content, and
especially ignorant of the existence of a distinct Quebec
society.
This defect has consequences which we felt last November
15.
e

(1610)

Now, here is the situation. Let us say there is a government
in Quebec composed of Quebecers. One can therefore speak of
constitutional reform. The Prime Minister of Canada has said,
"Yes, I am willing to make constitutional concessions, but as
far as I am concerned, I have nothing more to propose than
what I have already suggested in Victoria, or elsewhere: let the
provinces make their suggestions now." To my mind, that is a
very easy way of trying to solve the problem. Or else, one
adopts another attitude, that of being progressively more
aggressive with the Quebec government. On the other hand,
we hear such things in Quebec as the statements of Mr.
Lévesque, and those of the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr.
Trudeau, who attack each other, striking right and left, believing that the Quebec problem can be solved that way. For my
part, I say that every time a federal leader attacks the Quebec
government, thousands upon thousands of new separatists
spring up in Quebec. To my mind, fighting the Quebec government will never solve the Quebec problem. Unfortunately, that
is what is going on at this time. In addition, some seem to
claim that federalism is the sole responsibility of the present
Prime Minister, who in turn seems to want to make the issue
part of his electoral platform, saying that he alone can save
Canada when in fact it is just as much up to the leader of the

SENATE DEBATES
Conservative Party, the leader of the New Democratic Party,
and each one of us to find solutions to save Canada.
We of the Conservative Party took a more flexible position.
It is not that we were seeking the support of the Quebec
government; we just want to be sincere with Quebecers themselves. We want to tell them that there is at least one political
party in Canada which would like to discuss with them the
claims of their province as far as culture, communications or
immigration are concerned. Furthermore, our leader-I sec
that the government leader seems to deny this, but I would
refer him to the speech which was made when he was lying in
the sun in Mexico. He was far away. He was far from the
Canadian reality. But perhaps we could refresh his memory,
and I shall send him the speech the leader of the Conservative
Party made in Louis-Hébert, where he indeed discussed this
decentralization of powers not only as far as Quebec but also
as far as the other provinces are concerned. Of course, since
the Liberal Party has a major supporter in the person of Mr.
Charles Lynch, staff writer of the Montreal Gazette, I would
refer my honourable friend to Mr. Lynch's critique in which
he says that at least there is a federal party which has some
solutions to propose for Quebec and the other provinces.
Senator Perrault: A short speech!
Senator Asselin: In the March 25, 1977 issue of The
Gazette--of course, Mr. Lynch is a close friend of the Liberals
and perhaps he is going to convince the government leader that
our policy has been accepted by at leastSenator Perrault: You should read what the column said
about your leader.
Senator Asselin: Naturally it is always easy-the government leader is opening a door for me. He says we should read
what is said about our leader. He is opening a door for me. It
is always easy for the Liberals to say after the Conservatives
have chosen their leader, "Well, you know, we would have
chosen somebody else. This one is like this or like that." We
have heard that about Mr. Stanfield. We heard that he had
much flexibility and a lot of judgment. But, listen, he does not
do well on television. You should have another leader. And
now they are telling us that we should have kept Mr. Stanfield,
because, according to them, Mr. Clark cannot cut the mustard. This has always been the approach of the Liberal Party
and that is why they have managed to mislead the Canadian
electorate and stay in power in Ottawa during 40 years. But it
seems to me that the Canadian people do not share the ideas of
the Liberal tacticians.
It is my contention that a policy of confrontation and
aggression towards Quebec is not the way to fulfill the goals
and objectives of a united Canada.
The other day Senator Forsey, for whom I have tremendous
respect, especially when it comes to constitutional law, rightly
said that Quebec would not have the legal right to separate.
Clearly it would not. But if we go on trying to solve constitutional problems on a legalistic basis, we will never succeed.
The current conflict is so deep, so serious, that it must be
solved at the political level, either by granting concessions or

March 30, 1977

by discussions between the parties. I am in total agreement
with Senator Forsey when he says, as he did the other day,
that legally Quebec could not separate. It could not.
Senator Flynn: Neither could Rhodesia.
Senator Asselin: But we must consider political rather than
legalistic solutions.
The constitutional debate should in my view be postponed
momentarily; it should be taken away from politicians because
the attempt now is to focus on one question, to polarize the
issue. There should be a moratorium. We should refer the
issue to experts, people of recognized credibility throughout
the country, who could sit down and start drafting a new
Constitution. I do not know if I make myself clear. What I
would like is that we take the constitutional issue out of the
hands of politicians, that we postpone the debate and refer it to
people with a known expertise in constitutional law, people
who would be viewed across the country as persons of wisdom,
capable of sitting down and discussing objectively the problem
of reviewing the Constitution.
Some people say the issue will be solved when the referendum comes. They say they will beat the referendum. Even if
the referendum were beaten, this would solve nothing. The
problem would remain unchanged. Even if we tried now ail
sorts of policies to convince the Quebec provincial government,
we would be wasting our time. We will never convince the
Quebec government. We must establish decentralization policies to convince the people in Quebec, because in their minds
federalism is something that can be remodelled, adapted. We
must not let them go on thinking we are imposing upon them
some form of straitjacket they no longer accept.
Of course, it is getting late. I would have many more things
to say about this. The government leader already indicated he
intends to establish a Senate committee to sell federalism
throughout Canada. I have the feeling that this formula would
not be the best one, especially if it did not feature some
solutions which the government house leader might have in
mind. Therefore I say it is obviously our duty to deal with
national unity. I have the feeling that we can realize that
national unity, as I said, provided we set up a moratorium and
that we entrust people who believe in Canada and are respected by Canadians with the task of drafting a new Constitution
to meet the needs of all the provinces, and I am not referring
only to Quebec.
I was in Alberta over the last weekend and I heard the
Premier of Alberta, who has claims as well with regard to the
federal government on various points concerning his province.
If I had closed my eyes while listening to Mr. Lougheed, I
would have felt that I was listening to any former premier of
Quebec, because his remarks sounded like those of any
Premier of Quebec claiming more power from Ottawa. I think
he was speaking exactly like the former premiers of Quebec.
Those have been, honourable senators, the remarks I wanted
to make. Obviously, I did not want to take too much of your
time. We will have the opportunity to come back to this
subject. But I wanted to submit for the consideration of this

March 30, 1977

DEBATES
Marc 30,1977SENATE

bouse the reflections 1 had to make concerning the future of
Canada.
* (1620)

[En glish]
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, after the
eloquent speeches we have just been listening to this is almost
certain to be a matter of firing off squibs afier a shower of
meteors. 1 rise merely to draw attention to something that 1
hope will be examined carefully in commiitee, when ibis bill
goes to committee, as 1 assume it will, namely, the exiraordinarily wide discretionary powers it appears to grant. This is
perbaps a sort of déformation professionnelle on my part. 1
look ai ail legislation now with the jaundiced eye of the
co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Regulations and other
Statutory Instruments.
1 went over the bill ibis afiernoon and found that in twentyfour instances we are iold that something will be done "as
determined by the minister"; that a calculation will be made
as determined by the minister." If you look ai page 2, in
clause 3 you will see il says:
-the Minister may pay to a province for each fiscal
yearObserve the word "may" there.
-a fiscal equalization payment not exceeding the amount
compuîed in accordance with section 4.
Parenthetically, I do not know why it sbould be "not exceeding." Eiîher iî is an amount calculaîed in accordance with
section 4 or il is not an amount calculated in accordance with
section 4, and 1 cannot see why this discretion should be there.
Then clause 4 goes on with a very long series of metbods of
calculation, but aIl inîroduced by the words:
-if any, as determined by the Minister.
It goes on over and over again, in spite of aIl the elaborate
provisions made for determining various things, il goes on over
and over again 10 say, "as determined by the Minister." There
may be an adequate reason for this in some, or even aIl, these
instances, but 1 hope the commitîee will look ai that very
carefully.
1 have also noticed three different places wbere the bill says
"in the opinion of the minister." Again there may be a good
reason for that. 1 arn not saying that discreîionary powers
sbould be outlawed. 1 arn saying that they should be very
carefulîy examined.
There are seven cases in which we find "the Minister may,"
or "the Secreiary of State may," or some other minister may
do such-and-such. Again ibis seems 10 me to import a very
wide discreîionary power into the bill, 10 place a very wide
discreîionary power in the hands of the government of the day,
or more probably in fadt the permanent officiaIs in the department or deparîments concerned.
I therefore hope the committee, when il examines the bill,
will îry 10 secure from the minister or bis officiaIs somne
indication of why these apparently very wide discretionary

powers are required, and also some indication of how îbey are
likely to be exercised.
In making these few fooînoîe-like remarks, I do not wish 10
be taken as dissenting from anything that bas been said by
other speakers. Tbougb I did not hear the whole of Senator
Hicks' speech, I entirely agreed with aIl ibat I heard. 1 don't
think 1 can subscribe to aIl that bas been said by Senator
Asselin, or perhaps by Senator Phillips. I shahl wanî to read
their speeches very carefully before committing myseîf.
Indeed, 1 îhink there are quite a number of points that I sbould
find myself in disagreement with in ai leasi Senator Asselin's
speech.
1 may perbaps add in that regard that 1 do not think wben I
discussed the other malter he referred 10 the other day I
suggested that this wbole problem of national unity could be
settîed, would be settled, or should be settled purely on a legal
basis. I was setting oui certain legal considerations, whicb
seemed 10 me 10 be relevant 10 the subjeci, witbout prejudice
to the enormous political problems, some of whicb 1 tried 10
sketch, which wouîd arise.
I should also like 10 observe 10 Senator Phillips, wbo I arn
sorry is not here to bear il, that 1 think be was a littîe severe in
saying be was surprised wben supporters of the government
rose 10 comment on a government bill, and he noticed that
they were unlikely 10 turn up when a vote came. I îhink if
Senator Phillips will examine my record he wiîl see that on
several occasions I bave put my vote where my mouth was.
Indeed, Iess than 48 bours ago 1 made a motion in Committee
of the Whole, as some honourable senators will recaîl. wbicb
was decidedly hostile to the government. 1 was, of course,
licked to a shoestring, as 1 habitually arn. I migbî add ibat 1
got not very strong and enthusiastic support from the members
of the Conservative Party in this bouse, with the single exception of Senator Smith (Colchester). The others may have been
supporting me but tbey were rather piano where Senator
Smith was forte, if not fortissimo. 1 was a litîle disappointed
ihat wben 1 stuck my neck out againsi the government on
sometbing 1 described as scandalous, iniquitous, outrageous
and subversive of parliamentary government 1 did not hear
some sîronger echoes from the Conservative Party than 1 did.
0f course, we got the echo from Senator Smith (Colchester)
both that evening and the next day.
1 want 10 suggest that Senator Phillips was perhaps a little
bit over-stating the case wben he intimated that members of
the government side criticized government measures but were
reluctant 10 come up 10 scratch, and were perhaps notably
conspicuous by their absence when il came 10 a vote.
Senator Phillips: Senator Forsey referred to the so-called
P.C. attitude the other night. Since we were not allowed 10
stand and vote or be counted, how could we do anything else
but give voice support 10 you?
Senator Forsey: 1 amn sorry, I did not hear that. How could
you what?
Senator Phillips: Do anything else but give voice support 10

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Benidickson: We didn't sec you stand.
Senator Forsey: The voices were rather muted, I think.
However, this may be simply the fault of my poor hearing.
Senator Flynn: Is Senator Forsey sure that he is considered
as a member of the Liberal Party?
Senator Forsey: I leave that question to be decided by the
Leader of the Government or the deputy leader-I have some
doubts about what his answer would be-and the chief whip.
Senator Perrault: The party is blessed with democracy.
Hon. Andrew E. Thompson: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I wish to inform honourable senators
that if the Honourable Senator Thompson speaks now his
speech will have the effect of closing the debate on the motion
for second reading of this bill.
Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, I should like to
thank all the speakers who have followed me for their very
thoughtful and penetrating remarks, and the range that this
debate took. I congratulate Senator Asselin for taking, not just
the bare bones of statistics, and so on, but raising our eyes up
to the full purpose of our country and calling for action in
connection with the Constitution, and the approach that we
must take in understanding every part of the country. May I
say, first, to Senator Smith that I appreciate his kindness to
me. I was a very mediocre boxer away back, and I always
recognized the fact when I got into the ring with a pro. You
were kind, sir, and I appreciate it.

(1630)

I am inclined very much to agree with Senator Smith
concerning the complexity of the statistics and terminology. I
have a cold, and I spent the weekend striving to understand the
bill. I would say this in fairness, that when I met with the
officials of the department I realized how very stupid I was in
some areas. That condition is mine, and I know it is certainly
not that of Senator Smith, but I am sure that in the committee
to which this bill will be referred we will receive clarification
from the officials.
Senator Phillips: You are exaggerating.
Senator Smith (Colchester): May I ask the honourable
senator if he would consider the possibility that the stupidity
was not his?
Senator Thompson: I sometimes like to consider that possibility, Senator Smith.
Senator Grosart: Don't we all?
Senator Thompson: Again, I am very much in sympathy
with the next question raised by Senator Smith. I am concerned with respect to the federal-provincial negotiations that
go on. Indeed, a member of Parliament described the fait
accompli to which both Senator Phillips and Senator Smith
referred by saying, "What a federal-provincial conference has
joined together Parlianent could not capriciously rend asunder." Yet looking at the situation, surely it is the object of

March 30, 1977

government to present and to propose, and it is up to Parliament to dispose.
Senator Flynn: And to impose.
Senator Thompson: I was referring to Jennings when I made
the quote.
May I say in connection with this that the Prime Minister
did table his proposal of June 14. In that statement be outlined
the principles in his proposal. Both he and the Minister of
Finance spoke publicly on these principles, and the detailed
nuts and bolts were contained in what is termed, in rather
lyrical language, a lilac book which was tabled also in the
House of Commons and in the Senate. The Minister of
Finance, who was questioned on the very point that Senator
Smith made, said that really he was in a difficult situation.
The proposals had to start somewhere. If they had had
detailed debate in Parliament prior to going to the provinces,
then the provinces would have objected and said, "This is a
fait accompli." They felt, therefore, that a logical approach in
connection with this would be that there begin discussion
between the level of the provincial governments and the federal government prior to coming here. In my opinion, there is a
very important point, which has not been raised-I am sorry;
Senator Smith (Colchester) did raise this-and that is the
opening up of the federal-provincial conferences to more
scrutiny by the public, as well as by all sides of the political
arena.
When I was leader of the opposition in the Legislature of
Ontario I was always asking and hoping to be included in some
of these federal-provincial negotiations. In fairness, I will say
that Premier Robarts opened up his Confederation of Tomorrow, and it was televised. I agree with Senator Smith that if
there was this drama that we saw it would show the country
where there has been compromise on the part of the provinces
and on the part of the federal government.
As to the question which was swung at me by Senator
Grosart, may I put him in the same category as I put Senator
Smith with respect to my boxing days? I sensed at once that
there was some political implication in connection with his
question. He narrowed me down so that I had to say yes or no
to the question: Did the provinces agree? I rely on his interpretation, Senator Grosart being a Shakespearean scholar and a
very literate man who knows that "agree" comes from the
Latin gratum and can mean "to concur with." So in that
narrow term I reply that they did concur with this. However, I
would be naive if I were to suggest that the provincial leaders
would leave such negotiations and not return to their provinces
and posture in connection with the hard fight they had. I think
that is part of the game. It is a shopping bag. As one of the
members of Parliament said, "We have the pie, and certain
parties want it cut up proportionately." Of course, when they
go back they express the opinion that they are not satisfied
with their share.
The revenue equalization was raised, I believe, by Senator
Smith as being a sensitive area-I believe you did mention
that, did you not, Senator Smith?

March 30, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Smith (Colchester): Yes.
Senator Thompson: If I could just express the point of view
of the federal government with respect to that-and I am sure
Senator Smith will recall this-it was a unilateral understanding to make up adjustments with the reform of tax laws of
1971-72. It was clearly indicated that it was a transitional
program, and it was extended thus through the budgets right
up until 1976. It was always a unilateral approach with respect
to the federal government's extending this agreement because
of the adjustments which might be made to the provinces in
connection with the tax reform. The federal government had to
come to the point, they felt, at which this should be stopped.
Of course, the provinces objected to this, and again there was a
compromise in which there was an agreement to split the
differçnces. This may not be agreeable to the provinces and
they are fighting, as they should, for their constituencies, but
the federal government had also to be realistic.
I certainly do not wish to suggest what Senator Forsey is
thinking, but on reading again an article by Charles Lynch I
notice that there is some concern with respect to the strength
of the federal government if it is constantly going to hand over
and decentralize. Yet this is the dilemma of a confederation
where-referring to the very eloquent speech of Senator Asselin and, on the other hand, looking toward Senator Hicksthere is a situation such as that in which Senator Hicks asks
for a federal presence in education. Of course that creates a
dilemma.
I would say with respect to that, Senator Hicks, that there
is, of course, the informal method through the Council of
Ministers which met in Halifax a number of months ago, and I
am sure you are quite aware that John Roberts, the Secretary
of State of Canada, was invited to it, and he felt that there was
a spirit of cooperation. They were considering two areas,
Senator Asselin, as I understand it. One was the bilingual
programs throughout Canada. Another, as I understand it, was
a question in which Senator Hicks would be interested, that of
mobility among students across the country. That was of
concern to the ministers, and allow me to emphasize that the
federal minister said that it is the prerogative of the provinces.
He is invited to attend; he is not automatically a member.
Senator Phillips went back to the fait accompli, and I have
tried my best to answer that point. It certainly is a dilemma,
and I am sympathetic to the points he made. He asked me
whether the provinces had gone for an equalization formula. I
could go through a number of things which the provinces did
accept, but I do not wish to get into all the detail on thatSenator Phillips: It is embarrassing, is it not?
Senator Thompson: However, I wish to say, because you are
concerned in connection with your own province, for which you
speak with great vigour and much compassion, something
about the equalization program.
Let me take the equalization formula B and the per capita
entitlements under the EPF-which is the established programs financing-and compare the current arrangements with
regard to medical care, hospital care and post-secondary edu-

80003-41

cation with what provinces will be entitled to with the new
formula. In the current year-I shall take Prince Edward
Island because of Senator Phillips' being a great and noble
Prince Edward Islander, and perhaps compare it with Ontario.
I do this for another reason, that being that Prince Edward
Island has the smallest population and Ontario the largest.
The difference on a per capita basis would have been $40.95 in
favour of Ontario if the existing equalization program continued. As a result of the EPF in the first year of the program
that disparity will be reduced to $30.75. If we carried that on
to 1981-82 under current arrangements this disparity would
have risen to $57.30, but under the new program the disparity
wiIl be $5.89. So I think that equalization is very much at
work, and, as so many senators emphasized, it should be at
work and it must be maintained. This new program, I think,
will be more effective.
* (1640)

Senator Phillips: Equalization, but there is still disparity.
Senator Thompson: I accept that. The net aggregate gain
for all the provinces under EPF in the year 1981-82 is $1,718
million, and I think that is one of the reasons why the
provinces accepted it, with reservations, and I am sure there
will be different interpretations across the country, as there are
in this house, according to their enthusiasm in accepting it.
Senator Flynn: May I ask the honourable senator, when he
speaks of the acceptance of the provinces, what form this
acceptance took?
Senator Thompson: I could go through each section that was
acceptable.
Senator Flynn: I am simply asking: What form does the
acceptance by the provinces take? Do you have a document by
the provinces saying that they accept it? Do you have a piece
of legislation? Do you have an order in council? Do you have
any document which shows this?
Senator Thompson: Let me say there have been statements
on the discussions and negotiations between the first ministers,
the prime minister and the appropriate other ministers, and I
do have a statement by the Minister of Finance in the other
place.
May I say with respect to Senator Asselin that I was deeply
moved by the eloquence of his speech, and I think he brought a
completely new dimension which was well worth having into
the discussion.
Perhaps I could now turn to Senator Forsey. Of course, all
of us are completely behind him in his study of discretionary
powers, and his enthusiasm and drive to see that these are
curtailed as much as possible. He had asked what reason
might be given for wanting regulations-I won't go into the
discretionary power, but the need for regulations-and as I
understand from this black book, the reason given by the
department-I don't know if it is all that satisfactory, but I am
sure we will have the opportunity to question officials at the
appropriate time-is:

SENATE DEBATES
In explaining the extensive use of regulations it might
be noted that this is not a new development.
We ail know that.
The reason for the use of regulations is to define highly
technical concepts which may run to many pages in length
to set out complex procedures relating, for example, to the
scheduling of interim paymentsI don't want to read any more of those complex concepts
because I am sure Senator Smith wili ask me to explain them
myself.
-and to delineate other matters of technical detail for
use of legislation will be difficult and tend to give the
legislation excessive rigidity in areas where it is not
needed.
They go on to add this, Senator Forsey:
You might also note that it has been customary in the
past to have careful discussions with the provinces prior to
referring regulations to the Governor-in-Council. It is
planned to repeat this procedure this year before new
regulations are promulgated.
Senator Forsey: May I interrupt Senator Thompson to say
that I didn't say anything about regulations. I might have
made reference to that, but I didn't.
Senator Thompson: I am sure at some point you will be
saying something about regulations, Senator Forsey.
Honourable senators, before there are opportunities for
others, in view of the lateness of the hour, may I again thank
ail who contributed so much to this debate. I say to Senator
Smith, who was the lead-off critic-and I pick him out as
representing ail the others-that I learned a great deal from
his contribution.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Thompson, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Carter, that this bill be now read the second time. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?
Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, I move that the
bill be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, it is certainly not very appropriate for me, a very junior senator, to
raise this point, but there is a Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs, and if ever I heard of anything that
dealt with legal and constitutional affairs, it must be this. I see
a lot of wagging of heads, but can you tell me why this does
not deal with legal and constitutional affairs? What does it
have to do with banking, trade and commerce?
Senator Langlois: lonourable senators, if I may be allowed
to add a word of explanation in this respect, it has always been

March 30, 1977

the practice to send bills of this nature to the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce because they
are related to taxation, which is one of the orders of reference
to that committee, and it is the only one to have such an order
of reference.
Senator Smith (Colchester): As I say, I am a very junior
senator and I must not take too much umbrage at long-established traditions, but I must say again that if ever I heard of
anything that dealt with legal and constitutional affairs it is a
bill which deals with the fiscal arrangements between the
federal government and the provincial governments. While I
don't wish to make any point of it, as a newcomer here I
accept the traditions but I do so very much like some of the
premiers accept the provisions of this legislation.
Senator Langlois: I should like to quote from rule 67(k):
(k) The Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, composed of twenty members, five of whom shall
constitute a quorum, to which shall be referred, if there is
a motion to that effect, bills, messages, petitions, inquiries, papers and other matters relating to banking,
trade and commerce generally, including:
(i) banking, insurance, trust and loan companies, credit
societies, caisses populaires and small loans companies;
(ii) customs and excise;
(iii) taxation legislation;
(iv) patents and royalties;
(v) corporate and consumer affairs;
(vi) bankruptcy;
(vii) natural resources and mines.
Senator Smith (Colchester): May I rise again on a point of
order. I can read rules too. I can read the rule on page 18
which says:
(j) The Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs, composed of twenty members, five of whorm shall
constitute a quorum, to which shall be referred, if there is
a motion to that effect, bills, messages, petitions, inquiries, papers and other matters relating to legal and
constitutional matters generally, including:
(i) federal-provincial relations;
Now where could anything be more intimately concerned with
federal-provincial relations than this bill? I belong to both
committees and, consequently, it is of no real moment to me
where I make my arguments. I guess that I am more used to
making them in the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee than elsewhere, but it does seem strange that this bill
would go to that committee.

e

(1650)

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, occasions often
arise when a portion of the subject matter of a bill may indeed
relate to an area such as, in this case, federal-provincial
relations. The main areas in the measure before us certainly
relate to a division of revenues between federal and provincial
governments, and also taxation, and it is simply a matter of

SENATE DEBATES

March 30, 1977

judgment on the part of the sponsor of the bill as to where it
should be referred.
Senator Smith (Colchester): It is no wonder to me that the
judgment is very, very bad indeed, if that is the way it looks in
this bill.
Senator Grosart: I wonder if I could ask the Leader of the
Government if he would reconsider what he has just said?
Surely nothing is clearer than that the first responsibility, the
number one responsibility, of the Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee is federal-provincial relations. I ask the
Leader of the Government: Is that not the substance of this
bill, the very substance of the bill? Is it not federal-provincial
relations? Will he say that it is not?
Senator Perrault: I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there are many precedents for the motion of Senator
Thompson that this bill be referred to the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. There are
ample precedents. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, with
his vast experience, is aware of those precedents.
Senator Grosart: We have discussed precedents here before,
and I would ask the Leader of the Government, in view of the
distinct statement in our rules that any bill dealing with
federal-provincial relations shall go to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, if he will not consider that a precedent may have been wrong? We have had wrong precedents
for years but that has nothing to do with the decision in this
case. This is a matter that, in my opinion, should be ruled on
by the Speaker. I will leave it to the Leader of the Opposition
as to whether he wishes to go that far.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Very prophetic.
Senator Flynn: If the Leader of the Government will tell us
that he is sending this bill to the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee because the Chairman of the Legal and
Constitutional Affairs Commitee is not here, then that might
be considered a good reason. But, certainly, from the text of
our rules, this is a question that should go to the Legal and
Constitutional Affairs Committee. This bill does not impose
any tax; it merely transfers to provincial governments taxes
which have been collected under other legislation without, as I
can see, the provincial legislatures having any say in the
matter.
Senator Perrault: It relates to economics and a sharing of
tax points and finance.
Senator Flynn: Not at all. I should like the Leader of the
Government to give me a valid excuse not to follow the rule,
and I shall be quite happy to accommodate him. I ask him to
give me an excuse not to interpret the rule as I have. It would
be a precedent if he were to interpret the rule in the way that
he has.
Senator Langlois: It has been done in the past.
Senator Flynn: It may have been done in the past. This
debate on legislation goes back five years and, if h am correct,
our rules are more recent. They were revised only two years
ago.

Senator Langlois: There was no change in this.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I say that
apart from the fact that referral of this bill is a discretionary
matter because it involves the responsibilities of more than one
committee, there is the fact that the Chairman of the Legal
and Constitutional Affairs Committee is unwell at the present
time and unable to act in his capacity as chairman. In addition, honourable senators have the utmost confidence in the
capacity of the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee to
make a fair and judicious judgments on the contents of this
bill.
Senator Flynn: Do not bring that into it.
Senator Perrault: I am on my feet, and I hope the Leader of
the Opposition will restrain his emotions and remain seated
while I am standing. The Leader of the Opposition is a
member of the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee and
I know he has the utmost respect for the chairman of that
committee and for its members. I am sure there is no disagreement among us that that committee is totally capable of doing
an excellent job of analysis, and of acting in the highest
traditions of the Senate.
Senator Flynn: There is a word for that, but it is not
parliamentary language.
Senator Grosart: May I ask the Leader of the Government
if he is not being unfair when he implies it has anything to do
with the competence of any committee when we follow our
rules. The short title of the bill is the Federal-Provincial Fiscal
Arrangements and Established Programs Financing Act, 1977,
and the first responsibility of the Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee is federal-provincial relations. What could
be a clearer statement? In my opinion, we should have a ruling
from the Speaker.
Senator Perrault: It is the decision of the members of this
chamber as to which committee this bill shall be referred.
Senator Langlois: It is referred by a motion adopted by the
house.
Senator Perrault: I can recall, and our records will show an
instance during the first session of this Parliament, where a bill
could have been referred to either the National Finance Committee or the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, but
the Senate's decision was to refer it to the National Finance
Committee. Honourable senators opposite are being unduly
meticulous on this particular point, which seems to be made
for debating purposes and not for the efficient consideration of
this measure.
Senator Grosart: May I ask the Leader of the Government
if he does not think it improper to impute motives? If those of
us on this side of the house feel there is a rule, and that the
rule should be followed, that is as far as it goes. I resentSenator Perrault: The last thing I would do is impute
motives.
Senator Grosart: The Leader of the Government imputed a
motive. It is quite proper, when a motion is put, for a senator
to rise on a point of order to ask if the motion is in order. That

SENATE DEBATES
surely is the essence of any rules in a chamber such as this. 1
do flot wish to give the Leader of the Government a lesson on
the rules, but 1 arn afraid there are times whcn he needs it.
Senator Perrault- No one on this side is challenging the
right of the opposition to ask whether this motion is in order.
Senator Grosart: You did challenge it.
Senator Hicks: Honourable senators, 1 wish to make a point
which I think some of those who have participated in this
discussion have overlooked. Our rules do not require that this
bill be referred to cither one of those committees. A case could
be made for referring the bill to the National Finance Committee. It would be improper for us to ask the Speaker to rule
on the issue. What my honourable friends have forgotten is
that in the preamble to the rule respecting the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and following the
words -to which shall be referred," are the words "if there is a
motion to that eftect." No one denies that aspects of federalprovincial relations are involved in this legislation. However,
the rule respecting the Senate Committee on Banking. Trade
and Commerce has exactly the same wording, "to which shall
be referred, if there is a motion to that effect," and among the
matters that are related there is "taxation legisiation", and
some other headings to which this bill is relevant.
It is a matter of judgment or discretion on the part of this
house. Those who say it would bc more appropriate to refer the
bill to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee are on
sound ground, but 1 do not think they can invoke the rules of
this house to require a senator to move a motion to that effect.
Senator Grosart: Mvay I ask the honourable senator if he has
ever heard of a point of order that was not a question of
judgment?
Senator Flynn: The position of the Leader of the Government can't be very sound if Senator Hicks had to corne to his
rescue. The question before the house is to refer the matter to
the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee. An amendment can be made to strike out "Standing Senate Commitxee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce" and substitute therefor the
words "Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs". But since the Chairman of the Legal and
Constitutional Affairs Committee is not present, and since the
Leader of the Government has admitted that that is his main
reason for choosing the committee he has, this initiative should
not be considered a precedent. ln those circumstances, we
would be prepared Io agree. If he is willing to admit that it is
only becausc of these special circumstances that he has made
the choice of committee he has, we will agree that this bill be
sent to the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee.
* (1700)

Senator Grosart: The Leader of the Opposition is being
flexible.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, there is no inclination to admit anything on this side.
Senator Flynn: I know that.

March 30, 1977
Mrh3,17

Senator Perrault: Let me finish my statement. It is not a
matter of admitting or conceding anything. It is a matter of
intelligently attempting to refer this measure to the appropriate committee.
Senator Grosart: Don't make it worse. The Leader of the
Opposition is being flexible.
Senator Perrault: Senator Hicks explained exactly what the
situation is. There arc indeed more than two committees to
which this bill could be referrcd without any damage being
done to our rules or to the parliamentary system.
I suggest, honourable senators, that we proceed to vote on
this matter in our usual democratie way.
Senator Grosart: The Leader of the Opposition has given
you a way out. Why don't you take it?
Senator Flynn: If there is no inclination to make any
admissions, 1 will move in amendment that the words -Banking, Trade and Commerce" be replaced by the words "Legal
and Constitutional Affairs."
Senator Smiith (Colchester): I will second that motion.
Senator Neiman: Senator Hicks made two points that 1 had
intended to make. In my vicw, 1 do not believe that this
proposed legislation deals essentially with problems of the
Constitution; it deals with taxation. Perhaps 1 could just rcad
some headings from the bill itself. Part IV is headed:
Provincial Personal Income Tax Revenue Guarantee
Payments.
Part V is headed:
Transfer Payments with respect to Tax on 1971 Undistributed Income on Hand.
Part VI is headed:
Established Programs Financing.
The essential elements of this bill have to do with taxation, and
1 think it is very properly being placed before the committee
that should deal with it.
Senator Flynn: It is now. That is very convincing.
Senator Phillips: Honourable senators, I would point out
that the taxation of which Senator Neiman speaks is a tax
transfer to the provinces. The provinces are given the right to
do the taxing, not the federal government. Therefore, 1 have to
reject Senator Neiman's argument.
Sonie Hon. Senators: Question.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Excuse me, honourable senators, but this is a debatable motion.
Senator Perrault: Has it been duly moved and seconded?
Senator Smnith (Colchester): Yes, it was moved and 1
seconded it.
Senator Phillips: That is a matter for Madam Speaker, not
for you, Senator Perrault.
Senator Langlois: It has not been put yet.

March 30, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Perrault: No, it has not been put, and it is hardly an
amendment.
Senator Flynn: It is an amendment. Now I suppose you say
it is a matter of judgment.
Senator Langlois: It is a negation.
Senator Perrault: You know, honourable senators, these are
parliamentary fun and games, because the effect of the
amendment is to negate the original motion, and the Leader of
the Opposition is aware of that.
Senator Grosart: But surely the Leader of the Government
is aware that the motion is to referSenator Langlois: Madam Speaker is on her feet.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Flynn, P.C., seconded by the Honourable Senator
Smith (Colchester), that the motion be amended by striking
out the words "Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee"
and substituting therefor the words "Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee."
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion
in amendment? Those in favour of the motion in amendment
say 'yea."
Senator Smith (Colchester): This is a debatable motionSenator Langlois: The Speaker is on her feet.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I am claiming my right to
speak.
Senator Flynn: On the amendment.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Yes, on the amendment. I
believe I have that right. This is a debatable motion and any
honourable senator bas the right to speak to it. It is pretty
hard to tell what the Leader of the Government is doing when
he wags his head. I thought he was saying I could not speak.
Senator Perrault: It must have been the palsy, because I did
not shake my head.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I thought he was indicating I
did not have the right to speak. I did not second this motion in
a capricious desire to have fun and games, to use the words of
the Leader of the Opposition. I did so because I thought the
only protection of the opposition in this house, aside from the
good will of honourable senators generally, which is nearly
always forthcoming, was the rules. That is what our rules are
for, plus, of course, the object of furthering the orderly conduct of business in the house. It may well be that traditionally
this kind of legislation should go to some other committee, but
it seems to me very difficult to look at the words in the rules
relating to the two committees and come to any other conclusion than that which has been put forward by honourable
senators on this side of the house.
It has been pointed out several times by my colleagues, as
well as by myself, that reference should be made in these cases
to rule 67 to see the detailed reference. Paragraph (j) says:
The Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs, composed of twenty members, five of whom shall

constitute a quorum, to which shall be referred, if there is
a motion to that effect, bills, messages, petitions, inquiries, papers and other matters relating to legal and
constitutional matters generally, includingThe very first item is:
(i) federal-provincial relations.
Paragraph (k) says:
The Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, composed of twenty members, five of whom shall
constitute a quorum, to which shall be referred, if there is
a motion to that effect, bills, messages, petitions, inquiries, papers and other matters relating to banking,
trade and commerce generally, includingSurely that is the governing phrase, the phrase which governs
all the rest. Then it says:
(i) banking, insurance, trust and loan companies, credit
societies, caisses populaires and small loans companies.
That is the first responsibility. It goes on:
(ii) customs and excise;
(iii) taxation legislation.
I suggest that there are two very important things to note here.
One is that in the reference to the Standing Senate Committee
on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the words "federal provincial relations" constitute the number one item, and the
governing clause before the detailed items is:
-matters
relating to legal and constitutional matters
generallySurely that is the clause governing the duties of that committee. All the other matters detailed therein must be related to
that general clause. When we turn to the rule governing the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee we see the general
clause is:
-matters relating to banking, trade and commerce generallyI suggest again that the matters detailed there relate to
banking, trade and commerce generally. What is the predominant content of this bill? Is it a matter relating to banking,
trade and commerce generally? Who can say that? Or is it
"matters relating to legal and constitutional matters generally"? Surely it is impossible for anyone to say-and I assert this
not as any simple, lightly assumed argumentative stance, but
as a matter of careful consideration of the words in question.
0

(1710)

Who can say that the real substance matter-the pith and
substance I believe are the words used in the courts on
constitutional matters-who can say that the pith and substance of this bill is not legal and constitutional matters
generally but is banking, trade and commerce generally? Who
can say that? What court would sustain such an argument?
This is a court, the high court of Parliament. Are we really to
take these rules seriously, except when everyone agrees not
to-which is a frequent practice which facilitates the business
of the house-or are we to take them seriously when they are
seriously raised as a guide to a course to be followed?

undoubtedly whether the meeting was one chaired by Senator
Hayden or another by Senator Goldenberg, I feel that fine
work would have been performed in any case, as it was this
morning.
In committee this morning I had the opportunity to wander,
along with the other members, in the maze of tax relations
between Ottawa and the provinces. It was quite a journey, I
can assure you. I would bet that not one senator out of ten or
one member out of ten had read the bill in the first place, or
that if he did he was able to understand it adequately. However, the proceedings of the committee enabled us, let us say,
to see through this complex area of the legislation, and the
experience was quite valuable.
The second thing I want to mention is that it is interesting to
study that cobweb which is indeed the system of tax relations
between the federal government and the provinces as established since 1940 by the federal government on the ground
that a war was on. Of course, that was when the federal
goveriment said to the provinces: Give us your tax fields for
the war period and we will hand you back a certain amount
which will allow you to meet your expenditures and your
obligations. But, after the war, naturally the situation
changed. The federal government having stuck its nose in that
field, having reaped all its advantages, did not want to withdraw from it; that is when it started to spin its web. During the
war we were in a straitjacket. Then the federal government
wove its spider's web. Gradually it introduced itself into all
sorts of fields through the powers of taxation which traditionally, if not constitutionally, belonged to the provinces. As you
doubtless remember, this was done through a series of steps
which I shall recall briefly.
First, the federal government, having taken over the powers
of taxation, told the provinces: Why not let us levy your taxes?
We will give you part of the proceeds and you can meet your
obligations without having to suffer the odium of taxing your
people yourselves. That sounded very tempting to provincial
governments or legislative assemblies: You will not have that
responsibility; let us take that burden away from you; you will
still have a minimum of advantages. It started thus and
continued to the day when the Province of Quebec kicked up a
fuss and decided, very courageously at that time, to levy
personal income tax at the risk of having, if not double
taxation-because the word means two things, if not three-at
least additional taxation. The federal government would have
said at that time, to maintain its position: Agreed, up to 10 per
cent-until then it had been 5 per cent-we will allow you, the
provinces, the choice of collecting your own provincial income
tax, and so it went. That was something. It was a minor
concession. But, as the other provinces followed suit, and said
to the federal government: "We cannot accept much longer
your spider's web, or your straitjacket," as the case may have
been, the federal government came up with the equalization
formula, which I think is excellent, of course. Even Mr.
Duplessis, who was so much against the system prevailing at
the time, had to admit that it was a step in the right direction.
The equalization principle is excellent because it tends to

reduce regional disparities by saying: We, the federal government, shall collect taxes from all Canadian taxpayers and we
shall then redistribute these taxes on a more equitable basis to
maintain a level of services which will be more acceptable and
as uniform as possible throughout the country. This is an
excellent formula.
* (1420)

Senator Langlois: It is distributive justice.
Senator Flynn: Of course, it is distributive justice, which is
what we want in Parliament. But there is often quite a way to
go between wanting it and finding it.
Senator Langlois: Nothing is perfect in this world.
Senator Flynn: You are right, and I would add: especially in
a country that has been under the administration of the
Liberal Party for too long.
Senator Langlois: Vox populi, vox dei.
Senator Flynn: But vox populi is as blind as fate. Fate has
been very good to the Liberals, who have indeed helped it
along in a sometimes rather doubtful manner from an ethical
point of view. But I will not pursue this; I would not like to
hurt the feelings of my friend, Senator Azellus Denis. He was
one of the main beneficiaries of the Liberal strategy in
Quebec. He succeeded in getting elected, against any hope, for
I do not know how many years. The same could perhaps be
said about Senator Fournier (De Lanaudière).
Senator Denis: That is because we wereSenator Flynn: We were perhaps too honest.
Senator Langlois: I like the "perhaps".
Senator Flynn: In any case, as my friend Senator Langlois
knows, I am always very flexible. I do not like absolute terms.
I do not believe in absolute terms, especially in politics.
Senator Denis: Let others speak about your honesty.
Senator Flynn: Let othersSenator Denis: Speak about your honesty.
Senator Flynn: Certainly. But you speak so seldom that it
would be useless to leave it up to you.
Senator Denis: That is because I hear you too often.
Senator Flynn: Yes, in general, I would much rather speak
than listen to you.
So I come back to the equalization formula. It allowed
indeed the federal government to maintain its spider's web. It
had ample revenues on a continuing basis, so it urged the
provinces to enter into programs under their own jurisdiction,
such as hospital care, medicare and the like. The government
said to the provinces: With my revenues you can get into that
on a universal basis, with comparable benefits in every province and I will pay 50 per cent of the cost. So we got into that;
there was little choice left to the provinces but to do so. There
is nothing wrong with that per se but the fact is that the
federal government, when it urged the provinces to embark on
this, was controlling once more their actions in addition to

SENATE DEBATES
upsetting their priorities in a number of areas. So we had such
a double system, because you will remember that the transfer
system was intended to bring some general degree of uniformity in services under provincial jurisdiction.
But hospital care, medicare and now post-secondary education all are matters of provincial responsibility. Those were
services they were forced to provide. Normally the equalization formula should have covered all that. But the government
pushed the provinces into that on a universal or comparable
basis. It lured them with revenues that probably came once
more from sources of traditionally provincial jurisdiction.
And the government went on to create the situation we are
now faced with. Some will say that the provinces agreed. But
the whole system of fiscal relations between the federal government and the provinces is aimed at controlling them, at
taking responsibilities away from them so the central government can keep some leverage and a certain type of control in
particular. The provinces are told: If you do not agree, then all
you have to do is levy those taxes you need. What can the
provinces say? They are forced to accept. Senator Thompson
indicated that the provinces agreed. Can they really afford to
say no, in the context of the history since 1940 that I have
been referring to? Indeed, as I indicated yesterday, they do not
even say yes. There is no contract between the central government and the provinces on this. No agreements were signed.
The federal government, after hearing their complaints and
objections, told the provinces: Well, that is that. So finally it is
a question of taking or leaving it. The provinces said: What
can we do but take it?
Senator Langlois: There is also the opting out alternative.
Senator Flynn: Opting out is an extension. Those are other
concessions I could refer to. Opting out is not a bad thing, of
course, but it is also intended to give the central government a
certain degree of control, the spider's web that was put in
place. The web is there, and the provinces are not willing to get
out, especially the poorer, less affluent ones.
Senator Denis: The Diefenbaker administration did not
touch it.
Senator Flynn: It touched it, indeed, because the opting out
mentioned by my knowledgeable friend is a formula proposed
by the Diefenbaker administration.
Senator Denis: You say it is not worth anything.
Senator Flynn: I only say that in that regard the position of
the Conservative government between 1957 and 1963 was
much more flexible because we dealt with many problems,
including that of grants to universities and many others.
But I do not wish to make it into an anti-Liberal thesis. I am
against an omnipresent central government trying to assume
responsibilities which are not under its jurisdiction. It is only in
that respect that I mention the matter.
Then, I suggest that the only item in those fiscal agreements
which is of real value and which is really based on the
Constitution is the equalization system. All other concepts have
changed the essence of the Constitution without changing its

March 31, 1977

letter. The only valid principle which rests on a constitutional
foundation is the equalization system. Furthermore, I do not
see why eventually we could not solve all problems related to
regional and provincial disparities with one formula, that of
equalization payments. It is difficult to define a formula and
all factors that have to be considered. Still it is not impossible.
Far from it. Of course, the maze is there because we must
define in precise terms extremely complex formulas.
It was mentioned in committee this morning, following the
comments of our legal counsel, that this time mathematical
formulas were used which gave a clearer picture and, instead
of a whole page of text, with a mathematical formula we could
see in two or three lines exactly what was the situation. I say
that equalization, as a principle, is the only valid aspect in
fiscal relations between Ottawa and the provinces and it
should be improved to allow the provinces to meet their
responsibilities.
I know full well that people like Senator Buckwold and
Senator Hicks would want the federal government to interfere
in the administration of funds collected by Ottawa for the
provinces, but we should not support that trend, and 1, for one,
certainly do not support it. I believe in the true constitutional
responsibilities of the provinces. In my view, the provinces
should be able to assume the responsibilities which are theirs
under the Constitution. I cannot support this trend of the
federal government to dictate all fiscal policies to the provinces. This is what has been happening since 1945, since the
iast World War, and we have been witnessing a constant and
ever escalating confrontation between the federal government
and the provinces. I am not saying there is no other issue.
Certainly there is, but that one is very important. All those
federal-provincial meetings, either between the Prime Minister
of Canada and provincial premiers or between finance ministers, every such confrontation arouses public opinion, alarms
people and lets them know that Ottawa interferes with matters
under provincial jurisdiction and does not allow the provinces
to set their own priorities. I suggest this is one of the reasons
which led to the crisis we are now facing and which involves
mainly the province of Quebec, of course, but also to a lesser
degree many other provinces. I suggest, honourable senators,
that we must consider this problem much more with a view to
letting the provinces assume their own responsibilities, not only
in the taxation field but also in administrative areas which
come under their jurisdiction, than in the context which Honourable Senators Buckwold and Hicks are suggesting, because
they, of course, have immediate problems with their own
government. But surely those problems are less important than
ensuring that the Constitution, which requires a division of
powers between the federal and provincial governments, be
applied in both its spirit and its letter.
Of course, no one would think of voting against such a bill.
As someone said earlier, it is a fait accompli. However, I wish
we would follow a new direction here in Ottawa, under the
provinces' pressure, and not only Quebec but many other
provinces as well, and let them have jurisdiction over their own
matters, while giving the less wealthy provinces the opportu-

March 31, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

nity to assume their responsibilities through equalization and
revenue distribution schemes. I might add that some of these
formulas, for instance, are more likely to give less opportunity
to the poorer than to the more wealthy provinces. This point
was made in committee. What is important is not to look at
how the pie will be shared today so that each province can
prepare its estimates for the coming fiscal year or for five
years. We must look further than that. Had we looked further
a few years ago, we might find immediate solutions to the
problems we are now facing.
[English]
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senators, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition has failed to establish any
credibility at all for his theory of the "big federal tax conspiracy." His speech almost inferred that we have had some sort of
national taxation "caper" by a federal government with an
insatiable desire to centralize its powers and, as a projection of
this insatiable desire, to work against the best interests of
Canadians in al] the provinces, and to work against the best
interests of the provinces themselves. I do not think that he
will convince very many Canadians that there is any validity to
that theory.
• (1430)
Senator Flynn: I wouldn't bet that he wouldn't be able to
convince more of them tban you would.
Senator Perrault: I do not think many Canadians are convinced that the economic policies which have dominated this
nationSenator Flynn: "Dominated" is the proper word!
Senator Perrault: -very largely, since 1935, but perhaps
more strongly after the Second World War, have worked
against their best interests, and the best evidence of this is to
be found at the ballot box, where Canadians, time and time
again, have saidSenator Flynn: On November 15, I suppose!
Senator Perrault: -in effect, "We think we realize what
this federal government has been attempting to do."
We hear today about a spider's web, and we are told that
there is, as it were, an ominous quality about this spider's web,
that innocent provincial victims are being drawn into it and are
somehow becoming enmeshed in the great federal tax caper.
Most Canadians believe that the structure which has been
established in recent years has not been a spider's web but
rather a rich fabric which has provided opportunities for
thousands of Canadians in all provinces from coast to coast.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Grosari: Including a million unemployed!
Senator Perrault: Like the party the Opposition represents,
we believe that one of the main guiding principles of government should be to provide a basis for human beings to realize
their full potential, physically, mentally and educationally, and
this has been the thrust of federal policy in recent years.
Senator Grosart: A million unemployed!

Senator Perrault: We have heard the idea of a central
concern for the problems of the people of Canada attacked
here this afternoon. Yet these are the policies which have given
us the national health programSenator Grosart: And a million unemployed!
national welfare program, and
Senator Perrault: -the
unemployment insurance. Incidentally, many of these programs were fought right to the last vote by members of the
Conservative Party in this country. These are the policies
which have given us universal old age pensions and the supplement, and vocational training standards which are as high as
are to be found anywhere in the world.
Senator Flynn: And a separatist government in Quebec!
Senator Perrault: I would remind the honourable Leader of
the Opposition that he has already made his speech. These are
the programs which have provided education for those going
on to advanced studies.
Senator Grosart: And they can't find jobs!
Senator Perrault: They have provided communication links
from coast to coast, from the great province of Newfoundland
right out to British Columbia. They have provided the TransCanada Highway, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
and other communications media. Is the Leader of the Opposition seriously suggesting that this pattern of concern for all
Canadian provinces, established by this federal government, is
somehow working against the national interest? I am sure he
must have had his tongue in cheek when he made his speech.
One need only look at Canada's place in the world todaySenator Grosart: And look at the economy!
Senator Perrault: -to realize that we now have as fine a
medical program, as fine a hospital program, as fine a program of income security for the unemployed as are to be found
anywhere.
Senator Flynn: May I ask a question?
Senator Perrault: Mr. Leader, not at this moment.
Senator Flynn: Because, you realize you are way off base. I
never questioned the principle of these things.
Senator Perrault: We are anxious that there be no secondclass citizens in Canada on the basis of living in a small
province rather than a larger one.
Senator Flynn: So are we.
Senator Perrault: That has been one of the key policies of
this government.
Senator Grosart: And we have a great many first-class
unemployed.
Senator Perrault: Let me say with regard to constitutional
tax changes in the future that there never has been a Liberal
since Confederation who has believed that tax arrangements
should be enshrined in stone, or that even our Constitution,
created by dedicated, able but fallible Canadians, should not

SENATE DEBATES
be changed if the needs of the Canadian people require that it
be changedSenator Smith (Colchester): Change it any time you like.
Senator Perrault: -nor that there should not be a new or
changed distribution of responsibilities. That has never been
part of our party's creed. We have never been dragged kicking
and struggling into reform.
Senator Flynn: Phooey!
Senator Perrault: Instead of dwelling upon the real or
imagined shortcomings of the present system, which have led
this country to very respectable heights of social and economic
achievement, this party and this government look forward to
greater opportunities for improvement and change, and that is
the whole credo of this government.
Senator Grosart: And the economic mess we are in.
Senator Perrault: There is that old Tory talk about an
"economic mess."' A Liberal would say a glass with only 50
per cent water is half full and you would say it is half empty
because you are perpetually pessimistic about the future of this
country.
Senator Smith (Colchester): We have to be, with you fellows running it.
Senator Perrault: I wish to say by way of conclusionSenator Flynn: Yes, it's about time.
Senator Perrault: -that there is a determination on the
part of the government to ensure that every Canadian in every
region of this countrySenator Grosart: Has a job.
Senator Perrault: -realizes his or her potential, physical,
mental and economic-yes, and that makes jobs. Our critics
should not talk too much about jobs, however, looking back to
those disastrous days of 1958.
Senator Smith (Colchester): You hold the record.
Senator Perrault: To establish lesser objectives would be to
renege on its responsibility to the people of the country. In the
process of attempting to achieve these objectives the Constitution has to be regarded not as a straitjacket but rather as a
flexible instrument which should be made to serve all
Canadians.
Senator Asselin: You have changed your minds, then.
Senator Perrault: We have heard today about new tax
sharing and new provincial responsibilities. There is not one
person representing the goveriment here who would say we
should not consider new distributions of responsibility between
the provincial governments and the federal government. We
are not rejecting the idea of changeSenator Flynn: Did you listen to what I said? I do not think
you understood what I said.
Senator Perrault: Mr. Leader, please try to writhe sitting
down.

March 31, 1977

Senator Flynn: You are "riding" too high.
Senator Perrault: There will be change in the future and
there will be new accommodations of federal and provincial
needs, but the outspoken criticisrn on the part of the opposition
today is not constructive and not helpful and I do not think it
will convince many of the provinces that the Leader of the
Opposition is championing their cause.
Senator Flynn: Did you understand what I said? If you
prepared your speech before I spokeSenator Perrault: I have already spoken.
Senator Flynn: You are completely beside the point I raised
in my speech, but that is not entirely new with you.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I do not
wish to take up much of your time, especially since we have
not heard much in the last ten minutes that is worthy of
observation. However, 1 wish to make two points and no one
can deny them. The Leader of the Government can go about
the country showing irrelevance as much as he wants, but he
cannot deny that these wonderful policies about which he talks
have brought us to a separatist government in Quebec.
Senator Perrault: What is he talking about?
Senator Smith (Colchester): The party represented by my
honourable friend has been in power for a good many years. In
1963 there was no separatist government in Quebec. Everyone
knows the answer to that. Is there now, after 14 years of this
kind of wonderful government that we have heard about? Is
there now a separatist goveriment in Quebec? There is. The
honourable gentleman can mutter all he wants; at least I am
speaking in relevance to what he said. He spoke with no
relevance whatever to the excellent and eloquent speech of the
Leader of the Opposition.
Allow me to ask one other questionSenator Perrault: One other question!
Senator Smith (Colchester): My merry friends over there
had better join the million unemployed and sec if they like the
laughter. May I ask the Leader of the Government once more,
after these wonderful years since 1963, these years of perfection, these years when everything was rosy, how many unemployed do we have'? Some say 900,000; some say 1,100,000. It
is many hundreds of thousands too many, but these are two
products of the wonders we have observed, as described by the
Leader of the Government, during the last few years. Let him
ponder on that; let him not worry very much how many
Canadians the Leader of the Opposition can convince. He had
better find out if he can get one, or retain any he now has, if
there be such a strange creature.
(1440)
(

Senator Perrault: What is your second question?
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, the poor
fellow is so impervious to the facts of life that he does not
realize that I have already asked him two questions, neither
one of which he dares to answer. One is whether there was a
separatist government in Quebec in 1963, when his govern-

March 31, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

ment came into power, whether there is one now and whether
his government was in power all that time. The other is: Are
there not one million unemployed in Canada today under the
wonderful umbrella of the beautiful policies which his government has followed, and which he has now placed before us?
I do not wonder that he does not wish to recognize these
questions or to answer them.
Senator Asselin: He can't.
Senator Smith (Colchester): After all, when one can only
answer a question in a way which condemns oneself, it is far
better to ignore it. You know, there are some people who make
a practice of never answering a question, and I am beginning
to think the Leader of the Government is one of them.
However, having passed out those little bouquets of sweetness and light to the Leader of the Government, I do have to
say that it seems to me that he was not listening to what the
Leader of the Opposition said, if in fact he meant in any way
to reply to that speech or to deal with the points raised in it. I
do not like to be too offensive, but I cannot help thinking of
the biblical likening of a certain situation to something that is
very much like the wind or some other quickly disappearing
substance-the wind blows over it and it is gone. So far as
concerns anything the Leader of the Government has said
today, I think one would have to recognize that there was
plenty of wind, and, if there was any substance, when the wind
passed over it was gone.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

I should add that if there is need the Senate will be recalled
by Order of the Speaker, but I hope that procedure will not be
necessary.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Grosart: May I just ask the deputy leader if we can
assume that acceptance of this motion is possible because there
is no likelihood of any bills being passed in the other place that
we should normally be attending to?
Senator Langlois: I have had occasion in the past to warn
honourable senators that I am not good at trying to be a
prophet in this place. Hopefully, we will not be recalled, but if
need be that course will be followed.
e (1450)
Senator Grosart: By that does the deputy leader mean if a
bill is passed in the other house between now and the time that
house takes its recess that we would be recalled?
Senator Langlois: Possibly, but not necessarily. This must
remind the honourable senator of something that took place
previously in politics.
Senator Grosart: Yes.
Motion agreed to.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO STUDY BAN ON USE OF
SACCHARIN-POINT OF ORDER

On the motion by the Honourable Senator Buckwold:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon the proposed ban on the use of saccharin.
Senator Phillips: Honourable senators, I rise on a point of
order, not to express any opposition to the principle of the
proposed motion. It is my view that the Health, Welfare and
Science Committee already has the authority to inquire into
and report upon the proposed ban on the use of saccharin
without the need of any direction from the Senate.
I would point out that the counterpart of this committee in
the other place, the Health, Welfare and Social Affairs Committee, questioned the Minister of National Health and Welfare, and senior officials of his department, on this subject a
week ago. If that committee had authority to do so, surely our
Health, Welfare and Science Committee has the same
authority.
I would respectfully request a ruling on the authority of the
committee to study the subject matter of the motion without
reference from the Senate itself.
Senator Benidickson: Did the questioning to which you have
referred not take place when the minister was before that
committee on the estimates?
Senator Phillips: I believe the estimates were discussed at
that same committee meeting. However, I would invite the
Honourable Senator Benidickson to point out anything in the
estimates dealing with the use of saccharin.
Senator Benidickson: Administration.
Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might speak to the point of order? I would agree that there is

March 31, 1977

nothing to prohibit or prevent the committee from studying the
effects of the proposed ban on the use of saccharin. However,
the committee, to this point in time, has not seen fit to do so.
To my mind, this is a subject which is of significant interest to
Canadians and, therefore, worthy of discussion in the Senate,
which would then, hopefully, pass on to the committee an
instruction that the matter be inquired into and reported upon.
That is the purpose of the motion which I intend to move. I
do not sec how it would interfere in any way with other
directions given by the Senate to its committees.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, Senator Buckwold,
who proposes to move this motion, has himself said that as far
as he is concerned the committee now has the power to deal
with this matter. The point that Senator Phillips has raised
relates to a former ruling, a very clear ruling, of this house to
the effect that where a committee has the power to act, it is
not in order for the Senate to instruct that committee.
Senator Phillips probably had that ruling in mind in rising
on this point of order. As I recall it, it involved a motion by the
Honourable Senator Phillips that the Health, Welfare and
Science Committee be instructed, in its consideration of a bill
that had been referred to it, to hear two veterans' associations
which, as far as he was aware at that time, the committee did
not intend to hear, and that resulted in a ruling from the Chair
that it was not in order for the Senate to instruct the committee to hear the witnesses in question as it already had the
power to do so.
I have some reservations about that ruling. It would seem to
mean that if a committee decided to sit at four o'clock in the
morning in order to deny witnesses access, the Senate could
not instruct the committee to do otherwise. The point of order
that Senator Phillips has raised would seem to come under
that ruling. It is a procedural point. I am sure there is no
desire to prevent the committee from dealing with this particular subject. It is merely a matter, bearing in mind that Senator
Phillips' motion of some years ago was ruled out of order, of
whether this particular motion is in order, and of clarification
in that respect.
Senator McDonald: Honourable senators, I recall the occasion to which Senator Grosart has referred. To my recollection, it was a completely different set of circumstances. In that
case, the committee had a bill before it. If I recall the
happenings of that date accurately, Senator Phillips had
moved that two witnesses be given the opportunity to appear
before the committee. The important thing to bear in mind is
that a bill had been referred to the committee. Surely an
honourable senator cannot be prohibited from proposing that a
particular subject matter be referred to a standing or special
committee of this house.
I am not certain, in my own mind, that the previous ruling
was correct, but to deny an honourable senator the opportunity
of rnoving that a particular matter be referred to a committee
of this house is far beyond our competence.
Senator Grosart: I agree.

March 31, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Senator McDonald: To my mind, Senator Buckwold's proposed motion is perfectly in order. If we rule it out of order, we
will rue the day.
Senator Grosart: Senator Phillips' motion was to instruct
the committee, which would be a very different matter.
Senator McDonald: The proposed motion is that the committee be authorized to inquire into and report upon the
proposed ban on the use of saccharin.
Senator Grosart: Yes, but it was not to refer the matter. I
do not want to take a great deal of time on this, and certainly
it is not the intention to prevent Senator Buckwold from
speaking. Senator Phillips' objective in raising the point of
order, it seems to me, was merely to clarify the previous ruling,
and from the sentiments I have heard expressed, we would all
be delighted to see it clarified so that there would be no
question that the Senate could at any time instruct a
committee.
Senator Phillips: Honourable senators, in raising the point
of order it was my intention to obtain clarification of the
previous ruling. If Her Honour wishes further time-and I
realize this is a rather grey area-we could certainly have the
pleasure of hearing Senator Buckwold and receive the ruling
on a subsequent day, if necessary. I am not endeavouring to
prohibit Senator Buckwold from speaking. If we on this side
have to listen to anyone from the other side, we might as well
listen to one of the best, and I certainly include Senator
Buckwold in that category.
Senator Forsey: Honourable senators, may I point out that
only a few days ago we passed a motion that this very
committee be authorized to inquire into and report upon such
experiences in prenatal life and early childhood as may cause
personality disorders or criminal behaviour, and so forth, and I
never heard anybody suggest that that was out of order. That
appears to be on all fours with the motion that Senator
Buckwold is proposing.
Senator McDonald: Honourable senators, perhaps I should
read the proposed motion. It is as follows:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon the proposed ban on the use of saccharin.
* (1500)

Those are the exact words that we use in every reference to a
committee.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, according to
rule 71:
A standing committee shall be empowered to inquire
into and report upon such matters as are referred to it
from time to time by the SenateRule 67(l)(e) provides that the Committee on Standing
Rules and Orders is empowered on its own initiative to propose
to the Senate amendments to the rules from time to time. Rule
67(1) (f) provides that the Committee on Internal Economy,
Budgets and Administration is empowered on its own initiative

to consider any matters relating to the internai economy of the
Senate. According to rule 67(1)(l), the Senate Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science has the power, if there is a
motion to that effect, to study matters referred to it.
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO STUDY BAN ON USE OF
SACCHARIN-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold moved, pursuant to notice of
March 30, 1977:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science be authorized to inquire into and report
upon the proposed ban on the use of saccharin.
He said: Honourable senators, on March 9, 1977, the Minister of National Health and Welfare, the Honourable Marc
Lalonde, announced that the Health Protection Branch of his
department was banning the artificial sweetener saccharin for
use in foods, cosmetics and as a sweetening agent in drug
preparations. The primary motivation for the ban on saccharin
is found in the preliminary results, he reports, of a three-year
toxicological study on rats carried out by the Health Protection Branch in Ottawa. That study has shown that a high daily
dosage of saccharin in the rats' food supply caused a significant increase in bladder cancer.
The single dose used in this study to produce bladder cancer
in rats was extremely high. It represented about 5 per cent by
volume of their daily diet. The department's news release
equated it with consumption by a human of 800 12-ounce
bottles of diet soft drinks per day. If any of us were able to
consume 800 12-ounce bottles of diet soft drinks per day, he
would have enough energy, I suppose, to solve the crisis. It has
also been noted that no cases of human cancer attributable to
saccharin have ever been identified, although studies of diabetics in England and the U.S.A. have been conducted for that
purpose.
The Health Department does not consider saccharin to be
an imminent hazard to public health. Rather, the ban on
saccharin is being taken as a precautionary measure in the
interests of prudence, which is standard government terminology for taking action in a situation of significant but not major
risk.
I shall not take up the time of the Senate to give the
schedules. On July 1, soft drinks containing saccharin will go
off sale; on November 1, other dietetic foods will be taken off
sale; on December 31, 1978, certain drugs that contain saccharin will be prohibited from being sold; on December 31, 1979,
the sale of cosmetics, such as mouthwashes and toothpaste,
containing saccharin will not be permitted. It is a lengthy
schedule which I am sure is available to any honourable
senator.
Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne): What about the sale of
saccharin itself?
Senator Buckwold: The sale of saccharin itself will, in due
course be permitted at drug stores on a non-prescription
basis-that is, the actual physical compound saccharin, which
is a tar derivative.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators, this announcement has created a great
deal of criticism in this country as well as in the United States.
There are many people who feel that the conclusions which
have been reached in the study are a little hasty, that it has not
really involved what could be termed balanced scientific
research, and that the action taken by the Minister of National
Health and Welfare is a precipitous one.
Saccharin has been used for more than 80 years. It has been
used in dairy products, in dietetic drinks and desserts, canned
foods, chewing gum, mouthwash, et cetera. It is widely used as
a tablet to sweeten coffee and tea for diabetics and others who
want to restrict their intake of sugar.
I shall read some excerpts from a variety of scientific
comments made as a result of this study, and hope that
honourable senators will excuse me if I read more than I
usually like to do in my presentations to the Senate.
A United Press despatch from Washington reads as follows:
America's watchdog agency on food and drugs has
badly over-reacted with its plan to ban saccharin, ignoring
the fact the sweetener has been used safely by millions of
people for the past 70 years, several scientists told Congress today.
In fact, said one professor, there's far more potential
danger from obesity among people who, if the proposed
saccharin ban becomes effective, won't be able to get
sugar-free foods.
It goes on to indicate that this information was given to a
House of Representatives health subcommittee, and that the
head of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Guy Newell, said
that he doubts that saccharin causes cancer in humans.
The despatch continues:
Kurt Isselbacher, a Harvard medical professor, told the
subcommittec today:
"The available data indicate that the risk of humans
developing cancer from saccharin in the amounts ingested by the average individual is remote.
The harm, however, which may occur to millions in
the absence of a non-nutrient sugar substitute is great.
In this country, the problem of obesity is far greater
than that of malnutrition."
This goes on; there are many quotes from experts.
I think Senator Phillips may be interested in knowing that
the ban has caused many protests, including one from the
American Dental Association. Later I shall read one from the
Canadian Dental Association.
There was recently in Toronto-it may still be going on-an
international convention of toxicologists and the headline to a
newspaper report of their meeting is: "Visiting poison experts
sour on saccharin ban." It goes on to point out that from the
point of view of expert toxicologists from around the world, the
research was donc in such a way as not to be quite realistic to
the actual application on a day-to-day basis:
"It's obvious it [the research] doesn't address itself to
the question of hazard to the user. There is a big differ-

March 31, 1977

ence in my mind between carcinogenic . . . potential which

these studies demonstrate and carcinogenic risk," said Dr.
Scala of Linden, New Jersey.
He doesn't plan to remove saccharin from his home.
"To ban this is in my opinion a medical catastrophe,"
said Dr. Milton Eisler of Cleveland State University. "To
give doses all out of proportion to reality is ridiculous."
Eisler said research should consider the benefit-risk
ratio. He said saccharin has an important place in the diet
particularly of diabetics, individuals with a tendency to
obesity and persons with heart trouble.
Henry Trochimowicz of Wilmington, Delaware, an
industrial toxicologist ... described the ban as "over-reaction" and said he considered the hazard to humans from
saccharin as negligible.
Dr. Harry W. Hays of Washington, a former society
president, described the ban as "premature on the evidence produced so far."
He said that the U.S. government was forced to ban saccharin because of an amendment to an act of Congress passed in
1957, which provides that if at any time a chemical additive is
shown to produce cancer it must be banned from use in food.
That is why the Americans have reacted to this particular
situation.
Dr. Hays said that you can produce all kinds of things if you
give large enough doses, and added that Japanese researchers
had produced abnormalities in unborn animals by massive
doses of other common table products. He maintained that the
researchers did not pay attention to the dose-response concept
that has guided science since Paracelsus, who was apparently
the sixteenth century founder of pharmacology. That particular concept is: "It is the dose that makes the poison."
*

(1510)

I could go on and give you all kinds of other reactions.
Another newspaper report of this convention in Toronto is
headlined: "Rats to saccharin ban, U.S. toxicologists tell
researcher." Dr. Douglas Arnold of the Health Protection
Branch in Ottawa was defending his research. I would suggest
that honourable senators read the reaction to his evidence. I
must say it was very uncomplimentary to the work he carried
out. I will read this part of the article:
After Dr. Arnold spoke, Dr. Frederick Coulston of
Albany (New York) Medical Centre, presented details of
a 6'2-year feeding study of monkeys that showed no
carcinogenic effects from a saccharin diet.
In introducing his research, Dr. Coulston said he did
not intend to be controversial. "We appreciate the work
donc by the Canadian Government (researchers) and we
have nothing to say to contradict their opinion.
However, this is a beautiful lesson in comparative
toxicology. It points out the difference between a rat and
a non-human primate."
These are the kinds of things that make me concerned about
the reaction of our Minister of National Health and Welfare.

March 31, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

Time magazine reports that a United States Representative,
Andrew Jacobs, Jr., an Indiana Democrat, sarcastically introduced a bill to the bouse that would allow the sale of saccharin
under the label: "Warning: the Canadians have determined
that saccharin is dangerous to your rat's health."
This is the kind of thing that I do not believe is in the best
interests of scientific research. It puts some doubt on the
credibility of much of the evidence which is translated into
day-to-day reaction. For example, I see another headline to a
newspaper story: "Study links cancer in rats to shampoo."
Some scientists have indicated that some shampoos could
produce cancer because they contain a super wetting agent
that can be absorbed through the skin and, therefore, could
pàssibly produce cancer. We have had all kinds of indications
about massive doses. These are unreal situations, which are
sometimes over-reacted to by some medical authorities. It is
time that we started thinking about the effects of these bans on
people, particularly the ban on saccharin.
As I indicated in my previous remarks, obesity is a significant problem for many Canadians and many people around
the world. On the basis of one pound being related to about
3,500 calories, and there being about 100 calories in one
12-ounce can of a sweetened drink, if you consumed one can of
a regular soft drink each day you would put on ten pounds
over a year-and that is only one can a day. It is very easy for
some of the experts to say, "Go out and exercise, and do not
worry about that." I do not think that is really a proper
reaction because people have their own lifestyle, and I am not
sure that it is up to us to dictate them.
It could be argued that the government, in moving in the
direction of banning saccharin, is creating other problems like
those of obesity which is related to cardiovascular disease, the
danger of stroke, and the danger of heart attack. This is a
very, very real thing. There is, of course, a problem for those
who suffer from diabetes and other diseases of that kind.
I am suggesting to you, honourable senators, that it is
important that this matter be reviewed. The over-reaction
could create more problems than it would possibly solve. I
believe that action such as the one taken changes the credibility of the scientific community in relating research to the
reality of day-to-day living.
In addition to the problem of obesity, which will be created
by the elimination of saccharin-sweetened drinks and other
foods, we have the problem of dental care. I will quote from an
item in today's Globe and Mail under the headline: "Dentists
predict higher decay rate."
The Canadian Dental Association said Tuesday it is
concerned about the consequences of the federal ban on
the sugar substitute saccharin announced March 9.
"If refined sugar is used as a saccharin substitute, tooth
decay is certain to increase in the population," the CDA
said in a news release.
I could go on and give you much more evidence, but I think
you have probably heard enough to feel that there is room for
a much more thorough review of this than was done in the

rather cursory examination by the minister that was referred
to by my colleague and friend, Senator Phillips. I believe the
Senate committee bas a role to play in hearing some expert
evidence and reporting back to this house. It could be that the
minister is absolutely right. I do not know. On the basis of
what I have read of the furore that has been created in Canada
and the United States, I suggest it was a precipitate action; I
say it was a specious decision. The committee may not determine that, and that is fine. I am not here to personally judge
what the minister did. There may be much more evidence than
I have been able to accumulate, but I think the matter is
serious enough that it should be considered in some detail.
Therefore, honourable senators, I hope you will support this
motion, and that the matter will be referred to the Senate
committee for study and report.
Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Honourable senators, I
rise for the purpose of asking a question. I would ask Senator
Buckwold if he bas any evidence of the fact, as I understand it
from reading some of the newspaper reports, that cancers were
not produced in rats that ate those many pounds of the
substance, but were produced in the second generation of rats
that were not fed the substance. That certainly suggests a very
serious genetic effect which resulted in a wild multiplication of
cells which turn into cancer. I think that is the most significant
part of the research. I understand it is the first time that such
experiments have been successful in indicating the effect of
this particular substance, saccharin, on second generations of
any animal.
Senator Buckwold: I am not sure that Senator Smith is
quite factual in what he says. I will read this statement from
the minister's news release:
As stated above, the action is based upon the findings of a
study conducted by HPB, in which rats were fed a diet
providing 2500 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body
weight per day of sodium saccharin for two generations.
The parent generation male animals given saccharin developed both benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) bladder tumors. In male rats of the second generation whose mothers received saccharin during pregnancy
and lactation, the bladder tumors were mostly of the
malignant type. The increased incidence of bladder
tumors in the second generation may be attributable to
exposure of the young before birth (in utero) as a result of
maternal ingestion of saccharin.
From that I gather that there was some incidence of malignancy even in the first generation, but that most of the problem
was in the second generation.

(1520)

Hon. Frederick William Rowe: Honourable senators, I
understand that my microphone is not working.
Senator Grosart: Go ahead. We can hear you anyway.
Senator Rowe: With the consent of the Senate, I shall move
to another seat where the micropone is working. I shall speak
very briefly because, like others, I have a plane to catch this
afternoon.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators, I rise to support Senator Buckwold's
motion. Frankly, I never thought I would ever find myself in
this position because I yield to no one in my desire to prevent
pollution and contamination of any kind and, in fact, in my
desire to protect the people, and particularly the younger
people. For that reason, as I think ail honourable senators
know, I have frequently, both in this chamber and outside,
been highly critical of the drug manufacturing companies for
putting improperly tested drugs on the market and then trying
to discredit the critics who point out that the drugs have been
improperly tested. I yield second place to no one in my
criticism of the multinational corporations who have tried to
discredit the legitimate findings of medical science in their
desire to make money.
Having said aIl that, honourable senators, I want to say that
I have been a little disconcerted in recent weeks by this matter
of the saccharin ban. I do not use very much of it myself, apart
from the occasional diet Pepsi or the equivalent, so I have no
personal axe to grind. But what I do feel is that there is a
widespread feeling that somehow this action that has been
taken is, as Senator Buckwold said, a precipitate one. Certainly if the only evidence available-and I have to confess that I
have not read any official reports on this; I should have donc
so but have not had the time-if the only evidence available is
what has been given us through the news media, then there is
something seriously deficient in the action that has been taken.
I am told that the tests administered to rats and to other
forms of life have involved giving them 700 or 800 times a
normal dose. Most of us here ingest a fair amount of sugar,
and I am sure that if I were to multiply my daily intake of
sugar by 20, aIl kinds of things would happen to me. I am sure
one could not last very long doing that. This is particularly
truc of another very common food ingredient, sait. I happen to
like sait very much, but if I were to take 10 times as much sait
as I now take, not 700 times, I am quite sure that some of my
organs would have to pay a penalty, or my constitution generally would have to pay a penalty, in one way or another. The
same thing applies to iodine. You can prove anything if you
make the dose big enough.
I once lived in a part of the world where I personally added
iodine to my drinking water aIl the time on medical advice. It
was necessary to do that to render the water safe. That was ail
right as long as one was adding perhaps a teaspoonful of iodine
to a gallon or two gallons of water, but if one were to add a
quart of iodine to two gallons of water, then the result would
have to be fatal, without any doubt at ail.
So, honourable senators, I say that if the only evidence is
what we have heard in recent weeks from the news media, then
we are entitled to some further explanation. I support Senator
Buckwold's motion, because in committee we will have a
chance to delve into this matter and to satisfy ourselves either
that this decision is a correct one, or that it is perhaps too
hasty a decision in the light of ail the factors. There are a
multitude of factors. I have mentioned a few and Senator
Buckwold mentioned a few others, and there are many others
that could bc hrought into the picture too. But when aIl the

March 31, 1977

factors are analyzed, as I hope they will be when the committee considers this subject, if it is referred to committee, we will
then be in a position to judge whether or not this action is a
beneficial one for the public.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I am sure we
on this side have no intention of opposing this motion, but
perhaps it is appropriate to make some comment at this time
on it.

The motion, of course, is quite proper, and it would seem to
be wise to suggest that our Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science should look into the whole matter of what is now the
action taken by the government. However, I think it is worth
remembering that the government in this case may not have
acted, and should not be accused of acting, precipitately. The
reason I say that is not because I want to suggest that the
government's action was right or wrong, but because the
evidence relating to such matters in the past has been that
governments have been much more often accused of acting too
slowly, and thereby causing death, and in some cases multiple
deaths. So 1, for one, would not in any way agree with the
statement that the government in this case has acted too
precipitately.
Neither would I agree with the statement made by Senator
Buckwold that this action by the government challenges the
credibility of the scientific community. Surely there is no
support whatever for any such statement. I would say it does
not challenge the credibility of the scientific community. Some
members of the community have come forth with the results of
certain experiments. Those results have been interpreted by
political decision-makers as requiring, in their view, certain
action to protect the public interest. I sec no connection
between the credibility of the scientific community in bringing
forward the results of experiments and the political action
subsequent to that.
It is very doubtful if the scientific community as a whole
pressed for this or even asked for it. Those are two modifications I would like to make. In debates of this kind I think we
often fall into a trap and yield to the temptation to say we are
not discussing the scientific evidence, and then go ahead and
discuss it. For example, there is the comment just made about
doses 700 times the normal. Of course, that is a very normal
scientific process. It is the conclusions you take from that that
determine what your assessment of the results is. I have no
intention whatsoever of discussing the scientific evidence. I
haven't the faintest idea whether it would warrant credibility
or whether it is evidence that the whole of the scientific
community will accept. I do not know. I do not know whether
it would warrant the action taken by the government, but I
certainly would not criticize the government for moving quickly when this kind of evidence is presented to it.
So, I fully support the suggestion that our committee should
examine the whole matter-and examine the minister. I think
one of the immediate discoveries the committee will make is
what has already been made public by the minister, that
Canadian scientists associated with the ministry actually took
part in these experiments. Far be it from me to be in the

March 31, 1977

SENATE DEBATES

position, just before recess, of defending the government, but
in this case I feel the government should not be criticized for
acting as quickly as it acted.
On the other hand, honourable senators, we recognize the
great disability and inconvenience that this action is going to
cause. We think immediately of diabetics, and there are many
others, who will be more than inconvenienced by this ban,
which may or may not be a temporary one, on certain uses of
saccharin.
0(1530)
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, I should like
to say that personally I have no objection to the motion.
Indeed, perhaps some useful purpose can be served by having
the committee study the ban on the use of saccharin. However,
I would point out that it is easy to have instant expertise. Just
name a subject, and within 24 hours you can have experts
descending on you from both sides, pro and con, of a question.
And that holds true for saccharin. The amount administered
makes the investigation suspect, in my opinion. However, that
does not mean the results are invalid. Perhaps there were other
factors present throughout which have been neglected, but
which are the actual carcinogens.
I am reminded of an article I saw in Life magazine when I
was a student a number of years ago, which rather made fun
of some of the scientific research of the day. The article took
as an illustration a certain individual who went out on Monday
night and got high on scotch and ginger ale; on Tuesday night
he got high on rum and ginger ale; and on Wednesday night he
got high on rye and ginger ale. He kept mixing various liquors
with ginger ale for the rest of the week, and at the end of the
week he decided that he would try to find out what had caused
him to be inebriated. He came to the conclusion that it was the
ginger ale, because it was the only substance that had been
present in his drink on every occasion.
I would suggest to the mover of this motion that when the
committee is hearing witnesses it will be necessary, in all
fairness to those who oppose the ban on the use of saccharin,
to hear witnesses from outside the Department of Health and
Welfare. I certainly do not think we would hear any great
change of view from the officials in the department. If they do
give evidence before the committee different from that which
they submitted to the minister, they will probably not be in the
department for very long. I doubt if many of them would place
themselves in that position.
On motion of Senator McDonald, debate adjourned.

approves the reappointment of Keith Spicer, Esquire, as
Commissioner of Official Languages of Canada, for a
term expiring July 31, 1977.
He said: As I believe all honourable senators know, both the
Prime Minister of Canada and Mr. Keith Spicer himself
announced that it was the wish of Mr. Spicer, whose term of
office expires today, not to be reappointed for another term of
six years under the act, but that Mr. Spicer at the request of
the Prime Minister had agreed to stay on until the end of July.
In accordance with section 19 of the Official Languages Act,
the appointment of the Official Languages Commissioner
must be made under the Great Seal of Canada after approval
of the appointment by resolution of the Senate and the House
of Commons.
I understand that at present the House of Commons is
considering such a reappointment motion, and I think it is
proper for us to do likewise.
In 1970 Mr. Spicer was appointed Commissioner of Official
Languages under a motion moved in this house by the Honourable Senator Martin, and seconded by the Honourable Senator
Flynn. I assume there will be no objection or opposition to
such a motion today, which is merely routine. Because the
term expires on this present day, the action has to be taken
some time this afternoon. For that reason I ask honourable
senators favourably to consider this motion.
Senator Grosart: Honourable senators, I presume, to conform with the act, that this is actually a resolution of the
Senate rather than a motion. The act does call for a resolution
of the Senate. Whether a motion is technically a resolution is a
moot question, but no doubt that situation can be adjusted.
As the Deputy Leader of the Government has said, this is a
routine matter. The Prime Minister has asked Mr. Spicer to
extend his tenure of office, presumably until a suitable replacement is found. We are not here involved in any discussion of
the Official Languages Act, or of Mr. Spicer's tenure of that
important office for seven years-not that I would suggest that
there would be any criticism-and for that reason I see no
objection to the adoption of this motion at this time.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 5.45 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
