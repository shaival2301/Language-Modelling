OFFICIAL REPORT

THE SENATE.
MONDAI',

February 14, 1921.

The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., for the first
time in the Chamber of the Senate in the
new Parliament Building, the Speaker in
the Chair.
OPENING 0F THE SESSION.
The Hon. the SPEAKER announced that
hie had received a communication from the
Governor General's Acting Secretary informing him that His Excellency the Governor Geneiral would proceed to the Senate
Chamber tg open the Session of the Dominion Parliament on Monday, the l4th February, at 3 o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE.
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to, the Senate
Chamber and took bis seat upon the Throne.
His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House bding come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the
Fifth Session of the Thirteenth Parliament of the Dominion of Canada with the
following Speech:
Honourable Gentlemen of the Senate:
Gentlemen of the House of Commons:
On your return te, your Parliamnentary duties,
I arn giad to be able to congratulaite you on the
relative prosperity of the country and its comparative freedoan from the feeling of unrest
which has agitated countries oct so fortunately
situaited. Following the conditions o! expansion
due to the war, a period of contraction was
inevitable.
Restriction of credit involving a
certain limitation o! production -and business
ha.s been universal, but this Dominion has been
less affected than other countries, and a feeling
o! confidence prevails. A generai reduction of
the cost of living han set in, and the country,
save in certain himited areas, bas been blessed
wjth a bountiful barvest.
In spite o! this contraction, the annuai revenue of the courutry has been weiI maintalned,

and my advisers oonsidered that certain taxes,
imposed in part to check extravagant purohasing, had fulilled their purpose and, might be
withdrawn. Accordingly, with a few exceptions,
these taxes have been remitted, freeing Industry and business and thus promoting emnployment.
Unenrnployment, the worldýwide reeult of the
conditions to whjch 1 have referred, thougli less
widespread in Cana~da than eiseWhere, has received the moet anxious consgideration. 0f the
chairges for the relief of gffneral unemploymnent,
measures 'have 'been taken to bear a suibstantial
share, and special measures have been taken
to affsiat disabled'and partially disabied ex-service men. 'Phese will lys submltted to yoix for
approvai.
An Investigation le belng conducted by the
Departmnent of L.abour into systems of Unemployment, Insurance and ýOld Âge Pensions.
There will be submiltted to you for approval
the important agreement ooncluded iast year
with the Governments of the British 'West
Indian Colonies for the purpose of drawing
stitl doser tise trade rela;tions between Canada
and these Colonies and of imnproving the means
of communication and intercnurse.
The Firat Affsembly of the League of Nations
was recently held at Geneva. Representatives
of forty-one nations, inoluding those of 'Canada,
met and. delflberated together in a spirit of bargreat exmony ithat promises much for tie
perirnent.
Much time was necessarily devoted
to the work of organization, -but other measures
were also agreed upon whicb are calculated, to
promote stability and -good will in international

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH.
ADDRESS IN REPLY.

The Senate proceeded to the consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. LORNE C. WEBSTER rose to move
that an Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General to offer the
humble thanks of this House to His Excellency for the gracious Speech which he
has been pleased to make to both Houses
of Parliament. He said:
(Translation) Honourable gentlemen, I
will not surprise anyone in this honourable House if, in the discharge of the delicate mission of moving the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne, I express
myself in French first. I owe this token
of gratitude to the senatorial district of
Stadacona, which I have the privilege of
representing, and to the distinguished
gentleman who preceded me-in this seat.
Custom has it that the French language
is heard in the Federal Parliament at the
opening of each Session, and it cannot be
said that the representative of the oldest
French-speaking city in the New World
has failed in his duty on that point. In
the province of Quebec the two great races
profess for each other deep respect and
true friendship. Both keep their habits
and traditions. They have respect for
pacts and conventions. Nowhere else do
equal rights and minorities find more zealous sponsors and more ardent admirers.
It is the land of order, of bonne entente,
of conciliation, of loyalty, of true and enlightened patriotism. To live there is to
be content, immune from social unrest, as
everyone is working in his own sphere for
the development of national wealth and
the conservation of the precious heritage

left by our ancestors. In the fields of either
intellectual, agricultural, or industrial
activities, Quebec is leading the Confederation of which it bas been in the past and
will remain in the future one of the pillars.
Statistics place in the limelight wbat progress bas been acbieved. Beneficial emulation prevails in ail ranks of society. Labour
is plentiful and secure, wbich is a great
attraction to foreign capital.
The deep upheaval of the war bas bardly
scratched tbe surface of Canada when one
takes into consideration what it has done
elsewbere. Quebec bas weatbered the storm
with a serenity that is coveted by sister
provinces. Her prosperity is ever increasing and bier future is of the brigbtest. In
Quebec, trade, commerce, industry, hydroelectric development, and natural resources
of ail descriptions bave unlimited possibilities. A vast field -of activity is open
to the energy and initiative of ail. The
people know that they owe tbeir prosperity
to a régime of well-measured protection
maintained by ail our Governments since
1878, and I would bie more than surprised
if they would allow tbemselves to be
seduced by the mirage of a different policy
which couid lead 9nly to disastrous
ventures.
I cannot conclude these few remarks
whicb I have intended as a tribute of
friendship for the old city of Champlain
and the Frencb-Canadian race, witbout invoking tbe leniency of my bonourable colleagues for the weakness of my effort.
I
trust they will believe in tbe fullness of
my sîncerity and devotion.
(Text.) Honourable gentlemen, in rising
to move the Address in reply to tbe Speech
from, the Tbrone, -and again to pledge my
allegiance to the Crown, in wbich respect I
am confident I speak for every member of
this Chamber, I bave but few observations

Tbe words placed in tbe moutb of His

of Parliament bave often been said to
constitute a lean bill of fare, and it may
be that tbe same remark will be applied
by some to the Speecb of tbis Session; but
wbat would you bave? There bas been a
change of men, flot of methods, since we
last met, to make tbe laws for the good
government of Canada, according to our
ideas. A new Chief Adviser bas been

Premier as a man of outstanding ability,
of high character and good purpose, I arn
confident I voice the opinion of his political
friends, and I would add of his politicai

though somne may disagree with bim, on bis

And wbat shall I say of him wbo for so
many years, and especially during tbose
serious years of strife, led tbis country
in prosperity and to victory? History will
give to the Right Honourable Sir Robert
Borden his proper place, and I wilI leave
to others, to euflogise and bonour this
worthy son of Canada of whom we are
ail proud.
His Excellency bas referred to special
measures to be taken to assist disabled
soldiers.
I feel it is not necessary to furtber discuss any of the features of tbe late world
conflict, which will go down into bistory
as the "greatest world war." At the same
time, one cannot pass over this tragedy
without giving credit to our brave boys
for tbeir wonderful victories, and tbeir
great determination to "carry on" and to
"win out" for the glory of Canada and the
British Empire. Ever may it be our pride
that we were in it from the first and to
the Iast.
The war has cost us over 60,000 lives,
and two billions in money. Canada was
fortunate in having such strong and able
political leaders, and in baving tbem supported by a nation of such loyal and courageous citizens during tbose unfortunate
years.
The work performed by the Department
of Soldiers Civil Re-establishrnent sbould
receive our tbanks and appreciation. Tbe
work undertaken for tbe care of tbe
wounded, bospitals, vocational training,
the assistance granted
the returned
soldiers, and our pension system, bave ail
been carefuliy and well considered, and
sbould work out to tbe best interests of the
returned soldier. It is espèecially pleasing
and important to notice that more care,
help, and re-examination where necessary
will be given to tbe disabled and partially
disabled ex-soldier men.
Tbe war bas left its band beavily upon
our exchequer, and our debts must be met.

pay the demands of the Allies, it is not
expected that Canada will receive a very
large share of the indemnity. Normal
conditions will require to be restored in
Central Europe, and the Peace Treaties
will require to be duly respected. As Mr.
Lloyd George has said: "We entered this
war because a treaty was broken; but
now that it is over, we mean to see that
the treaties are observed."
Honourable gentlemen, His Excellency
has referred to the world unrest and the
difficulties supervening upon the Great
War, and to the slow and tedious restoration of things to what they were both in
the victorious and the defeated countries. It
is undoubtedly a grave situation with
which we are confronted. As His Excellency has informed us, we are faced
with contraction in credit and business
activity. We may hope that the recession
will not be of long duration, while we recognize that it comes as a natural sequence.
Prices have fallen; prices may go yet
lower. No honourable gentlemen of this
Chamber can fix the date when an
upward turn will come, but we can rejoice
that the cost of living is being lowered,
especially affecting persons of small
means.
Canada reaped last year a bountiful
harvest, and of greater value than ever
before, and from that asset our country
will thrive. If I may be permitted to
drop into poetry for a moment, it will
be only to differ frorn the sentiment of
him who wrote that
Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,

Where wealth accumulates and men decay.

We need men in Canada, but not less
do we need wealth. It is from accumulated money that our taxes must be paid:
it is from accumulated money that employment will be given; and it is from
accumulated money, and the use of it, that
business prosperity will be derived.
It is a pleasure to learn that the revenue
of the country is well maintained, and I
trust the Finance Minister will be able
in due course to announce a surplus over
expenditures and to remit further taxation. If I had advice to give to His Excellency, it would be to suggest to his
advisers the abolition of the Business
Profits Tax, not because it is not a revenue-producing source, but because it inevitably strains those other sources fron
which the Government derives its income
and maintains its credit. Taxation that
hampers business can never be good for the
country. By recent press despatches it is
Hon. LORNE C. WEBSTER.

noted that Mr. J. Austin Chamberlain,
Chancellor of the British Exchequer, has
announced that the British Excess Profits
Tax will be abolished, as the conditions
have changed which called forth this tax,
and it would appear that its renewal was
no longer necessary. This tax has tended
to discourage enterprise, new industries,
thrift, and appears to have been conflicting and unfair in its application. It
might therefore be considered wise on the
part of the Government to consider the
abolishing of this tax and replacing it
with some other more effective general
method.
There are many topics in the interesting Speech of His Excellency, topics
prompting discussion, and which I might

is the spice of life, brevity is the essence
of debate, and my duty is fulfilled by
simple allusion to some of the subjects we
will later on be required to discuss. One
of these of a very practical nature is the
trade treaty with the British West Indies.
Canadian intercourse with these Islands
is in the way of nature and much to be
desired. They produce in a tropical clime
the articles we require, just as we in a
northern zone produce many commodities
which the Islanders must purchase abroad,
and the enlarged commercial relations
which the conventions promise to promote
should prove of mutual advantage. Our
thanks are due to the Right Honourable Sir
George Foster for his work in developing
and arranging trade with the British

plished in this direction should be possible

Coast, Nigeria, etc.
But I wish to draw your attention to
the mutual advantage that would result
from closer co-operation with other porWe are privileged

hindered in the past by various treaties,
but we should be able to give to other
portions of the world such treatment
as to make for the entry of Canadian goods
into those distant countries. As Mr. T. B.
Macaulay, President of the Sun Life Assurance Company, bas stated: "The more one
looks into the question of trade between
Canada and the West Indian Colonies,

standing in the way do not seem te be
serious, and with patience ought to be overcome. The precedent of a Canada-West
Indies trade agreement might be followed
elsewhere with advantage." Certain parts.
of Central and South America can use our
northern goods, and while the United States
may offer certain advantages, yet in these
countries, with proper treaties and steanship arrangements, there is no reason why
Canada should not get its proportion of
this trade. British Tropical Africa has a
population of forty-five millions, with enormous wealth and resources, and why should
we not encourage trade to mutual advantage between ourselves? If we are to cut
down the premium on American exchange,
we must reduce our imports from that
country, manufacture at home everything
possible that we require, and purchase from
other countries, preferably those in the
Empire, tropical and other goods !with
which those countries can supply us, and
supply those countries with our goods in
return. We cannot overlook the fact that
Canada is exclusively northern, and requires to go outside of her own boundaries
for many articles. There are many articles, such as meat, flour, fish, coal, butter
and cheese, vegetables, cottons, and other
things which Canada is in a favourable
position to export to tropical countries, but
of which very little has been sent from
Canada, most of those outside countries
getting their supplies from the United
States. The United States produces much
the same class of northern agricultural products as we do, and has no need of our
exports, save as to lumber, pulp, and paper.
Therefore we can see the necessity of looking
elsewhere for a preferential market, and not
expecting any consideration through free
trade with America. Our trade with the
eastern nations across the Pacific, such as
Japan and China, being closer to us than
to the United States, should have close
attention for valuable development.
It is in this connection, in seeking new
markets, that the Canadian mercantile
marine will, I think, find its chief usefulness. Recent months have been a trying
time in shipping circles: rates have fallen
heavily and a large amount of tonnage has
been tied up for lack of cargo. The Canadian Government fleet cannot expect to
escape the trials and tribulations common
to all shipping; but there may be advan-

ù

tages in possessing a large fleet available
for any port in the world where trade can
be found, provided that the cost of the
service does not exceed the subsidy a private corporation would ask. We will doubtless soon have before us full details of the
operations of the Government marine, and
will then be in a better position to weigh
the policy and count the cost.
It is a matter of deep regret that we
have been unable as yet to climb out of the
bog of financial deficits which result from
the operation of the National Railways, and
I fear some considerable time must elapse
before this great property ceases to burden the public treasury. The Prime Minister has invited those who can offer a
practical solution to do so, and I can only
urge upon you honourable gentlemen, and
all concerned in the welfare of Canada, to
give profound and constant consideration
to this question, which nearly touches the
credit and resources of the country, and is
unquestionably one of the most serious
problems confronting us.
His Excellency informs us that his advisers are convinced of the necessity for
revision of the Customs Tariff, and that a
measure having this purpose will be submitted to Parliament. We will presumably
discuss the subject in this Chamber in due
course, although the prerogative of taxation pertains to the popular branch. It is
a question that has excited great interest
throughout the Dominion, and seems by
common consent to be the principal plank
in party platforms. It is now fourteen years
since the last general revision was made,
and I content myself with expression of the
hope that the coming revision will stabilize
industry, promote manufacturing, and advance the general interests of Canada.
Sane, careful, and wise judgment must be
exercised on this score.
Last year there were more employed in
manufacturing than ever before in our
history, and probably 25 per cent of
the entire population are directly or
indireetly dependent upon the manufacturers of this country for their

still be looked for among manufacturers in the future, with proper protection.
Canadian agricultural products have also
largely increased, and will continue to increase, and protective markets must be
found and held. .I fear any serious reductions would greatly affect our prosperity.
It is a striking and I believe accurate
statement that per head of population Can-

year 1920 imports amounted to $1,336,921,000, and exports to $1,302,805,000, one
closely balancing the other and giving
a per capita foreign commerce of $310,
while that of the United States in the same
period was not more than $135 per head.
When Canada returns, as she is fast
doing, to normal conditions the unemployment question should be more easily sett]ed amid the prosperous conditions that
shall then prevail. Those working in the
best interests of Canada desire that the
highest possible remuneration shall be paid
to labour for an honest day's toil, and it
would be unwise and unfair that any class
should benefit at the expense of another.
Honourable gentlemen, there is but one
other topic in the Speech from the Throne
to which I shall allude. It is the League
of Nations. Despite serious obstacles, not
the least of which bas been the failure of
President Wilson to carry his country into
the cause, and notwithstanding a grave
situation in Europe, the League of Nations
does exist and does function. The Supreme
Council labours incessantly to bring order
out of chaos, and slow though it be it
seems to be making progress. Russia bids
fair soon to resume commercial relations
with the outside world, and if a basis of
reparation payments can be finally arranged with Germany, the clouds that lour
over Europe may be lifted. The Assembly
of the League bas met and legislated.
A
permanent Court of International Justice
has been agreed upon, and we can take
pride from the prominent part taken by
Canadians, being Canada's representatives
in the deliberations. The League of Nations is a noble conception which deserves
to succeed, and should it fail our Christian
principles and vaunted civilization will be
as dust and ashes.
Honourable gentlemen, I beg to move the
adoption of the Address in reply to His
Excellency's Speech from the Throne.
Hon. GERALD V. WHITE: Honourable
gentlemen, I rise with a certain amount of
diffidence to second the resolution so eloquently presented by my honourable colleague from Stadacona, because I feel my
inability to discharge in a fitting manner
the duty which the leader of the Government bas placed upon my shoulders. However, I appreciate the great honour which
has been conferred upon mie, and I take it
as a recognition by the Government of the
part played by my district in the political
and industrial life of the country, and also
H4n. LORNE

C. WEBSTER.

as a tribute to the magnificent war record
achieved by the people of that district.
In this connection it might not be out of
place for me to emphasize the fact that the
contribution of the district of Pembroke to
the military and naval forces of the Empire consisted of at least 1,200 men and
women, of whom more than 125 paid the
supreme sacrifice. We also raised a large
amount of money. According to a statement submitted to me by the Department
of Finance, the district of Pembroke contributed for war purposes the enormous
sum of $2,700,900. This amount was made
up of subscriptions of $2,284,900 to the
three Victory Loans, $256,000 to the two
War Loans, and $160,000 for patriotic purposes, including the Patriotic Fund, the
British Red Cross, the Canadian Red Cross,
Belgian Relief, and Army Huts.
In passing, I should also like to pay a
tribute to the splendid war work accomplished by the women of my district. Not
content with giving their husbands, sons,
and daughters to assist the Empire; they
worked unceasingly from the outbreak of
the war until peace was declared in an
effort to supply the necessary comforts for
our wounded and sick in hospitals and for
the men in the trenches.
Honourable
gentlemen, we owe a deep debt of gratitude
to the women of Canada for the splendid
services which they rendered during the
period of the war.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Webster) bas alluded in a fitting manner to the
change which bas taken place in the leadership of the Government of this country.
Sir Robert Borden, an outstanding figure
in the public life of the Empire, retired in
July of last year from the premiership of
Canada, after occupying this position during the most momentous period in the bistory of this country. Canadians of all
shades of politics, recognizing the splendid service rendered by Sir Robert Borden
to Canada and the Empire, will, I am sure,
join with me in the hope that he may long
be spared to us.
Canada is fortunate in having so
worthy a successor in the person of the
Right Honourable Arthur Meighen to Sir
Robert Borden. Young, courageous, and
brilliant, a firm believer in the future of his
country, be is a man in whose hands Canadians of all classes and creeds can safely
place the administration of the affairs of
the country.

SENATE

In connection with the League of Nations
it is interesting to note that forty-seven
nations in all took part in the Assembly,
including the six which came in during the
later days of the' conference, and it is to
be hoped that the other great nations of
the world, who have not as yet become
members of the League, will do so in the
very near future; because, in order that
the League may be a predominant factor
in maintaining the peace of the world and
thereby preventing further wars, it would
seem to be essential that all the great
world powers should sign the covenant.
Canada sent three representatives to this
conference, in the persons of the Rt. Hon.
Sir George E. Foster, the Rt. Hon. Mr.
Doherty and the Hon. Mr. Rowell, and I am
sure it must be a source of pride to Canadians to know that Canada's representatives played a most important role in the
deliberations of that great assembly and
were instrumental in introducing many
matters of world-wide import.
In order to bind together the component
parts of this great Empire, scattered as
we are throughout the four quarters of the
globe, it is essential that relations which
will stimulate trade and improve means
of communication and intercourse between
the Dominions, the Colonies, and the Mother
Country should be entered into whenever
possible. It is therefore satisfactory to
note that the Government bas been able to
effect a beneficial trade agreement with the
British West Indies.
As one who has always taken a deep
interest in the welfare of the men and
women of Canada who served overseas
during the late war, I wish to place myself
on record as being prepared at all times
to support all reasonable measures which
will be of benefit to the disabled man,
especially those which will give preference
to his claim for employment. And, in
keeping with the finances and resources
of this country, I believe that the Government cannot be too generous in its treatment of the widows and the dependents of
those brave men who laid down their lives
for their country, and also the disabled men
who, owing to service, have become impaired physically.
In this connection, I believe the Government bas demonstrated, by the legislation
which it bas already placed on the statute
book and that which is foreshadowed
in the Speech from the Throne, that it is
ever mindful of the welfare of the returned men and the widows and dependents

of the fallen, notwithstanding statements to
the contrary made by agitators of the
Flynn type. Let me say here that I am
convinced that a very large majority of
the returned men are perfectly satisfied
with the treatment which the Government
of this country bas accorded to them. They
are only too anxious, I believe, to become
re-established in civil life as soon as
possible.
In comparison with the policy of other
countries which were engaged in the war,
Canada's soldiers' civil re-establishment
policy is one of which she might justly feel
proud. Within one year of the commencement of hostilities a commission was formed,
charged with the provision of hospital
care and treatment of men who were expected to return invalided from overseas,
and the honourable leader of this House
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) was appointed
Minister in charge. From this small beginning bas grown the great organization
known as the Department of Soldiers' Civil
Re-establishment, the Board of Pension
Commissioners, and the Soldier Settlement'
Board, the two latter handling distinct
branches of the work of compensation and
rehabilitation.
In the first place, hospitals have been
provided on a scale not at first contemplated. They have been equipped with the
latest improvements in the way of therapeutic apparatus and conveniences, and
they have become an example for other
countries to follow. Among the innovations
which have been tested and the value of
which have been proved may be mentioned
the appointment of ward aides, specially
trained in classes organized by the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment in
order that they might assist men in the
hospitals to utilize their idle time in the
performance of some useful work Immediately this plan was introduced the tone of
the hospitals showed a marked improvement. This was particularly the case in the
sanatoria for tuberculosis. Another new
feature in the hospital personnel has been
the introduction of dietitians. This has resulted, first, in an improvement in the food
supply, and, secondly, in a lessening of the
cost.
The next activity to which I desire to call
attention is that of vocational training.
After the close of every previous war men
have been allowed to shift for themselves
and no attempt bas been made, except on
an insignificant scale, to solve the war
wastage among those suffering severe
disabilibies and handicaps. Early in the war

FEBRUARY 15, 1921
certain patriotic Frenchmen commenced
training schools, supported
vocational
largely by public and private philanthropy,
and a good work was achieved, but nothing
upon a comprehensive and national scale
was undertaken until the Government of
Canada led the way. Vocational training
bas its critics, as there are bound ta be a
certain number of failures-there are in
every line of activity-but the percentage
of failure is so small when compared with
that of success that it may be practically
disregarded. Up ta the end of January 1921,
50,683 returned soldiers had commenced
training, of whom 11,576 were minors
who were trained because of the fact that
they enlisted under the age of 18 years and
had suffered a severe interruption of their
apprenticeship or education. At this time
there are 37,762 graduates and 3,983 men
undergoing training, the difference between
those who commenced and these latter
figures representing those who for various
reasons preferred ta discontinue their
courses before completion. The greatest
number of men undergoing training at any
one tinte was at the end of February last,
when the Department had on its strength
26,022.
A very excellent feature of this work is
the follow-up system in force, by which the
men are watched for a period after the
conclusion of training. The follow-up figures indicate that approximately 72 per
cent of those who have been trained are
following their new line of occupation. Men
have been trained in 421 occupations.
The employment section of the Department, which closed its activities in June
last, except for handicapped men, placed
101,000 men in employment, the number of
actual situations secured having been 174,789.
The medical branch of the Department
had on its strength on the 31st December,
1920, 6,431 patients, a decrease of about
1,300 from the 31st December, 1919. The
total number of out-patient treatments for
the year was nfo less than 447,142. The
medical work includes general hospital
treatment, treatment for tuberculosis, and
treatment for insanity.
A branch of the work which is of vital
importance ta many of the returned men is
that which deals with the supply of orthopedic appliances. Until the Commonwealth
of Australia followed suit, Canada was the
only country maintaining a government
factory for the manufacture of artificial

designed which are giving general satisfac-

tion. The output of this branch of the
Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment to the 31st December, 1920, consisted
of 5,448 legs, 1,962 arms, 13,565 orthopedic
boots, 11,644 pairs of glasses, 24,027 repairs,
in addition ta which large numbers of
splints, new sockets, rubber goods, belts,
etc., have been furnished. Men, while undergoing medical treatment, vocational
training, or waiting for the supply or repair of orthopedic appliances, are granted
special rates of allowance.
Another branch of the Department which
is entitled ta special mention is the Soldier Settlement Board, which bas done
splendid service in rehabilitating the soldier
on the land, and bas distributed the sum of
$81,354,948 in loans for the purchase of
lands, for the removal of encumbrances,
for permanent improvements, and for stock
and equipment. It is also worthy of mention that the total area of land taken up
by soldier settlers comprises roughly 3,371,000 acres, including - approximately
2,000,000 acres of free land.
The Pensions Board is another branch
of the service which has carried on its
work in an efficient and able manner. Canada's pension bill for the year from the
1st of September, 1920, ta the 31st of
August, 1921, will amount ta between $33,000,000 and $34,000,000, a sum in excess of
the total expenditure of the Dominion not
many years ago. There are approximately
75,000 disability and dependent pensions
being paid, and the total number of persons receiving benefits by way of pensions
is roughly 130,000. The pension paid ta a
disabled man is continued as long as his
disability continues ta exist; it therefore
may be said that the door is never closed
ta the man who is suffering from any
handicap as a result of his war service.
The pensions paid in this country are
higher than those paid in any other country, with the solitary exception of that
paid by the Government of the United
States ta a single man who is totally
incapacitated.
The question of the Tariff, with which
my honourable friend dealt ta some extent,
is one of the principal matters to be discussed at this Session of Parliament. Since
the adoption of the National Policy under
Sir John Macdonald in 1878 Canada bas
continued ta maintain a protective tariff.
When Sir Wilfrid Laurier came into power
in 1896 he continued the policy of protection, realizing, no doubt, that any drastic

lu

SENATE

change in our fiscal policy would be detrimental to the best interests of the country.
To-day, however, the platform of the
Liberal party, as indicated at their recent
convention, favours a lower tariff and practically free trade. The National Policy
is responsible for the great development
which has taken place in the industrial life
of this country in recent years, and if we
are to expand our trade by developing our
great natural resources, if we are to give
employment to labour and to build up a
great and prosperous nation, we must continue a policy of adequate protection
against unfair competition to the industries
of the country.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, we have listened to two very interesting speeches by the mover and the seconder of the Address; and on account of
the House meeting on Monday instead of
on Thursday, as is our usual custom, I ask
permission to move the adjournment of the
debate until tomorrow.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH.
ADDRESS IN REPLY.

The Senate resumed from yesterday conconsideration of the Address in reply to
His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the Session.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK:
Honourable gentleman, before addressing myself
to the Speech frorn the Throne, I think
it opportune to make a few remarks about
the Chamber in which we are assembled
Hon. GERALD V. WHITE.

to-day. I think we are to be congratulated
upon having such a fine Chamber to meet
in, and one in which I think we shall find
every convenience provided for the members of the Senate. I think the Government is to be congratulated upon thE
decoration and furnishing of the Chamber,
with the exception of the ceiling, which,
to my mind, is not suitable. I think the
decoration of the ceiling is too gaudy altogether. But honourable gentlemen will
probably keep their eyes fixed on the members of the House, and not be looking up too
often at what is above. With regard to
the Chamber as a meeting place for public
functions, I am afraid a big mistake has
been made. It seems that the convenience
of the public has not been considered as
much as it might have been; but, as the
Chamber bas to be considered more from
the point of view of members of the Senate
than from the point of view of the general
public, I think the Chamber is going to
prove a very great success and a great
convenience to the members of the Senate.
I desire to congratulate the mover and
the seconder of the Address for thie very
able speeches to which we listened yesterday afternoon. I think the honourable
gentleman from Stadacona (Hon. Mr.
Webster) is to be congratulated on the
fact that he is able to address this House
in two languages.
I regret very much
that I am not able to follow the example
which he set to the members of this Chamber, and which I think is a very good one.
I wish also to congratulate him upon the
subject-matter of his speech, which was in
line with views that I hold to some extent
myself on the question of trade, and to
which I hope to refer later on in my
speech.
The honourable member from Pembroke
(Hon. Mr. White) is a new member of this
House. He comes of a family that is weil
known and has been prominent in the public
affairs of this country for a great many
years. His father was a great parliamentarian, at one time Speaker of the other
Chamber, and I think we are to be congratulated on being able to welcome him as
a member of this House. I congratulate
him on his speech of yesterday, which was
so full of comment on the work that bas
been done by the Government during the
war, and especially on the provision that
they have made for the returned soldiers
and the widows and orphans of the men
who died in the war. I am sure that we
all feel that the country cannot do too much
for those who have suffered in the defence

FEBRUARY 16, 1921
of their country. We desire to see everything possible done to assist those who have
returned in finding their places in the life
of the country once again.
The Speech from the Throne dealt with
certain subjects; but .I think the general
criticism that can be made of it is that
there were a number of omissions-on
points to which the country would have
expected the Government to refer in the
Speech from the Throne at the present
time.- I shall deal with those points as I proceed; but for the moment I want to refer
to a matter that was also touched upon by
the mover and the seconder of the Address
-an event which took place just after the
close of last session. I refer to the change
that was made in the Government, and also
the change that was made by the Conservative party. Immediately after Parliament had prorogued the Government party
met and for some reason or other thought
it advisable to change the name of the party
to what I think is an exceedingly long
name for any party to adopt-"The
National Liberal and Conservative Party."
They chose as Premier and leader of their
party a young man who is energetic and
capable. He was accepted by the Governor
General as the Premier of this country. So
far as he has gone in laying down the policy
of his Government and of the party which
he now has the honour to lead, although
this party is called National, Liberal, and
Conservative, the policy is more nearly in
line with the old policy of the Conservative
party than with anything else that I have
read about in the history of this country.
I fail therefore to see the necessity of
attaching to the party a long name of that
kind, which will be too long for anybody to
use in the future. I think we shall see them
come down to what I believe to be their
true position, in being known as the Conservative party. The action of the Premier
in assuming the reins of office without appealing to the people for a confirmation of
his procedure is, I think, one that is rather
questionable. The best tradition of British
parliamentary practice is that when a great
party which happens to be in power at the
time changes its leader, when he, as in
this case, loses several of the former members of the Cabinet and takes in several
new members, the Government appeals to
the people for a confirmation of the policy
on which they intend to administer the
But apparently the
country's affairs.
Prime Minister and his friends did not
consider their duty to be along this line,
and so far they have not taken any action

to ascertain from the people of the country
what is their opinion regarding the policy
that the Government are pursuing; with the
exception, of course, of certain by-elections
which have been held and which some
honourable gentlemen may interpret in one
way and some in another. I do not intend
-I do not think it is for honourable gentlemen in this Chamber-to express an opinion
as to what the results of those elections
may represent, but I think they indicate
that the country itself may differ with the
Government on the policy which they are
pursuing.
The Speech from the Throne mentions
the League of Nations. We know that
Canada was represented at the meeting
of the Assembly of the League. We know
that the representatives of Canada at that
meeting were energetic, and considerable
attention was paid to certain things that
they said there. But we have so far not
heard any expression from the Government as to what the course of action of
the League of Nations is and how far it
may bear in any respect on the policy of
Canada. Everyone, I think, must be desirous of seeing the League of Nations a
success and that it should achieve a position in which it can enforce its policy and
regulations on the various nations that
comprise it. But we have had so far no
statement showing what is the policy of
the Government with regard to our action
in connection with the Assembly, and I
think that we ought to hear something
from them along these lines. We must
all wish that the League may be a success,
and further, that our neighbors to the
south, who have not yet taken any part
in it, may soon see their way to come in
and take the prominent part that a great
nation such as they are should be able to
take. We desire to see the peace of the
world maintained, to the very great advantage of the whole world. The great
danger that I see at the present time is
that the unrest which to-day exists in
Europe may lead to a further outbreak
of trouble at no very distant date, and
unfortunately there has been raised in
the United States and discussed in the
newspapers the question of armaments and
the increase of naval forces, which may
lead to a rivalry such as existed before
the commencement of the war in 1914. I
think it is a very serious matter that great
powers like the United States and the
British Empire should start any policy of
rivalry of armaments, especially rivalry of
naval armaments, as to which can build

SENATE

navies of the world, I think, should be
for the purpose of maintaining peace, law,
and order all over the globe, and not for
the purpose of rivalling one another as
to which is the greatest power and can
put the largest number of ships in any
part of the world at a given time.
I mentioned the question of omissions
from the Speech frorn the Throne. One
that I think is affecting the country very
severely to-day, one on which the country
would almost have expected the Government to make some pronouncement as to
what they intended to do, is the question
of freight rates on the railways. As
honourable
gentlemen will remember,
towards the end of last year the railway
commission dealt with the question of
rates and practically agreed to the rate
that the railway companies asked the commission to allow them to charge. The
effect of those rates on the trade of the
country was very serious. In the province
from which I come it immediately caused
the cessation of business in the lumbering
trade throughout the province. The rates
were found to be so high that it did not
pay the lumber merchants to ship their
lumber. The effect of those rates, if I
am credibly informed, bas been to change
very seriously the course of trade of this
country and cause us to do a great doal
more business north and south than we
formerly did. It stands to reason that,
if you raise the rates on the railways to
such an extent that it becomes cheaper
for the people of the country to pay the
duty and import from the south the goods
that they wish to buy, this will seriously
injure the business of the country and
change the course that it has been following for a great number of years. One of
the arguments that I have always heard
since coming to Canada, regarding the
danger of lowering the tariff between ourselves and the United States, was that it
would seriously affect the business between
east and west and cause business to be
done north and south instead. Now, the
effect of raising the railway rates to the
extent to which they have been raised has
been, I think, the same. I think there is
no honourable gentleman in this House
who will dispute the fact that it bas very
materially injured every branch of business throughout the country, in handicapping not only the lumbermen, but also
the agriculturists and producers generally,
if it bas not hurt the merchants.
I may be told that it may be necessary to
raise these rates in order to enable the railHon.

ways to meet their expenses and pay the
higher wages that they were called upon
to pay when our neighbors to the south
dealt with the question of wages and agreed
to what was called the McAdoo award.
The railway companies of this country,
of course, are practically compelled to fall
in line with what is done in the United
States; consequently we have to suffer to
some extent in being compelled to raise
railway rates in this country. But I think
that the Commission perhaps went too far.
I should have hoped that the Government
would have announced that the decision of
the Commission would be reconsidered at
an early. date. There is no doubt that it
was necessary to raise these rates in order
to assist the Government roads, because,
as we have seen for a considerable time
in the newspapers, the deficit on the Government roads this year is going to be very
much greater than it was last year and will
be a very heavy burden on the country.
I have seen various figures given, showing
in one case that the loss on the Government
railways will amount to $60,000,000, in
another case $75,000,000, and I think in

another case $80,000,000.

I have myself

no definite information as to what will be
the amount of the deficit, but I have no
doubt that the honourable leader of the
Government will be able to enlighten us
as to the condition of things, either now
or at some later stage of the Session.
The increase in railway rates of course
also affected the cost of living, which was
beginning to be felt very seriously by people
all over the country. The peak of the
load of the high cost of living was practically reached by Canada in May of 1920,
and fron that date on the prices were
gradually coming down; but I think we
may say that the effect of this increase in
railway rates bas been to increase to a
considerable extent the cost of living to
the people throughout the country; and,
inasmuch as it bas also checked the trade
of the country, it bas been a very serious
drawback to the people of Canada.
The Speech from the Throne deals with
another question that I think is a very
serious one for this country: it mentions
the fact that the Government have decided
to do away with the Conservation Commission. The Conservation Commission was
established by Act of Parliament in 1909,
with the idea that it should look into the
natural resources of Canada and help to
educate, not only the people, but also the
various Governments and public bodies,

of creating the Board of Commerce. Now
that the war is over we should not have
any compunction in repealing restrictive
measures which were only agreed to as
being necessary during the war. It is only
right, now that the war is over and we are
getting back to more normal times, that
steps should be taken to do away with such
legislation and to let the trade and business
of the country take its natural course, so
that people will feel that they may carry
on their business without any restrictions,
which, in many cases, have proved very
difficult to comply with and detrimental to
the business of the country. Of course, I
understand that all the members of the
Board of Commerce have resigned, and that
as far as they are concerned the Act is
practically a dead letter. It would be very
much better that it should be repealed.
The Speech from the Throne deals with
the unemployment situation of the country at the present time. As is very truly
stated, the condition of Canada to-day is
considerably better than that of a large
number of other countries throughout the
world. It is only natural, as a result of
the terrible period through which we passed
during the war, that we should feel very
seriously the destruction of capital and
property that went on at that time. The
position of Canada to-day is much better
than that of other countries, because Canada was in the fortunate position of being
able to supply many of the requirements
of the Allied nations during the war and
to ship her goods to Europe. Unlike Australia, which had a large production of
wool and other products that were required
'for the war, but could not ship them on
account of lack of vessels and means of
transportation, Canada, during the years
of the war, was able to export a great deal
more than she imported, and the trade of
the country was exceptionally favourable.
That condition, I think, continued up to the
end of last year: but I regret to say that
a change has come, and that our trade today shows that we are importing a great
deal more than we are expo'rting, and, what
is still worse, that we are importing very
large amounts from the United States and
exporting to them not nearly sufficient to
pay for the goods we are importing from
them.
Throughout the country to-day
prices are falling, and I think it is safe to
say that the farmer in selling to-day bas
to sell at the prices that he obtained in
1914 before the war commenced, while, on
the other hand, he bas to pay higher rates
on the railways, higher wages, and more

for certain goods that he requires than he
had to pay in 1914.
The same is true as to many- of the products of this country. The export of agricultural produce forms a great portion of
our total exports. The exports of lumber,
paper, and pulp have been very considerable, and to-day these latter make up about
one-quarter of the total export of the country. But we are now face to face with the
fact that the German production of paper
is coming to the front again, and we will
have to be prepared to meet that competition, which, of course, we had not to do
during the war. This may result in our
getting a considerably smaller amount per
pound for the pulp and paper that we have
to sell. In other ways we find that Canada
to-day bas not as good a market in Europe
as she had in 1914. It stands to reason
that with the impoverished condition of the
countries of Europe the markets are not as
good as they were. The people of those
countries, even if they wished to buy goods
from Canada, have not the money to do so,
and in a large number of instances they
have not the goods to exchange for the
goods that we can supply to them. This
puts Canada in a very different position to
that which she occupied in 1914.
At the same time, we find that owing to
the war the debt of the country bas enormously increased. At the end of November
of last year Canada's net debt was given
as $2,298,784,804, and I think that, as far
as one can reasonably estimate, the population of the country to-day may be taken
at about nine millions of people.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: These figures are

and deducted from the gross debt, leaving
the figures that I give as the net debt.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The figures take
no account of the railways at all?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I am afraid that
I cannot give my honourable friend exactly
the information he asks for. These figures
were given to me as the net debt of the
country at that date. Last year, as my
honourable friend will remember, the
Finance Minister made some revision of

FEBRUARY 16, 1921
the financial position of the country, and
wrote off certain assets that before had
been taken into acount and deducted from
the gross debt of the country. I do not
know whether the, total value of the railways is deducted from the gross debt before this figure of the net debt is arrived at.
The comparison that I was endeavouring to make was that in the year 1914
the net debt of the country was $335,996,850 and the population 7,725,000, whereas
our position to-day is such that we have
an increase of the debt amounting to
$1,962,787,954, and an increase in population of only 1,275,000.
Therefore the
burden on the people of the country today is very much greater than it was in
1914, and, as I have pointed out, the difficulty of carrying on business and exporting to the markets of the world is very
much greater than it was at that time.
This means that the people of Canada
will have to put their shoulders to the
wheel and struggle very hard to find the
necessary revenue to pay the interest on
the country's debt.
The statement was made the other day
by the Prime Minister of Canada that we
wiIl require a revenue of $400,000,000.
Whether or not it is going to be necessary
for us to raise that amount of 'revenue,
we cannot tell until we get the financial
statement from the Finance Minister; but
I presume the Premier would flot have
nmade such a statement if he had thought
that our position would have been more
favourable. The difflceulty that we are
labouring under is that with a decreasing
trade we have to raise this greater revenue from a population of only nine millions of people. I shall await with a very
great deal of interest the statement of
the Finance Minister as to how he purposes raising the revenue required.
During the recess what is knowin as the
Fordney Bill was brought down in the
United Ï States. That Bill, if it goes into
force, is very liable to seriously injure
the trade of Canada with the United
States. If I understand the Bill correctly,
it will increase the duty on Canadian goods
going into the United States, and will
very materially hamper trade between the
two countries. My honourable friend the
leader of the Government was interviewed
in Calgary on one occasion with regard to
what he considered would be the effect
of the Fordney Bill, and I think I am

correct in stating here, as it was stated
in the Ottawa Citizen, that:
In reply to a question as to what the feeling
Ln Ottawa was on the subject, Sir James remarked, that thfi Governanment was flot at the
moment concerning itself about it: "there will be
time for this when the United States enacts
any Buch leg1slat1on. It la known, however,
that the Republican party wlll seek a higher
tariff poiey, and it would flot come as a surprise to ses legislation passed along these lines
as far as Canadian Imports to the States are
concerned."

My honourable friend apparently thinks
the only way to meet the situation, should
the Bill go into effect, is to increase the
duty on goods coming from the United
States into Canada; but if these goods are
required in the country, we may be forced
to brîng them in from the United States,
because, I presume, to a very large extent they are goods that capnot be obtained in Canada. Therefore the increase
of the duty on Anierican goods coming
into Canada will not help the Canadian
people, so far as I can see.
Contrary to the view of the honourable leader of the Government in this
Chaniber, we had a statement the other
day from the Minister of Trade and Commerce. Sir George Foster went down to
New York, and, in talking to the people
of that city, hie asked them to trade more
freely with the people of Canada. He used
these words:
We are pretty good neighbors to you. We
came over from Canada in 1920 and bought
$921,000,000 worth of stuif from. you in the
UJnited States.
This means that every man
woman and child in Canada spent on an
average $115 in purchasing from the Ulnited
States last year. The United States, by the
same statistics, came into Canada and bought
$560,000,000 worth only, exactly five dollars for
every man, woman and chi-Id In the United
States. Let us be neighbors, buy as much from
us as we have donse from you and when ws
corne down here with our good-wiIl security,
Canadian dollars, be above offering us 88 cents.

I quite agree that what we want to do
is to put the exchange as between the
United States and ýCanada into a very
much better position than it is to-day, but
I do not think that if the ideas of my
honourable friend opposite are carried out
it is going to resuit in an encouragement
of the trade between the two countries,
which apparently the Minister of Trade
and Commerce thought was the best solution of the difficulty.
It is only right to point out that in that
same speech the Minister of Trade and
Commerce, after disclaiming any desire to
meddle with public affairs in the United

16

SEN ATE

States, referred to the Fordney Emergency
Tariff Bill now before the Senate in Washington as a measure that would "prevent
us from sending down our cattle and
sheep and agricultural products in order
that we may pay you." Then he went on
to say: "Well, there are but two things
for us to do. One is not to buy the extra
$400,000,000 worth from the people of the
United States. That is my appeal to the
commercial portion of the United States."
And, after pointing that out to the people
of the United States and advising the
people of Canada to buy goods in the
United States to that extent, he did not
go on to elaborate what the other point
was that he intended to make, but he said:
"It may be a good thing to think of these
things before we legislate too far." He
evidently held that out as a proposal to
our neighbours across the line, that on
both sides of the line the governments
should consider very carefully before they
start on this policy of increasing duties
on goods coming from Canada to the
United States or on goods coming from the
United States into Canada. Whether Sir
George Foster was prepared to go as far
as my honourable friend in this House
is prepared to go, and place these higher
duties on goods coming into Canada from
the United States, he did not say; he left
it to his audience to think out for themselves what he proposed to do. But I think
very much better than this policy of retaliation against the United States would
be the policy that was outlined only yesterday by the honourable gentleman from
Stadacona (Hon. Mr. Webster), that of
trying to assist Canada in every way to
find markets in other parts of the world.
Canada to-day is in a position to trade
with any part of the world, and there are,
as the honourable gentleman pointed out,
markets that are ready to take the goods
that we can send them, and markets that
should be developed. Honourable gentlemen
may know that we have a line of steamers
running from Vancouver across the Pacifie.
The men at the head of that line of steamers
complain very bitterly that a large quantity
of the goods that they require to carry to
Japan and China have to be obtained in the
United States. They consider that the
people of Canada should make such goods
and be prepared to ship them across to
the market in China which is waiting for
them. At the present time there is a tremendous market waiting to be opened up,
and I think that the best policy for Canada
Hon. HEWITT

BOSTOCK.

to pursue is to endeavour in every possible
way to open up trade with the rest of the
world, on both the Atlantic and the Pacifie
oceans.
The Speech from the Throne deals with
the question of the Treaty with the West
Indies. We have not had the advantage
of seeing what the terms of that Treaty
were, but we hope to do so before very long.
But, in regard to that Treaty, I doubt
very much if the proper degree of consideration was given to the question of the
development of trade on the Pacific coast
of Canada at the same time as the development of trade on the Atlantic coast. I had
the opportunity of talking to one or two
delegates who came to Canada to be present
at the negotiations in regard to this Treaty,
and I was rather surprised to find that they
did not seem to be aware that some of the
goods that they required could be obtained
on the Pacifie coast of Canada just as
easily as on the Atlantic, and that on the
Pacific we require the sugar and other
products that they can send back, just as
much as they are required at St. John or
Halifax. I hope that we shall find that
this Treaty is as favourable to the Pacific
coast of Canada as it is to the Atlantic.
Honourable gentlemen, I do not desire
to take up the time of the House any longer.
We are not in the habit of making long
speeches in the Senate, and I think it is
a very good rule to adhere to. We must
consider the other matters mentioned in the
Speech from the Throne when they are
brought before us, and I think it is much
better to leave those measures to be dealt
with as they come up from time to time.
I would like to express the hope, now that
we are in a new Chamber and working
under these pleasant conditions, that the
Government will be able this Session to see
their way to bringing important legislation
to this Chamber before the dying hours of
the Session. We have of late years had to
complain on more than one occasion of the
Government bringing legislation down here
at the close of the Session, when d'e members of the Senate had not sufficient time
and wete not able to give to it the proper
consideration. Now that we have come into
our new quarters, I hope the Government
will show that they are trying to treat us
more favourably and give us a better
opportunity to consider the legislation.

and I am satisfied we shall appeal successfully.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Bostock) referred a few moments ago to the
fact that no statement was made in the
Speech from the Throne in regard to the
increase of freight rates. Surely my honourable friend is not serious in urging or
contending that this Government was in
any way responsible for the increase of
freight rates. My honourable friends when
in office very wisely established a railway
board chargeable with regulating freight
rates throughout the Dominion, and I think
that Board may be complimented upon
having shown up to the present time a reasonable degree of wisdom in having exercised fair discretion in regard to the rates
which they have established. But my
honourable friend sought to leave the impression that the initiative was taken by
the Dominion Government in moving for
an increase of rates on account of the Government ownership of railways. This was
not the case. As my honourable friend opposite knows, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was the active factor in demanding there should be an increase of
rates, although any increase which might
be given would inure to some extent to the
advantage of the roads that are operated
by the Government of Canada. But let it
not be overlooked that there were grounds.
For instance, it was established on evidence
that the average annual wage of the railway
employees immediately previous to the war
was $756, and at the present time they
will average $2,000. The operating expenses of railways are made up largely of
wages of employees and the cost of materials. The prices of materials increased
not merely one hundred per cent, but in
many cases two hundred per cent. I need
not weary the House by going into detail.
It therefore was not unreasonable that the
railways of Canada should be placed on a
parity with those of the United States. We
are so closely allied in our relations with
the United States in business, commerce, and
many other matters that when certain conditions prevail there they largely control
similar conditions in Canada. My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Bostock) is fully aware
that the jurisdiction to regulate railway
rates is exclusively with the Railway
Board. True, an appeal lies to the Governor General in Council, but the effect of
that appeal is not that Council revises the
rate, but rather that it sends back the
report with any suggestions it may have
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED.

to make to the Railway Board; and in
this particular case this was done.
I therefore need not occupy the time of
the House with subjects which are not referred to in the Speech from the Throne,
except that possibly I should not overlook
the statement which was made as to the Conservation Commission. I think honourable
gentlemen on both sides of the House will
agree that there should be the greatest
economy exercised in the administration of
our public affairs; that because a Commission may exist and may have been appointed by one Government or another is
not necessarily a reason why there shauld
be no change when it is found that practically the same duties which were being
assumed by the Commission and carried
out by them were assumed by other departments of Government long before the
Commission was established. No less than
four or five departments of Government
are and have been doing practically the
same work that the Conservation Commission was doing, and as the Session proceeds and as the Bill is brought before
Parliament, if honourable gentlemen desire
any evidence upon that point it will be
forthcoming. I think honourable gentlemen
can easily satisfy themselves that this
Government will be able to save approximately $250,000 a year by the extinction
of the Conservation Commission.
I have to congratulate my honourable
friends who moved and seconded the Address. I listened with a degree of envy
to the honourable member from Stadacona
(Hon. Mr. Webster) addressing this House
in both languages. Had I been able to do
likewise I assure you that I should have
done so with the greatest pleasure. My
honourable friend is not only to be congratulated upon addressing the House in
bath languages equally well, but upon the
soiwnd business speech which he made,
which was truly characteristic of the representative position which he occupies as
a leading business man in the most metropolitan city of Canada.
I was also pleased with the speech made
by my honourable friend from Pembroke
(Hon. Mr. White). My honourable friend
from Pembroke, like many another honourable gentleman in this House, did yeoman
service in the House of Commons, and
graduated from that House to this. We
have to congratulate ourselves accordingly.
I think the strength of this House may
be said to be largely made up of honourable gentlemen who at one time as menr

FEBRUARY 16, 1921
bers of another Chamber clamoured for
the abolition of the Senate, but looked forward at the same time with considerable
anxiety to being promoted to this body.
The Senate in acquiring these two gentlemen may congratulate itself. I hope they
will be heard very often on the floor of the
House, and that they will not depend for
inspiration upon the atmosphere that comes
from the House of Commons, but in cold
reason and in cold blood will express themselves as we are moved to do on the floor
of this Chamber in discussing public business.
Reference bas been made to the League
of Nations. Canada was represented at the
recent meeting in Geneva in such a way
as to reflect credit upon the representatives
whom we sent to that great gathering.
It is unnecessary to discuss at any length
the enormous task which was imposed upon
the Peace Conference at Versailles out of
which grew the League of Nations. Probably never within the four corners of
any document was there so great a task
entered upon as to give effect to the Covenant of the League of Nations and the
great objects which it had in view.
It is to be regretted that the United
States did not see its way to become a
party to the League. In my judgment,
to make the League an absolute success,
so that effect may be given to the objects
which it bas in view, it is indispensable
that the republic to the south of us should
become a party to that League. I am at
a loss to understand how the League can
be made a success if the United States
should refuse to become a member thereof.
We on this continent are particularly
interested in this phase of the subject. I
have no doubt that upon the Republican
régime entering upon office, as they will
next month, this difficulty will be overIt seems to me that too much
come.
attention was given to the phraseology of
the League and too little to the essence
of the purpose which it had in view; and
if to-day the different articles of the League
are of such a character as to prevent the
free entry into the League of the United
States or any other nations that have
refused to enter, no articles or language
should stand in the way of there being a
League of Nations united against war and
committed to the maintenance of the
world's peace for all time.
There is just this further comment that
I should like to make in regard to the
League. There appears to be a disposition
on the part of sone European nations to
deal with questions somewhat outside the
S-2ý

19

purview of that very important body. There
is .a tendency to make it a kind of international parliament instead of purely a
League of Nations for the maintenance of
peace and the prevention of war. I feel
assured that nothing will result so injuriously to the success of that great tribunal as importing into its discussio:ns
questions which are not international, and
which must be dealt with exclusively by
the different nations which up to the present time have entered 'the League. I
hope, therefore, without being at all critical, that the League of Nations will hereafter confine its deliberations to questions
affecting peace or war.
Reference bas been made in the Speech
from the Throne to the inquiry instituted
into our tariff laws. This inquiry has
created considerable interest in the country,
and very properly so.
The Tariff bas always been the most
important political issue in Canada since
1878 down to the present time. When
Confederation was entered into we had a
continuance of the revenue tariff that ohtained in the different provinces previous
to that period. It only needed a few short
years to demonstrate that the industries
and revenues of Canada required something more than a mere revenue tariff for
their support.
Upon the abrogation of the Reciprocity
Treaty between the United |States and
Canada at the conclusion of the Civil War
-an abrogation which was manifestly
brought about with a view to crippling
the industries which Canada had built up
during the currency of that Treaty-it was
thought from that time down to 1873 that
Canada might possibly be able to face the
hostile tariff legislation which had been
passed by the United States. For some
seven or eight years this struggle continued
until it became apparent that Canada had
to adopt tariff legislation to meet the legislative conditions of the United States,
which operated most seriously against us.
Between 1873 and 1878 a tariff propaganda was successfully carried on in Canada, which in the latter year resulted in
the adoption of protection by an overwhelming majority and the defeat of the
Government of that day. From that date
down to the present time protection has
been the fundamental principle of our fiscal
policy.
Governments advocating free trade have
succeeded Governments that advocated protection, but when faced with the responsibilities of office and .the carrying on of the
national affairs of this country, even

20

SENATE

though their sympathies were not with
the doctrine of protection, national conditions compelled them to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and to maintain
those principles of national policy upon
which the national life of Canada rests.
The United States during its whole history bas based its fiscal policy upon protection.
The Republican party in that
country has been its avowed advocate,
whilst the Deniocratic party has professed
opposition to high tariff principles; yet
during the whole hist'ory of the Democratic
party in office they maintained tariff barriers higher than ever have been maintained in Canada.
With this short historical review in mind
it may therefore be said that the policy of
Canada since Confederation, and likewise
that of the United States, have been committed to the fundamental principles of
protection as opposed to free trade.
In anticipation of every general election
in Canada we are faced with the old
declarations of hostility against a protective tariff, and to-day we find ourselves
facing this same issue as on the many previous occasions when an appeal to the electorate was shortly to be made. We find
the Liberal party adopting the same attitude as they did previous to 1896-that
of all things to all men: free traders in
rural districts, protectionists in the cities;
boxing the compass at all points; not hesitating to sail to every wind that blows.
Then, on the other hand, we find the United
Farmers'
organizations, avowedly free
traders, committed to a condemnation of
all tariffs, and advocating unique systems
of taxation about which they know nothing
and which are as visionary as the views
they entertain upon all general questions
of government.

Without entering into any lengthy disquisition upon the relative merits of the
doctrine of protection or that of free trade,
I take the position that the fiscal policy of
any country should be based entirely upon
the conditions which confront it. A country is not made for trade policies, but
trade policies for the country, and in
framing them every consideratien should
be given to the conditions which we are
called upon to face. In Canada we occupy
one-half of the North American continent:
we have here all the resources calculated
to build up a great nation-a nation which
ultimately should be as virile and as great
as the nation to the south of us. On our
side of the line we have approximately nine
millions of people; on the other side of the
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

line they have 120 millions. Within a little
more than a century they have built up
one of the most powerful nations of the
world; a nation which to-day largely
dominates the nations of Europe. Its products and manufactures go into every part
of the world and largely dictate the international relations that must be adopted by
other nations in every hemisphere. While
an imaginary line separates the two countries, a line made up of sea-coast and internal boundaries, without apparently any
obstruction appearing to the eye between
the two countries, yet they have built
tariff barriers between this country and
theirs that tower higher and are more formidable than if national fortifications were
erected along every mile of their boundaries. To get Canada's products into the
United States this country has generally
been called upon to pay from twenty-five
to fifty per cent on those which were exported to them. National life can only be
built up upon an exchange of commodities,
and if that exchange is carried on under
unfair conditions, or on terms which handicap the one nation as against the other, it
is manifest that it must operate to the
detriment of the nation against whom it is
directed. If Canada is compelled to pay 25
per cent of the value of all its products to
the United States to permit of its exports
crossing that boundary line to which I have
referred, then it seems to me to be nothing
short of national madness to contend that
this should be passively allowed and that
such a course of exchange is of advantage
to the building up of Canada. It is incomprehensible that human reasoning could
advance so preposterous a doctrine.
It
scarcely requires any words to point out
that, if we give 120 millions of people free
access to cross our boundary line with the
products and manufactures of their country, two things must follow-one of which
is that the revenue derivable to-day from a
protective tariff must necessarily fall to
the ground, and that products and manufactures of the United States must necessarily overwhelm and paralyze the efforts
of nine millions against 120 millions.
If we view the situation from this standpoint, as we necessarily must, what would
we have in Canada as against this condition? Canada is peculiarly an agricultural
country, yet can it seriously be contended

that agriculture in Canada could flourish
and prosper while the products of 120
millions are being shipped to Canada under
conditions which would preclude the products of our nine millions from getting into

culturist to find his market for his products? It is manifest he cannot get into
the United States; the tearing down of our
tariff walls would destroy the home market
in Canada, because it is manifest that industrial life in Canada would cease ta
function immediately our tariff walls were
removed, and the home market which he
ha-, to-day would disappear. His access ta
the European markets is handicapped by
the inferiority of his position here in campeting with 120 million% ta the south of
aur boundary, and the like access which
that 120 millions have ta the markets of
Europe. The Canadian farmer must necessarily, therefore, become a mere cipher as
a producer in thus getting access to the
markets of the world.
What about the manufacturer? If aur
tariff walls are practically removed, in
accordance with the representatione of
these gentlemen, we are at once aver'whelmed by the products of the 120 nillions ta the sauth af us. It cannot for a
moment be seriously thought that aur
manufactures could be built up in the
face of this competition whereby the
United States would have access ta aur
muarkets while we are precluded from
having access ta theire.
Canada is comparatively a new country.
We are only on the threshold of aur developuient; the natural resources of this
country have scarcely been scratched; and
yet I unhesitatingly say we have natural
resources which, if developed, are capable
of sustaining and will eventually build
up one of the greatest of Anglo-Saxon
races. Will anyane seriously contend that
this development could take place in the
face of such a policy as that which is
advocated by those who are in opposition
ta the Government of ta-day? This Government is committed ta, the policy of
protection. It is the fundamental plank
in its platform. It in no way equivocates
or evades the issue. It knows and avaws
that through this policy alone can the

deflated in their markets to the extent of
from twelve to fifteen per cent. To gain
access to their markets we are to-day paying them. a higher duty than we impose.
We are their best customer on this continent and notwithstanding the advantages
with which they are thus deriving fromn
Canada they are to-day seriausly. discussing in their Congress the erection against
us of hostile tariff walls so much higher
as ta be practically insurmountable. Today we are seriously facing the effeets of
those adverse conditions, and which dail>
must become intensified.
The constant avowal by political parties in Canada of free trade or the
lowering of the Canadian tariff between the United States and our-ý
selves has left the impression in that country that by the adoption of hostile tariff
legisiation they can secure the control of
our markets in Canada. They have interpreted the declarations of our opponents
to our disadvantage to the extent that they
believe they can cripple our industries,
absorb ourtrade, and ultimately have at
their conmmand this northern half of the
American continent. If, instead of this
insidious policy of bringing about the
ruination of Canada's trade, these gentlemen opeinly avowed annexation to the
United States one could better understand
it and better fight it. The logical regult
of the adoption of such a policy as that
whith is now openly advocated by the
Liberal party and the United Farmers'
organization, and particularly in view of
the present avowed policy of the United
States in increasing its tariff, can only
have one outcome, namely, the reduction of
Canada to be a mere dependent upon the
trade policy of the republic to the south of
us., When this point is reached, as it ultimately would be if our oppanents had
their way in tariff matters, there would be
a graduai absorption of this country by the
United States. It seemns ta me, therefore,
that there are only two courses to pursue,
one of which is ta make this eountry
dependent entirely upon the producing and

sound sense of the people of Canada, as
well as the financial conditions by which
we are governed, must largely dictate and
maintain the fiscal policy under which this
country bas been practically since Confederation.
It is therefore not the advocacy of those theories of free trade that
is injurious to Canada, but it is this constant and continuous assault upon the tariff
policy of this country.
The investment
of capital is ever sensitive to attack and to
change: if capital is to be invested in Canada in the development of our resources,
in the opening up of our trade, and in
the establishment of our industries, there
must be stability and continuity in the
trade policy of this country.
There is
nothing so calculated to disturb the sense
of security, which is so necessary for the
building up of our trade and commerce,
as those periodical attacks which are made
by parties and organs from time to time
in endeavouring to accomplish the defeat
of the Government of the day. The cessation of those irresponsible outbursts, and
attacks upon capital and trade policy, is
a duty which every citizen owes to Canada.
Until there is firmly embedded in the public mind a sense of security as to the trade
policy of the country upon which capital
bas been invested and upon which the
channels of trade have been worked out,
there will be that lack of response to our
public and national interest in the way
of developing our resources and building
up our trade which is indispensable to the
upbuilding of our national greatness.
I feel assured that when the result of
the tariff inquiry is laid before Parliament
it will demonstrate more clearly than ever
the impossibility of this country departing
from its well-established trade principles
and the necessity of maintaining a tariff
sufficiently adequate for the protection of
our industries and the yielding of a revenue necessary for the carrying on of
Government.
. Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: May I ask the honourable gentleman if the report of the
Minister of Finance on the inquiry which
bas been made throughout the country bas
been tabled in the House of Commons?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
tariff inquiry?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot tell my honourable friend. If it bas
not been it soon will be.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: To-morrow.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I can
assure my honourable friends that the report will be forthcoming, and I think it
will be clearly apparent from that report,
when it is presented to Parliament, that
there is only one thing for Canada to do,
and that is to maintain the tariff which
we have been advocating and will continue
to support.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentleman bas the advantage over other members of this House, because we are entirely
in the dark.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: You always were.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I regret
very much the want of knowledge on the
part of my honourable friend with regard
to this important subject. I can scarcely
conceive that he is lying awake at night
awaiting this report. I rather fancy that
my honourable friend bas his own opinions
upon the subject, and that they do not
differ greatly from mine.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Judgment is rendered before the witnesses are heard.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I have to apologize for
dealing so lengthily, and so warmly perhaps, with this subject. It is a matter of
satisfaction that we are again in our permanent Chamber. I do not know that I
agree entirely with the comments which
have been made by my honourable friend
opposite. True, there bas been a contraction of space: this is not as spacious as
the old Chamber was; but we get closer
together, and it is well known that at this
time there is a very commendable attempt,
particularly between different parts of
Canada, to come closer together so that we
may discuss to greater advantage the many
differences which appear at times on the
sky-line. I have no doubt that we shall
become accustomed more and more to the
compactness of this Chamber, and as time
goes on we shall appreciate its many advantages to a greater extent than we do
to-day. I feel assured that we shall have
a very useful and pleasant Session and
that, notwithstanding the differences which
may possibly mark the two sides of the
House upon many questions, when we come
to prorogue we shall find that the interests
of Canada have been well served by the
deliberations of the Senate.

Maclean left the Cabinet. And what was the
statement made by Mr. Calder during the
elections? Speaking in the presence of two
of his colleagues whom I have just mentioned, he said:
We were prepared for the time being te
sink our differences of opinion in so far as
many of the domestic and local problems which
we have are concerned. We must do that to get
union. Just Imagine what would have happened
If Mr. Crerar had sat down with Sir Themas
White to try and get together on questions
of
tariff.
We would never have had Union if one
of
the requirements was that it had to be
reached
on the question of the tariff.

That is what Mr. Calder said to the
people. So I wonder why my honourable
friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) can
claim a mandate for the Government to
touch some of the matters that are mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, and
more especially that important question
to which he devoted about three-quarters
of the time he spent in discussing the questions to come before this Chamber during
the preser]t Session.
It seems clear that the people of Canada in 1917 were told that the tariff question would not be taken up by the Union
Government. It is clear because the Ministers themselves spoke out openly and declared that they had not formed that Government for the purpose of dealing with
any of those delicate questions upon which
they were at variance.

the honourable gentleman a question if he

the fact that those three gentlemen who

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose my
honourable friend would very likely applaud the departure of some members of
the present Cabinet, and we would all agree
if he would press on and ask that the whole
Cabinet resign or offer itself for re-election
at as early a date as possible.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then the honourable gentleman might come in, and that
would be a misfortune.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No, I think not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
said: "We have had a mandate ever since
1911." 1 will discuss for a moment the kind
of mandate which this Government received
in 1917, and, with his permission, I will
revert to 1911. I think that I shall be able
to demonstrate that the elections of 1917
were based on a stupendous fraud, and that
the elections of 1911 were based on duplicity,
or at all events insincerity.
I said the elections of 1917 had been the
result of a tremendous fraud. The Wartime Elections Act was before us. I made
the following statement, which I take .from
page 1149 of the Debates of 1917:
We have devised all kinds of penalties to
prevent ballot-plugging and ballot-switching.

Hon. Mr. BLAIN: Was not the soldier

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course,
there were tens of thousands of votes
taken. I am not prepared to say what
took place when each vote was recorded,
but I know what took place in St. Johns in
the province of Quebec under our eyes,
and I have an idea of what took place behind our backs.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Would my honourable friend be kind enough to tell us what
took place in St. Johns in regard to the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I only know
of the intention to switch votes.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: My honourable

that.

not know. That telegram was published.

they have for those who through this hypocritical War-time Elections Act brought
into power the present Administration. I
shall be told by some of my friends on the

the War-time Elections Act did the trick
for them and that by-gones should be bygones.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We think you die
easily.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You thought
you had killed us for good at that time.
You will see us very much alive at the
next election if you give us a chance.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: All right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, honourable gentlemen will say, " But why speak
of old things?" Those old things took
place yesterday, and I remind you that it is
always more easy for the assailant to forget and forgive the kicks he has given than
it is for the one who has received them.
It was most amusing to hear the
Premier of Canada speak with haughtiness
of his opponents as wreckers, anarchists,
and Bolsheviki. That was his first tack.
But he has come down a peg. Indeed, he
is an ideal preacher of public morality,
because he is holding power by the most
stupendous fraud ever inflicted on a
people.
Honourable gentlemen express
surprise that Quebec resents that treatment, because, after all, it was in a large
measure directed against Quebec. Quebec
decided to join the Confederation after the
conference of 1864, and entered Confederation in 1867 with the full knowledge
that she was losing her equality in numbers, that she would become more and
more a minority. Quebec knew that, but
she entered sincerely and confidently into
an association knowing the contract which
was embodied in the British North
America Act.
Have honourable gentlemen ever stopped to think for a moment
that that decision meant something to the
province of Quebec? To be a minority for
all time is somewhat of a handicap, and
some of the honourable gentlemen who
hear me may remember that they themselves have at some time been a minority
in their province. They were consoled by
thinking that it was but a passing moment, and that the next year or in the
next Parliament they would become a
majority. It was not so with Quebec. We
knew that we would always be a minority,
but we were entitled to believe that we

FEBRUARY 16, 1921
would get a fair deal, that we would be
deait with honestly, and that the franchise would not be tampered with in order
ta surely eliminate us.
Sir George Etienne Cartier, speaking
for Quebec, said that he knew the Englishman -well enough to be convinced that
Quebec would get a fair deal from the
majority. Quebec knows that in 1917 it
did not get a fair deal, and some of My
honourable friends on the other side know
as well as I do that the whole War-time
Electians Act was for the purpose of
stifling its vaice and extinguishing its
legitimate share of influence in Confederation.
Hon. Mr. S HARPE: Is it flot the fact
that this Government holds power to-day,
flot; because of the soldiers' vote, but apart
from that entirely?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have established in this Chamber by figures that
without the phalanx of women who voted
this Government is in a hopeless minority.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
Those are your
figures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend will look at my speech-I
think it was in the Session of 1918-he
will find the figures and he may discuss
them before this debate ends.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We have enough
to listen to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Quebec has
decided that it will not; shake hands with
the organisers and the beneficiaries of
that shameful Act of 1917. It is most
amusing ta see the efforts that are being
made ta, induce Quebec ta enter the Cabinet to-day. No man in Quebec, with any
sense of dignity, will do that thing; they
will first go ta the people. Quebec knows
that it is a bad thing for the province ta
stand as a solid block. When there were
big men at the head of bath political parties the people of Quebec were in the habit
of dividing according 'ta their political
leanings, some being Conservatives and

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Na one who
was in this Chamber in 1917-and I understand my honourable friend was here
--could be surprised at what I say. The
honourable member for Montarville (Han.
Mr. Beaubien), speaking on the other side
of the House, notified his Tory friends
that if Quehec was to be treated as it was
being treated there would corne a time
sooner or later when the Tories of
Ontario would turn towards Quebec for
help and Quebec would not know them.
1 heard that statement made here ta the
Conservatives of this Senate. They smiled
at the time. They are not smiling now.
My honaurable friend the leader of the
Government boasts that the next election
will see them in power. But the cold wind
from. the West has touched their spinal
calumn. It has even penetrated Ontario.
They look in vain for friends. They turn
ta that old-time Conservative province of
Quebec for assaciates, and Quebec does
not; know them, and will nat; know them at
the next election. I do not; think that the
honourable gentleman (Han. Sir James
Laugheed> should be very much scandalized at that statement. Quebec has undoubtedly a right ta choose its own assaciates. After the next electians I hope
that the people of Quebec who feel politically as does my honourable friend from
Granville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) will then
go on their way as Conservatives, and that
Liberals will follaw their own traditional
lines; 'but nat until after the next
elections.
I have endeavoured ta show my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
that he can find no mandate from. the
elections of 1917. At every Session I have
told my honourable friend that the Province of Quebec looked upon this Government as a de facto Government. That is
what the world at large calis the present
Russian Government-a de facto goverfiment. My honourable friends may derive
some consolation fromi the fact that they
were elected in 1911. Yes, there was an
election in 1911, in which the people of

SENATE
Canada recorded their votes and the Borden
Government went into power. I have
nothing to say as to the regularity of the
vote that was taken in 1911. But, as the
effects of that vote of 1911 are of considerable importance to Canada, as they
are before us at the present moment and
have raised problems that we must face,
is it not natural that I should revert to
the elections of 1911? Those problems
which arise from the elections of that
year are the attitude of the Western
farmers towards the manufacturers of the
East, and the attitude of Washington as
exemplified in the Fordney Bill. I hold
that the situation which has arisen in the
West and seems to have divided the country geographically on the tariff question
is a natural result of the elections of 1911,
as is the Fordney Bill now before Congress
at Washington. I have heard with some
degree of amusement my good friend the
Tory and my good friend the manufacturer
speak impatiently of the class movement
and of the egotism of the Western farmer,
who was simply looking at his own interest
and not thinking of the general interests
of Canada. Yes, I have listened with some
amusement, because I remember the treatment the Western farmer received at the
hands of the Tory party and the manufacturers of the East in 1911. A selflsh
class movement?
Let us see who was
selfish and who was insincere in 1911. I
maintain, and I think I shall establish,
that the stand of the farmers of the West
is the logical outcome of Tory insincerity
and of the manufacturers' fierce egotism
and shortsightedness. It is interesting to
prove it now that the United States are
reacting against it.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: The honourable
gentleman can prove it to his own satisfaction, but not to the satisfaction of the
House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
has referred to the Treaty of Reciprocity
of 1854, which was law until 1866, and
he has stated briefly what was the situation of this country after the repeal of
that Treaty. In natural products only, the
Reciprocity Treaty increased our trade between the United States and Canada within
a few years from $20,000,000 to $80,000,000. Already in 1859 the Americans were
claiming that the deal was a twenty-to-one
deal against them; that we were selling
twenty to one under that Reciprocity

for one outward reason and for another,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

which perhaps was the determining factor,
but which remained in the background.
The pretext for its repeal was that in
1858-59 we in Canada had raised our duty
on manufactured articles to such an extent
that the Americans, who thought they
could even up with us through their sale of
such goods, were being very nearly shut
out. The other reason, which was perhaps
the determining one, but was not mentioned officially, was the fact that England
and Canada, or some elements in England
and Canada had shown too much sympathy
for the South during the War of Secession.
The mere threat of the termination of that
treaty was such that the Conservative Government in 1865-66 sent Sir A. T. Galt, Mr.
Howland, Mr. William A. Henry, of Nova
Scotia, and Mr. A. J. Smith, of New Brunswick-although. Confederation was not an
actual fact-to Washington to try to prevent the abrogation of the Treaty. They
met with no success. In 1868 the Sir John
A. Macdonald Government inserted this
clause in their Customs Act, which remained as "a standing offer to the United
States." It is clause 6 of chapter 44:
Any or ail of the articles mentioned

in the said schedule, upon proclamation of the
Governor in Council, whenever the United States
shall provide for the importation of similar
articles from Canada into that country free of
duty, or at a less rate of duty than is now imposed on the importation from Canada of such
articles into the United States.

Schedule D mentions the articles that
may be exchanged freely with the United
States, by virtue of that statutory enactment, whenever the United States are
pleased to reciprocate.
An expression
which my honourable friend (Hon. Sir
James Lougheed) used comes back to my
ear. He said that ever since 1866 people
throughout this country have been clamouring for reciprocity or a fair deal with the
United States, and he deprecated that
action, for which, I surmise, he charged
the Liberal party with being mainly responsible.
Now, the Conservative party,
to which he belonged, had brought about
that statutory enactment; and the goods
that might be exchanged with the United
States whenever it pleased the United
States to give us reciprocity were:
Animals of all kinds.
Fresh, smoked and salted meats.
Green and dried fruits.
Fish of all kinds.

gone over to the United States, Erastus

in Ontario in favour of commercial union.
The Board of Trade of Toronto, being asked
to make a pronouncement-Toronto, remember!-passed the following resolution:
Resolved, That the largest possible freedom of
Commercial intercourse between Canada and the
United States compatible with Canada's relations to Great Britain was desirable, but that
the Board could not entertain any proposai
which would place Great Britain at any disadvantage as compared with the United States or
which would tend in any measure however
siall. to wealken the bonds which bind Canada
to the Empire.

I cite this resolution of the Toronto
Board of Trade to show how strong was
the clamour for reciprocity, even in the
good city of Toronto.
In 1888 Sir Richard Cartwright moved
in the House of Commons in favour of unlimited reciprocity in natural and industrial products. A somewhat lengthy debate took place on his resolution which
was finally defeated by a party vote. On
the 5th of March, 1891, we had a general
election in this country. I suppose very
few of the honourable members of this
House are ignorant of what took place
at that time, although I see quite a number of junior menbers who may not have
been participants in that contest. I was
very much interested in that electionand that does not make me so old, after all.

Canada desired, namely, reciprocity in
natural products.
The campaign was not yet over wlen
Mr. Blaine, the American Secretary of
State, was written to by a member of
Congress for Rochester, New York, and
asked if it were true that he had offered
to discuss with Canada reciprocity in
natural products only. Mr. Blaine made
this answer to the member for Rochester:
I authorize to contra-dict rumours you refer
to. There are no negotiations whatever on foot
for a reciprocity treaty with Canada, and you
may lie tissuredl no such schene for reciprocity
with the Dominion confined to natural products
will be entertained by this Government. We
know nothing of Sir Charles Tupper comi-ng to
Washington.

Yet the trick was done, and the elections were carried by Sir John Macdonald.
This was one of the most extraordinary
incidents in Canadian politics, and I do
not know whether any member of this
Chamber has ever realized the fact that
for once every elector in Canada who went
to the polls, Conservative, Liberal, or Independent, voted for reciprocity in natural
products.
That was the policy propounded by Sir John Macdonald, and upon
which he was consulting the electors in
contradistinction to the unlimited reciprocity which the Liberals were supporting. The Liberals voted for reciprocity
in natural products inasmuch as they voted

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I can

It did not provoke Sir John A. Macdonald's

only disclosed after the election.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: My honourable
friend will allow an interruption, because
this is rather ancient history. He will

gentleman, now dead, who, was down at

and that we should go in for annexation,
and that Sir Richard Cartwright had
hoped to, congratulate him as the Senator
at Washington for Ontario. I will not
say how that letter became public, but it
was in the hands of Sir John A. Macdonald
at that famous meeting at Windsor, Ontario, where hie was accompanied by Sir
Charles Tupper.
I remember
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

was a free lance, following his own fancy,
and I was going to, say at times his employer's, but perhaps that would be too
harsh. He adhered to the Erastus Wiman
movement, and it would carry me too far
to explain the difference between the Erastus Wiman movement, which perhaps Mr.
Farrer was supporting and the policy
which Sir Richard Cartwright propounded
in the resolution of 1888. But we remember that it was good play, it was scientific
play on the part of the "«old wizard," the
most able politician of the time, Sir John
A. Macdonald.
Now, in 1891, when Sir John A. Macdonald decided to offer the people of Canada reciprocity in natural products, it
was feit that it would create somewhat of
a turmoil among his manufacturing friends
in Toronto and other places in Ontario;
so hie rushed to Toronto and called them
in "confab," in what was called the Red
Parlour meeting, when hie saîd to them:
"Gentlemen, you need not be afraid of my
policy; it is in regard to natural products
only, and does not affect industrial matters;
I arn not lowering the wall; keep your
souls in peace; take it for granted that
I arn not touching you in the slightest,
even with a feather; I arn simply giving
the people of Canada what they want, the
American market for their natural products." The manufacturers were reassured, and accepted this statement, and we
did not hear a wail nor see a wince during
that election. They accepted the principle
that Canada should have a certain degree
of protection in industrial products and an
open market to the south for its surplus
farm products.

STANDING COMMITTEES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON

SELECTION.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask the House to permit me to move concurrence in the report of the Committee
of Selection before we proceed with the Orders of the Day, so that the notices involved may be sent out to the different
members? There are a couple of hundred
notices, I understand, to be issued.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will the House allow
me to say that the name of the honourable gentleman from La Salle (Hon. Senator Godbout) was put by mistake in place
of mine on the Private Bills Committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
have much pleasure in bringing about the
change suggested by my honourable friend
from Mille Iles (Hon. Mr. David).
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, before the motion is put I would like
to draw the attention of the House to the
fact that this proceeding is a little unusual.
I do not want to raise any objection, but
I think it is well to call attention to this
fact. As a rule we do not deal with any
business until we have disposed of the Address. Probably this procedure is more
convenient for honourable members of the
Senate, but I do not think it should be allowed to pass without drawing attention
to the change that we are making in our
procedure.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We always reserve that right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No precedent.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Before the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) resumes the debate on the
Address, I think that we should be sure
that we are proceeding in the right way.
I quite concur in the view expressed by
the honourable gentleman on my right
(Hon. Mr. Bostock). As I understand, the
honourable leader of the Government asked
the leave of the House to move the adop-

tion of the report of the Committee on
Selection, and the honourable gentleman
from Mille Iles (Hon. Mr. David) and
other honourable gentlemen thought that
the report needed certain amendments. It
seems to me that the correct procedure is
that on the motion of the honourahle leader
the gentlemen who wish changes made
should move those changes as amendments,
and that we should not adopt the report
as a whole, as I understand we are doing,
and later take up the amendments piecemeal and separately. I think the businesslike way is for any honourable gentleman
who bas an amendment to move it before
the report is adopted.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: It was my intention
to have an amendment moved, but I was
waiting for the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), who is not
present, as I counted upon him to make
the motion.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will move the
motion, if necessary. It is only a mistake
in substituting one name for another, and
the honourable leader of the Government
has agreed to have the change made.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
be changed accordingly.
The motion was agreed to.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY.

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the Address in reply to His
Excellency the Governor General's Speech
at the opening of the Session.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, when my honourable friend
the leader of the Government delivered
his address yesterday he stated that after
1866 there were in Canada people who were
constantly clamouring for the American
market, and he deprecated that attitude on
the part of Canadian people. I was proceeding to establish that reciprocity in natural products was the uniform policy of both
political parties in Canada up to 1911. I
had reached the year 1891 and the elections
that took place in that year, which were
won by Sir John A. Macdonald on that issue.
He presented an alleged offer of reciprocity
in natural products coming, as he said, from
the United States. He presented that offer
to our people for endorsation, as against
the Liberal programme of unrestricted
reciprocity. I think I am stating clearly
what was the issue in the elections of 1891.

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
Sir John A. Macdonald carried those electjdns with a slight majority, although before the close of the poil the Secretary of
State of the United States, Mr. Blaine, had
publicly disclaimed having made any offer
of a discussion iooking to reciprocity in
natural products. This did flot prevent
Sir John A. Macdonald's Government f£rom
sending to Washington, in the month following the elections, a delegation to see if the
door could not be opened. That delegation
was composed of Sir Charles Tupper and
the Honourable Messieurs Thompson and
Foster. The situation which confronted
our Canadian delegation when they reached
Washington was somewhat delicate. They
went to the British Ambassador to ha
introduced. The British Ambassador made
bis officiai request, and Mr. Blaine answered
in. writing to Sir Julian Pauncefote that
he desired first to have it recognized by the
Canadian delegates, that no negotiation
had. been initiated by him for a treaty based
on an exchange of natural products only.
And Sir Charles, who led that delegation,
when he returned to Canada empty handed
as usual, made the statement, and wrote
it in his report, that his* first declaration
when he entered the presence of the Secretary of State was to agree with him. that it
was flot the United States nor himself, Mr.
Blaine, that had initiated the proceedings
for reciprocity
in natural products.
Although they had seen each other, nothing
came of this visit. The situation remained
as it had been since 1866. There remained
on aur statute book, as I have said,"a standing affer of reciprocity," covering practically every item which had formed the basis
of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854-66.
.When Sir George Foster in 1894 modified
the tariff, he again in the new act devoted
five clauses to an effort to obtain recipracity in natural products with the United
States. These clauses in the statute of
1894, chapter 33, are the seventh, eighth,
tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, fairly reproducing the
standing offer that had
been on our statute book from 1879.
But aIl these pilgrimages to Washington,
as well as the correspondence which passed
between Canada, Great Britain, and the
United States, were in vain tiil 1911, when
Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mr. Fielding at
last succeeded where their predecessors
had failed. We then saw that what up
to that date had been thought pure goid
for the two parties, and for the Conservative party especially, had changed to lead
over night.
When this policy of reciprocity in natural products was pro5-3

pounded by Sir John A. Macdonald and
offered to the people twenty years before,
it was an ideai policy, and when the election of 1891 was over and won, as I said,
by ail the people declaring themseives in
favour of that poiicy, we ail feit assured
that we could die under the British fiag.
But when the Liberals succeeded in getting
what the people had voted for unanimousiy
in 1891 it became downright treason.
The campaign of 1911 was carried with
the aid of a few sîogans. The hoardings
were covered with British and Ainerican
flags, with these words underneath: "Under which flag?" Speakers in every village proclaimed that we should have no
truck nor trade with the United States,
and the manufacturers throughout the land
were mobilized in a fierce assault against
the reciprocity pact called the Taft-Fielding
pact. These manufacturers were probabiy
the same men who in the Red Parlour in
Toronto had accepted the statement of Sir
John A. .Macdonald in 1891 that they were
flot touched by the arrangement-.that the
treaty did flot affect the degree of protection which they had enjoyed up to that
date; and yet, after adhering to the principles of Sir John A. Macdonald in 1891,
after standing by and helping with their
subscriptions, as the rumour went, in 1911
they went into hysterics and forced the
Conservative party to renounce old policies
and principies, ana to inveigh against the
dangers of restricted reciprocity with the
United States in natural products.
In 1911 the nianufacturers of Canada
occupied exactly the sanie position with
regard to the United States that they had
ôccupied in 1891, and nothing justified
theni in assailing the Treaty and ciosing
the American nmarket to the products of
the farm. They dictated a new policy ta
the Tory party. I was present in the
gallery of the House of Gommons when
Mr. Fielding made bis statement outlining
the advantages which would accrue te
Canada under the Treaty, and it wouid
flot have been possible to repress the Conservative members of the House who, one
after another, interrupted the Minister of
Finance to ask him whether a certain
article in which they or their county was
interested, was on the free iist, and when
Mr. Fielding said, "Yes, it isP they applauded and leaped with delight. I saw
that happen in many instances, as the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentleman of this House owe it to
the amenities of parliamentary debate to
observe with exactitude the practice invariably followed in parliament since Confederation. My honourable friend the Postmaster General has absolutely denied the
phrase or the language attributed to him
by my honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) and if my honourable
friend had the characteristie courtesy which
has ever marked the amenities of debate in
this House-and I have no doubt he hashe would not seek to evade the responsibility which is cast upon his shoulders, but
would at once bow to the amenities of debate and the wishes of this House and withdraw the expression.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:-justice to
the honourable the Postmaster General. I
have said that this statement needed explanation, and I gave explanation as falling from the lips of the honourable Postmaster General himself. It seems to me
this was the fair thing to do. I am asking the honourable gentleman if it is not
the explanation which he gave himself.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: What does the
honourable gentleman say?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will repeat.
I say that as far as my recollection goes
the honourable gentleman explained that
that phrase, or one similar to it, was not
one that he had coined himself, but that in
quoting the speech of a prominent public
man in the province of Quebec he had
read such a phrase.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Read it yourself.

the Postmaster General was shooting holes
in the British flag in Arthabaska he knew
very well that it meant that I had actually
said those words.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is a very
simple question. I am asking the honourable gentleman what explanation he gave
of this incident, and I stated that my recollection is that that statement was as I
have made it.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER:

Take it back.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The honourable
gentleman is in such a pitiable position
now that he has called to his help the
honourable member for Arthabaska (Hon.
Mr. Lavergne). If there is a witness who
can be useful to the honourable member,
I want him to speak and say what he has
to say, and I ask him when and at what
place was he present when I said the incriminating words, and what w;ere the incriminating words. Will he please state
that?
Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: The honourable
senator said those words-that he did not
care if he shot through the British flag.
Anyhow-I do not remember well, but he

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: And I ask that

Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: I know you
will deny it, but I am sure I was there and
I heard you.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: This incident
has lasted too long. The honourable member froni De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) attributed to the honourable the
Postmaster General an expression said to
have been made outside of this House, and
now the honourable the Postmaster General
denies that. So I believe that the honourable member who is speaking (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) ought to withdraw the expression.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Withdraw.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, the expression complained of is
the following phrase: " In 1910, when the
present Postmaster General was occupied
in shooting holes in the British flag in
Drummond-Arthabaska." That is the expression that I am asked to withdraw. I
withdraw. The honourable gentleman did
not shoot holes in the British flag.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
An Hon. SENATOR: Play the man.
After that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
meeting, in which the honourable the Postmaster General took part-and we have
not yet heard from his own lips what were
his exact words-and after the speech appeared in the Montreal papers, the Montreal Herald sent a telegramn to the Acting
Prime Minister of Canada, who was none
other than Sir George Eulas FosterHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I rise to a point of order.
My honourable friend is only continuing
and aggravating his offence. He is endeavouring to equivocate regarding a plain

statement, the implication of which. was
that the Postmaster Gene-,al made a certain remark. My honourable friend should
play the game fairly and withdraw.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Withdraw.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, surely
when I declare that I withdraw the phrase
which was complained of, my duty towards
the Chair is done. But I say that I have
flot yet heard from the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Blondin) exactly what explanation he gave outaideHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is the
honourable gentleman bound to state what
he said? You make a statement and he
denies that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He will have
occasion to speak, and he will state what
he really did say. I ask this House. to suspend judgment upon the speech of my honourable friend. 1 was not present. The
honourable gentleman from Arthabaska
was present. I ask the Senate to suspend
its judgnient regarding the exact words
which the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Blondin) used, because I do not myseif
know what he did say.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: My honourable
friend admits that he does not himself know
what I said.
No, except
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
from what the newspaperÉ reported and
from what the honourable gentleman said
himself. But that we shaîl have later.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, play
the game. Take it back.
Now, when
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND:
that campaign wag proceeding and the
speech of my honourable friend and other
speeches were being made in DrummondArthabaska, a -telegram was sent by the
Montreal Herald to Sir George Eulas
Foster asking him if the statement of policy
of the Nationalist candidate had his approval and if he had no advice to give to
the electors of Drummond-Arthabaska; for
there was no Conservative cgndidate ia that
fight. There was a Nationalist candidate
and a Liberal candidate. Sir George Foster's answer was: "Anything is good to
beat Laurier."
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I think he was
right.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 0f two evils cboose

38

SENATE

At that moHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment his loyalty to the flag was for him a
negligible quantity, provided Laurier was
defeated. The Nationalist movement was
thus started on its way with Sir George
Eulas Foster's blessing.
In 1911 there was another issue: it was
the navy question. It was assailed from
two angles. In the English provinces the
policy of building a Canadian navy was
called "the tin-pot navy of the Laurier
Government." That "tin-pot navy" was intended for the protection of our coasts,
and in 1914 the Conservatives realized that
they had again sacrificed the interests of
Canada in deferring the building of ships
for a Canadian navy, which would have
protected our coasts both on the Pacific
and on the Atlantic against the raids of
the German navy. But the Conservative
party are not very proud. They are now
proceeding on the saine lines as the Laurier
Government in building and developing a
Canadian navy, and they seem to be quite
satisfied with the "tin-pot navy" which they
assailed in 1911.
Can they boast of their 1911 mandate?
They then subsidized the whole Nationalist
campaign and tried to carry in Quebec the
principle of " no contribution to imperial
wars outside of Canada." I have had occasion to state in this Chamber that every
Nationalist candidate was helped by Conservative money; that Sir Herbert Ames,
representing the Conservative party, having under his charge some eighteen counties, mostly English-speaking, or Englishspeaking to a certain extent, had left the
rest of the province of Quebec to Mr. Monk
and Mr. Bourassa. That was the division
in the organization of the province of Quebec. I stated in this House that Sir Herbert Ames took the list of the French Canadian electors in his eighteen counties to the
office of Le Devoir and asked that Le Devoir
preaching "no contribution to Imperial wars
outside of Canada" be distributed during
the month preceding the election in those
eighteen English-speaking counties
in
which there were French-Canadians, and
that he paid with his own cheque, "Herbert
B. Ames," for the distribution of Le Devoir
in those eighteen counties. I stated that
that Nationalist campaign had been subsidized by the Conservative party, and I
added that outside of the ordinary organization and the subsidies which were distributed during the election, the sum of

$40,000 was given by Sir Hugh Graham,

Lord Atholstan himself, to twenty NationalHon. Mr. FOWLER.

ist counties, in order to better influence
their returns on the night of the elections.
And Mr. BourassaHon. Mr. BLONDIN: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Would the honourable gentleman mind telling us who was
the Liberal organizer and treasurer during
that election?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1908?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will not
equivocate.
The honourable gentleman
thinks it was myself. It was not myself.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: You were in that
position no longer?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No longer?
My honourable friend takes it for granted
that I had been in it before?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would take
some time to explain to him the working
of the organization of the Liberal partyHon. Mr. BLONDIN: It is very complicated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -but we are
not here for that purpose. It was not coinplicated at all; and if I told him with how
little money the Liberal party could carry
on an election in the province of Quebec
he would be very much surprised indeed.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: That was not the
opinion of your friends.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: What is the inference?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say to
the honourable gentleman that never was I
the treasurer of the Liberal party in the
province of Quebec. I make that clear-cut
affirmation.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: What answer did
the honourable gentleman give to the Hon.
Jean Provost when certain accusations
were made against him?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No accusation,
within my knowledge, was ever made
against me by the Hon. Jean Provost.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Would the honourable gentleman permit me to refresh his
memory?

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may tell the
honourable gentleman that rny memory is
very clear; because if the Honourable Jean
Provost had assailed rny character in any
manner or form, I would have taken an
action against him.
Mr. Bourassa, in his paper and in a book
which hie pubiished, admitted that the Nationalist niovement in 1911 had been subsidized and carried on by Conservative
nioney; and I was arnused to find in the
Montreai Gazette of the 7th of February
instant a statement by Mr. Armand Lavergne to the sarne effect. In Kingston, touching on Canada's naval policy and on the
question as to whether this country should
have a navy to be used in foreign waters,
Mr. Lavergne recailed that in the general
election of 1911 the Nationalists were
aliied with the Tories, and hie added that
the alliance was financed from the loyal
city of Toronto.
I have said that the election of 1917 was
carried by fraud. I think I have estabiished
that the election of 1911 was carried by
deception at least, to use a very mild exThese are the - sources from,

peace within and peace without. We had
extended the hand of friendship and of
neighbouriy fellowship to our American
cousins. Tory rule has disrupted the Canadian famiiy, each group mistrusting the
other and ciamouring for its rights and for
justice. Tory rule has estranged us from
our neighbours to the south and we are
threatened with a fiscal war and reprisais.
Is it any wonder that the people of Canada
are restiess? They have wiped ont every
provincial Conservative government in the
land. They are ready and anxious to sit
in judgrnent upon this Federai Tory Governent, which is ashamed to fly its reai
colors and to show itseif under its reai
naine.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, I arn giad, like those who
have preceded me, to pay a tribute to the
excellent speeches made by the mover and
the seconder of the Address. They showed
an intimate knowiedge of the politicai and
general affairs of this country, and their
speeches were deiivered in a rnost acceptable manner. We had a very calm, dispas-

39

sionate presentation of the case from his
standpoint on the part of the honourable
leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Bostock). His speeches are always caim and
and,
rancour,
without
dispassionate,
although fromn a wrong standpoint, well
presented. We had also, a characteristic
speech from the leader of the Government
-a speech that must, from its form, for
what it contained, and from the manner
in which it was delivered, have carried
conviction into the somewhat stony and
obdurate hearts of honourabie gentlemen
opposite.
1 cannot entirely agree with the statements that have been made by honourable
gentlemen who have preceded me as to
this Chamber. I think it very unfortunate
that this Chamber has been made so small.
It is narrower than the old Chamber by
about five feet, I understand. It does not
afford proper accommodation for the generai public. This is the oniy part of the
Parliament Buildings which is devoted ta
the general public on gala days. The gaileries that are here, fore and aft, are a
disgrace to a Chamber of this character.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They would not
be suitable in an ordinary country theatre.
I would be almost afraid, at my age, ta
risk my _life in climbiiig _to those steep
seats that are up there: I might have a
fali and break my neck. There was no
reason in the worid why this Chamber
should not have been extended twenty feet
to the ieft. There is a series of dark rooms
there that rnight very weii have been
omitted, and the Chamber might have been
extended so as to make it spacious and
fitting for this great country. We are
supposed to be building here for one
hundred years to corne, and we have
criticized the men who in 1860, 1 think,
purchased the site for these buildings. We
have said they were men without vision
or they wouid have made the site largerthey wouid have extended it at ieast to
Queen street, Sa as ta have spacious grounds
and a great avenue leading from the
centre out through the city. After sixty
years, with ail the growth and development
that this great country of ours has had
in that time, and with the tremendous
development which those of us who have
faith in Canada believe will come in the
future, it seemis to me that there was a
great iack of vision on the part of the
men who designed this building, that they
shouid have perpetrated this--shail 1 say

10

SENATE

crime?-at least this grievous and isad
mistake. It will certainly have to be
changed. The general public pay the cost
of thjs building, and the right and interest
of the general publie should bave been
considered when this Chamber was constructed. We bave a very fine Parliarnent
building here, probably the finest in the
world. Being the latest building, it is the
most modern and up-to-date, and it is a
pity it should be spoilt by what I have
pointed out as the defect in this particular
Chamber. The galleries could very easily
be extended by raising the roof on the
outside. That might be done perhaps
instead of rnoving the walls, because the
rnoving of the walls rnight destroy the
symrnetry of the Chamber.
I cannot pass to other subjects without
referring to this ceiling. It reminds me
of nothing so rnuch as a circus van. I
think it is entirely ont of place, and it
shows very poor taste on the part of the
architect, at least if he is responsible; and
I rnust to sorne extent find fault with the
honourable gentlemen who are on the
Building
Committee
representing
the
Senate. They are both my good friends,
and I arn very sorry to have to say anything; but in a public way I am obliged
to say to them that 1 think they have very
grievously neglected their duty.
Now I corne to the speech of my honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), for I do not intend to take
very much tirne. If this were a meeting
of an antiquarian society, that speech of
my honourable friend's would be perhaps
in place. He certainly showed greut
antiquarian
research
in
preparing
that
speech.
He
mnust
have spent
sleepless nights and
laborious days
in cornpiling the material
for
it.
He travelled back to before Confederation,
and carne down step by step, haltingly and
slowly, to the present day, when he got into the altercation with the Postrnaster
General, frorn which he emerged pretty
badly scarred. I regret that the honourabie
gentleman did not see fit to admit he was
wrong, and to withdraw. I can understand
how it rnight hurt bis pride to admit that
he was wrong, because he is a very aggressive man, and I arn inclined to be a littie
that way myself; but surely that is the
proper thing to do. We cannot conduct
the aifairs of Parliarnent unless we recognize the rules of debate.
When an
honourable gentleman denies a staternent,
the only fair thing to do is for the one
making it to take it back. The honourable
Hon

Mr. FOWLER.

gentleman opposite found very great difficulty in doing that, and when he did it he
did not do it in a whole-hearted way, but
grudgîngly and as though he was forced.
to do so at the point of a gun.
The honourable gentleman bas charged
that the elections of 1911 were won by
duplicity. I do not quite know what he
means by that, unless it be that the issue
was clouded by the victorious *party, and
I cannot see how he can possibly prove
that there was any clouding of the issue.
It was a clear issue as to whether or not
we should have reciprocity or flot with the
United States; in other words, whether we,
the free people of Canada, should hand
over the making of our tariff to the people
to the south of us. That is what the whole
question resolves itself into. That was the
bargain made by the two eminent delegates
sent to the United States to negotiate with
one of the cleverest and rnost acute statesmen in the United States,' William H.
Taft, and, to use a common phrase, he
"ýput it over them for fair." We won by
a handsorne rnajority, and the country did
flot suifer in any way thereby.
Then the ionourable gentleman cornes
down to the election of 1917, and he saysI want to quote bis exact words, because I
was a little surprised at these particular
words: "The province of Quebec will neyer
shake hands with this Government until we
have revenge for the fraud of 1917."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Revenge?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, revenge. You
spoke of revenge. Here is what the honourable gentleman says: "Quebec bas decided
that it will not shake hands with this Government until the fraud of 1917 is wiped
out." That means revenge, and the honourable gentleman spoke of revenge. What does
he rnean by that? Does he rnean that. no
matter how well the policy of this Governrnent may suit the material interests of
the province of Quebec, because of the
War-time Elections Act of 1917 Quebec
will not vote for this Government, but will
choose rather a party with whose policy
it does not agree? Is that what he says?
Does the honourable gentleman mean to
tell the members of this House that the
people of the province of Quebec are so lost
to ail sense of their own interests, so lacking in foresight, so lacking in wisdom and
sensibility, that for the sake of revenge
they will do this?
The honourable gentleman speaks of
mandates. What mandate bas he from the

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
province of Quebec ta speak so glibly for
that province? As has already been pointed out by the Postrnaster General, he neyer
had a rnandaïe of any kind tram any constituency in the province of Quebec, and yet
he cornes here and speaks for the whole
province.
Does he intend that this revenge on tbe
part of the province of Quebec shall apply
to individuals as welI as to parties? Is
that what we are ta understand from hirn?
How about the hanourable member for
Assinibeia (Hon. Mr. Turriff)? Are we
ta have the pain of seeing the scalp of the
honourable gentleman from Assiniboia,
with its silver hair aIl gary and dedabbled
with blood, hanging on the totem pale cf
the wigwam of the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier?
Han. Mr. TURRIFF:

Do not worry.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Haw about Hion.
Mr. Maclean of that ilk? Is he to be
treated in the same way? - e bas crossed
the floor and is sitting in tbe seat of the
would-be migbty. Is be also ta be punished
because he saw bis duty in a certain way
at a certain time and did it? Is that what
the bonourable gentleman means, or is it
only revenge against a party and net
against individuals?
Witb wbarn is the quarrel .of Quebec?
Frorn whom is the quarrel? Is it from the
province cf Quebec, or frarn the Grit party
in the province cf Quebec wbicb was injured by the,1917 electien, if tbere was any
injury? As a resuit cf the electien cf
1917, wbat was done to work barm te the
province of Quebec? Wbatever harm was
dane was done te the Grit party in tbe province cf Quebec, and as it was fairly successful tbere, I fail ta see bow the quarrel
Migbt arise. The Grit party outside cf the
province cf Quebec was pretty badly demoralized, but that surely sbould be the quarrel
of tbe Grit party putside the province of
Quebec. I venture ta say tbat rny bonourable
friend bas ne mandate ta speak in this
House in regard te this matter except it
be from the Grit party in tbe province cf
Quebec, wbicb at tbe present tirne seems
te be fairly strong.
The benourable gentleman says that
Quebec did not get a fair deal. In wbat
way did not Quebec get a fair deal? The
bonourable gentleman failed in every respect to prove bis point. Tbe bonourable

women having the vote. Who among the
women had the vote? It was the wives, the
daughters, and the mothers who had said
to their husbands, their fathers, and their
sons: "Go and fight that the world may
be free and safe for democracy." Those
were the women who had the voteintelligent women, loyal women-and what
harm could possibly come from that?
Those are the charges which my honourable friend makes, and he says that those
acts constitute a crime that can never be
forgiven until they are wiped out by the
defeat of this Government. I think my
honourable friend will have difficulty in
proving his point in that regard. My
honourable friend has gone into ancient
history; he has recounted the history of
this country since, I think, 1866.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: 1854.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1854, was it? I
know he began a long way back; and what
has he proved? He has proved, according
to his own view, that we should have
accepted the pact of reciprocity with the
United States which his friends negotiated
in 1911. What is the use of fighting out
these old issues? They were fought and
decided at the polls ten years ago. Since
that time much water bas passed over the
dam; since that time the greatest epoch
in the history of the world bas passed, and
to-day we are face to face with other
conditions. Why waste the time of this
House? Why waste the time of honourable
gentlemen here discussing these old issues?
It is not my purpose to follow the
honourable gentleman through the tortuous
course that he bas pursued in that regard.
I say the issues before us are sufficient
without discussing those matters of the
dry and musty past. Let us get together
in this country. Let us forget that we are
Englishmen or Irishmen, Scotchmen or
Frenchmen, and let us remember that we
are and should be, first of all, Canadians.
That is the first thing. Then let us remember that we are partners in the greatest political organization that the world
bas ever seen. We ought to be proud to
think that we are partners; not subordinate, but full partners-in the great
British Empire which makes for everything that is good in civilization and sets
its face sternly against everything that is
bad. Let us forget these racial questions.
I do not care whether a man is French or
English, Irish or Scotch; if he is a man who
does his duty by the country and tries to
make himself a good citizen in order that
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

this great country with its great extent
of territory and great natural resources
should be what it ought to be, this will be
one of the greatest countries in the world.
Some people are built upon such narrow
lines that they cannot see beyond their
own dooryards. Let us remember that we
have one of the finest countries in the
world, a country of great natural resources and great potential wealth, and that
all we need is an increase of population.
Let us be careful to handpick that population in order that we may have not only
the greatest country in the world, but
a splendid, sturdy citizenship that will
make this country prosper as no country
under the face of heaven shall prosper in
the future.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, my first duty is a very pleasant
one. I want to thank and compliment the
mover and the seconder of the Address,
particularly the mover, coming as he does
from Quebec, where he was born and
brought up amongst our own people. I
can tell the members of this House who do
not understand French that he spoke very
good French, and said very nice things in
French. He went to a French school, Montmagny College, and he was then a schoolmate of the honourable gentleman from the
Gulf (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance). I may also
say that the mover of the Address is a man
who bas very large interests in this country. He is a man of great substance, and
when he speaks about business matters he
knows very well the full importance of
what he says. As to the seconder of the
Address, the honourable gentleman from
Pembroke (Hon. Mr. White), he is an old
parliamentarian who graduated from the
other House, and it was easy for him to
make a good speech, and he did it.
While complimenting the mover and the
seconder of the Address, I cannot praise
the Speech from the Throne.
I do
not think there is very much in it. It is
remarkable for what is not in it. The most
momentous question that we should like to
hear about was not mentioned. The Speech
from the Throne harks back to protection,
and as the leader of the House told us in
his speech, protection is forty years old.
The honourable gentleman from Mille Iles
(Hon. Mr. David) says: "That is nothing:
I was fighting for protection in 1871, fortynine years ago." At that time there was
an exodus of our people from Montreal
and the province of Quebec to the United
States to work in the factories there. They

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
were leaving this country in droves, driven
away by the nefarious policy of the Conservative Government of the time. The
honourable gentleman from Mille Iles (Hon.
Mr. David) and the honourable gentleman
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) remember that very well. They said: "Why
don't we have factories in Canada?" They
started what they called the Parti National-the national party, and that name
bas now been adopted, for we have the National Liberal and Conservative party.
One might write books and books about free
trade and protection; everybody has his
own opinion on that question; but the fact
remains that if the honourable gentlemen
on the other side think so much of protection they must think very highly of the
people of the province. of Quebec who
started this policy, the support of industry.
It was started in Montreal, and the first
man who established a large cotton mill
there was Victor Hudon. He was regarded
as a visionary in establishing that large
factory when cotton was grown in the
South. The Hudon Cotton Mills are now
part of the Dominion textile plant. But
there are two kinds of protection; there is
good protection and bad protection. We
are in favour of good protection, the Laurier protection, whereby everyone becomes
rich. That is the protection we believe in.
Let us take the Canadian Pacific railway
as the financial barometer of this country.
What did we find when our old friends the
Tories, with their protection, were in
power away back, we will say, in 1893?
We are all referring back to those days;
perhaps it is because we are growing old.
At what was G.P.R. stock selling then? At
85. But in June 1896 a change came over
this country; the sun of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's administration shone upon the land,
and there followed a period of glorious
prosperity. The C.P.R. stock rose with
the rest, and within just a few years after
Sir Wilfrid Laurier came to power it was
up to 100, and by 1904 it had reached 175;
then it passed 200 and went as high as 250,
and was on its way to 300. That is what
happened under the régime of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier-under a régime of protection as
I understand it, that is, the protection of
industries that deserve to be protected. I
went once to Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier for the purpose of obtaining from
him protection for a certain industry in the
province of Quebec. He said: "No; that
industry has antiquated machinery; it is
not well equipped; it bas not sufficient

43

capital. I will not protect an industry like
that. Let them secure capital and instal
good, modern machinery. Then let them
come to me and I will, give them good
protection. But I cannot do so until they
make those improvements." Then there is
such a thing as prohibitive protection; that
is to say, protection may be so high as to
prohibit altogether the importation of certain articles, and jhe country receives
absolutely no revenue from that high tariff:
the manufacturer reaps the whole benefit,
making the people pay 25, 30, 40, or 50 per
cent more than they ought. That is what
may be called bad protection. But the
Laurier protection, the Fielding tariff, that
is what makes for the prosperity of the
country.
What happened after the change of Government in 1911? It is strange, but it is
true, that after 1911 immigration began to
decline. People did not want to come to
this country. Immigration had decreased
considerably by 1913, and the C.P.R. stock
commenced to tumble down. Where is
C.P.R. stock to-day? Why, it is tumbling
like the Government majority, and it is
now reduced by 50 per cent or more.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Will my honourable
friend tell me-?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentlemen please allow me to proceed?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: How long before-?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, I would like to proceed. I will not
be long, and then the honourable gentleman
from Halifax can speak for hours if he
wishes.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I shall be able to
deal with you when you take your seat;
so that is just as good.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I promise my
honourable friend I will not be long.
I heard the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
yesterday deprecate very much the adverse
balance of trade and commerce between
I heard
the United States and Canada.
him state that it was deplorable that we
were buying over $900,000,000 worth from
them while they were buying from us five
hundred and some odd million dollars'
worth; that each day we in Canada actually took one million good Canadian dollars, each worth 100 cents here, and carried them over to the United States, where
we received only 88 cents' worth for them.

L4

SENATE

That is what he said. I thought he was
talking for the Opposition-he an able
business man and a member of the Government. I can pay him the tribute that he
is a very able business man. In another
place there are other able men, such as the
new Prime Minister, and this is the position into which they have brought our
country, that every day of the year, according to the honourable leader's own
statement, we must take a million good
Canadian dollars and carry them over to
the United States to pay for what we buy
from them over and above what they purchase from us. I blame the Government for
that, and I charge them with very bad
administration. The Government deserves
blame for putting the country into such
a state that our currency is depreciated.
Our dollar was worth only 86 cents yesterday; that is the latest quotation. I say
the Government must be blamed for having
allowed the country to come down to such
a state of affairs, and one reason why this
Government should be driven from office is
the adverse trade balance which the honourable leader of the Government quoted
yesterday. He cannot deny it. There can
be no argument about this. We heard the
honourable gentleman make the statement,
and everybody is aware that it is because
of the way in which the Government has
administered the affairs of this country
that we are in such a bad position to-day.
The honourable gentleman's remarks in
deprecating the adverse balance would
have been an excellent speech coming from
the Opposition.
But let us discuss other things. I said
a moment ago that the Government majcrity has been decreasing. It was about
70, I understand, in December of 1917
after all the soldiers' votes had been
counted: What is it to-day?
We shall
know, I suppose, in a few days. I believe
it will not be one-half of that. They talk
about the duration of Parliament and
when the Government will appeal to the
people. Why, it may be ascertained by a
simple rule of proportion: if the Government majority has been reduced by so much
in three years, in so many months the
Government will go down because they
will not have a majority. Unless we are
mistaken, the results in East Elgin and
West Peterborough are not very encouraging for them.
However, let us pass on to another matter. The honourable leader of the Government said, and I was much amused at
hcaring the statement: "Honourable genHon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

tlemen, we have spent two billions of dollars and never has the expenditure of one
dcllar been challenged."
The honourable
gentleman got away with that statement.
Now, to be absolutely parliamentary, I will
make my comment in Latin: "Audaces
fortuna juvat." But really and truly the
honourable gentleman must have forgotten
something.
There must have been just
some little scandal in connection with
the two billions. Has he forgotten about
the horses the Government bought? Does
he not remember the horse that was exchanged for two ducks and one drake?
That is not a big scandal, but it is a scandal, you must admit. And then what about
the painted horses? And what about the
horses that qualified for the Boer war,
which had taken place some fifteen years
before? If the honourable gentleman did
not remember the horses, he must surely
have remembered the appointment of a
legal gentleman of very high attainments,
Sir Charles Davidson, to make an inquiry
into the wrongdoing in connection with the
purchase of those horses and also to investigate the actions of one Nova Scotia member of Parliament-his name, I think, was
Foster. Anyway, he defeated Sir Frederick Borden and came up to Ottawa. He
was given $50,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Seventy
thousand.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Seventy thousand, I am told, but I will make it easier
and say $50,000.
That was an amount
given him for the purchase of horses and
not accounted for. He said he had bought
plenty of horses, but when it came to an
accounting he said that the man who had
the receipts had gone to the United States
and he could not get at them at all.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He was well punished.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, he deserved it. But it was a scandal. Yet the
honourable leader says that there was
absolutely no scandal in connection with
the expenditure of those two billion dollars! I think Mr. Foster had to retire
from the House of Commons. But there
was almost a scandal in the fact that it
took Sir Charles Davidson two years to
make a report. By the time his report was
presented all interest in those transactions
had been lost; the horses were probably
dead by that time, and nobody cared.
But there was another little incident
that surely ought not to have been missed,

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
and it was missed too. There was a certain Miss McAdam who was a stenographer
in one of the departments. She patented a
wonderful instrument of warfare: it was
a shovel. On this shovel there was to be
no handle, or the handle was to be detachable. But the peculiarity of this great
invention of Miss McAdam's was that in
this shovel,.which was to be planted in
front of our warriors when they were engaged in battle, there was a little hole in
which they were to place the muzzle of
their rifle-the Ross rifle, I suppose-and
they could lie down behind this shovel and
shoot the Germans. About $40,000 was
spent on that. 0f course, that is nothing:
still the honourable leader of the Government says there was no scandal. Well, if
there was no scandal, it was certainly giving away the $40,000, for those shovels
were just like any others, except that there
was a hole in the middle of them, and they
had no handle. The honourable leader of
the Government must have forgotten about
that. Of course, there was not very much
love between the leader of the Government
and the then Minister of Militia. However, I do not want to become involved in
family affairs.
The honourable leader of the Government
in this House seems to have forgotten these
little affairs. But surely neither he nor
anybody else can have forgotten " Glad
Hand" Allison-our friend Allison from
Morrisburg, Ontario. Everybody has heard
of him. We have all heard of the scandal
about the revolvers, and the scandal~about
the field-glasses, and the scandal of the
member of Parliament right here in the
city of Ottawa who kept a drug store and
who, notwithstanding the independence of
Parliament, was selling bandages and what
not to the Government. An inquiry on this
subject was held in another place.
Then, to cap all-for I do not want to
take up the time of the House in going
into further detail-in another place Mr.
Kyte, one of the members from Cape
Breton, took a whole day in reciting all the
scandals. Still the honourable leader of
the Government says there was no scandal
and that not one dollar -in all tliose millions had disappeared. Signor Lignanti,
one of the musicians in the orchestra of
the Ritz Carlton-I cannot be sure whether
it was the flute or the piccolo he playedreceived no less than $50,000 for being a
party to some transaction. Still there was
not a scandal and in all that two billions

4E

of dollars there was never a dollar challenged!
Then there was a stenographer and typewriter who was engaged in drawing up
contracts; and how much do you think she
received for this wonderful work? Five
thousand dollars? Ten thousand dollars?
Fifteen thousand dollars? Too low. Fifty
thousand dollars? Seventy-five thousand
dollars? She received $100,000. They
said: "Oh, my; but she must have been a
fine typewriter operator to get so much
money." I call that also a scandal.
Besides, there were some persons around
Ottawa, fulfilling their parliamentary
duities and drawing military pay at the
same time. I call that a scandal. They
ought to have been doing either one thing
or the other.
But enough of that. I think that the
honourable leader of the Government will
admit that there were some scandals sometimes, and I do not wish to take up any
more time on this subject.
But in the Speech from the Throne there
is something that has been absolutely omitted-the most important of all the questions that are troubling not only the business men, but all the taxpayers of this
country; there is no mention of the railway situation. The railway situation in
this country, honourable gentlemen, is
grave indeed. The honourable the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is
quite familiar with this question too, and
I know that he appreciates it. Now, I
have thought out this matter carefully, and
this is what I have to say about it. Onehalf the railways of Canada during the last
period for which we have statistics have
not paid operating expenses. It was stated
the other day that the rates were too high.
Well, if the railways are not paying operating expenses, surely the rates cannot be
too high. If they are not high enough to
pay operating expenses, who is going to
cash the coupons on the debentures, and
who is going to provide for betterments
and renewals? This is, I claim, a most important question; yet there is no mention
of it in the Speech from the Throne-not
a word as to how we are going to solve this
great problem.
It seems to me that the advocates of public ownership now realize that it has been
a failure. In the United States it was
realized that Government ownership was a
failure-that the McAdoo scale of wages
was such as would, if continued, drive the
railways iûto bankruptcy; and the United

SENATE
States Government has returned all
the railroads to their former owners.
We now realize, I think, that a mistake was
made in taking over the C.N.R; that it
would have been better for the Government
to have honoured its obligations and kept
on paying the interest on the bonds that
they had guaranteed and let the other part
of the railway go into a receiver's hands.
But we are saddled with the burden now
and it cannot be helped: the point is to
make the best of it we can. But there is
in my opinion no way of deriving any advantage from it except by establishing rates
sufficient to pay for the service. Honourable gentlemen from the Northwest who
are suffering from this railway situation
to-day are really in a position to be told,
"We told you so, but you would have it that
way; now you have it and it cannot be
helped." Not counting the Grand Trunk,
which after all has not yet been taken
over, there are about 14,000 miles of Government railways, and the estimated deficit will be, as a minimum, $60,000,000
during the last period, which means over
$4,000 per mile.
If to that you add the
Grand Trunk with its 8,000 miles approximately, making 22,000 miles of railway
under government ownership, you are
bound to have the same result, and you
will therefore have to add to the minimum
deficit of $60,000,000 another $32,000,000
at least. The deficit will probably reach
$100,000,000. Why, honourable gentlemen,
all that the war has cost Canada is two
billions of dollars, the interest on which, at
5 per cent, amounts to $100,000,000. The
deficit on the railroads alone will be equal
to that-equal to the amount we sacrificed
in that tremendous war.
Is not that a
matter for serious consideration without regard to party or without determining who
is to blame? But what should be donc to
remedy it?-that is the question. Where
can the Finance Minister of this country
find the money to meet the interest charges
on the debt accumulated by the war, and find
also the money to meet the deficit on these
railways, amounting to
$100,000,000?
We all know that Canada leads the world
in transportation facilities. Measured by
population, Canada has more railroads
than any other country in the world. In
Canada we have one mile of railroad for
every 218 persons-men, women and children. No other country in the world has
such a small population per mile of railroad. The United States, for instance, has
404 persons per mile of railroad, or just
about twice as many as we have, and still
their railroads, as we all know, are not in
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

very good financial condition. The railroads having been taken over and handled
by the Government, it will take a long time
for private ownership to remedy the evil
brought about by public ownership. In
Great Britain there are 1,943 persons per
mile of railway; in Germany about 1,700
persons per mile; in France there are
1,241 persons to keep up each mile of railway. The figures as to Italy are very surprising: in that country there are 8,162
persons per mile of railway, and still the
Italian railways are not in a very prosperous condition. In Belgium there are 1,356
persons per mile; in Spain 1,967; in Denmark 1,105; in New Zealand-now we are
coming to countries more like our ownthere are 354 persons per mile of railway;
in Victoria, Australia, there are 347; in
New South Wales 391; and so on.
Now, these facts are suggestive. They
give us a clue to a great part of our deficit,
and it must be a matter of congratulation
to the Canadian Pacific railway that in a
sparsely-peopled country like ours they are
able not only to meet their fixed charges
and operating expenses, but to pay a dividend of 10 per cent. That is about all they
have been able to do, but with increased
rates they may be able to do better.
Our trouble is that within the last twenty
years we have increased our railways by
130 per cent, while the population has increased by only 70 per cent. The honourable Mr. Drury, Prime Minister of Ontario,
the other day said that we had built railways fifty years ahead of our time, and
that it was high time we stopped building
railways and tried to populate the country
in order to help out the railways that we
already have. In Canada we have, say,
38,000 miles of railroad, and in the United
States they have some 250,000 miles. In
Canada and the United States there is a
greater mileage of railways than there is
in all the rest of the world. We must
have at least 10,000 miles to spare.
The great question which is agitating
the public just now is whether we want
to take over any more railways. There is
an arbitration going on now in regard to
the Grand Trunk railway, and here is a
British comment which appeared in this
morning's paper as to the action of the
arbitrators:
British Comments Minatory in Tone. Canada's
G. T. R. Poliey Will be Remembered in Money
Circles.
British financal comment on the action of
the Grand Trunk arbitrators in refusing to consider the physical value of the system has been
plentiful in the past few days, and is very
minnatory in tone. The threat that "this gross-

-7

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
ly unfair decîsion," -in conjunction with the
fact that the (janadian Government refused to
allow freight rates to be raised, durIng the
war, «"wuil flot be forgotten when the Dominion
has again to enter this market as a borrower."
is even made by the Money Market Review and
Investors' Chronicle, while the Times speaks of
the "Shylockian rote" played by the Canadian
Government -in securing the system.

This shows us that the owners and shareholders of the Grand Trunk railway do not
think they are getting fair play.
We have had eneugh of Government
ownership: we have seen what it brings.
If the members of the Senate-I arn speaking te these who are friendly te the Government and the powers that be-would enly
get together and ask that the Grand Trunk
be allowed te continue the' operation of
their property they would be rendering the
greatest possible service to the country.
Experts are ceming before the arbitrators
every day and saying that the Grand Trunk
have a fine preperty, that. they want to
keep it. Let themn have it. It may be said:
"What about the Grand Trunk Pacifiec1?
Well, we have that anyway; it is a white
elephant, but we have got it; but, we do
net have to take over the Grand Trunk
railway if we de net want to. I believe
that if the Gevernment were approached
by the menibers of this House who are
friendly te the Governuxent, and if it were
explained what a mistake is being made,
perhaps th'e Gevernment weuld welceme the
suggestion of leaving the Grand Trunk
alone. A majerity of this House could do
it. It would be ne threat te the Government; it could be done in a friendly way.
There is a rumeur abread, and I give it
fer what it is werth, that when the Grand
Trunk is taken ever and jeined with the
14,000 miles that we new have, the whole
system will be handed over te seme corporation or institution. Well, if that institution were solvent, if it were te pay
fer the railreads, I would welceme such a
proceeding; but I would net liike te see the
railroads given te people whe had ne nioney
te pay for them, because as long as there
is any money due on these roads-they are
just like any property you may buy-you
becorne respensible for all the mertgages
and hypothecs on the property-the Governnment would be respensible te the last dollar
if the people te whom the railroads are
handed over are irresponsible, we shall be
ne better off. If it were a financial corporation with some ability te carry on it
weuld be a good thing, even if we made
them, a free gift of the raîlways, because
we would be relieved of the deficit.

We have heard a great deal said against
the Transcontinental railway between Winnipeg and Quebec. I was very much surprised te find that the Transcontinental is
developing into: a very geod piece ef railroad. I was amazed te see the amount of
traffic eriginating on one running mile.
This is the way it figures eut, and it will
net take two minutes te explain it. There
is any amount of pulpwood on the Transcontinental near Amos and La Sarre in
the Province of Quebec near the boundary
of Ontario. For«about 100 miles there is a
territery that grews very good pulpweod.
It is of the right size, it bas ne branches,
and it is just about the right length te
make four cuts. Even in a good tumber country if you get 8 or 9 or 10 cerds te the
acre you are doing well, but in that district it grows very thickly and they get 15
cords te the acre. Suppo-sing yeu allow for
the lakes, rivers, and swamps, and say
that they get only 10 cords te the acre;
there are 640 acres te the square mile;
if yeu multiply that by 10 you get 6,400
acres, and if yeu go back 10 miles fromn
the railroad, which is net a very great
distance, you get 64,000 cerds, on one
side of the railroad.
If the saine
thing is duplicated on the other side, you
get 128,000 cords of pulpwood te the one
mile of railway. The price of pulp wood
is froni $7 per cord up; se multiply 128,000
by 7, and you get $896,000 fer the pulpwood subtending 1 mile of railway. Besides that $896,000 you have got the freight.
Most of that pulpweod is geing te United
States peints. The freight on pulpweod
say from La Sarre te United States points
is $16 a cerd. Multiply $16 by the 128,000
cords subtending 1 mile of railway, and
you get about $2,000,000, three-quarters of
which gees te the Canadian railways and
the balance te the American railways. On
1 mile of railway you have enough te pay
for that road fifteen tumes ever, even if it
cest $125,000 per mile. I think this is the
one ray of hope and sunahine that we have
froin the building of the Transcontinental
railway.
There is something very strange in the
way the railway mileage is divided in this
country. As I have teld you there are 218
persens per mile of road-I have figured
it eut at 217, which is very close. In Ontarie there are 11,000 odd miles of railway,
and a population of nearly 2,900,000 people;
se yeu have 1 mile of railway for every 260
people. In Manitoba there are 4,168 miles
of railway te, a population of 558,000; se

SENATE

you have only 133 persons per mile of railway When you come to Alberta you have
4,273 miles of railway as against a population of 496,525, or 116 persons per mile.
Saskatchewan bas 6,162 miles of railway
as against a population of 647,835, or 105
persons per mile of railway. In British
Columbia they are well supplied with railways; they have 4,247 miles for a population of 450,000 people, or a mile of railway to every 106 persons. In New Brunswick they are not quite so well off, but
still they are not badly situated: they have
1,959 miles of railway as against a
population of 352,000 people, or 1 mile to
every 180 persons. In Nova Scotia there
are very few railroads, there being only
1,428 miles to a population of 525,000, or
367 persons per mile. There is not much
mileage in Prince Edward Island, where
they have only 279 miles of railroad to
93,728 people, or 336 persons to the mile.
Now we come to the dear old province of
Quebec. How many people do you think
there are per mile of railroad in that
province? According to my figures the
province of Quebec bas 4,791 miles of
railroad and a population of 2,357,566, or
492 persons per mile of railway. The local
government of Quebec has just completed
a municipal census, and they find the
population to be 2,500,000; therefore there
are 520 persons to contribute to the upkeep
of 1 mile of railway in that province.
When the collector comes round to make
up the deficit everyone is taxed the same
amount. In the province of Quebec he
collects from 520 people $7 each, and in
Saskatchewan or British Columbia be
collects $7 from only 105 or 106 people,
and still they have the advantage of having
the money spent to keep the railways in
those provinces. You see, there is an
average deficit of $4,000 per mile, and
those provinces with a small population
and a big mileage get the benefit of all the
expenditure on those railways, while the
other provinces with a smaller mileage and
a greater population contribute a greater
proportion to help the others. That was
never the intention when the Confederation pact was made. In one word, Quebec
bas 1,371 miles of railway less than
Saskatchewan-25 per cent less-although
Quebec has four times the population.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What about your
docks and wharves?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And it is Ontario
and Quebec that are principally affected
by that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Now, this railway situation-and this
consideration-is an
deserves serious
impossible one. Does anyone believe that
any 105 or 106 persons, which means
perhaps 25 or 30 families, can keep up 1
mile of railway? It is a physical impossibility to take that deficit of $4,000 per
mile and divide it among 25 or 30 families.
What must be the receipts per mile? If
there is a deficit of so much, what must
be the receipts for the operation, and so
on?
There is one good thing about the
Speech from the Throne, a thing of
which
I
approve.
Our
dear
old
friend the Hudson Bay railroad is
not mentioned. It is not stated that
the road will be finished this year. The
question of the Hudson Bay railroad lies
in abeyance for the time being; so nothing
need be said about it. However, I should
like to place some photographs on the table
of the Senate for inspection by some of
my honourable colleagues. These photographs were taken in Hudson bay and
strait during last summer. On the 14th
of August, 1920, the steamer Nascopie.
which I think belongs to the Hudson
Bay Company, lost its screw in the
ice, and the steamer had to be beached at
high water. On the 14th of August! I
would like to lay on the Table these various
photographs, showing especially the Nascopie surrounded by ice. The dates are on
the back of the photographs, and photographs cannot lie.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
bas the honourable gentleman to show that
they are taken in Hudson bay?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They are marked.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
nothing.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I did not take the
photographs and if it comes to a question
of swearing to them, I must declare at once
that I cannot vouch for them. But I would
like to lay them on the table.
One word about the League of Nations
and I am finished. There was in Geneva
not very many weeks ago a great Assembly
of the League of Nations. The word
"nation" is there used instead of the word
"states", for it was states and not nations
that were represented there. For instance,
there is an Irish nation, and it was not
there. Canada was represented at that
Assembly-oh, we were there in great
shape! We had the honourable the Minister

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
of Justice, a very able man, and Sir George
Foster, and aur own Mr. Rowell from
Ontario. They were there and they spoke
a great deal and said a great deal, and the
other nations were quite surprised ta hear
these colonials tallcing s0 much. There was
the Hon. Arthur Balfour, with his arma
folded, saying ta himself, "'Why did we
bring the children'i" 0f course, those fortyone nations who were there had neyer read
the Canadian Constitution and did not
know that we had no say and no right ta
be there. But nlot only were we there, not
only did they bring the big cbldren like
Canada, but they brought also the small

South Afrîca, if I am eorrectly informed,
there are no more white people than there
are in Newfoundland. Stili South Africa
was represented at the Assembly exactly
on a par, and, as the honourable Minister
of Justice stated the other day in a speech
in Montreal, when the rail of nations was
called, in marched aur three delegates and
in marched the three delegates from South
Africa. 0f course, South Africa would not
go ta the expense of buying transportation
and sending delegates over, but they.hired
three men in London ta go over and represent them, and that helped ta make up
the vote. But it would have been too exfrome South
pensive ta send 'anybody

Hon. Mr. F0WLER: They had an electien on.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Canada was put
on a par with those Boers whom we did
flot think sa much of about twenty years
ago. It has cost Canada and is casting us

see any reason why we should have to pay
$200,000 of good Canadian money every
year to belong ta that. Let those who cail
the tune pay the piper. We do not eall the
tune, and when there is a possibility of
war we are not consulted as to whether we
should go to war or not. It is those who
make war who should be in the League of
Nations. I do nlot believe that we should.
When those diplomats who were there representing the forty odd nations go home
they will say they heard a great deal £rom
Mr. Roweli and Sir George Foster; but
if they look at our Constitution they will
learn that we have absolutely no right outside the four corners of the Dominion of
Canada-absolutely no right, not even the
right ta carry a flag. They will say: "We
were camoufiaged by ail that fine talk."
But Mr. Rowell is a fine taîker, the very
best; and Sir George Faster is a very goad
taiker, and while he talked, as Hlarry
Lauder would say,
The wedding bells were ringing,

and he was very happy. Then yau had Mr.

SENATE

Chief Justice of New Brunswick, and I
think he bas that position yet. Apparently
he does not desire to relinquish it, for he
was mentioned as one who might come into
the Cabinet and it appears that he would
just as soon stay where he is. Last year
Parliament voted $50,000 for the purpose
of sending an ambassador to Washington.
His name was even mentionedMr. Rowell.
Perhaps he went
to
Geneva in order to qualify. However,
he is not at Washington yet. Now,
let us be reasonable. How could he possibly be there?
You know, honourable
gentlemen, that one of the elements of
diplomacy is that countries must communicate with each other through their
ambassadors. Now, the British Empire is
one and indivisible, and there is only one
ambassador of the Empire at Washington,
and that is the British Ambassador. You
cannot have any side-shows in connection
with an embassy, and to communicate in
any way except through the British Embassy would be a great breach of etiquette
in the first place, and contrary to one of
the commonest rules of diplomacy. Why
deceive ourselves with the idea that we are
going to have foreign relations, etc.?
When our Constitution was given we were
not authorized to raise a militia except for
the defence of our territory, because otherwise we might embroil the Empire in wars.
We were not authorized to raise an army
to attack the United States, for instance.
It was for the Imperial authorities to decide whether to go to war or not. Foreign
affairs are left to them alone. If the Empire is one and indivisible, then you cannot'
have several embassies: it would be an
absurdity. We have had for forty years
or more a commissioner in Paris.
Sir
John Fabre resigned a senatorship and
was sent to Paris. He was succeeded by
another very able man, Mr. Roy.
What
happened?
The British Embassy absolutely ignored them-would have nothing
whatever to do with them. Anything to
be done must be done through the proper
channels.
As to the question of our having any
say, do you want to know what Colonel
Amery, the Under-Secretary of State for
the Colonies, said?
Many of you were
present. The Empire Parliamentary Association- gave him a luncheon at the
Rideau Club, and we said that, having
done what we had done in the war, we
thought we should have some say as to
whether in future we should have war or
peace, as -to what should be the relations
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

between the colony and the Empire, and
so on. We considered that we should be
consulted.
He made a very fine speech,
and these are his very words. He said:
"The colonies must first be educated to
think imperially."
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Who said that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Colonel Amery.
"The colonies must first be educated to
think imperially, and there can be no
division of authority; there should be no
change in the constitution;" and he said
there had not been neither; and to make
this absolutely plain, he said that it was
the intention that we might have outside
conversations et cetera, but the whole
control must be kept in the hands of the
present British Government.
I for one
am quite satisfied, and why my good friends
the loyal Tories are talking about our
being an independent nation, having ambassadors et cetera, passes my comprehension. I do not see why we are not satisfied
as we are. Independent?
In what position would we be if we were independent?
Any pretext is good enough when there is
a desire to make trouble. If we were independent, and if the United States at any
time wanted to make trouble, what chance
would we have to resist them, with 8,000,000 against over 100,000,000? We would
have no chance at all. We do not want
to be independent.
Sir John Macdonald,
it is said, wanted to live and die a British
subject. Well, I wish to live and die a
Canadian citizen, as I am to-day.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Crosby the debate
was adjourned.
DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill A, an Act to
amend the Dominion Elections Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it may
be somewhat of an innovation to project
into the discussion on the Address the motion for the second reading of this Bill, but
it may be said to be an emergency Bill. It
bas transpired that under the Dominion
Elections Act entirely new lists would have
to be prepared for the plebiscite which is
to be voted upon under-I suppose, the
Canada Temperance Act on the 18th of
April. At the last Session it was pointed
out to the Government the desirability or
the necessity of amending the Dominion
Elections Act so as to permit of additions

FEBRUARY 17, 1921
to the existing lists. If new lists were to be
prepared it would involve the expenditure
of a substantial sum by this Government.
As honourable gentlemen are aware, under
the legisiation which was passed at last
Session or the Session before, the expenditure in taking aplebiscite in the different provinces of Canada under the Canada Temperance Act falis, upon the
Federal Governent. It is feit that the
difficulty which was pointed out can be
obviated by the amendments that are now
before us, their object being, as I have
said, ta add to the list the names of those
who would be entitled to vote. I would
therefore ask, bonourable gentlemen, notwithstanding the fact that we have not yet
disposed of the Address, that this Bill be
now read the second time. When it is read
the second time, I arn going to ask the
House to permit of the third reading, so
that it nlay be sent down to the House
of Commons. The Government is prepared,
I understand, ta postpone, if necessary, the
debate on the Address in the House of
Commons, in order to permit of the passage
of this Bill. When it bas passed the House
of Commons, the Senate cannot adjourn as
it usually does until the Royal assent is
given to the Bill. With a view to bringing about an early adjournment of the
Senate-for we shahl not have business to
occupy our time-I would ask the House
to permit me to accelerate the passage of
this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I was not aware that my honourable friend intended to deal with this matter this afternoon. We have listened to
bis explanation with a good deal of interest. But this procedure is ahl new to us.
Since I bave been in this Chamber, we have
neyer, so far as I know, taken action of
this kind. I infer from the remarks of
my honourable friend that he apparently
intended to have the commnittee stage of the
Bill omitted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, I
wihl movè the House into committee if tbat
is necessary.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have not myseif
really had time to examine the Bill and
do flot know that I arn in a position to say
much about it; but if any other honourable
gentleman wants to discuss the matter, I
think the Bill should certainly be put into
committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I bave
no desire to ask the House to deal with thé
S-U'

51

Bill without being thoroughly satisfied tbat
it is a nieasure that ought to be passed.
But I move the second reading this alternoon, and before the Address is proceeded
with to-morrow, in order that we may be
able to send this Bihl down to the House of
Commons before we rise, I shahl ask that
it be dealt with in its final stages thea.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Cannot the honourable gentleman niove that we go into
committee on the Bill now? Then we ean
consider it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before that Is
doue, I desire to ask my honourable friend
(Hon. Sir James Lougbeed) who prepared
this Bill. Is it prepared by the Government
here, or is it a Bill prepared by the Ontario
Government and submitted to the Dominion
Government?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
prepared by the Government.
Hon. Mr. BE>LCOURT: This Government?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes;
it is a Government Bill. It bas, I understand, been prepared by the present Minister of Militia,' who is Acting Solicitor
General, and I understand bas been submitted to the Province of Ontario as meeting the conditions which it purports to
deal with.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 0f course, I quite
understand it is a Government Bill, otherwise my honourable friend wouhd not; be
handling it. But my question is whether
or not the Bill is one which bas been prepared by the Ontario Government and forwarded to the Minister of Justice here, with
the request that it be submitted to the
Federal Parliament. That is what I want
to know.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- I eaunot speak positively on that point. I was
under the impression that it was specialhy
prepareld by the Acting Solicitor General,
and that the province of Ontario bad passed
upon it.
I will not speak with any definiteuess upon that except to say that I
understaud both Governments are fully
cognizant of the contents of the Bill and
are satisfied that it will meet the situation
wehave to provide for.
Hon. Mr. PRO UDFOOT: There is one
question I should hike to ask in conuection
with the Bill. Subsection b says:
The raid lists shall, subJeet to section 63 of
thh3 Âct, be used in rural polling divisions
without revision. but in urban 1pollirig divisions

SENATE

i2

shall be revised as directed by rules 11 to 20,
inclusive of schedule A to section 32.

Apparently there is to be a revision in
the urban municipalities but not in the
rural districts. The result will be that
the rural municipalities will vote on lists
more than a year-and-a-half old, while in
the urban portions of the province the lists
will be revised up to date. I should like to
know if the temperance people, who are
desirous of having this legislation brought
forward, are satisfied to have the vote taken
in that way. It seems to me that there is no
difficulty in having the whole list revised.
In Ontario the lists were revised in 1919
just before the election which took place on
the 20th of October in that year, so that all
the machinery is provided for under rules
11 to 20 that can be made applicable to the
rural municipalities as well as to the urban
ones.
Of
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
course, my honourable friend is much more
familiar with the Ontario Elections Act
than I am; but am I wrong in the impression
which I have that in the rural polling
divisions names can be added to the list
on application being made and passed upon
by officers duly appointed under the Act?
A person in a
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
rural district can vote whether his name
is on the list or not.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not understand that they can have their names put
on in that way.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: They can vote without their names being put on at all.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I am not prepared to discuss that point.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
urban districts there might be such a congestion of applications to vote as to render
it embarrassing or impossible to take the
vote. My honourable friend can give somo
consideration to the question, and to-morrow
we can dispose of the committee stage and
the third reading.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is the
reason I brought up the question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
only alternative would be to prepare new
lists; but that would cost several hundre.1
thousand dollars, I understand, and the Government is not prepared to do that.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: They are going
to revise the urban lists: they are simply
going to strike off and add to; and they
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

can deal with the rural lists in the same
way.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If we
were to hold a court of revision in every
rural constituency it would put in motion the
most elaborate and expensive machinery, and
if what my honourable friend from Nova
Scotia (Mr. Tanner) bas pointed out is so,
surely it is unnecessary, because the vote in
the rural districts must be small in each
polling division.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is no doubt
about that under the Dominion Act, honourable gentlemen. We had some experience
in Nova Scotia this year. The urban list
is a closed list after application bas been
made to the registrar and to the revising
officer-that is, the appeal officer. In the
country districts the list is an open one, and
any one who is not on the list can go to
the poll accompanied by a neighbour and
make application and have his name put
on the list.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The reason I
made my inquiry is because I am very
doubtful whether the Government of Ontario, in an important matter like this,
wishes to place itself in the position of
having a revision only in the cities. I have
no reason to doubt, as my honourable friend
says, that this Bill bas met with the approval of the Ontario Government; but I
must confess that I am surprised.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: While
my honourable friend is on his feet, would
be point out the utility of having a revision
of the list in rural polling divisions if the
list is not a closed list and can be added
to?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That applies tc
the cities. You can add to the list in the
same way; and if there is no reason for
adding to the country list, I can see no
reason for adding to the urban list.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not understand that the country list in Ontario is an
open list.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is not.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: My honourable
friend says that is the case in Nova Scotia,
but I do not understand it to be the case in
Ontario. However, this evening I will take
the opportunity of looking up that question and seeing if the sarne thing applies to
Ontario. If it does not, then we have one
portion of the country voting on one list,
and another portion voting on another list
that bas been made up to date.

FEBRUARY 18, 1921
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Ontario list
is not an open list. The list is made for
municipal purposes every year; it is revised
some time in October, I think, and becomes
a complete list some time in December.
That is done every year, not only for the
country parts, but for the cities as well.
Why there should be this discrimination bétween the country and the cities I cannot
see at ail. I think if the Government of
Ontario bas agreed to that it bas placed
itself in an awkward position.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
see about that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand that the Government intends passing this Bill through the Commons before
the Address is voted, as we are doing now?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Honourable gentlenmen, I sympathize with the honourable
gentleman from Kings (Hon. Mr. Fowler)
when hie says that this Senate is buiît in
such a way that it does not meet the wishes
of the people. Behind the bar there is
room for a large number of people, but
even the leader of the Government, when
hie desires to consult his secretary, cannot
bring him there but is obliged to go outside
the Chamber. I think that the standing
of the Senate should be maintained, and

53

that we should provide chairs in that space
for ladies or others who desire to corne
here, as we did in the old Chamber. I
have been in the Senate now for eighteen
years, and anyone who wanted to see me
could corne in and take a seat on the
benches.

arise as to the advisability of doing that
at the present moment before the Senate
Chamber is completed. I think honourable
gentlemen have already experienced a difficulty in making themselves heard owing
to the open spaces that enter upon the
vestibule of the Senate. I have directed
the attention of the architect to the necessity of building a screen across those three
open places, similar to the screen behind

reason why an artistic screen should not
be constructed which would add very
greatly to the acousties of this Chamber.
It seems to me that if that were done we
ceuld then with safety and with pleasure
invite the public to seats on the floor of the
Senate as we did in the old Chamber.
I think we are indebted to my honourable friend from Victoria for directing attetion to this matter, and, if it is the
judgment of the Senate that this should
be done, I shall exert any efforts I can
towards carrying out any suggestion along
that line.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, niy honourable friend has asked
whether it is the judgment of the Senate.
I think I may say for gentlemen on this
side of the House that they agree with
what my honourable friend bas said. I
think it is desirable that we have acommodation in this Senate, as we have always had, for ladies or others who wish
to listen to the debates.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK moved:
That an humble Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General praying that
His Excellency will cause to be laid before the
Senate all papers, documents and correspondence
passed between the Canadian Government and
the Bri.tish Government, or between any Minister, member, or officiai of the Canadian Government and any member or official of the British Admiralty, or between any persons or officials thereof, since 1909, giving details and
particulars as regards the negotiations on naval
affairs leading up to the agreement which was

DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL.
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEFr-THIRD
READING.

On motion of the Hon. Sir James Lougheed, the Senate went into Committee on
Bill A, an Act to amend the Dominion
Elections Act. Hon. Mr. Daniel in the
Chair.
On paragraph a of new subsection 4 of
section 101-list of voters:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I made an explanation
yesterday touching paragraph a, which
may possibly require a little further explanation to-day.
I informed my honourable
friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
that this Bill had been prepared by the
Solicitor General and I understood it had
been submitted to the authorities in Ontario.
I understand now, from further inquiry,
that this Bill has been prepared by Mr.
Biggar, who is attached as counsel to the
Department of Justice, and that it has

been placed in the hands of the Hon. Mr.
Guthrie, the Acting Solicitor General, and
meets the situation which we wish to
cover. It is proposed that the Dominion
Elections Act of last Session should be
amended. I would direct the attention of
honourable gentlemen to the last clause of
that Act, that is to say, subsection 3 of
section 101, which reads as follows:
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the
list of voters as finally revised and completed
for use in the provincial election in the Province of Ontario held in the month of October,
1919, shall be used without revision for any
vote in that Province under this section taken
before the thirty-flrst day of December, 1920.

Apparently it was intended that the
plebiscite in Ontario should be taken before
the 31st of December, 1920; that the vote
should be taken upon the lists which had
been used in the provincial elections of
that province in 1919, and, furthermore,
that they should not be further revised.
Circumstances have apparently delayed the
taking of the vote. The consequence is
that the Government has been called upon
to make provision for the vote which is
to be taken in that province on the 18th
of April next. It is felt by the Government
-and due consideration has been given to
this fact-that the lists which were used
in the Ontario elections of 1919 should be
used for this particular vote, and that those
lists should be supplemented in the way indicated in the Bill now before us. That
is to say, it is proposed that we shall add
to those lists as provided for in this Billthat in polling divisions in rural districts
the list, which is not a closed list, shall
be open, as is already the law, to those who
wish to vote. The machinery of the law
is to be found in the Dominion Elections
Act, which I have now before me, and
xthich permits a voter in a rural district
to tender his vote and to have his vote
properly recorded.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is under
section 63, is it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
But in urban districts the list is a closed
list: it cannot be added to in the way a
list in a rural district is added to. The
consequence is that there must be in urban
districts a revision of the list if those who
do not appear upon the list are to be given
an opportunity to vote upon the question
that is being submitted to the electors. It
is for the purpose of making provision for
this that we have the legislation which we
are now considering.
I desire to point out, honourable gentlemen, that should this legislation not be

FEBRUARY 18, 1921
placed upon the statute book it would be
incumbent upon the Dominion Governrnent
to prepare new lists upon which the vote
would be taken. Those new iists wold cost
this country, I arn informed, at least
$8350,000. The Government very naturally
is opposed to the preparation of new lists;
we regard theni as unnecessary. Although
a demand bas been made on the part of a
certain section of the voters in Ontario
that the Government, at its own expense,
prepare new lists, we have refused to do
so. We have said that substantial justice
can be done and the entire vote recorded
under the machinery we have now before
us, in the manner I have already indicated.
I therefore move the adoption of paragraph a.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to renew
the question which I put to my honourabie
friend yesterday and which he bas not
answered-whether or not this Bill has
been submitted to the Ontario Governent,
who are responsible for the carrying out.
of the plebiscite or referendum, or is this
legisiation proposed by the Government
simply on its own initiative, without consultation with the Ontario authorities?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
The
answer my honourable friend no.
Ontario Governent bas nothing te, say
upon the subject except to make such representations as it may desire. The Dominion Government, of course, is only too glad
to receive any representations which may
be made, and ta give theni every consideration; but this is a duty which is exclusively cast upon the Dominion Government. We
would be only too glad if the Ontario Government or any other provincial Goverpnment wouid assume the responsibility of
preparing the lists and of carrying out the
plebiscites. I may say, and I say it unhesitatingly, that 1 think Parliament made
a mistake in the first place in assuming the
expense incident to the call of any provincial Government to submit these plebiscites, and if the matter again came before
Parliament niy own dispositim would be
against it. I do not think this is an expenditure which should be saddled upon
the Dominion Government, but 'we have ahready assumed the responsibility under the
statute and of course we are bound by it.
Hence, as it is a matter exclusively within the authority of the Dominion Government, we have not subrnitted this legislatien to the Ontario Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend says, quite properly, I think, that
they would welcome any representations

5

ýfrom. the Ontario Government in regard to
this; but if we pass the Bill and then ask
them for representations or suggestions,
it is a case of mustard after dinner. Now
would be the tie to ask if they have any
representations to make. I quite agree that
this is an expenditure which this Parlianment should not have assumed; we have no
right to meddle with the thing at aIl. The
referendum is a matter to be decided wholly
and exclusively by the people of the province, and why we should have anything to
do with the preparing of the lists is sornething that 1 cannot understand and would
be opposed to. But there is a demand
froni the Ontario Government to this
Parliament to pass legisiation in order to
enable the province to have this referendum, and I submit again that it would be
quite in order for this Government, before
submitting the legisiation to Parliament,
to consuit with the Ontario Government in
order to ascertain whether the legisiation
is to their liking. What is the good of passing a Bill with which they may find fault?
It seems to me that if any representations
are to be asked, they should be asked before we pass the Bill.
Paragraph a was agreed to.
On paragraph b-revision:
Hon Mr. PROUDFOOT:* Honourable
gentlemen will see that section 63 of the
Dýominion Elections Act is introduced, which
gives an opportunity in the rural polling
subdivisions to any person who is not already on the list to corne for-ward and
tender a vote. 1 will read a portion of it.
At polllng stations In -rural polling divisions
the deputy returning officer shail. while the poil
Io open, If reiuired by any person whose nome
is flot on the voters' list and who la vouched
for by an elector whose name appears upon a
votera' list and who la a resident In such
polling division, administer to such person an
oath in Formn No. 33 of Schedule One to this
Act and to such other person an oath in Form
No. 34 of Schedule One of this Act, and such
oath having been taken by the applicant person, and by such other person the deputy returning officer shall at once cause such applicant
personsa name to be added to the votera' list,
with the word "sworn" written thereefter.

So that aniyone whose name is not on the
list need not be deprived of a vote. Ail
that one is required to do is te, corne forward with some other person, and his name
will then be placed on the it provided hoe
is in a position to take the oath as provi4led for. That was one of the difficulties
I had in mind yesterday, I thought it
would probably be unfair te the people in
the rural municipalities if they were
not permitted. to vote ia the saine way

SENATE
as those living in the urban municipalities. That difficulty having been overcome by the incorporating of section 63 in
this Act-as I understand it is in force
during the time of taking the referendum
-removes one of the doubts I had in mind.
One bas to refer to the interpretation to
find out what is meant by "urban polling
division":
"Urban polling division" means a polling
division which is wholly or partly contained
within places having a population of more than
one thousand persons and which places are under the provincial laws-cities, towns or incorporated villages.

There are many villages in the province
of Ontario that have not a population of
1,000, so they will come under section 63,
and persons not on the list will have an
opportunity of coming forward and voting
in the same way as people living in the
country. It strikes me that if section 63
is utilized in that way no one bas reason
to complain-all of the people in the province who desire to vote will have an
opportunity of doing so. If we do adbpt
the course of preparing a new list, it will
mean, as the leader of the Government bas
stated, an expenditure iof a very considerable sum of money, and in the end we would
only attain the same object as the Bill will
attain. Such being the case, and the expense being wholly unnecessary, I think
the course proposed is the very best one
under the circumstances.
Paragraphs 11 to 20 referred to in the
Bill provide that the machinery of the
Dominion Election Act shall be put in force,
and under rule 11 of section 32 the county
judges in the various counties of the province will be the chief revising officers.
The rules of that Act, as they will be applied under the proposed Act, provide all
the remedy that is necessary; so from
that standpoint and from the standpoint
of giving every person an opportunity of
voting, nothing can be said against the
course which it is now proposed to adopt.
Some of the temperance people in the
province of Ontario who have had a good
deal to do with matters of this kind are
satisfied with the proposed legislation; another branch are not satisfied; so it would
be impossible to satisfy both parties.
It bas been stated by the honourable
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
that the Ontario Government should be consulted before we pass this Act. It is the
Ontario Government which bas asked this
Parliament to submit a referendum to the
voters of the province of Ontario. You
will all remember that it is the Ontario
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

Legislature that bas set this law in motion.
It asked us to bring about a referendum;
its responsibility commenced and ended
with the passage of the necessary provincial Act asking us to bring this vote about.
That being so, I do not see what good purpose can be served by submitting the Act
to the Ontario Government. If any good
object could be attained in that way, I
should be quite willing to see the legislation
submitted to them. If we submit it to them
they may submit it (to the temperance
association and cause all kinds of trouble.
The legislation as it stands will give, as I
have said before, a full opportunity for
everyone to vote, and I think that is all
we are interested in.
Paragraph b was agreed to.
Paragraph c was agreed to.
On paragraph d-residence qualification:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would suggest that a few words be added to this paragraph. Section 29 refers to the taking of
an oath, and the form of oath is provided
for, and I think that we should add to it
so that it would read:
Notwithstandi.ng the provisions of paragraph
c of subsection 1 of section 29, or amendments
thereto.

That would cover clause d that we are
adding. The form of oath as given simply
covers section 29 of the Act, and for the
purpose of removing any doubts I suggest this amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It does not occur
to me that it is at all necessary. If the
section bas been amended, it is referred to
as amended.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
that is all right.
Paragraph d was agreed to.
Paragraph e was agreed to.
On the preamble:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to suggest an additional paragraph, which will
be paragraph f. I am doing it at the instance of the honourable member from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholls).
He bas
pointed out that it would be a matter of
importance to know in a matter like this
bow many male voters there are and how
many female voters, and he asked me to
nake some suggestion as to the best way
of ascertaining that fact.
I think there must be more reasons than
one why it would be interesting to have this

1

FEBRUARY 18, 1921
information. I suggested that it might be
accomplished very easily by requiring the
returning officer to, furnish two classes of
ballots-one white and one pink, the white
being for the maie voters and the pink for
the female voters. At the close of the poli,
the returning officer would total up the
number of white ballots and the number
of pink ballots. The paragraph wouid read
something in this way:
The returning officer shall cause two ballots
to be prepared, 0116 coloured white and one
coloured pink; the white ballot to, be given to
maie voters and the pink ballot to, female voters.
The returning officer shall make a return showing the total number of each class of vote.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Wbat good purpose will be served by that?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: You want to know
whether more nmen than women voted, or
whether more women than men.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: While I arn not
very enthusiastic about women's votes, I
do not see wby you should distinguish between the maie and the female votes. It
appears to me that it wouid be a violation
of the secrecy of the ballot which bas been
adopted the world over.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is just as secret
as ever.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to, the honourabie gentleman from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) that while it
wouid be a very interesting study to, analyze the ballot in this way, and to determine how many men and bow many women
had voted, yet there is the insuperabie difficulty tbat if we had to print a new ballot
the vote could not take place as bas already
been arranged. The ballots are ail printed.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Then I withdraw the
proposed amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
informed by Colonel Biggar, the returning
officer for the Dominion, that it wouid take
four months to, get a new ballot.
The preambie was agreed to.
The title was agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
By leave of the House, on motion of Hon.
Sir James Lougheed, the Bihl was read the
third time and passed.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADfDPuP.qS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the Address in reply to His

Excellency the Governor General's Speech
at the opening of the Session.
Hon. A. B. CROSBY: Honourable gentlemen, in moving yesterday that the debate
be adjourned until to-day, I overlooked the
fact that to-day would be Friday. This
House bas been very generous to the honourable gentlemen fromn Quebec, and as to
that I have no protest at ail to, make, but
I now find that some of these honourable
gentlemen, who preceded me in this discussion, have left the Chamber. I can quite
understand their desire to do so and go to
their homes rather than listen to, me. At
the samne time I desire to make my few
remarks on the Address when these honourable memhers are present. My reason
is that during their speeches, they did not
allow mie to ask any questions or make any
replies. I would request the House to be
good enough to, permit me to move the
adjournment of this debate until Monday
or Tuesday, or whenever the House reassembles. Then our friends wiil be here
and I shall have a fair field in the debate
and shall be able to deal with the honourable members who made statements that
were not correct. I therefore move the
adjournmnent of the debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Until Monday
or Tuesday?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: 1 do not know, but
I understand we are going to adjourn tilI
Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend fromn Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power) was
desirous of speaking this afternoon. Would
the honourable gentleman object to bis
making bis speech now?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Certainly not.
shail be delighted to bear it.

I

Hon. Mr. MURPHY :! The honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Crosby) wants the
proper auditors.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does it make any
difference?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: On the understanding that it does not take away my right
to, speak.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is this going to
be a precedent?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Precedents are made to, be broken, you know.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: On any Friday
some honourable gentleman wbo felt that

)8

SENATE

his audience was not sufficiently large for
him might simply move an adjournment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
this is an exceptional case. My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Bostock)
has suggested that we might advantageously occupy the time this afternoon in
listening to the senior member for Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Power), instead of the honourable gentleman who moved the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I transfer my right
to him.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I am much obliged to the honourable
members of the House for the courtesy they
have extended to me. I have not very much
to say.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will the honourable gentleman permit me to interrupt for
one moment? There is a point of order
which is rather important. I think my honourable friend from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Crosby) has lost his right to speak, under
the rules. I do not want to raise the point
when he stands up to speak at the next
meeting of the House, but unless this question is settled now, I shall raise the point
when the House does meet again. He bas
lost his turn.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As I
understand it, the honourable gentleman
from Halifax on this side (Hon. Mr.
Crosby), by leave of the House, asks that
the senior member for Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Power) be permitted to precede him in the
discussion. That is all he asks, and it is
done by leave of the House, the honourable
gentleman reserving to himself the right
to address the House when we resume.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I should be very
sorry to do anything that would deprive
the House of the pleasure of hearing my
honourable colleague from Halifax on a
future day; and, as I have mentioned, I
have not very much to say. I have come
to that time of life and membership when
one does not care to be obliged to hold back
anything in the nature of a speech to be
made by himself.
I notice that the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
devoted a reasonable length of time to a
criticism of the Government for not providing for a dissolution. I feel this way
about that matter, honourable gentlemen.
The present Administration-or, at any
rate, the Administration of which the
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

present is the successor-passed an act
known as the War-time Elections Act.
That Act, I do not hesitate to say, is probably the most unfair and objectionable
Act with respect to voting that bas ever
been passed in any English-speaking community. I do not feel as my honourable
friend from De Lorimier does; I do not
think that there is any occasion for our
worrying over dissolution. The honourable gentleman from De Lorimier knows
very well-better than I do-the character
of the measures by which the Government
secured a continuance in office after 1917;
and it is perfectly safe to say that a
government or party who could make use
of such an instrument as the War-time
Elections Act to secure office are not going
ta retire from office until they are obliged
to do so. This position reminds me somewhat of a remark made a great many years
ago, during the McKenzie administration,
by Mr. Joseph Rymal, who was a member
from an Ontario constituency. He said:
"The she-bear robbed of ber cubs is mild
compared with the Liberal Conservative out
of office." And the Liberal Conservative,
like the leopard, bas not changed his spots
since.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: The other fellows
have changed several times.
Hon. Mr. POWER:
I do not think,
honourable gentlemen, that on an occasion
of this sort, when we are dealing with
the Speech from the Throne, the members
are bound strictly to the limits set forth
in the Speech. The practice bas been, I
think, always to regard the House on
this occasion as a sort of committee on
the state of the Dominion, every member having the right ta express his views
not only on the coming measures indicated in the Speech from the Throne,
but also on the record of the Government
during their past administration. I think
that on the present occasion it is more
than usually justifiable and desirable that
this practice should be followed. This is
an occasion when, as I have said, we
should not be confined within strict limits;
and this is the more true because the
actions of the present Government, as
anyone who examines into their record will
see, do not by any means always square
with their declarations of intention.
Up
to 1873 or 1874 there was a theory that
none but a Conservative Government
could administer the affairs of Canada
in a satisfactory way. I do not know now

FEBRUARY 18, 1921
whether Sir John A Macdonald made the
statement himself or flot, but it was made
on his behaf-that the gift of governing
.was confined to the Conservative Party.
That theory bas disappeared. It disappeared very largely under the Mackenzie
administration, and completely disappeared under the Laurier administration.
Now let us consider, honourable gentlemen, what the position is, if we wish to
see what we are to expect. Let us consider what were the promises and undertakings of the Conservatives before they
came into office, and what were their
achievements afterwards. One of the first
and principal promises made on behaîf of
the Conservative Party by their recognized
leader was that if the Conservatives were
placed in power the affairs of the country
would be managed with much more regard
to economy than they were managed under
the Liberal administration. The country,
influenced by these promises, placed
the gentleman who promised greater
economy at the head of an administration.
One of the first resuits was that within a
few months after the economists had got
into office the number of Civil Servants in
this country increased by nearly fifty per
cent. That was the first great step in the
direction of economy. That was not the
only one; there was greater expenditure
in every direction--expenditure for. naval
purposes, expenditure in shipbuilding,
extravagant expenditure on docks and railroads, et cetera. So we found that with
regard to the subi ect of econemy we could
not rely upon the promises of the present
administration.
One of the great war cries of the
Opposition in 1911 was that there should
be no trade or no dealings with the republic
te the south of us. Every one of us knows
that hardly had the new Government been
comfortably seated when they began to
negotiate at Washington, and the relations
between the Government of -Canada and
the Government at Washington were neyer
before as intimate as they have been during
the administration of these gentlemen
who did not wish any truck or trade with
the people to the South. So much for the
second promise.
Then, honourable gentlemen, as I said
a while age, there was a theory that the
Liberal Conservative Party was the only
party that could carry on the Government
of t1iis country in a satisfactory waY. I
venture to say, honourable gentlemen, that
from 1867 up te the pressent time there bas
neyer been any Administration so decidedly

characterized by incapacity as the present
Administration.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. POWER: When I say the
present Administration, 1 mean the Administration fromn 1911 up to the present
time. A gevernment have some duty besides that of sitting down and looking after
elections and drawing their pay. It is the
duty of the Government to lay down the
policy which the country is to follow. I
quite agree that yeu cannot expect the
ministers to go into every. subordinate department and conçluct its business, but it
is clearly their duty to do two things: one
is te lay down a general policy, and the
next is to se supervise the work of the
country that that policy will be adhered
to and carried out successfully. Now,
every honeurable gentleman here knows
that neither of those duties bas been performed by the present Government. When
the policy with respect te any important
matter was to be settled, the Government
did not decide upen it; the Government
appointed a commission and left with that
commission the duty of deciding upon the
policy. The commission, as a rule, went
out and spent months, probably, in inquiring, and they reported-reported sometimes definite opinions and sometimes not.
But the general outcome with respect to
the reports of commissions was that nothing
was done.
Take, for instance, the Board of Commerce. A commission was appointed composed of mnen of very considerable ability
and capacity for work, and their duty was
to prevent the consumers of this country
fromn being victimized by the profiteers.
Some honourable gentlemen here read the
English newspapers. You! icouId hardly
take up an English newspaper without findmng that seme person in business, frequently a retailer, had been brought up
and fined a considerable sumn for profiteering. The same thing happened in the
United States: yeu would see that So-andse had been fined $5,000 for charging unduly for a necessary of life. But that
bas not been the case in Canada. As far
as I arn aware, the only matter in which
anything jet all bas been done by the
Board of Commerce is the question cf
prices of sugar. Let me illustrate the
extent to which. this profiteering was carried on, if one may use the word "profiteering" in this case. It seems really to
apply to something bigger, but the principle is the samne. Now, I arn not going to
speak cf any particular firm or person. I

SENATE
think that on the whole the wiser plan
is to take the Government. The Government appointed a commission whose object
was to prevent undue profits from being
made on the necessaries of life. The Government happen to control an undertaking
which has to deal with the matter of food.
I just give the experience that any honourable gentleman bas probably met with
when travelling on the Government railways. I happen to know that the Government does not pay more than 5 cents
apiece for grapefruit; but on the Intercolonial in the dining-car 35 cents is
charged for a half grapefruit. There is a
profit of something like 700 per cent.
Then, take the matter of fish. The trains
from Nova Scotia to Ottawa bring large
quantities of fresh fish; that fish can be
bought in the market in the lower provinces for not more than 10 cents a pound.
If one orders fish for breakfast in the
dining car, he gets probably a quarter of a
pound at the outside and is charged 50
cents for it. I do not say anything about
the injury that must be done to the dining
car business by the exorbitant rates that
are charged; but here is the Government
setting the very worst possible example
to people in business. How can you expect the retailers throughout Canada to
be careful not to exceed a reasonable profit
on the sale of their goods when you have
the Government making 700 per cent
profit?
I really think the excessive
charges made on the Intercolonial dining
cars are enough to show you what little
honesty there was in connection with the
Board of Commerce.
And, by the way,
honourable gentlemen, while it is not
directly in point, I think it is to a certain
extent to the purpose to say that I have
learned that recently the Canadian Pacific
Railway company have largely reduced the
charges in their dining cars; and I think
the least the Government should do is to
reduce the charges on their cars to the
same level.
I ventured to say just now that there
was a great lack of capacity shown by the
Government; but when it has been a question of keeping the Government in office
or getting them into office they have shown
what may, I think, be honestly and properly described as a pernicious activity. The
manner in which the war-time elections
were conducted showed an activity and astuteness worthy of a better cause.
I do not purpose to say much more,
honourable gentlemen, about the history
of this Government.
But I just turn to

economical Government-and the honourable leader of the House has pointed out
within the last few minutes a saving of
$300,000 as a good reason for taking certain action in respect to a measure asked
by the Ontario Government. I think the
honourable leader of the House is perfectly
right; but this economy is something that
apparently has struck the Government
only lately and only struck them in spots.

case in the Old Country, I think that up
to the time that the late war broke out,
at any rate, there was no necessity for
old-age pensions in Canada. The people
of Canada were, as a whole, remarkably

were taken care of by the various localities-and there was no more necessity for old-age pensions in Canada

millions and millions of dollars a year.
Well, if the country is fairly prosperous
unemployment insurance is unnecessary,
and if the unemployment results from
strikes I do not think the rest of the people should be penalized to enable any section of the population to discontinue work.
The next paragraph of the Speech from
the Throne which bas struck me is one
which states:
The first assembly of the League of Nations
was recently held at Geneva. Representatives
of forty-one nations, including those of Canada,
met and deliberated together in a spirit of harmony that promises much for this great experiment.

I think that is a very satisfactory statement; that whole paragraph is satisfactory.
It is satisfactory to know that the three
honourable gentlemen whom Canada sent
over to take part in the recent meeting at
Geneva distinguished themselves there by
their ability, and that the line of action
which they adopted will probably lead to a
pretty considerable improvement in the
framework of the League of Nations. Apparently the prospects are that the 10th

FEBRUARY 18, 1921
clause of the treaty, which bas been the
occasion of a good deal of justifiable criticism, is likely to be altered owing to the
able and resolute attitude taken by the
honourable gentlemen who went from
Canada.

We were told last year, unless I am very
much mistaken, that the Income War Tax
Act was to be consolidated and distributed
in the shape of a pamphlet. That pamphlet, as far as I am aware, bas not reached
the taxpayers yet, and I trust that this
time we shall have better luck.
The next paragraph deals with the tariff

ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Friday, February 18, consideration of the Address in
reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the Session.
Hon. A. B. CROSBY: Honourable gentlemen, it was with pleasure that I and
every other honourable gentleman who was
present listened to the Speech from the
Throne, and, following that, the resolution
which was moved by the honourable member for Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster).
In listening to the Speech from the Throne,
one realized that there was not much in it
that could be opposed. The honourable

FEBRUARY 22, 1921
member from. De Lanaudière (Hon. J. P. B.
Casgrain) told us about the honourable
member from. Stadacona, who had rnoved
the Address. He said that the honourable
gentlernan's character and standing and
knowledge of business in the Dominion of
Canada were such that anything he said
should be taken for granted, because it
wouid be right and couid not be otherwise.
At the sarne time the honourable gentleman, before he took his seat, gave us ta
understand that he was falsifying bis
own staternent. Those of us who fallowed
the speech of the hon ourable member from
Stadacona, and who heard the resolution
he moved, seaonded in such an eloquent
manner by the hanourable gentleman from
Pembroke (Hon. G. V. White), could not
but feel that they had said ail that could
be said in the Speech frorn the Throne.
But sorne honourable gentlemen on the other
side, as is their custom, paid no heed ta
what was before the House. Long as they
have been' in this House, they are prone
ta do the things they should nat do here,
and thus they set a bad example ta the
younger men caming inta the Senate.
My honourable friend frorn De IoArirnier
<Hon. R. Dandurand) started away back
at 1854, in order that he migbt be able to
say a few words. The honourable gentlemnan took up the tirne of this House for
something like two hours talking about
stealing electians and that kind of tbing,
and he thought he was rnaking a success of
that; but before he resumed bis seat he
discavered he had made a sad failure af it.
The bonourable gentleman has referred
to, the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, and I
want ta refer ta that treaty for one reasan
and one reason only, and that is ta say that
if the United States bad not misjudged
the people af Canada and had allowed that
treaty ta continue, the probabilities are
that there wauld have been no Canada taday. We did not want that treaty abrogated, but tbey abragated it, and for what?
Tbey had only one purpose in view-ta
try ta force Canada inta annexatian. One
cannot came ta any other conclusion, thaugh
he may go aver the course af history frorn
that day ta this. Who was interested in
Canada at that tirne? Not Great Britain:
she did not care very rnuch for Canada
at that tirne, althaugh since then she has
realized that we are ber strang rigbt arm.
But at the tirne of whicb I arn speaking
we were only a bother ta ber-an encuzabrance. But the United States played their
cards wrang, and consequently wben that
treaty was abrogated tbe gaod men af this

6

Dominion, the men who were campetent,
the good men frorn the province of Quebec, the province of Ontario, and the eastern provinces carne together and agreed
that tbey must stand tagether for Canada.
My honourable friend bas told us: "You
were always looking for reciprocity." Yes,
we were looking for reciprocity, and when
we got recipracity we did not want it, because it was got at the wrong time. It
was got by the Liberals, and they always
do things at the wrong time. Tbey were
always wrong and will always be wrong, as
they are to-day, and you must be convinced
of this wherever you may look. I purpase
sbowing that befare I sit down. I will show
my honourable' friend that tbe people of
Canada bave very littie hope or trust in
'the party which he tries ta represent bere.
As 1 say, the big rnen af Canada got tagether in those early days of reciprocity
and decided that, tbey rnust stick together,
couple up the provinces, make a stand for
interprovincial. trade, bring about a national condition and start a nation in Canada. They did sa, and we then forrned
what is known as tbe Confederation, and
no men took a mare prorninent part in that
movement than the leaders from the province ai Quebec.
I shahl not dwell very long on that point.
I want ta corne ta the treaty af 1873, tbe
Treaty of Washington, whicb was the next
treaty we had. I arn not sure ai the date,
because I bave not been very well since
Saturday, and bave not bad an opportunity of laoking these matters up.
Tbat
treaty gave us the right ta send fish to the
United States free ai duty. We tried ta get
free entry for lumber and agricultural products. We did tbe best we could, but that
was ail we cauld get. But wbat did the
United States get under that treaty? Tbey
got free access ta aur insbore fisheries.
Tbey said, "We will appoint a commission
ta decide what rnanetary value is ta be
placed upon that concession," and tbat commission was appointed and decided that we,
with Newfoundland, were entitled ta get
$5,500,000, af wbicb $1,500,000 went ta
Newfoundland.
While I arn toucbing an tbis point, let
me say that tbe interest on this $4,000,000
furnishes the bounty paid ta the fishermen
in the eastern provinces every year ta the
extent af about $160,000. Let me suggest
this-and I cornrend it ta the attention af
the leader af the Hause-that that $160,000
should be paid ta tbe insbore fishermen af

34

SENATE

eastern Canada, every dollar of it, and
that not one dollar of it should go to the
deep sea fishermen. I do not mean to say
that I would take away the bounty of the
deep sea fishermen, but what they receive
should be paid from the general revenues
of Canada. If there is one man in this
Dominion who should be re-established, it
is the inshore fisherman, and he should get
the full amount that he derives from that
source. This is a very important matter,
and I hope it will not be long before the
Government takes it into consideration.
In those days the inshore fisheries were
the only fisheries we had, and even to-day
they are worth a great deal to this country, although in many places they are more
or less a thing of the past.. So much for
the Washington Treaty and my honourable
fiiend's arguments for reciprocity. I have
shown you that the United States were
bound, and always have been bound, to
give us nothing they could possibly keep
from us.
We come then to the election of Sir
John A. Macdonald and the question of the
mandate, which I intend to take up later
on. Sir John A. Macdonald lost his mandate and another Government had to be
formed. The situation then was not as it
is to-day: Sir John A. Macdonald lost his
mandate, and a new Government came in
under the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie; today the leader of the Government has the
whole House behind him.
Sir John A. Macdonald inaugurated
what is known as the National Policy,
which is as good to-day as it was then.
In 1878 the Government went to the
country, and what happened?
We all
know what happened, so I need not tell
you. Again in 1882 they appealed to the
country, and I need not tell you what happened. They went to the country again
in 1887, and on that occasion there was a
real issue; but I need not speak of that:
it is all dead and buried.
Again, in 1891, the time of which my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
spoke the other day, there was an appeal
to the people. The honourable gentleman
indicated that we had gone to the people
on the question of reciprocity in natural
products. That is not so. I want to put
my honourable friend right. We went to
the people on the National Policy, as we
had done in the preceding election, and
his party appealed to the electors on unrestricted reciprocity, and we knocked the
"divil" out of them.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY.

What the Conservative party did say
on that occasion was this: "If we are returned, we shall be glad to send a commission down to Washington, and, if we can,
make a deal with the United States with
regard to some natural products, or some
products as to which we feel it will be of
advantage to us." They were able to do
nothing, and, thank God, we were able to
get along without it, for any time we need
help we shall get very little from them.
A United States statesman once said that
he could not say that every Democrat was
a horse thief, but he could say that every
horse thief was a Democrat, and I defy
contradiction when I say that while every
Liberal is not an annexationist, wherever
you find an annexationist you find him
under the umbrella of the Liberal party.
There are some people to-day who are
talking about opening up Canada to the
United States. We are side by side with
the greatest nation in the world-the
richest nation in land and in everything
you can think of, under the earth or on
top of it; their climatic conditions are
wonderful; and yet we are holding our
own, which proves beyond a doubt that
we are a great people and that this is a
great country. We, with a population of
nearly 10,000,000 people, are standing
alongside this rich country with a population of from 100,000,000 to 120,000,000
people, and we are holding our own and
are second to no country in the world.
My honourable friend was mistaken in
saying that we went to the country on reciprocity in 1891. We did not go to the
country on that issue at that time. We held
up the old flag, and we waved it, and we will
continue to wave it as long as it is there
to be waved, and that will be for all time.
We always went to the country waving that
flag and telling the people what we would
give them.
Then we come to the election of 1896, and
later on the election of 1917, of which my
hon. friend spoke very strongly, saying, I
think, that it had been stolen. One thing
about which I have no doubt is that he
said it was won by a most stupendous
fraud. I do not think it is wise to go back
and bring up old accusations. What we
should consider is the present and the
future.
I
am sorry to say
that
my Irish friends in another land-friends
to whom my heart is true, and for whon
no man would be better pleased to give
every moment of his life-have gone wrong,
and are doing themselves a great deal of
injury. I am afraid the same thing is

FEBRUARY 22, 1921
happening in this country. We sometirnes
say things that we should not say. We have
no right to go back and bring up things
that-should be forgotten.
I amn sorry that my honourable friend
the senior member for Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Power) is not here, as 1 should like to say
sornething about the election of 1896. He
wrote a pamphlet on that election. I went
to hirn and asked him if hie would not
be good enough to give me a copy of that
pamphlet. He is a literary character, and
no one has a higher appreciation of his
literary menit than hie has himself. My
honourable friend remembers as well as
I do, and better perhaps, what was done in
the province of Quebec in 1896, and now the
good people of that province-and they are
ail good people if it were not for agitating
leaders-were fooled. I have heard sorne
nmen say that Quebec did not do what she
should have done in the war; but I say that
the people of that province are to be congratulated on what they did, under the
conditions that existed there.
1 have nothing to say of the great leader,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, except that hie was
a fine man and that everyone liked him.
I liked him myself. I always liked him to
keep in his place, and his place was making
nice speeches and not doing niuch in the
affairs of the country. He was a fine rnan,
and in rny judgment it is a pity he did
mot do as many of bis fniends did and corne
into the Union Government, which was
formcd for the purpose of welding the people of that province with the people of the
other provinces ini the great undertaking
which we had on hand. He did not corne
into the Union Government, but that was
mlot the fault of the Conservative party.
I do not think any man can say that a
greater sacrifice was ever made in this
country, or in any other country, than was
mnade by Sir Robert Borden. Everyone,
no rnatter what his politics rnay be, must
give Sir Robert Borden credit for the way
he sacrificed every personal interest and
every interest of his party for one purpose,
and one purpose only, that of bringing the
people of this country together to win the
war. I want to say here, having had the
great honour of being a colleague of that
honourable gentleman, that I often felt
in rny heart that hie was making a rnistake,
and that I could have done better myseif,
because I had studied the people and had
been watching politics ail rny life, whereas
he camne into politics later in life. But I
was brought around to his view the very
:minute I carne into his presence and heard
S-5

him address his followers and tell them that,
no rnatter what the sacrifice, no matter
what happened, the one thing hie was desirous of doing and would do under any
circumstances was to iinite the people
of Canada with the object of winning the
war and dealing with the problerns that
arose out of the war.
If there ever was a time when a party
could be accused of false promises it was
in 1896. The 'province of Quebec had
always been a supporter of protection, but
what was the staternent made to the people
of the province of Quebec? The Remedial
Bill did not meet the situation at aIl. The
people were asked: "What are you going
to do? Are you going to return Sir John
Macdonald and elect Sir Charles Tupper,
and turn down Sir Wilfrid Laurier who is
of your own kmn and your own religion? Is
that what you are going to do?
No. You are going to send hlm back and
he will give you a rernedy: he will give
you ail that you have a right to get, and
nothing less." And, honourable gentlemen,
they sent him back, giving hirn fifty-one
or fifty-two out of the sixty-five.
My
honourable friend knows that is a tact.
And what did Sir Wilfrid Laurier give
them?
I do not think hie was Sir
Wilfrid Laurier at that time; however,
he was good enough to be called
Sir.
What did he give them?
My
friend tells me he gave thern, what he always gave thern, a smile-a pleasant srnile.
You cannot get even that frorn sorne of
them now. That was one thing that Sir
Wilfrid could always give them, a smile,
and that is all the remedy hie told themn he
would give themn in the province of Manitoba. Now, honourable gentlemen, you
sometimes can get an election carried hy a
faIse promise. That election was carried
by the province of Quebec. Let rny honourable friend put that down in his diary
and not forget it for a while.
In the
election of 1900, the samne thing was done.
But I arn not going to dwell on this point.
In the election of 1911 they hrought up

foresaw what was ahead, but what a
great thing it was that those gentlemen«
went down to the United States. Let me
tell you a little story I heard about those
gentlemen. when they went down there the
flrst time. There were Sir Wilfrid Laurier
and Mr. Fielding and Mr. Patterson. Sir
Wilfrnid was a distinguished-looking man.
Whereve r he rnight be, someone would ask,

REVIBED XDITION

SENATE

" Who is that splendid looking gentleman?"
He was one of the most gentlemanly persons you could meet. You would always
expect better things from him than you
got. However, when he was leading the
procession into the White House, an old
Yankee who was standing by asked:" Who
be those three men?" Somebody answered:
" Why, there is Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the
Premier of Canada, and that is Mr. Fielding, the Finance Minister of Canada, and
that is Mr. Patterson, the Canadian Minister of Customs, the man who makes the
biscuits over there." And the old Yankee
said: " Ah, yes, that be where they have
to sing' God Save the King!' Now I understand why they have to sing that."
He
thought from the look of those Ministers
that it would be essential to take care of
the King.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I come to the
election of 1917 and the War-time Elections
Act. I would like to find out what my honourable friend has to say about that Wartime Elections Act. If I understand it
rightly, that measure was framed on the
principle and with the intention that every
Britisher, every Canadian, every man who
was taking any part in the fight for Canada, for Britain, for the freedom of the
world, was interested and should be on that
electoral list if possible.
That was the
principle of the Act, and I ask my honourable friend if he does not think that was a
proper principle?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He is very quiet.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Well, he is getting
instructions from that able Whip.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Silence gives consent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Go on.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: No, I am not going
on. Pardon me. I have my place in this
honourable House, and if those honourable
gentlemen do not know enough to treat
others as they are treated when they are
talking, it is their fault, not mine.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would the honourable gentleman-?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: The honourable
gentleman will do anything you ask.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We wvould like
to know what the joke in the story was.
We have not seen it.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: It would be of no
use for anybody to tell the honourable
gentleman a joke, because he never could
see it, unless somebody explaineJ it to him
Hon.

M[r.

CROSBY

the next day. He would never be able to
have his laugh when he first heard it.
What I want to say, honourable gentlemen,
is this. If I understand the War-time
Elections Act, it was framed for the purpose of making sure that every Britisher,
every win-the-war person in Canada, would
have the right to vote in the election of
1917; and I want to ask my honourable
friend if that was a wrong principle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is the honourable gentleman addressing me?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Yes, sir. I want to
ask if that was a wrong principle
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I stated my
views last week, before the honourable gentleman spoke.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: The honourable gentleman may have stated his views, but nobody in this House knows what his views
are. I could not make them out. I am
asking him if that was a wrong principle
on which to frame that Elections Act. Do
not tell him, Mr. Whip. He does not need
you all the time. Was it a wrong principle on which to frame that measure at
a time when a war was going on, a war in
,which we had been engaged for three years?
Was it wrong to frame that Act so that
every man who was taking part in thai
war, every woman who was taking part ii
it, every woman who had a son in it, or a
brother in it, should have a vote in that
election? Was that a wrong principle?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAÑD: I do not admit
that that was the principle underlying the
Act.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Then what was the
principle underlying it? More principle
than my honourable friend has in dealing
with anything, which is not much. But,
honourable gentlemen, that was the underlying principle, and that was the proper
principle, and everybody in Canada who
believed in principle and fair-play voted
for that; but I am sorry to say that my
honourable friend's people did not vote for
that principle. He may say to me that
certain people were eliminated. Yes, but
nothing like as many as should have been
eliminated; and, if I had my way, I would
eliminate a good many of them to-day and
they would not vote at the next election.
But this Government-this broad-minded
forgiving Government, that wishes to have
the country run by the people and for the
people, and to give the people every oppor-

FEBRUARY 22, 1921
tunity of doing the right thing by themselves-gave them a franchise that eliminated nobody. But do not misunderstand
me, honourable gentlemen. I am not referring to any one province in this
Dominion. There were men all over Canada,
and there are men all over Canada to-day,
who should not have a vote, and if I had
power to keep them off the voters' list, I
would do so.
Speaking about the franchise, let me
give you an illustration. My honourable
friend is a great admirer of the Hon. Mr.
Fielding, who was the Minister of Finance
in the Laurier Administration, and a man
who was looked upon as the next leader;
and, as leaders go in that party, I think
he would be all right-for that party. He
was looked upon as the ablest man in the
party, the man who would take the place
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. I will tell my
honourable friend something about his
Election Act. What do you suppose that
gentleman did when he became premier of
Nova Scotia? He passed an Act that eliminated every employee of the Dominion
Government from the exercise of the franchise. He did not take away the franchise
of the men who were engaged by the Local
Government, but he took away the franchise of every Civil Servant in that province who was employed by the Dominion
Government.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Our Liberal Government did the same thing.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Yes, they are all
alike. But I would ask my honourable
friend if he would consider that that was
a fair and decent way of acting. I am sure
he would not. Silence gives consent. He
would say that was an outrage. But what
do you suppose the Liberals did after they
came into power in 1896, and before they
went to the country in 1900? Did they
not enfranchise the Dominion officials so
that they would be able to pull them in to
vote for them in 1900? Yet the honourable gentleman comes here and talks about
the franchise and about the stealing of
elections. Why, it is outrageous, it is unfair, it is unreasonable; and it is something
which would not be expected from a man
of the experience of my honourable friend
from De Lorimier, because from his appearance and his personality you would expect better from him than that he would
talk of matters of that kind when he himself knows that if there have been in this
country any elections that have been-I was

going to say, a disgrace, but perhaps that
would be too strong a word-if there have
been any elections misleading to the people,
they are the elections with which he bas
been connected and in which he has been
engaged head and shoulders. I have no
hesitation in saying that.
My honourable friend spoke the other day
about the Government going to the country. The Postmaster General (Hon. Mr.
Blondin) gave us the information, which
I know is true, that the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier had never tried going to the country himself, unless perhaps
it were for a holiday down by a stream;
that is to say, the honourable gentleman
had never accepted a nomination. Whether
he had ever been offered one or not, I do
not know; the Postmaster General did not
tell us about that. At any rate he told
us the honourable member from De Lorimier had never run in an election. Why,
about gothen, is he so anxious
ing to the country? Perhaps if he had
to run in an election he would not be so
anxious about that. Well, there were some
men who went to the country, and I cannot
see where the honourable gentleman would
derive any consolation from the result.
We had an election in the province of
Nova Scotia since the Meighen government
came in. The people down there did not
know much about Mr. Meighen, but he
came down there and when they saw him
they liked him, and what he said to them
they believed in, and they believe in it
still. I refer to that splendid county of
Colchester, a farming county second to
none in the Dominion of Canada. I see
my honourable friend here is smiling. I
do not care whether Ontario or any other
province is included; I say that the county
of Colchester as a farming district is
second to none in the Dominion of Canada,
and if I had to go further and provide
proof of that, I should be prepared to
produce it. I do not mean ,to say that it
bas as many people as some other counties, but I refer to its standing in reference
to its population. The Liberal party could
not get a man to accept nomination and
contest the election i.n that county; but
they did throw in their whole weight, and
the Labour party did the sane thing. I
do not want to be misunderstood about the
Labour party, because I am one of the
labour class myself; but, like my honourable friend from De Lorimier, the Labour
men go wrong sometimes, I have no hesitation in saying. But I am as faithful to
the labour interests in the Dominion of

Canada as any man in this country. However, I was not in line with the Labour
men who were in Colchester, and I had the
opportunity of meeting several of them
there. The Labour men in Colchester, and
the Farmers' party and the Liberals,
joined up to defeat Mr. McCurdy, and we
beat them there by fifteen hundred votes,
the largest majority ever polled in that
What consolation does that give
county.
my honourable friend? It gives him no
consolation. That is the kind of consolation he will get when we go to the polls;
and I hope that this Government will take
care that when we do go to the polls the
minds of the people will be in such a state
that we shall get a fair vote, whether it is
for his party or for ours, or for whatever
party it may be.
But we had an election in St. John, over
in the Province of New Brunswick, and the
Liberals put up a candidate there, a very
decent, very fine man. I know him very
well. But what happened there? I need
not tell you what happened: he almost lost
his deposit. Where does my honourable
friend get any intimation, or indication, on
which to base the opinion which he gave us
here the other day, unless he may have it
in the Province of Quebec? He said the
Province of Quebec was going to have revenge, or words to that effect. I want to
say to him here that I have as warm feelings for the people of the Province of
Quebec as I have for those of any other
province of the Dominion. It was my good
fortune in my earlier days to have had a
great deal of business to do with Quebec;
so I have a very warn spot in my heart
for the people of that province, and I know
them to sone extent. I do not want to hear
such a statement as that of my honourable
friend. We may have our political differences, we maY differ on the question of
the tariff or on free trade and such matters, but I say to my honourable friend
from De Lorimier that we ought to forget
those unfortunate differences which have
cropped up and have embittered the hearts
of the people. Let us all try to overcome
them. Let us all try to bring about an
understanding so that the people of this
great Dominion can come together and join
hands and work for one common interest,
the Dominion of Canada and the great
British flag that flies over it. Let us forget
the past and try to bring about unity.
I have spoken much longer than I intended, but I should like before taking my
seat to say a few words with regard to the
Hon. Mr. CROSBY.

mandate. Speaking about that a short
time ago, I pointed out that Sir John Macdonald had to give up his leadership in
Parliament in 1873, because he had lost
his mandate. How did he lose his mandate?
Where does the mandate come from? The
mandate comes, thank God, from the people
of this country.. It is given to the men in
the different electoral districts of Canada.
In every constituency a man is elected by
the people and he carries the mandate to
Parliament. The Premier of the country
does not carry the mandate; it is carried
to Parliament by the men who are elected
from the constituencies. So long as the
Right Honourable Mr. Meighen has that
mandate behind him, as he has to-day, and
as I know he will continue to have itbecause the more you know him the better
you like him-you cannot take it away
from him. You will have to find a good
many more Mackenzie Kings than you can
find in Parliament to take it away from
him. By that mandate, so long as it is
behind him, Mr. Meighen can continue to
the end of the term. He might lose it tomorrow, might lose it next Session, or at
any time. It is the right of the people's
representatives to forsake him; but, as I
say, it is by their legal mandate that he is
carrying on the government of the country.
My honourable friend ought to know that;
he must know that; and there fore I say that
when any honourable gentleman gets up
in this House or anywhere else and talks
about this mandate and that mandate, if
there is one man who, more than another,
has no mandate, it is the man who left the
Meighen Government and went over to take
a seat somewhere else. I have no hesitation
in referring to the honourable gentleman
from our own province who was a member
of the Government, and who took his seat
on the other side of the House. I say he
should go down to the city from which he
comes and resign that mandate.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He is under the
gangway.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Yes, and he is in
a bad gang as well. I say that be and every
other honourable gentleman who bas a seat
on that side of the House and who went
across should have gone down to the people
and said: "We believe your mandate is at
an end."
Is not that fair and logical?
They should do that and see if they would
be returned again to take their seats on
the other side of the House. That seems to
me, as a layman, to be the proper thing to

FEBRUARY 22, 1921
do. Of course, I would not expect lawyers
to see it in that way; they never see anything right. Legal complications come in,
and they get things mixed up, but to my
mind that is the logical conclusion.
If ever anything made us suspieious of
our leader, it was what the honourable
gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power)
said to-night. I wanted to get some evidence
on the matter, because I do not want to
suspect my honourable friend the leader of
the Government. I look upon him as one of
the ablest men in Canada, and I do not
want to change my view on that point.
I want to say to the leader of the Opposition that I was pleased with his speech.
He looked at the Speech from the Throneand I do not want anyone to be suspicious
of me because I am going to fraternize
with my honourable friend.
Really, he
should be over here on this side of the
House. It is some kind of a mistake that
he is where he is-one of those accidents
that happen in the best-regulated families.
He is not at home on the other side of the
House and never seems just where he would
like to be. The honourable gentleman did
not say anything about the Speech from the
Throne. He looked it over, and he knew
he would have to go somewhere else if he
was going to say anything about it. I
want to say to him and to the honourable
gentlemen on the other side of the Housebecause there seem to be two sides te the
House, no matter what we try to do to make
it only one side-that if there ever was
a time in the history of Canada or the
history of the world when every man who
is a man.was called to put forward the
best that is in him, this is the time. This
is a time to support Conservative policies.
If there ever was a time te go slow and to
be careful and to try te pull together to
make this pne of the best and greatest
countries and our people one of the finest
people in the world, this is the time. Is it
net the duty of every fair-minded man,
every honest Canadian, to join hands and
do what he can te bring about such a condition in this country that when the next
election comes round-and I hope it will
net be too soon-the party- that the people
desire may be put into power? I am not
going te say anything about the Liberal
party, bècause no one can tell from one
week te another what.they are going te do.
I want te see such a condition that when the
people next go te the polls they will be in
such a state of mind that they will vote
for one of the parties, and that the party
they desire will govern them for the next

69

term of office. Let me say this as a workingman, as a man familiar with the working class; that the minds of the people
to-day are not in such a condition that they
are ready for an election. The farmers
are net ready for an election; they think
they are ready, but they are net. Nobody
in the Dominion of Canada is ready for an
election to-day. The people who have the
good of this Dominion at heart are hoping that an election will net be brought on
until the people are ready te give an unbiased and fair mandate te the next Government. I trust that the honourable leader
that we have to-day will live that long,
and I feel sure that God will be good enough
te permit hi te do so-and I hope he will
be the man te carry the colours of the
National Liberal and Conservative party
to the country; and if he does I am sure he
will sweep the country froi the Atlantic
te the Pacific.
Hon. P. E. BLONDIN: Honourable gentlemen, my honourable friend the member
for Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) intended
te move the adjournment of this debate,
but, as the remarks which I intend te make
will be very short, he bas agreed te permit
me to speak before him and after my
speech te move the adjournment of the debate.
I wish te join with the speakers who have
preceded me in congratulating the mover
and the seconder of the Address in reply
te the Speech from the Throne. Both of
them have performed a delicate and difficult task with talent, broad-mindedness and
thought such as one looks for in the members of this House. I should like particularly te congratulate my honourable friend
the member for Stadacona (Hon. L. C.
Webster) on the portion of his speech
which he made in French. There was a
time in Canada when some people thought
the ideal mette for a united Canada was:
"One flag and one language." The ideal
contained in the last part of the sentence
I am sure exists no longer, or, if it does,
I have no doubt in my own mind that the
achievements of the honourable member for
Stadacona in every walk of life are a substantial proof that a knowledge of both
the French and English languages is an instrument which every Canadian ought te
acquire. May I go further and say that it
seems te me that those who have charge of
the education of the younger generation'do
net appear te have realized how great is
the ability of young people te learn nearly
as many languages as they like when they

SENATE

are in the prime of their youth, and that
so far, not only in Canada, but in the whole
world of pedagogy, no adequate system has
yet been devised for developing in children,
to the extent of which it could be developed,
this wonderful aptitude which disappears
with age. Ever since it has been my privilege to sit in this honourable assembly I
have been impressed by the dignified way
in which its proceedings have been carried
on, and I am sure that I shall disappoint
those who think that I rise to-night in a
spirit of revenge for any attack that may
have been directed personally at me. The
best policy is to try to forget and forgive,
but certain matters have been placed before this House in words of bitterness
which, in spite of my reluctance to deal
with them, I feel it my duty to present in
their true light.
The first one is the self-given mandate
which my honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) seems to have
been assuming. For the last three years I
have seen him here talking as the mouthpiece, the authorized mandatory, for the
province of Quebec. Any such impression
is contrary to the fact. My honourable
friend has not the least authority to
speak for a single man in the province of Quebec. When the honourable
gentleman was looking down at me with
his splendid contempt-his kingly contempt
for the poor little thing that he thinks I
am-I was surveying him and trying to
find in his life any reason why he is here.
No one in the province of Quebec ever
knew of any reason for his being here.
H1e never was elected-not only was he
never elected, but he never ran, nor was
he ever offered the honour of being a candidate, in any constituency. A certain politician used to say that he could have his
own horse chosen as a candidate.
Well,
as a matter of fact, my honourable friend
never was a candidate anywhere in the
province of Quebec. He is a fighter only
here from his seat between these thick
walls. He is not known in the province of
Quebec. This is not an insult, but a real,
hard fact.
He had never been known
before he was made a Senator. I should
like to find someone in Montreal who would
tell me that he is a lawyer of any competency or prominence. Judging from his
speeches, he cannot have great ability
before the courts, where logic counts for
something. He bas become a very powerful, rich man; I am a poor man: is it
for that reason that he looks at me with
contempt? I do not know; but let me tell
Hon. M'r. BLONDIN.

him that he has no mandate to speak here
for the province of Quebec, but that I
know, and maybe some of the honourable
gentlemen around him know, as a large
proportion of the people know, that he has
not even a mandate to speak for his own
party. The real fact is, honourable gentlemen, that this gentleman, who bas presuned to have a mandate to speak for the
province of Quebec, is among the rank and
file of his own party the most execrated
man on earth. If the honourable gentleman wants to contradict what I say, let
him go outside, and ask the members of
the House of Commons to sign a certificate
for him.
I dislike to say what I am saying, honourable gentlemen, but for three years I
have been sitting here not uttering a word,
whilst the honourable gentleman was
taking advantage of my silence, thinking
that he had a sneaking dog to deal with,
as he once called me. I waited and waited,
thinking that the day might come when
he would see that he had no justification
for acting in that way and mend his ways.
But apparently the honourable gentleman
bas to fight a bulldog before he learns
that a dog will defend himself.
That is not all. The honourable gentleman asks what reason I have for being in
the Cabinet to represent my province. I
will tell him in a few words. In a county
where I had been twice elected, after a
very hard fight in which I fought singlehanded, I was the third time elected by
acclamation. It happened under most extraordinary circumstances which I will explain in a moment. The honourable member
who spoke before me spoke the truth: I was
elected in the face of menaces and threats
of the use of dynamite, on advice given by
the leaders of the Liberal organization, to
set fire to the places of those who had the
audacity to stand for the Government.
In the face of all that, honourable gentlemen, I am proud to say that 300 fathers
of families exposed the lives of their dear
ones to come and vote for me; that is,
300 votes more than the honourable gentleman ever got in his life or ever will get.
At the same time, I was running in the
constituency of Laurier-Outremont, and
there, I think I am pretty safe in saying
I received at least 5,000 votes; that is, 5,000 votes more than the honourable gentleman will ever be able to get. Still he asks
me by what right I am here speaking in
the name of the Province of Quebec? Well,
honourable gentlemen, I never claimed to
have any mandate to speak here for the

FEBRUARY 22, 1921

whole of the Province of Quebec; but were
I here only to represent those who had
the courage to stand up and vote for the
Government at the last election, I think
I would have reason enough to be here.
My honourable friend from De Lorimier
likes to refer to the honourable member for
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). He has
a fine way of making people believe that
he is in the secrets of those who sit on this
side of the House; that he knows all that
is going on. He mentioned the honourable
Senator from Montarville the other day as
the prophet of the fall of this Government.
But I know one thing: on the very eve of
the day on which the honourable senator
for Montarville was going to address this
Senate on the question of conscription,
sticks of dynamite were placed around his
house. That is a fine way to educate people
to the faith of Liberalism! My honourable friend spoke of the system of Trotsky
and Lenine, but Trotsky and Lenine might
have learned something from my friend's
friend during the elections of 1917. It was a
shame to see intelligent, learned, responsible men, men who knew they were hurting their province and the good name of
their people, but were not manly enough
to face the situation and tell our fine, intelligent, honest, brave people of the Province of Quebec what their duty was.
This is the first opportunity I have to
thank my honourable friend for having
been kind enough to appear with me in
Montreal when I started a recruiting campaign. We were unfortunate: we did not
succeed. I admit that I was the object of
the hatred that seemed to prevail among a
certain crowd of young men in the upper
part of the hall. It is true that the honourable gentleman made quite a good
speech there. He did not go so far as
his leader, the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, who said that we were in this war
to the last cent and the last man; but on
the whole he said it was not a bad thing
to do this for France, or something to that
effect. It is not with the intention of casting any reproach upon the honourable
gentleman that I mention this fact; but the
point that I want to make is this, that that
very night the few persons who prevented
the meeting from going on were members
of an organized political club. There were
in the hall many thousands of people who
were anxious to hear both sides of the question; but the Liberal organization had decreed that no men ought to be heard in the
Province of Quebec who were trying to ex-

71

plain the questions of the hour. We were
not allowed to speak. And I say this, that
history will show that if the Liberal party
had consented to play its part fairly, the
province which would have led in the application of military service would have
been my province. It is too bad to have to
say that I personally know the names of
men of high standing, Liberals, some honourable gentlemen, who were advising
young men anxious to enlist not to make
f'ools of themselves, but to stay at home.
Speakers who appeared on the hustings
were threatened with death.
As an instance of this, the editor of
L'Evenement, of Quebec, was surrounded by
a mob when he persisted in trying to address
a meeting, and he escaped lynching only
by a hair's breadth-under the smile of the
present Prime Minister of the province of
Quebec. Honourable gentlemen,-the people
of the province of Quebec have a tremendous reserve of calm patience, common sense
and coolness. I wonder whether in any
other province, under similar circumstances,
the people could have stood the test as well
as my people did.
I said I would not speak very long. I
wanted to tell my honourable friend in the
first place that he cannot make us believe
that he is in any sense authorized to speak
Let that be
for the province of Quebec.
clearly understood for the future. In the
second place I wanted to tell him that when
I accepted a cabinet position I did so
primarily in order to represent in thé cabinet those who voted for the Government.
Remember, honourable gentlemen, there
were hundreds of thousands of French Canadians who voted for the Government in
spite of everything. And, if you admit that
those people have a right to be represented
here, I wonder who is the more qualified
to represent them-this honourable gentleman or myself.
There is another point. From Lafontaine and Morin td Cartier and Laurier
there has been only one creed: it is that
isolation means death for the province of
Quebec. I believe in that creed. Were I
alone in the province of Quebec in believing
in it, I would stand alone till death. But
there are hundreds of thousands; not only
the immense majority, but the entire population of Quebec believe in it. I think that
in being in the Cabinet I am representing
those people.
Why does the honourable gentleman look
upon me with such contempt? Why does
he address me with such insults? Is it
because he is my senior in age and in this

SENATE
House? If that be so, I would take the
liberty of advising him to meditate on certain quotations that I shall read for his
benefit. The honourable gentleman likes
to make quotations. Oh, he bas a beautiful voice, just as agreeable as it is highpitched. He likes to make his voice heard,
but does not care very much for the poor
audience. He reads his speeches-quotes all
that can be quoted, and even quotes himself. Well, just to cope with those quotations, here is one that I would advise my
honourable friend to place just in front of
the quotation of himself that he gave last
year. This is an extract from the debates
of the British House of Commons of 1740.
It contains some of the advice that a
man younger than I am took the liberty of
offering to one of his elders.
Amongst
other things he said:
One should learn to reason rather than to
declaim, and to prefer justness of argument
and an accurate know lecige of facts to soundiang epithets and splendid superlatives, which
may d'isturb the imagination for the moment,
but leave no lasting impression on the mind.
That te accuse and prove are very different,
and that reproaches unsupported by evidence
affect only the character of him that utters
them.
That one should endeavor to be one of those
whose follies may cease with their youth, and
net of that number who are ignorant in spite
of experience.
That surely age may become justly contemptible if the opportunities which it brings
have passed away without improvement, acd
vice appears to prevail when the passions have
subsided. The wretch that, after havi'ng sean
the consequences of a thousand
errors, continues still to blunder, and whose age has only
added obstinacy to stupidity, is sýurely the object of either abhorrence or contenit. and
deserves not that his grey head should secure
him from insults.
Much more, Sir, is he to he abhorred who,
as he has advanced in age, bas receded from
virtue and spends the remains of his life in
the ruin of his country.

My bon. friend likes to say things which
are disagreeable to me, though they seem to
be pleasant for him. May I add this word
of wisdom, in order that he may meditate
upon it also:
No more lamentable spectacle can offer, qf
we except that of genius r.educed to miserv,
than that of contented fatuity.

My honourable friend seems to have laid
special stress on the War-time Elections
Act.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me, before he takes
up that question? Would he tell me if he
knows who gave the money to buy the dynamite of which he spoke, and which was
used in Montreal?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I know one thing,
only one thing, and a very sure thing-that
it was only the supporters of the Government who were blown up.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow me to say-?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -and I think
my honourable friend must know, that it
was proven in court that a Government
detective by the name of Desjardins, employed by the Government in Montreal,
paid $25 to the people who used the dynamite to which my honourable friend refers.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Well, I understandHon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is a fair question.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Oh, yes, I understand my honourable friend now. He is
absolutely right. I should not like to convey the impression that during those
troublous times people of all kinds did not
often act in the name of one party or the
other. But what my honourable friend
cannot deny is that this sort of thing was
general in the whole pravince of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no, no, no. 1
certainly deny that absolutely, and everybody will deny it. Dynamite general
throughout the province of Quebec? Does
the honourable gentleman know what he is
saying?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes, I do. How
many barns were burned, and how many
times was dynamite used in the district of
Quebec?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Only vhen the
Government paid for it.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: They were very
convincing arguments anyway. Well, facts
are facts, and the honourable gentlemen may
say what they like, but I repeat that there
is only one party who can be held responsible if we were not allowed to go to the
people of the province of Quebec and explain to them what the law was; it is the
Liberal party. And I wish to say this,
honourable gentlemen: every man in this
country who enlisted is entitled to the respect of all, but remember that while it
was a very difficult thing in the other provinces not to enlist, it took a doubly heroic
man in my province to enlist, because he

FEBRUARY 22, 1921
was exposed to the abuse of the Liberals
anywhere and at any time.
Honourable gentlemen, I did flot intend
to deal at such length with this matter, but
it must be admitted that we are ail nmen,
and that when you start a row you neyer
know where it will end.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURI: It looks like that.
does it not?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes. The other
day I interrupted the honourable gentle-«
man when he was quoting a certain phrase
wbich. has been used by the members £romn
the, province of Quebec. But mark you,
that during the whole election of 1917 the
entire press, save two newspapers, were
in the hands of these gentlemen-I arn
forgetting one, Le Devoir, Mr. Bourassa's
organ.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Your old leader.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: There is one
thing I want to gay about Mr. Bourassa:
1 respected hlm, I believed in him, and 1
followed him; and when I followed him,
I did not stay in a private office to attend to the organization; I slept in the cold
and faced the electors on the stump and
fought for him. The day carne when we
did not see eye to eye, and I left hirn; but
I know whorn I have left. I know what
Mr. Bourassa thinks, and I know he is flot
afraid of saying what he thinks. It is
strange that so long as he is fighting the
Liberal party-and when I refer to, the
Liberal party I want to say that I arn
not referring to the Liberal party of the
Dominion of Canada, for there is a great
difference between the real Liberals and
the Liberals of the province of Quebec.
So long as Mr. Bourassa is attacking tbem
he is the worst man in the world; they
have nothing dirty enough to say against
hlm;- but whenever Mr. Bourassa happens
to play in their hands, wbat a great man
he is I It is my firrn belief that it was not
Mr. Bourassa who was responsible for the
troubles of 1917: it was the Liberal party.
Had Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his Party
honestly played the game in Quebec, there
was no Bourassa and nobody else to prevent the people frorn understanding wbat
the issue was, and there would have been
no trouble in my province.
I was reported to have said a certain
tbing at a certain time. The war is over,
and we are facing the consequences of the
war: we are looking for reorganization
-reorganization in our financial and industrial life; reorganization in our nianner
of thinking and in the political, field; re-

.73

organization everywhere. That is the
question of to-day; that is the question
of to-morrow. I do not care, honourable
gentlemen, what I said two years, three
years, or ten years ago. If I arn reported
some day as having been the very devil
himself, I arn willing to admit it; but I
want my opponents to report me exactly
and to tell me where I was. That is ail
there is to it. 1 am* reported as having
nmade a speech at twenty different places.
I heard the honourable gentleman from
Arthabaska (Hon. Mr. Lavergne) state
that the speech was made on tbe hustings
at Arthabaska. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. LAVE RGNE: Go on.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I want to know
that.
Hon.,Mr. LAVERGNE: Go on. I bave
nothing to say now. I will speak after
you.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Was it made at
Arthabaska? Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: You ought to
know yourself.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I do know it myself, and I tell you honourable gentlemen
who report me wrongly that you do not
know what you say. I arn not ashamed of
what I said, and even if I said awful things
I amn not worried about thern. The only
thing that worries me is that I should do
my duty to-day and be wiser to-day than
I was yesterday. Not long ago my honourable friends of the province of Quebec
attended a Liberal conference in Ottawa,
and what was the great, the special titie
of the present leader of the Opposition in

Quebec it was stated that he was a grandson of the Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie,
who--well, was a kind of rebelîjous personage.
Even if my honourable friend
were to prove that I have been a rebel, I
could reply that even the Hlon. William
Lyon Mackenzie and Sir George Etienne
Cartier had a price put on their heads,
and it would not strengthen bis case. But
the only thing the Canadian people care
for to-day is to know where the honourable
gentlemen who caîl themselves the Liberal
party stand on the tariff questionwhether they are in favour of protection
or whether they are against it; whether
they are free traders or whether they are
protectionists.
This Government bas proved its mettie.
We have been at war for practically five

SENATE

years-at war four years, and the year
following was as bad as being at war.
What bas this Government done? Well, it
would take too long to give the history of
what the Government has done during that
period.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Do you mean its
crimes?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I will speak of that
in two words; from the first day of organizing regiments to send them overseas to
the last day of organizing the settlement
of soldiers on the land, and organizing the
re-establishment of our credit-in a word,
settling the whole heritage of the war-billions of dollars have been handled by this
Government.
During four or five years
time, more money bas been handled by this
Government, perhaps, than by all the Governments which have ruled in the Dominion
since Confederation. And yet how many
scandals have you discovered? How many
inquiries have been asked for? The doors
of every department have always been open;
inquiries were offered. Two or three or
four were held, and they all showed the
honesty of the Government. I was a witness, and heard the honourable leader of
the Liberal party contend in.the House of
Commons on the day before prorogation
that wc ought to be put out of office; and
he made a charge that will certainly be
used in the next general election, nanely,
that the Board of Commerce was the greatest scandal he had ever known. The Board
of Commerce, which had been created to
investigate the rise of prices and the profits made by those who were called profiteers. It was a terrible scandal. Can you
believe it, honourable gentlemen, the man
who thinks he is fit to take the responeibility which lies upon the shiulders of the
Prime Minister of the country did not
even dare to make this charge and ask
for an inquiry. He just said it was an
awful thing-that the greatest scandal
since Confederation had been committed
by the Government; but be had not the
courage to stand up and say, "We will
investigate."
When you investigate all
the acts of this Government, the conclusion
you have to come to is that the charges
preferred are false.
And these gentlemen do not pay to the
people of this country the compliment of
saying what they think of the tariff. They
just say to them: "Well, you know how
well we fooled you in the past; believe
us, we will fool you in the same way in
the future." That is the only guarantee
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN.

they can give; that is the mettle of which
they are made.

I never saw the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)

on the hustings, but lie has heard his chief,
as I have, talk about free trade as they have
it in England. What did they do when they
came to power-these men who so easily
call others traitors? What did they prove
to be during their long administration? If
it were not so late and if that story were
not so well known by every honourable
gentleman in this House, I would relate

the hundreds of scandals that have been
pioven. They are the people who are responsible for the railway policy of which
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
is so well qualified to speak, and which
the present Prime Minister spoke of as
"a night of intoxication, the result of which
we are feeling to-day." They ask to be
put into power, thinking that the people
of the Dominion and the people of my province do not know what the duty of the
hour is. Well and good. In the past the
Liberals may have well played the game
of being free traders in opposition but
protectionists in power; but serious people
do not believe in that to-day. The Liberal
party in the Dominion will be smashed as
a protectionist party.

Hon. LOUIS LAVERGNE:
Honourable
gentlemen, I must remind the Postmaster
General that in 1910 there was a by-election in my riding. One of the candidates
was a Mr. Gilbert, a pupil of the Postmaster General, and one was the Hon. Mr.
Perrault, who is now a Minister in Quebec.
Mr. Blondin came to Arthabaska at the
end of October or the beginning of November and made a speech.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I never spoke in
Arthabaska. That is the only place in
the county that I never went into.
Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: It was in the

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Anywhere else,
but not there.
Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: I have no brief
to defend the honourable gentleman from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), but
you made a speech. You have said that
the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier never was elected. Neither was the
leader of the Senate nor the Minister of
Labour, and many others; and you ran
twice in one election and were defeated,
that is your record.
I must congratulate the mover and the
seconder of the Address. They made nonpartisan speeches which were moderate and
to the point, and much better than the
speech made by the Postmaster General.
That, honourable gentlemen, is all I have

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH.
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the Address in reply to His
Excellency the Governor General's Speech
at the opening of the Session.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: In rising to continue this debate I wish to convey to you,
Mr. Speaker, my hearty congratulations on
the honour that has lately come to you in
being appointed a member of the Imperial
Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Canadian
Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That is a greater
honour still. I wish to say personally that
there is not a man in this House or in the
other House that I would rather see so
honoured. Ever since I have known you,
Mr. Speaker, although I may not altogether
agree with you politically, you have been
a good man, a man who bas had opinions
of his own and who has not been afraid
to stand by them or express them; and to
my mind that in a public man is something
very worth while. I hope you may be long
spared to wear the honour that bas fallen
upon your shoulders.

SENATE
I wish also to extend my congratulations
to the honourable gentleman from Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster) and the honourable gentleman from Pembroke (Hon.
G. V. White), on the speeches they delivered in moving and seconding the Address.
Those speeches were able and well delivered, and I am sure we all agree that this
House has received an addition, to its debating talent that is very welcome. Further, both the honourable gentlemen have
the great distinction of youth, something
that some of us are beginning to envy, and
I am sure every member of the House will
wish them a long and successful career in
this new sphere of duty to which they have
been called.
Now, honourable gentlemen, may I indulge in a personal word? You will remember that last Session I stated to the
House that when we got into our new
chamber I intended crossing over and sitting on the cross benches as a supporter of
the Progressives or Farmers' party. I
have done so, honourable gentlemen, for
two reasons. The war is over and we are
now dealing altogether with domestic matters; and, as I do not agree with the tariff
policy of the Government, I felt that the
only thing I could do was to take the position I have taken. I have a further reason, and it is this: that in the particular
part of Saskatchewan that I am supposed
to represent in this House the great majority of the people are supporters of the
Farmers' platform, and therefore I felt
the more justified in taking that position.
I would also say that, while three years
ago I differed with my old friends who
are sitting around me here on the conduct
of the war, I have no apologies to make to
anybody for the course I then took. Under
the same circumstances I would take the
same course again. But I must say this:
that my honourable friend the leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Bostock) and
many others sitting around him, although
they took an absolutely different view of
that question and acted in a different manner, were in my opinion just as honest and
just as anxious for the welfare of Canada
and for the winning of the war as I was,
and several of them have made sacrifices
as great as any man in this country has
made to carry on and win that war.
But, honourable gentlemen, the war is
over and now we have to deal, not with the
war itself, but with the aftermath of the
war. It is a heavy burden for Canada to
bear, but we must face it, and we must
meet it, and I think the time has come
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

when all those old differences and any hard
feelings or heart-burnings that may have
been caused by that question a few years
ago might well be dropped now, and we
might all get together as far as possible
and conduct the affairs of this country in
such a manner that we may meet and overcome the difficulties that are confronting
us, caused by the war, and may soon be
able to bring Canada back to a soinewhat
normal condition.
Now I come to the Speech from the
Throne. There are not a great many subjects mentioned in it.
It mentions in a
rather unusual manner the question of the
tariff. That question is brought up while
an inquiry is being made by a comnittee
and before the committee has reported. I
have no quarrel whatever with the Government on that account. My honourable
friend the Senator fron Stadacona (Hon.
L. C. Webster) delivered a very able
speech, and I congratulate hirn upon being
able to speak so well, not only in English,
but also in the French language. I feel
that if more of us could speak the French
language as he speaks it, it would be better
for the whole of the Dominion of Canada
and there would not be so many differences
of opinion between one part of the country
and another. That honourable gentleman
speaks with a good deal of authority, because, although he is a young man, he has
risen to a very high position in the commercial life of Canada. In that speech
he stated there was no reason why we
in Canada should not export many things
to tropical countries. Among other articles
he mentioned cotton. Well, all I have to
say to that is that if the manufacturers of
Canada can bring in raw cotton from the
Southern States, pay freight on it, manufacture it into cotton goods of various
kinds, and then export them to tropical
countries which are South of the United
States, then how does that line up with
what my honourable friend the leader of
the House (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
says, namely, that we cannot begin to stand
at all if American goods are allowed to
come into Canada? The two staternents do
not agree to the slightest extent.
My honourable friend from Stadacona
also states that Mr. Thomas B. Macaulay,
President of the Sun Life Assurance Company, has stated: "The more one looks into
the question of trade between Canada and
the West Indian colonies, the more one is
convinced that this trade ought to be developed to the benefit of all concerned."
That is all very well, but if Mr. Macaulay's
advice on that question is no better than

FEBRUARY 23, 1921
the advice he gave us about two years ago
in a circular which I received, to the effect
that the present tariff should be maintained
for Canada, and that a new tariff should be
imposed upon the people of Canada and of
all the other dominions of the Empire to
provide revenue to be expended in Downing
Street for Empire purposes, I can only say
that any man who would advocate a system
of that kind inspires me with very little
confidence in anything else he might advocate, because if there was ever anything
more preposterous suggested in the Dominion of Canada I have yet to hear of it.
It was to my mind the most absurd proposition that could possibly be made. I
would like to see any Government in
Canada, Liberal or Conservative or Farmers, go to the country with a policy in
favour of a special t'ariff levied on the
people of Canada for Empire purposes, the
revenue to be expended from Downing
Street. The thing is too absurd to consider
for one moment.•
My honourable friend the Senator from
Stadacona went on to say that if we are
to cut down the premium on American
exchange we must buy less in the United
States. That may be true. There is no
doubt that if we bought five hundred million
dollars worth less in the United States it
might eut down the rate of exchange
against us. But, after all, honourable
gentlemen, let us be fair and honest with
ourselves. What is the real cause of the
exchange being so much against us? It is
not so much in the buying and selling of
goods; it is because our country, as a result
of the exigencies of the war, bas not a gold
standard, such as we had some years ago.
There is the whole situation. Why was
Canadian money so valuable at the end of
the American civil war? Simply because of
the United States not having a gold standard. If we get our finances in such a state
that we can repeal the Act that was passed
a few years ago, and place our currency
under a gold standard system, and have
some eighty odd per cent of gold in our
vaults against the Dominion bills and the
Bank bills that are circulatedHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Paper.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
then we shall
have an even currency; but until we reach
that position we must expect that the exchange will be against us.
At the same time, honourable gentlemen,
I quite agree that we ought to buy less in
the United States, if it is possible. But

71

why do we buy so much from the United
States? It is not the Government that
buys, nor is it the Government that compels you and me to buy American goods.
Why, I ask again, do we buy hundreds of
millions of dollars' worth of manufactured
goods in the United States instead of buying them at home? There is a great deal
in the way in which we are able to answer
that question. I answer it in this way:
we buy those goods in the United States
because we cannot help ourselves. Our
Canadian manufacturers are not able
to supply those goods at a price at
which we can buy them;
so our
merchants and our individual consumers
buy American goods, because they can
buy them and pay the freight and the
duty and from ten to fifteen per cent
exchange and have them laid down in
Canada more cheaply than they can buy
them from our own manufacturers. That
is why we buy them in the United States:
there is no other reason. That does not
apply to the hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of goods that we buy in the
United States-the raw materials for our
manufacturers, anthracite coal, cotton,
and several other things, but applies to
the manufactured goods that we buy to
the extent of hundreds of millions of
dollars' worth from the United States;
and under the conditions existing in
Canada to-day there is not a bit of use in
my honourable friends opposite and that
reconstruction committee under Sir John
Willison preaching that gospel and sending
out editorials to the same effect to every
paper in Canada every week.
I want to deal for a moment or two with
a few of the points mentioned in the
Speech fron the Throne. One is the question of unemployinent. I will not dwell on
that, because I am not well enough informed on the question to deal with it at
any great length; but I will express my
personal opinion, and that is, that the
great bulk of the unemployment that exists
and has existed in Canada is due to the
fact that the labouring people of this
country during the past few years have
got the price of labour up to such a high
point that manufacturers are not able to
pay it any longer and continue in business,
and the labouring people have refused to
eut it down or to accept other work.
I
venture the assertion that there is scarcely
in all Canada a man who cannot find work
if he will go to where the work is. The
farmers want thousands of men and can
keep them employed at reasonable wages,

Government of certain taxes. I believe the
reference there was to the luxury tax.
While I am not very anxious that taxes on
luxuries should be remitted, still there is no
doubt in my mind that the way the tax
was being handled and the way it was being
collected made it a very unsatisfactory one.
My honourable friend who moved the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, the honourable member from
Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster), also
offered some advice to the Government with
regard to doing away with the business
tax. In that respect I agree absolutely with
the honourable Senator from Stadacona.
The Business Tax to my mind worked a
hardship in a great many cases. There
may have been cases in which it was all
right, and it may have been all right as a
war measure; but now that the war is
over, to my mind the Business Tax is a
very wrong way of raising the necessary
revenue.
My honourable friend from
Stadacona was very emphatic in pointing
out that any tax of that kind hampered
business, and was not good for the general
business of the country. I agree Nvith him
absolutely; but might not my honourable
friend go just a little further and say that
an unduly heavy duty on anything hampers
business just as much as a direct tax
hampers it? If that is the case, if it is
good policy to take off the Business Taxand I know it is good policy-and, as my
honourable friend said, when the money
is received by the individual it can be collected by way of Income Tax-and the
Government is gradually getting collections
of that tax into shape-I believe that is the
right method of collecting the money that
is required for the revenue outside of what
is derived from the tariff. If you want to
get money you go to the people who have
it; and my idea is that instead of taxing
business you should tax the man who got
the profits out of the business.
I know personally, honourable gentlemen, of certain cases in which a company
or a firm has a good year of business, say
in 1918, and made 10 per cent, 12 per cent,
or 15 per cent-and in my judgment 10
or 15 per cent is not a bit too much for a
business to make with all the chances and
risks it has to meet. A business like that
could make $15,000 or $20,000, and was not
called npon to pay a tax at the moment,
and, in some cases that I know of, by the
time they were called upon to pay the tax
of 1918 they had lost in their business all
the profits they had made in 1918. But

79

even take those who have not lost their net
profits. Owing to the exigencies of business they have often to increase their building capacity; owing to the high cost of
goods they have to have double the investment in stock, and there are many things
coming up; so that when a firm that may
have made the first $15,000 or $20,000 has
to pay a business tax it may have to go
to a bank to get the money. The money is
not in the business. It is out in all sorts
of betterments or in credits throughout the
country, and the business that has been
helping people throughout the country by
way of credit is called upon to pay a tax
when it bas not a dollar of its profits in.
I hope that tax will be removed, and that,
if necessary, the Income Tax will be increased to make up the deficit, because
under the Income Tax the man who bas
the money is taxed, which, to my mind, is
the prdper way to deal'with taxation.
I cannot hope that my views will meet
with favour in all quarters. I am afraid
from the remarks I hear, that some of my
friends sitting around me have a good income and have not any business. But I
think that is the proper method of taxation,
and under it my honourable friends would
have to take their medicine like everybody
else.
Speaking as a representative of the Progressive party, known as the Farmers'
party, I want to say that I am rather disappointed at the attitude of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on
taking office-upon which I congratulate
him, and in connection with which I want
to say that, with his ability and energy
and with youth in his favour, he is a'man
who should go far in Canada, a man for
whom I have not only the greatest respect,
but the kindliest feeling, as I also have
for my honourable friend the leader of this
House. I should like to take this opportunity of saying, that I appreciate the kindness and consideration that were always
extended to me by the honourable gentlemen opposite during the years in which I
sat on that side of the House; and I wish
also to express appreciation to my honourable friends on this side of the House who
always treated me with great kindness and
consideration although they may have felt
sore on some points. My honourable friend
the Prime Minister started out very
severely on the Farmers' party, criticising
them terribly and calling all those in sympathy with them Bolshevists and other
hard names. One of the honourable gentleman's colleagues, who spoke in Peter-

party was a menace to the Government.
Well, I do not object to that at all. That
may be quite true; and it might be a good
thing for the country. But he went on to
say that the Farmers' party was a menace
to the Dominion of Canada. I say that
the man who makes statements of that
kind does not know what he is talking
about. I would ask any honourable gentleman in this House to point to a single case
where the men who live on the land, who
work and make a living for themselves
and their families out of the soil, have
ever been a menace to any country. Where
do our cities recruit from? From the boys
on the farm. I venture to say that if you
went to the chief politicians, statesmen,
bankers, manufactúrers, and merchants,
and asked the head men where they spent
the first twenty years of their lives, the
great majority of them would answer, "On
the farm in such-and-such a part of Canada." They are not the men who are or
The

farmers of Canada to-day are the most
conservative people in the Dominion of
Canada. Why would they not be conservative? They have the biggest stake of any
class of men in the Dominion of Canada.
Any one who would like to see a change of
Government brought about, who would like
to see this Government put out and a
Farmers' Government brought in, need not
complain of the statements or actions of
the right honourable the Prime Minister
or the honourable the Minister of Militia.
Such statements as those made by those
two gentlemen never make a vote for them;
on the contrary, they do more to make
votes against them than almost any other
course they could take. I am glad to say
that my right honourable friend the Prime
Minister has toned down marvellously since
then. He is young, and quicker to learn a
lesson than we old fellows; and, if you
will notice, he now speaks with a great
deal more consideration and respect for the
Farmers' party.
Now, I want to deal for a short time
with the tariff. My honourable friend the
leader of the House went into that questior
very fully and very strongly, and he waxed
very wroth that any one should have the
temerity to suggest that the tariff might
be lowered or should not be increased.
Among other things he said that we are
likely to find the Fordney Bill in force in
the United States. Personally, honourable
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

gentlemen, I do not think that the Fordney
Bill is likely to go into force-it may; I
don't know; but I think it more likely, if
it passes Congress during the next few
days, that President Wilson will veto it,
and I do not think there will be enough
votes to carry it over his veto; and by the
time the Harding Administration will be
in the saddle, I think the better sense of the
people of the United States will begin to
assert itself.
The United States is a great manufacturing nation.
What are the people of
that country- up against now? They are
up against the high cost of living and high
labour. How could they hope to bring down
the cost of living if they put an almost
impassable barrier to food products going
from Canada into the United States? But
for the purposes of argument let us suppose
that the Fordney Bill comes into force, and
then let us see where we are. I want to
say, honourable gentlemen, that, practically,
the Fordney Bill was in force in the United
States prior to 1911. At that time we had
the McKinley tariff, under which for every
bushel of wheat sent to the United States
25 cents was paid in duty; for every bushel
of flax 30 cents was paid; for every bushel
of oats 12 cents; and as to barley, I am not
sure from memory, but I think it was 15
cents.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Twenty cents.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Twenty cents on
every bushel of barley. We paid through
the nose on every head of cattle, every
sheep or lamb, and every hog that went
into the United States. My honourable
friend the leader of the House is mistaken
when he says a Bill of that kind will keep
those goods out altogether.
Under those
conditions we sent many millions of dollars
worth of them into the United StatesWhy? Because the people of the United
States wanted food, and had the money
to pay for it, and they paid the farmers'
price, and the duties besides, to get that
food. Do you know, honourable gentlemen, that in the United States they cannot make the satisfactory grade of flour
which they want without the hard wheat
of the prairie provinces-with the exception of some that they have in Minnesota
and North Dakota-which they mix in the
proportion of 1 bushel to 4 of their soft
wheat.
We do not want the Fordney Bill. Our
farmers in the West, and I have no doubt

not speaking for Ontario, as I do not

materially when those duties were taken
off.
But if we have the Fordney Bill
put into effect now, whose fault is it? If
that legislation is put into force, I say who
is to blame for it? I want to say that the
people who are to blame are my honourable friends opposite, together with the

had been carried into force in 1911 the

twenty million to whom to sell our goods.
Think of what it would have meant to the
manufacturers for the great farming community of Canada to have been put in a
position to make mare money and to have
more money to expend in buying manufactured goods. Honourable gentlemen, if J
had the full say I would not close a single
factory in Canada by legislation. No one
can make ee believe that that would result
from the opening up of the American
market, or that the manufacturer on our
side of the line is not as good a man as
the manufacturer on the other side. My
honourable friend frem Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Crosby) yesterday stated very forcibly that
we could hold our own with the United
States and have held our own. If that is
the case, why can we net hold our own in
manufacturing if we have the whole of the
American continent to supply with our
manufactured goods?
The honourable leader of the House
stated the other day that the Democratic
party had during their terni of office maintained a tariff barrier higher than we have
ever maintained in Canada. 1-lonourable
gentlemen, that is not in accordance with
the fact. The fact is that the United
States tariff to-day is practically a freetrade tariff except on luxuries. That may
seem strange, but the United States tarif!
is low as campared with our tariff. We
pay in duties, per capita, the sum of over
nineteen dollars per annum. What do the
United States pay? It takes over eleven
persons in the United States to pay to their
Government as much duty as one person
pays in Canada. In the face of that, my
honourable friend the leader of the House
makes the statement that the United States
tariff is higher than ours. That is net the
case: my honourable friend is wrong. I

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I thought I had the exact figures with
me, but they are apparently upstairs in my
desk. But how does my honourable friend
answer the fact that in the year 1918, the
last year for which we have the figures, the
United States collected in duties something
under $200,000,000? I have not committed
the exact figures to memory. But I remember the Canadian figures, and they were

tively are very much less than the importations of Canada; consequently the duty
falls less heavily upon their people per
capita than does the duty upon the people
of Canada, because they have built up
home industries, whereas we do not do likewise.

That does not

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, no.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: No argument can

fact stands out quite plainly.

the honourable gentleman still of the same
opinion as he was in 1904 when he was a
member of the House of Commons and

FEBRUARY 23, 1921
when the Laurier Government was giving
large bounties for the production of pig
iron? Does he still favour that as a system of protection, and would he be agreeable to it being taken up again to-day?
The system of
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
bounties for the production of iron or steel
is not a bad way of assisting an enterprise
to get on its feet. My honourable friend
smiles, but let him wait a minute. In
my judgment it is a great deal better than
a high protecte tariff, -because then we
know what we are paying. My honourable
friend has mentioned the paying of bounties on iron and steel. The right honourable Prime Minister says that the policy
of the Government is that all our manufacturers in Canada must be protected, in
order that they may be enabled to hold
the business that they have at present and
to increase their business in the future.
Now, since my honourable friend reminds
me of this matter of steel production, let
us look into it for a moment. When the
Dominion Iron and Steel Company was

formed we paid $11,000,000 or $12,000,000
to that Company in boùnties and in addition gave them a high protective tariff
that enabled them to take tens of millions
of dollars more out of the pockets of the
people of Canada. Did that put them on
their feet? Did that set them up so that
they could legitimately do business and
compete? It is a well-known fact that just
before the war the Dominion Iron and
Steel Company was on its last legs. It
had not for years paid any dividend on
stock. Then the war
the preferred
came, and the company began to experiment with steel and soon succeeded in making *a steel that it was
able to use in the manufacture of
shells for war purposes; and I give it
credit for that. It obtained contracts from
the Dominion Government and from the
Imperial Munitions Board, which enabled
it to make tens of millions of dollars of
profit, so that $20,000,000 of common stock
that never brought one cent into the
treasury, had during the last few years a
market value of about sixty-five dollars a
share, or another $13,000,000. And what
is the condition of that company to-day?
I see in the press every little while the
statement that unless the Dominion Iron
and Steel Company,can get orders from
the Government it will have to shut down.
So you see that the giving of bounties or
the imposition of high duties does not always put a business on its feet, although
S-6à

83

it may give it a mushroom growth. The
business may practically depend for its
existence .upon being pap-fed.
We have had other experiences of that
kind.
The Government during the last
few years started in a shipbuilding industry. Before the war was ended there was
some reason for that; the German submarines were sinking the ships of the mercantile marine very fast, and Britain was
straining every effort to build ships and
wanted ships to be built. I make no complaint, honourable gentlemen, regarding
the Government undertaking the building
of warships before the war ended; but
what can be said of continuing after the
close of the war the policy of giving contracts for ships to be built at double the
price at which they could be built at other
places? Let me read to you a despatch
which appeared in the Ottawa Citizen of
January 7 last, about a month and a half
ago:
Vaucouver, Jan. 6.-The keels of two new
government steamers, the Canadian
Transporter and the Canadian Trader, were laid
at the Coughlan
shipyards
here
to-day.
Seven hundred men are engaged' in the yards.

Over two years after the war was over,
when the shipping of the world had been
increased to a far greater tonnage than
it was prior to the war, and when ships
were being built in England at so much a
ton dead weight, half the price at which
the contract is let to build these ships!
What can you say for a policy of that
kind?
Here is another despatch appearing in
the same newspaper of the same date:
Dutch Ships Laid Up
Rotterdam,
Jan.
6.Forty-nine ocean
steamers, mostly Dutch, are laid up at the
present time at Rotterdam because of lack
of cargoes, andi the low freight
rates,
according to Burgomaster
Zimmermann.
He
also announces that while more ships entered
Rotterdam iast year than
previously
the
actual tonnage was only 38 per cent of that
of 1918.

My honourable friend the Prime Minister says that we must have a tariff for
revenue purposes. That may be quite a
fair argument to make.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before my
honourable friend leaves the subject of
ships will he be good enough to inform the
House whether or not any of the Canadian
Merchant Marine are laid up and not employed?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: In answer to my
honourable friend the Miflister of Labour,
I may say that I have not heard that any

SENATE
of the Canadian merchant ships are held
up, but I understand that they are running with one-quarter or one-half cargo,
and that they are losing money by the
hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year, and that the wages for stevedoring
in Montreal were unpaid three months
after the work was done.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend is misinformed as to the facts. The
ships that have been completed and are in
use in the service of the Canadian Merchant Marine are all profitably enployed,
and cargoes are offering for a considerable
period in advance of the completion of
the ships now under construction at Vancouver. With reference to the matter of
the stevedores at Montreal, I cannot inform the honourable gentleman, because I
do not know.
Hon. Mr. BOYER:
As far as thar
stevedoring matter is concerned, I was
questioned some time ago by a firm of
stevedores in Montreal who had loaded
a couple of Government ships last October
as to why their bill was not paid, and was
asked if I could help them. I told them I
had nothing to do wvith the matter. It was
learned on inquiry that the bills owing to
theni were duly sent to the office in Montreal; that they were transferred from
the Montreal office to Ottawa, from Ottawa
to Toronto, and from Toronto back to Montreal, and were then placed at the bottom
of the shelf and left there. They are still
unpaid.
Now, as far as profitable freights are
concernedSone Hon. SENATORS:

Order.

Hon. Mr. BOYER: One of the steamers
of the Donaldson Line, now amalgamated
with the Cunard Steamship Line, left
Glasgow last month without a pound of
freight.
Stevedores,
lightermen,
etc.,
were ordered to Portland to help to
unload
and
load
the
vessel.
They
reached Portland and the ship got in
all right.
She had not a pound of
freight.
She went to the coal dock and
took in 700 or 800 tons of coal, waited for
ber day of sailing, and went out without
another pound of freight. Now, if an old
company like the Donaldson Line, having
ramifications all over the United States,
and, you might say, all over Europe, can
send ships out to America without a pound
of freight expecting a return cargo, how
does this Government manage to get a
cargo?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend the Minister of Labour should be
in a better position to know the facts of
this case than I am; but I do not know
that he is in any better position to state the
facts than the directors of the Government
Steamship Company. I am going to give
you what they had to say on that question, and it differs from what my honourable
friend has said. I am referring now to
the Ottawa Citizen of January 13, a little
over a month ago. This is in answer to
some remarks that had #een made by
another paper in Ottawa. An excerpt from
that paper, I presume it is the Journal, is
given, which is exactly along the line of
what the Minister of Labour Las said. Here
is what the Citizen says:

As I said a moment ago, I had no objection whatever to the Government of Canada building ships during the war, before
we knew how soon it was going to end.
But imagine continuing that policy for
over two years after the war has been
completed, and building ships at twice the
cost. I venture to say that when the reports
for last year and for this coming year
corne out, many of the Government ships
will be found to be losing more money running than they would be if they were tied
up to the wharves. No one can make me
believe that the Canadian ships can be run
very much cheaper than the British ships.
The British are too old in the game; they
would never have occupied the position
which they occupy to-day in the carrying
trade of the world if Canadians could build
ships at twice the cost, and run them
cheaper than the British Government is
running British ships. It cannot be done.

FEBRUARY 23, 1921

course is for the Government to eut off
some $50,000,000 of the expenditures that
are taking place in Canada-and I venture
to say that could be done without the public
interest suffering in the slightest degree.
Some private pets to whom these contracts
have been given might suffer, but the public
of Canada would not suffer in the slightest
degree.
There are other sources of expenditure
that, in my judgment, might be cut off to
very good advantage. Take, for instance,
the lending of $25,000,000 to Rumania at
a time when the Government knew that
Rumania was absolutely bankrupt. They
gave that $25,000,000-why? To enable certain manufacturers in Canada to contract
for large quantities of supplies for Rumania.
The Government put up the money and the
manufacturer gets his big price and makes
big profits, and when it comes to getting
the money back we cannot even get the
interest on it. The same remark applies
to Greece. The Government was in exactly
the same position as a merchant doing a
credit business. A man comes in -and says:
" I want to buy $1,000 worth of goods, but
I haven't got any money. My farm has two
or three mortgages on it; I have private
debts; and, besides, everything I have
chattel-mortgaged; but will you sell the
goods to me on credit?" What would you

You may talk about it as much as you like,
but it cannot be done. I say it was a most

Are we going to continue every enterprise in Canada, no matter what it cost?
Let us take the building of ships by the

They built some ships for the Government,

but at cost plus. What do you think they

times lately that the Canadian Vickers
Company will have to shut down unless
the Government comes to their rescue with
more orders.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: I must take
exception to the statement of my honourable friend with regard to the nature of the
contract with -the Vickers Company. I
happen to know that those ships were built
on a contract price per ton basis, and that
that price was lower than th'e price in some

the reclassification of the Civil Service by
Young and Company.
To-day the Civil
Service is fairly seething with indignation
and rebellion. As one man told me: "There
is no danger of strikes; we won't strike;
but you cannot get the work done; the
officials are so dissatisfied that they won't
work;" and they are dissatisfied in spite
of the fact that Young and Company's
classification increased the cost of the Civil
Service by about $5,000,000, and that there
is to-day a Board of Hearing which has
been sitting for months and raising the
salaries of those that Young and Company
missed. In many cases they put up the
salaries of men in the lower grades beyond
those of men who were bigher in the Service.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
May I draw
attention to the fact that neither Arthur
Young and Company nor Griffenhagen and
Associates had anything whatever to do
with the preparation or determination of
the Civil Service reclassification. That was
done by the Civil Service Commission, and
my honourable friend is in error when he
asserts that either of these companies had
anything to do with any increase in the
cost of the Civil Service salaries by reason
of the reclassification, because that was
not their function.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
Technically, my
honourable friend may be right; but it
seems to me that Young and Company
gave hundreds of men their classification
and put up their salaries. I know men who
have got increases; there are a couple of
men in the service of the House of Commons who got over $1,000 more than they
were getting before.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
My honourable friend must remember that Arthur
Young and Company and Griffenhagen and
Associates had nothing whatever to do with
that.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I have not mentioned Griffenhagen and Associates yet; I
was talking about Young and Company.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I may inform
my honourable friend that they had nothing

became a little ashamed, I suppose, of taking so much, and had their rights transferred to the Griffenhagen outfit.
Is it
any wonder that in some parts of Canada
the Senate is not looked upon with a very
great degree of respect? What can you
expect the public to think of the Senate
when the Government pays no more attention to it than the wind that blows?
Last Session I had the honour of moving
that Canadians be employed instead of
Griffenhagen and Associates, and the motion was carried in this House by a majority of ten. But my honourable friends
the Minister of Labour and the leader oF
this House just went right ahead and
dealt with Griffenhagen as if the Senate had not expressed any opinion upon
the matter. Is it any wonder, I say, that
throughout Canada people talk of doing
away with the Senate? If the Government
bas no confidence in the Senate, if the Minister of Labour has no confidence in the
Senate, what can be expected from the.
people of the Dominion of Canada?
In spite of that resolution and the majority on it against the Government in this
House, they engaged Griffenhagen and
Associates at $10,000 a month, and for not
less than a year. There were eleven of
them: three or four principals, the balance
being clerks-so they got an average of
almost $1,000 a month.
No doubt the
chiefs will get two or three thousand
dollars a montb, and in addition to that,
honourable gentlemen, they get travelling
expenses and living expenses when they are
outside the city of Ottawa; and they have
a regular staff of ordinary Civil Servants
who know something about the matter telling them what to do. I am informed on

costing $10,000 a month, will cost, taking
into consideration the other expenses for
stationery and office room and so on, about
$25,000 a month. That is going on, and
we have to put up the tariff to get money
for the Government to indulge in measures
of that sort.
Mind you, the Civil Service Commission
was not allowed to deal with this matter;
it was taken from them-and the only
thing J blame the Civil Service Commission
for is that they did not resign on the spot
when they were set aside and the work
taken out of their hands. And who did
this? It was a Committee of the Council,
consisting of my right honourable friend
the Minister of Trade and Commerce, the
Minister of Immigration, the then President of the Privy Council, the Hon. Mr.

look after and run the Griffenhagén outfit,
but what did they do? The Minister of
Trade and Commerce went across to the
old country to Geneva; the President of
the Privy Council also went over there;
the Minister of Immigration went to England, and when he came back he took a
trip out West, ostensibly to go with the
Tariff Commission, but really to conduct a
campaign throughout the West. Mr. Burrell resigned; Mr. Rowell resigned also;
and the Minister of Labour, who was left,
had to go through the country, and the
whole matter was left under the direction
of a clerk taken from the Civil Service
Commission.
And what is the Civil Service Commission costing us? I am- informed, honourable gentlemen, that during the coming
year we shall have to provide about $500,000 for the Civil Service Commission. As
I said a moment ago, I had been in favour
of taking the matter of Civil Service appointments out of politics; but I want to
say now that when I find I am wrong I am
willing to acknowledge it. I find that I

a man who was not fit for a position,
there are now ten getting into the Service.
A vote of Civil Servants was taken a few
months.ago, an-d a majority of 1,500 voted
to join the labour unions. Imagine! the
Civil Servants of Canada! I have often
said that I believed that the Service would
be far better if it were put back again as
it was before, and if a great deal of the
expenditures that we are now ineurring
were done away with. At the present time
the head of a department has practically
no say in his own department and has lost
interest in the department, and matters
are going from bad to worse. The sooner
the Government takes hold of this question
and restores the former condition the
better it will be in my opinion for Canada.
I know that When the new Board was appointed it was given carte blanche, and
it was supposed to be a business organization; but there was not a less able or less
satisfactory branch in the whole Civil Service, although it was supposed that the
best men available had been selected.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: When the honourable gentleman refers to the head of a
department does he mean the Minister or
the Deputy Minister?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Deputy.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That is what
I understood.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: From my -own
experience of the Civil Service, I do not
expect that any minister can have much
to do with the running of the Department,
that is, as regards promotions or matters
of that kind. The Minister must depend
upon and accept the word of the Deputy,
who knows all about the matter. The Minister has enough work to do in settling the
policy of the Department and attending
to other important matters. The Deputy
is the man who should have control of the
department.
My honourable friend the leader of the
House (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) says
that the tariff of the United States is higher
than ours. I venture to say, honourable
gentlemen, that the Farmers of Canada and
the Liberals of Canada, whose policies are
much alike, would welcome the American
tariff in this country, because on the necessaries of life it is practically a free-trade
tariff; the duties are largely on the luxuries. I want to read just a few items
from the two tariffs. I have taken these
as correctly as I can. There may possibly
be one or two mistakes in the Canadian
duties, because there have been so many
amendments to the Act that it was a little
difficult for an ordinary member who has
not paid a great deal of attention to the
different items to get it exactly. I do not
say that every item is absolutely right,
but they are all as nearly right as I can
possibly make them.

and the Liberal party misrepresented? The
Prime Minister and other ministers of the
Government and honourable members opposite go into the cities and say: "The
Farmers are going to give you absolute
free trade, no protection at all; and the
Liberals are going to do the same." Then
they go out into the country and they tell
the country audience: "The Liberals are
not going to lower the tariff; they are
going to maintain it exactly as it was
before." There is always a good deal of
jockeying for position. When a party is in
opposition, it may say a good many things
it is not prepared to carry out when in
power. But the Government is in a
position not a whit different from that of
the Liberals. The Farmers have never
been in power in the Dominion. The present
Government did not carry out its promises
any better than did the old Liberal Government when it came in. Both parties are in
the same position. The members of the
Government side-step and misrepresent
their opponents just as much as did the
Liberals and more than the Farmers.
My honourable friend the Prime Minister
says the country is not clamouring for an
election. You know, members of this
House are apt to get a little out of touch
with the people. I have been here only a
couple of years and I have noticed that a
little myself. So there is a good deal of
excuse for the honourable leader of this
House (Hon. Sir James Loughëed), who
has been here so long. In his speech he
stated that we must have high protection
and nothing else is thinkable. Let me say
to my honourable friend that if either he or
I went to our respective provinces and
made such a speech on the tariff as he
made, and if we had to depend upon the
votes of the settlers for election, there
would be only one or two places in either
province where we would have one chance
in a hundred of ever again warming a seat
in this House. My honourable 'friend is
not keeping his ear close to the ground.
That is natural, I suppose.
If he had
kept his ear close to the ground, he
would have heard that there had been
an election in East Elgin. What did
we notice there? That although the
vote
against
the
Government
was
divided into two parts by the Liberal and
the Farmers candidates, with policies very
much alike, still the Farmers came out
away ahead. That indicates to me that the
farmers of Ontario are going to stand by
their party. Honourable gentlemen opposite

89

may congratulate themselves that the
Farmers are trying to offset a breaking
up. But do not make any mistake. You will
learn before very long whether they are
breaking up or not. That election indicated
another thing. In the town of Aylmer, the
largest town in the constituency, in spite
of the Farmers' vote, the Liberal candidate,
who opposed the tariff platform and program as annouriced by the Prime Minister,
received more votes than did the Government candidate. So my honourable friend
ought to keep his ear more closely to the
ground.
We heard also of an election in Peterborough the other day. What was the
result? Somewhat similar. The Farmers'
candidate, although defeated, received more
votes in all the country polls than the other
four candidates together. That shows that
the Farmers are working in unison. And
again in the town the Liberal candidate
received more votes than the Conservative
candidate. I am not worrying about whether there is to be an election soon or not.
The honourable leader said that the
Government will eventually go to the
country. It will go to the country soon. He
says there is no clamour for an election.
There is no clamour on the side of a
Government that had three years ago a
majority of over 70 and whose majority is
now down to about 25. He will not have to
wait very long, at the same ratio of loss,
until the Government will have to go to
the country. But whether they go immediately or not, I claim that the Farmers
will stand pretty well together; that they
will stand on a platform good for the
country; that there will be in it no menace
to the country or no danger in any respect.
Can any honourable gentleman here point
to a single instance in which Premier
Drury of Ontario bas pasied class legislation? I never met Mr. Drury until the
other night when he delivered an address
here at the Board of Trade annual banquet;
and I want to say this, that, with all my
respect for the eloquence of the right
honourable leader of the Government, and
all my respect for the eloquence of the
honourable leader of the Opposition, it
would in my judgment have puzzled either
of those honourable gentlemen to make a
finer or abler speech, or one with less
partyism in it, or one on a higher level,
than the speech that was made by Hon.
Mr. Drury here within the last two weeks.
There would be no danger to the country
if the Farmers should have a say in the
next Government. There would be no class

SENATE
legislation. Nothing would be done for the
Farmers exclusively; all would be done
for the good of Canada, just as I know the
present Government do what they think is
for the general good, and the Opposition,
if they were in power, would do what they
considered to be for the general advantage
of the country.
There are a good many things that I
should have liked to touch upon, but I have
spoken so long that I must not trespass
further on your time. I just want to say,
in conclusion, honourable gentlemen, that
in Canada we have a country of great
resources and with a class of people that
are not dependent on any one man or any
one group of men, and I believe Canada will
prosper, and prosper exceedingly, even
if my honourable friends on the other
side are returned to power at the next
general election.
There is no question
about that.
But, in my judgment the
country would prosper a little better if
the leader of the Opposition came into
power.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: But I want to say
further that it would prosper best of all
if the Progressive party, the Farmers'
party, came into power and directed the
next Government of Canada.
Hon. RUFUS POPE: Honourable gentlemen, I think nearly every one who bas preceded me bas turned out to be the leader of
some particular branch of political thought;
therefore it bas been quite in keeping for
men to congratulate the mover and the
seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. However, perhaps a man who is not a leader of any
particular party or organization may be
permitted to offer his congratulations to
the two gentlemen upon the excellent manner in which they performed their duty.
I now have to express my congratulations
and at the same time my sympathy-my
congratulations to the honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House who
call themselves a party, upon having completed their organization on the floor of this
House as they have in another place; in
having the two elements that they have
with a double-headed leadership.
My
sympathy goes out to the honourable gentieman who bas led the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Bostock) with such dignity in this
House for so many years. He is always
a gentleman and always courteous.
My
sympathy goes out to him because, after
all these years of labour, the hour bas
Hon.

Mr.

TURRIFF.

arrived when the honourable gentleman who
bas just taken his seat proves to be the
usurper of that leadership which we all
thought would fall to the honourable member from British Columbia. But let me
tell the honourable gentleman from British
Columbia to cheer up; there is much wind
from the prairie, and when it blows it
blows hard and long and principally in
the southern portion of the province of
Saskatchewan; and all that bas been said
may not be true, and when the winning
hour comes there still may be a lingering
possibility that the honourable gentleman
himself may occupy the seat of honour upon
this side of the House which the courtesy
and custom of this House would entitle
him to.
I cannot go into all the details necessary
to reply to the double-headed leadership,
to the two separate and distinct parties
within one, and the long story of one, and
the longer story of the other. It imposes
a tremendous task upon any honourable
gentleman upon this side of the House who
feels it incumbent upon him in the slightest degree to do honour to two different
and peculiar and distinct parties on the
other side of the House. I heard the other
night, and every honourable gentleman bas
read, the description given of a certain
honourable member on the other side by
another honourable gentleman-that when
be was down in Gaspé he was a free trader
that when he was in Montreal he was a
protectionist; that he represented in the
human family the place taken by the bat
in the animal kingdom-a bird when he
was in the air and a mouse when he was
on the ground.
I am not an economist, and do not pretend to be one; but, after listening to the
leader of the Progressive party in this
House, I am unable to say who chose him.
But self-nomination goes a long way. He
may have a mandate from the Progressive
party-I do not know-but to-day he bas
declared himself to be their representative
bere, and he informs us that the more
we owe the better our credit will be. Well,
honourable gentlemen, I have tried that
with my banker over and over again, and
I will be damned if I could ever make it
work. I have been under the impression
that because we
bought
more
from
the United States than we sold them
our money was discounted; but to-day
I am told it
is because we have
not got that mythical thing, gold, in the
treasury. Why, honourable gentlemen, the
rate of exchange is regulated by Irad,

FEBRUARY 23, 1921
and nothing else but trade, and when the
time comes when Canada is selling to the
United States more than we buy from
her, our money will be worth 100 cents on
the dollar, gold or no gold. When the
honourable gentleman makes the proposition that if the tariff were lowered it would
increase our trade with the United States
rather than decrease it, all I have to say
to him is that while the dollar to4lay is
worth 90 cents, if that were done it would
be worth only 80 cents. Whether the basis of
the currency be gold or silver, the value
of the dollar is the result of trade and
trade alone.
The honourable gentleman bas also told
us that the United States pay less duty
per capita than the people of this country.
That is very easy to account for; they
import less because they have a higher
tariff. If we in Canada want to have less
taxation per capita, then let us raise our
tariff and make more goods in Canada,
and import less from abroad. That will
accomplish two things: it will enable you
to lower the percentage of taxation, and
it will enable you to give employment to
your own people and in that way balance
your credit with foreign countries so that
your dollar will be worth 100 cents.
The honourable gentleman says the Canadian manufacturer is no good. I am not
a manufacturer; I am a farmer. Unlike
the honourable gentleman, I am not a
leader of a Progressive party. I am a
natural and positive and absolute farmer,
and have been all my life; but when the
honourable gentleman says that the manufacturers of Canada are no good, he is
reflecting upon a body of men who during
the war did as much credit to Canada as
any body of men could do to any country.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: May I interrupt
the honourable gentleman?
Hon. Mr. POPE: No, I am speaking
now. You talked two hours. I want to
tell the honourable gentleman that if it
had not been for the National Policy which
was inaugurated by Sir John A. MacdonaldHon. Mr. TURRIFF: Mr. Speaker, I
request the privilege of interrupting. The
honourable gentleman is putting words
into my mouth that I never used.
Hon. Mr. POPE:
you say.

That is what I heard

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The honourable
gentleman bas said that I said the manufacturers were no good. I said no such

thing. I said the manufacturers could not
supply the goods we wanted as cheaply as
we could get them in the United States.
Hon. Mr. POPE: And of as good quality. That is the old-fashioned Grit doctrine, assumed by the Progressive party
of to-day. Let me say; honourable gentlemen, that under the National Policy of Sir
John A. Macdonald, which was wisely left
alone by Sir Wilfrid Laurier during his
fifteen years of administration, the manufacturing industries of this country played
an important part. They manufactured
better and cheaper inunitions for the war
than any other nation in the world. They
had no competitors; they got to work more
quickly than those of any other nation in
the world. The United States was studying
while the manufacturers of Canada were
shipping munitions manufactured fron
steel produced by industries that were encouraged by the bounties given by the late
Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Administration, and
from the lead industry of British Columbia,
which was encouraged by the policy of
the same eminent gentleman. But round
those shells was a little band of copper.
We have no National Policy on the manufacture and drawing of copper, and we
had to go to the United States to buy
that to put around the shells, the products
of National Policy. Therefore I have
always looked upon those shells as one of
the strongest arguments in favour of the
wisdom and force of protection.
The honourable gentleman speaks of the
investors of capital in the industries of
Canada as men who have gathered together tremendous fortunes by means of
exorbitqpt prices-profiteers, I believe, is
the word that has been freely used for the
last few years. I would say to the leader
of the Progressive party in this House
that if the manufacturers of Canada had
been permitted to make one-fiftieth of the
profit that the Co-operative Grain Growers
of the West made, they would to-day be
worth millions where they are worth only
hundreds of thousands. If there has been
any institution that bas robbed the people
of the western country it has been the
Co-operative organization of the Grain
Growers of Western Canada, and if the
Government does not appoint a Commission to investigàte the matter I say they
are failing in their duty. 100 per cent?
200 per cent? 400 per cent? 500 per cent?
Nothing doing. That was not enough for
those gentlemen who begrudge the industries of this country an ordinary 15 or 20
per cent for their industry.

SENATE
Speaking of protection as it applies to
the farmer, I admit that the western
farmer is in one position and the eastern
farmer in another.
This farmers' movement certainly has a legitimate function
provided it is not for class purposes.
From the time of Confederation, 1867,
until the present moment, I have never
known a Cabinet of Canada, whether
.Liberal or Conservative, to have among
its members more than one farmer; and I
have known of many which had not that
one. During all that time the rural population of Canada was possibly 40 per cent
of the whole; and if the farmer had been
recognized by the several Governments in
proportion to his percentage of the population, and if his knowledge had been
benefited by and his advice taken, possibly
this apparently sudden uprising of the
farmers of Canada would not have been.
On the other hand, honourable gentlemen,
the farmer of Canada stood in his own
way, and in his own light. Over and over
again, he had the opportunity to select a
man of his own calling in many a constituency to represent him, but the lawyer or
the doctor or the merchant or some other
gentleman came in his stead supported by
the farmers' vote. So, if he has not had
the representation in the past that he
should have had, it is his own fault because he did not utilize his voting power.
While all that is true, honourable gentlemen, it does not give any set of farmers,
be they eastern or western men, the privilege of class representation. The honourable gentleman who has just taken his
seat bas gone a long way in an effort to
persuade this House that no harm is meant
-that
no legislation will be introduced
that will injure the industrial or investing
interests of the country. I presume that
is what the honourable gentleman wishes
us to understand. But I say, honourable
gentlemen, that no material reduction can
be made in the tariff of 22 or 23 per cent
that we have to-day without injuring some
of the industries and investors of the Dominion of Canada. The farmer of Eastern
Canada enjoys protection; the farmer of
the West enjoys protection, although the
honourable gentleman does not know it.
Take the eastern part of Canada; take
the eastern part of the United States, and
take the Eastern Townships from which I
come.
Without protection would the
value of the farms in Eastern Canada
compare as they do with the value of the
farms in the Eastern States? For while
you can buy a farn in the Eastern United
Hon. Mr. POPE.

States for from $1,800 to $2,000, you cannot buy one in Compton of the same size
and as well situated for less than $8,000
or $10,000. Why is that?
That is because the United States is a country of
110,000,000 or 120,000,000 people.
The
United States is a country in which the
meat production is all in the hands of halfa-dozen large concerns, and they have
driven 'the producer of the eastern farm
away from his home; they have sold beef
and -pork and the products thereof in all
the cities and towns of the Eastern States
at a lower price than those products can
be produced in Maine, Vermont, or New
Hampshire. They have ruined the retail
trader and butcher. At one time the fat
-the butter and the cheese-for Newfoundland was furnished by Eastern Canada.
What happened?
Chicago, 1,000 milet
farther west than we are, drove us froir
the Newfoundland market; and I say that
if Chicago and those great interests can
drive those Canadian products out of Newfoundland, they can drive them out of the
Eastern Townships, if you lower the
tariff that protects the farmers of Quebec.
The honourable gentleman speaks of the
farmers of the West. In our country they
are described as the miners of the Westthey have to mine the soil, not to farm it.
Many of the farmers of the West come
there to stay; many come to go. Hundreds
of thousands are attracted by the low price
of land and the opportunity to sell it at
a bigger price. They are not permanent
residents. They should not have a voice in
the future national policy of this country.
They own the Grain Growers, my honourable friend says; they are the Grain
Growers, and the Grain Growers alone are
represented by the Progressive party in
the two Houses of Parliament. Mr. Crerar,
who leads the Grain Growers in another
place, is the hired man, and always bas
been the hired man of the co-operative
organization. He gets, someone says, $15,000 a year for being faithful to them, and
be gets $4,000 a year for being faithful to
Canada-and if he is going to be honest as
a man and earn his money he will earn
$15,000 for being faithful to them and will
let Canada take care of itself. That is a
fair business proposition. If he wanted
to come here as an independent member of
Paliament, if he wanted to stand on the
floor of the House of Commons and speak
to this great nation of ours, I say that if
be represented that great element of progress which my honourable friend bas re-

FEBRUARY 23, 1921
ferred to, it would not take him long to
scratch his pen through the cheque for
$15,000 and send it back to the people from
whence it came. Talk about mercenaries;
talk about lawyers being the hired agents
of any special class. I want to ask you,
honourable gentlemen, if there is a man
in either House whom we can for one moment compare with a specially-hired agent
like Mr. Crerar, who represents this organization. If this Government does its duty,
and if the three Ministers in this House
see that they do their duty, they will appoint a commission to inquire into this
organization, and if that commission does
not find that it has swindled the western
people, I am prepared to leave this House
and never to enter it again. Take the million in grain that Ithey have never paid for
at the terminal elevator which they charged
up to the farmers; they have taken millions
and divided it up amongst themselves.
Why have we not a sample market to-day?
Why would honourable gentlemen, if they
were living there and were farmers, not be
paid for the flour that is in their wheat?
The Bill was passed by Parliament after the
outbreak of the war, and everybody supposed it would come into force. There had
been a demand for it, and I believe it was
an honest demand. After the Bill became
law, those people asked that its enforcement be postponed. Why that postponement? Honourable gentlemen, I am told
that the Grain Growers' Guide was at that
time in very low water, that it needed financial assistanne, and that certain representatives of transportation in this country went to the organization and said:
" We are perfectly willing that you should
have free wheat; go on with your agitation
for free wheat, but stop this agitation for
a sample market, because we would have
to stop our cars here-it would cause delay.
If you will do that, we will see that your
Grain Growers' Guide is financed." Whether
that is true or not, it is a fact that
from that day to this the Grain Growers'
Guide has not been in want of money. I
saw two loads of wheat shipped to Fort
William and two loads shipped across the
line to Minneapolis. It was wheat of low
grade, 3 or 4 points grade. One lot was
graded and bought by grade, as Canada
buys and sells. The other was bought by
sample market, and payment was made for
the flour that was in the wheat. It was
not that the American market was better;
it was because the sample market meant
honest treatment.
What was the result?

After paying the duty we received over
23 cents a bushel more for the wheat that
went to Minneapolis than for the wheat
that went to Fort William and was sold
under grade. Who stepped in and prevented us from getting the difference? The
Grain Growers' corporation asked that the
enforcement of that law be suspended, and
to this day they have not asked that it
be restored.
It surprises me to find that the honourable member who sat behind me (Hon. Mr.
Turriff) has disappeared-has gone to the
other side. I am sorry he has gone, and
I am glad he is away, because he used tg
groan here every time there was anything
presented in the way of strong protective
legislation.
Nobody speaks of the farmers as a menace. I do not think that Canada in its
weakest moments ever produced a fool who
would speak like that. No, and it is not
creditable to the leader of the Progressive
party even to suggest such a thing. We
may have been foolish, as others have been,
but we are not a menace, provided we remain in full sympathy with a complete
nationhood and that we spread out our
beneficent wings over all the classes and
all the people of Canada, without selfishness. If we do that, the farmer will stand
where he ought to stand, first among the
citizenship of this country. But he must
not be agitated by the people who want to
use him.
The honourable gentleman says that if
we had the American market the great
West would flourish. I suppose he thinks
that if we had free trade it would flourish
even more. If beef and mutton could be
brought free from Australia and New
Zealand, countries that have summer when
we have winter, and winter when we have
summer, so that when the honourable gentleman wanted to sell his corn-fed beef or
pork it would come into competition with
the meat of animals' fed only from the
soil, I suppose that would make the cattle
industry of the great West flourish. Honourable gentlemen, when you think of these
things, and of many more, with which I
shall not take up your time, you cannot
help realizing how unfortunate it is that a
man of his great ability-for he must have
that, because otherwise he would not occupy the position to which he has appointed
himself-should not have been given understanding.
I find that I have still a few moments
before we have any right to feel hungry,
and I wish to devote that time to the other

SENATE

wing of the group sitting opposite. I can
see no better subject on which to spend the
few remaining minutes than my dear friend
the honourable member for De Lorimier
Evervbody has
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
paid him some attention, and it would be
exceedingly unfair for me to neglect or
overlook him. I take particular pleasure
in dealing with him upon this occasion,
because of the new alliance he has formed
with the Liberals of the West, the Progressive party-the organization with which he
intends to ally himself for the betterment
of Quebec, and, J suppose, Canada generally;
but, being a citizen of Quebec, whenever
he speaks in this House, he practically
confines himself to Quebec-Quebec subjects, the people of Quebec, the nationality
of Quebec, and their religious affairs, incidentally included. So if I spend a few
minutes in pointing out to him the beauties
cf this new organization with which he has
allied himself, I am sure he will be forever
grateful to me.
He was speaking of the Parti National,
or the National party of Quebec. It is, I
presume, not necessary to repeat in this
House every year what I have already
stated, that the Parti National had its
opposite origin among the honourable gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Blondin?
Mr. Blondin
Hon. Mr. POPE: No.
stated bis case last night, and stated it
plainly, decisively, and well. He takes all
the responsibility for himself. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier himself said that he was the successor of Papineau. Papineau was of the
National school of thought, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier succeeded him.
It is on
record-preserved in writing, thank goodness, so that although the honourable gentleman is gone we can read it over and over
again with perfect assurance that it is
correct-that Sir Wilfrid Laurier stated
that he belonged to the Papineau school,
and that he and others of the Papineau
school could not look at affiairs in the same
light as the English colonists, because they
were entirely different; they had no alliance
in any manner, shape or form; they were
a separate colony and they had more to
do with the other colonies upon this continent than we had, or with Australia and
New Zealand, except for the matter of distance. He laid down that principle. Later'
on he came to power. The first Nationalist
Government in our province was that of
Hon. Mr. Mercier, who declared himself
Hon. Mr. POPE.

to be a Nationalist Prime Minister. Following him, Mr. Bourassa came into view.
When Mr. Bourassa left the Liberal party,
he said he left it-why?
Because Sir
Wilfrid Laurier was departing from the
teachings of the school in which he had
been a student.
Whether it bo right or
whether it be wrong, the Nationalist party,
if it has a field of operation, has it in
Quebec; if it bas a benefit to bestow, it is
in Quebec; if it is injurious, its effect is
on Quebec. At any rate, it is a Quebec
institution, which can be controlled and
governed by the voice of the people of
Quebec. So when you French Canadians
make an alliance between either of the two
great
political organizations
and the
Nationalist party, you have an instrument
of your own, which you may govern as
you sec fit, because it

is within your con-

trol. I am not a Nationalist.
I do not
believe in this separation. I think it is
wrong. I think it is unfair to the French
Canadian as I know him. I knvow him ai
home. I know bis industry, J know his
splendid hospitality, J know his adaptability, his ability to make good, and I
say that he should be broadened and not
narrowed in this Canada of ours. I am not
a French Canadian; J am an Englishspeaking man, as everybody knows. I do
not belong to the faith of the majority. I
am supposed to be a Protestant, and 1
fancy I am, but at the sane time, let me
say, I have some right to speak for those
people, because I do it without particular
prejudice either for or against them. I
speak of them as I know them, and I say
that whoever have misled those people
have assumed a tremendous responsibility
which they will regret-which they do now
regret. I am not going to charge anybody.
The war is past, and, thank God, we won it.
You have now formed your alliance with
the western wing of the Liberal party. I
am sure my honourable friend from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will appreciate the suggestion of total co-operation made in the speech of the leader of the
Progressive party in this House: "To be
frank, if we win, we shall take all the front
seats, of course, and the back seats will be
good enough for you; but that is only a
matter of arrangement: we must remernber that we are all one and the same."
The honourable gentleman from De Lorimier saw fit the other day, as he had donc
on two or three other occasions, to take up
the time of this House on a matter that
was purely and simply of a provincial

FEBRUARY 23, 1921
nature, of the alliance with the Nationalist party which I have just described.
Now let us see what will be the ,result
of this other alliance.
The first question that ever began to divide the province of Quebec from Ontario and other
parts of Canada emanated from the province of Manitoba. I am not speaking
of the rebellions. We know about them. I
am speaking of legislation. It was when
the Greenway Government, with Mr. Sifton
as its Attorney General, passed what is
known as the Manitoba School Act and
wiped out every vestige of the rights that
the French Catholic minority had in
that province in their schools. That
was the first act of his new allies.
Mr. Roblin came into power later on.
Nobody could return all the favors that he
had extended, but that they had been deprived of. He must have treated them
fairly, because, I notice, during the last
four years the Opposition in Manitoba bas
practically been composed of seven or eight
French Canadians. The treatment that
they received from the western wing of the
Conservative party must have been something that they remember with gratitude.
However, as time went on, the Roblin
Government went down, and the Liberal
party came to power under Premier
Norris. What did we see at the next
session? We saw again the wiping away
of every consideration that had been given
the Catholic minority of the province under
Roblin. Once more the honourable gentleman's (Hon. Mr. Dandurand's) new allies
had done their work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable gentleman allow me to correct
him? I know he would not like to make an
assertion which is not exactly according
to the facts. What were wiped out were
not advantages obtained under Premier
Roblin, but those of the Greenway-Laurier
agreement. I think the. honourable gentleman will agree with that.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Al right, put it that
way; and Roblin's act with regard to the
newly added territory. The honourable
gentleman will also stand corrected: it is
fifty-fifty. Ahi that your great leader had
been able to get, all that my great leader
had been able to get, was wiped out, not
by the Eastern Liberals or by the Eastern
or Western Conservatives, but by those
new allies with whom the honourable gentleman is to-day forming a relationship
for the advantage of his native province.
We had the two Autonomy Bills introduced in the House of Commons in Sir

Wilfrid Laurier's day. Honourable gentlemen remember that. You remember that
there was a strong clause providing for
minority rights in the first draft of that
Bill as presented to Parliament. You
remember that Mr. Sifton tendered his
resignation and a crisis was brought on.
You remember that certain clauses of the
Bill had to be very materially amended in
order that the Government of the day
might not be defeated. Once more, those
people whom you would rather trust than
any others, and with whom you are now
forming an alliance, got in their work. I
think it is well that these facts should be
known.
Now, let us consider the war, and the
elections of 1917, and the advent of Mr.
Crerar and others. There was a loud cry,
not from the Crerars, but from the real
Liberals of the West, for Sir Wilfrid
Laurier to come, and he went. He was
welcomed by thousands everywhere. Having
returned to North Bay on the morning
after the election, he received notification
that only two of his followers were elected
in the West. He said: "Impossible! It
cannot be true." Honourable gentleman,
it was possible and it was true. The shock
proved too much. Once more those people
got in their work, and you, the French
Canadians sitting in this House, ally yourselves with them, pretending to speak for
the welfare and happiness of your own
people. You who spurn the idea of association with Nationalists choose a band
whose character is plainly seen in every
act of theirs. Honourable gentlemen of
this House, I am not a Nationalist, but I
am from Quebec, and as a Quebecer, if I
had to make my choice between belonging
to the Nationalist party and the western
wing of the Liberal party, I would tomorrow become a Nationalist.
But that is not all. Who is the other
gentleman? They say, "If we do not depend
upon Mr. Crerar or his outfit, we depend
upon Mackenzie King." Who is Mackenzie King? For Heaven's sake, who is he?
The paid agent of Rockefeller and the tool
of Crerar. Crerar is the paid agent of this
co-operative American organization in the
West, and the other is his tool- a combination that cannot be beaten on earth. We
are here in this building on the same
ground that was occupied by the old building where men laid the foundation of Canadian nationhood, broad and strong and
deep; we are here, the successors of those
men, standing in this Parliament with
hirelings and self-appointed leaders asking

SENATE
that we should vote this vay, that way,
or the other way in the national interest.
I find that time is moving on, and I have
spoken a little longer than I intended. I
have but a few words to say on protection.
Protection is always used for tariff; but that
is one of the smallest of its uses. We could
live, somehow or other, without protection,
but not as well. There is not a man living
who bas got a particle of Canadianism in
him vho would contend that we could do
away with the tariff; therefore the principle
of protection is advocated by everybody. It
is a question of volume, a question of its
application.
The province of Quebec is particularly
interested in protection, because, while a
few of us down there speak English, we are
a French people. We have no other country
than Quebec; it is our home, and we only
overflow to other parts when we are
crowded. We do not leave Quebec because
we want to. Roamers there always were,
and roamers there always will be; but the
great bulk of the French Canadian people
are a close home-abiding people.
They
proved themselves to be the best industrial people the United States ever had, and
before we had the National Policy they went
over there to such an extent that to-day
there are nearly 2,000,000 French Canadians in that country. If we had had the
National Policy at that time ve vould
to-day have half those people in this country
instead of them being over there. Protection is a home policy. We want to stay at
home. The French Canadian is an artisan;
give him an axe and a saw and he can
make a house. He adapts himself to industry as no other nation in Canada does.
He protects himself to a certain extent in
that respect, and manufacturers like to
come where be is because he is a good artisan. That is the first principle of protection that we have in the province of Quebec.
That is the character of our citizenship,
and to-day we have industries coming from
the United States and from Ontario and
establishing themselves in Sherbrooke,
Montreal, Three Rivers, St. Hyacinthe, and
wherever ithere is water-power, because they
are protected by the industry of the people
there, because they are free from strikes,
because the people are a home-loving,
peaceful people-and that is the essential
thing in the building of an industry.
Capital is not worth anything, and management is not much better, unless you have
the man with the fingers te produce the
goods. Therefore we have in the province
of Quebec a centre of industry which, if it
Hion. Mr. POPE.

is given a chance, can manufacture for the
great prairies of the West as cheaply and
as well as any nation in the world. And
seeing that we pledged our credit and mortgaged Canada to upbuild the western
country-and we did it gladly-the only
decent and fair thing the progressive
people of that part can do is to give fair
play to the man in the East who is willing
te give them fair play. Sir John A. Macdonald recognized these characteristies of
the people of Quebec, and Sir Wilfrid
Laurier recognized them, because he lived
amongst these people, and he continued Sir
John A. Macdonald's policy, and safeguarded it, and protected Canada, and with
it Quebec. There is no equivalent for protection.
There is nothing that you can
substitute for it in Quebec; no other policy
will do. We do not want anything that is
not fair, but we demand protection in
Quebec, whether we are farmers, or labourers, or industrial people.
Now I cime to another form of protection-the protection of our labour. I say,
honourable gentlemen, that our labour
should be safeguarded against the importation of labour into this country. It should
be protected as to the quality and
character of that labour. I say it is unfair that our people of the province of
Quebec, and the girls and boys of our
people, should be exposed te the lower
civilization
of
Central
Europe. They
should be protected from it, and I demand
that protection for them.
One thing mare, and I have finished. Let
it be well understood throughout the wide
w orld that we are not calling for immigrants from the sunken nations of
Europe, from the remnants of those empires
that were se great five hundred or a thousand years aga, but which have fallen se
low that they can never rise. I say that
the prairies of the West should not be
settled by these animals; they should be
conserved for the best people in the world.
No second-rate people should be allowed te
go there. In the interests of the Dominion
of Canada, the quality should be branded
Number One, and Number One only, because we have learned that there is no asset
se valuable to the citizenship and the life
of a nation as the encouragement of its
citizens.

HALIFAX AS A REGISTRATION PORT.
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. B. CROSBY: Honourable gentlemen, there is a matter of importance that
I would lilce to bring before this House. I
S-7

notice in this morning's Citizen a statement which appears to have been made by
the Minister of Marine and Fisheries. I
do not know whether it is correct or not,
but I desire to bring it to the attention of
the House and of the honourable leader
of the Government in the Senate. The
statement is as follows:
Halifax, NS., Feb. 23.-That ail ships of the
Canadian Government merchant marine, ne
matter where they were built, will be registered
at Montreal, was the statement made by the
Minister of Marine, in a telegram to the Halifax
Board of Trade, it was announced at the board's
office to-day. The board recently protested te
the Minister against registration at Montreal
of the steamers Canadian Mariner and Canadian Explorer, both built by the Halifax Shipyards, Limited, the board claiming that Halifax should be the officiai sailing port of both
these ships.

That indicates to me that this report
may be wrong, because in place of "the
official sailing port" it should read " the
official registration port." The statement
continues:
At the board's offices this morning It was
said that the Minister had promised last year
that ships built at Halifax would be registered
at Halifax.

I am not here to speak in any way
against the registering of any ship at
Montreal. We are all proud of Montreal
and her position in the Dominion; but it
bas always been the custom to register
ships at the capital of the province in which
they are built. Sometimes when there is
only one registry port in a provinceHon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The honourable
gentleman bas no right to make a speech
in calling a matter of this kind to the
attention of the House.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I was trying to get
some information. If I may not speak,
may I ask the House to permit me to say
a word in connection with the matter,
because it is an important matter, and I
want the leader of the Government to
report upon it. If necessary, I intend to
move a resolution in regard to it. It is a
matter that needs attention at once. But
if my honourable friend objectsHon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think my honourable friend should give notice of motion if
he wants to make a speech.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Give
notice of motion.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I do not know
whether this is really a matter of fact or
not, but perhaps that is one of the strongest
reasons why I should not speak about it.

REVIsED EDITION

SENATE
But if it is incumbent upon me I shall be
very glad to give notice that I will bring
this matter before the Senate to-morrow
in the form of a resolution if necessary.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH.
ADDRESS IN REPLY.

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the Address in reply to His
Excellency the Governor General's Speech
at the opening of the Session.
Hon. GIDEON D. ROBERTSON: Honcurable gentlemen, at the adjournment of
the Senate yesterday, I think the honourable gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) would have moved the adjournment of the debate had he been in the
House, and, if the House has no objection
and the honourable gentleman desires to
proceed now, I would be perfectly willing
to follow him, because I simply moved the
adjournment because of his absence.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I am very much obliged to the
honourable gentleman who bas given way,
and as he bas expressed a desire to have
the last say on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, it is but proper
that I should speak before him.
I have no intention of following the
leader of the Government in this House
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) and the honourable leader of the Progressive party on
this side of the House (Hon. Mr. Turriff)
in the discussion of the tariff question. T
think it is somewhat premature, and that
we should wait to express our opinion on
that question when it is brought before this
House. The leader of the House, of course,
has an advantage over us in discussing that
question, because he is supposed to know
what is the intention of the Government,
while we are entirely in the dark. For
that reason, as I have already stated, it
vould be premature to engage in a discussion of that question at this time. I am
sure that whenever that question is brought
before the House it will be discussed on this
side and on the other side of the House on
its merits, irrespective of the political
opinions of individual members of this
House. For my part, I always regret that
we are sometimes tempted to give way too
much to our political feelings. We should,
I think, bear in mind that it is our duty
to refrain as much as possible from engaging in discussion on strictly political
questions.
Hon. Mr. OROSBY.

I have no intention either of following
the honourable members of this House who
have spoken of what they call the "isolation" of my own province. In the province
of Quebec we have the consciousness of not
being isolated in any way. We are conscious of having done our duty in the great
war, of having contributed in a fair
measure in men and money, and today we stand well in the opinion not
only of the Dominion of Canada, but
of foreign countries, and in that respect occupy a position which may
well be envied by the other provinces of this
great Dominion. I desire to refer for only
a few minutes to some portions of the
speeches which have been made by the
honourable gentleman from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and the honourable
the Postmaster General (Hon. Mr. Blondin). I was surprised to find that there
was such a difference of opinion between
these two gentlemen on a question which I
thought was hardly of a nature to cause
such a difference of opinion. It is not my
purpose to take sides with either of these
honourable gentlemen, but after what has
been said of my own province by the Postmaster General I cannot remain silent in
this House, and I feel it my duty to say
a few words. I desire to refer mainly to
what is to be found on pages 74 and 75
of Hansard. I will read a short quotation.
The Postmaster General says:
This is the first opportunity I have had to
thank my honourable friend for having been
kind enough to appear with me in Montreal
when I started a recruiting campaign.
We
were unfortunate: we did not succeed. t admit
that I was the object of the hatred that seemed
to prevail among a certain crowd of young
men in the upper part of the hall. It is true
that the honourable gentleman made quite a
good speech there. He did not go so far as
his leader, the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
who said that we were in this war to the last
cent and the last man; but on the whole he
said it was not a bad thing to do this for
France, or something to that effect. It is not
with the intention of casting any reproach upon the honourable gentleman that I mention
this fact; but the point that I want to make
is this, that that very night the feéw persons
who prevented the meeting from going on were
members of an organized political club. There
were in the hall many thousands of people who
were anxious to hear both sides of the question; but the Liberal organization had decreed
that no men ought to be heard in the Province
of Quebec who were trying to explain the questions of the hour. We were not allowed to
speak.

And then, further, on page 75:
Hon. Mr. Blondin: I know one thing, only
one thing, and a very sure thing-that it was
only the supporters of the Government who
were blown up.

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
The honourable Postmaster General was
referring to the blowing up of the country
residence of Lord Atholstan.
Hon. ,Mr. Belcourt: Will my honourable friend
allow me ta say-?
Hon. Mr. Blondin: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Belcourt:-and I think my honourable friend must know, that it was proven
in court that a Government detective by the
name of Desjardins, employed by the Government in Montreal, paid $25 ta the people
who used the dynamite ta which my honourable friend refers.
Hon. Mr. Blondin: Well, I understandHon. Mr. Belcourt: It is a fair question.
Hon. Mr. Blondin: Oh, yes, I understand
my holourable friend now.
He is absolutely
right. I should not like ta convey the impression that during those troublous times people
of all kinds dld not often act in the name of
one party or the other. But what my honourable friend cannot deny is that this sort of thing
was general in the whole province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Belcourt: Oh, no, no, no. I certainly
deny that absolutely, and everybody will deny
it. Dynamite general throughout the province of
Quebec? Does the honourable gentleman know
what he is saying?
Hon. Mr. Blondin: Yes, I do. How many
barns were burned, and how many times was
dynamite used in the district of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Belcourt: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Casgrain: Only when the Government paLid for it.
Hon. Mr. Blondin: They were very convincing arguments anyway.

The honourable Postmaster General may
well be thankful to the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) in having assisted him in inaugurating his recruiting campaign. I was on
the platform at the Monument National on
the occasion referred te in the address of
the honourable gentleman, and I heard
both his address and that of the honourable gentleman for De Lorimier, and both
of them were patiently listened to throughout their remarks. I regret to say that the
honourable gentleman does not give a
correct account of that meeting. It is true
that there was some noise during part of
the meeting, but it did not last long, and
it was net during either of the addresses
I have mentioned, but when a young man
who followed spoke in a very indiscreet
and offensive way. If it had not been for
that I am perfectly sure the meeting would
have been perfectly quiet. But at all
events, the honourable gentleman was
given a good hearing, and I do not think
it is with a very good grace that he comes
now to throw mud on his own people because of the interruption to which he has.
referred.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Will my honourable friend permit me? I do not think he
S-7

99

is stating exactly what happened. I was
practically prevented from speaking. I
was interrupted after I had been permitted
to say only a few sentences. I do not consider that I was allowed to speak, because
I do not think I spoke for more than seven
or eight minutes, and as I was to be one
of the main speakers I suppose that I
should have spoken longer than that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is a matter of
appreciation. The honourable gentleman,
of course, was present; I was present. My
recollection may be faulty, but I am speaking to the best of my recollection, and I
must say that I have a good memory and
I was near the honourable gentleman, and
I have consulted other persons who were
present, and my memory is to the effeet
I have mentioned. I could give the name
of the young man who followed the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier and who
was speaking when the noise took place.
I do not deny that during the speech of
the Postmaster General there were some
interruptions, that questions were put to
him; but my recollection is that the interruptions were of an orderly kind, and that
there was no indication of any desire on
the part of the audience to prevent the
honourable gentleman speaking.
The
honourable gentleman of course should
bear in mind the position that he occupied
at that time. In his address the other day
he confessed errors in the past.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
same?

Will you do the

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: We are all subject
to errors. They may be more or less important, but we are all subject to errors;
and when a public man commits an error,
which he has to confess later, I think it
is bad grace on his part if he takes the
occasion of such errors on his part to
make reflections upon his own province.
Now, how does the honourable gentleman
reconcile the admission which he made in
his address the other day, that he was supported by both the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier
as the leader of the Liberal party and by
the honourable member for De Lorimier,
wha was at that time, as be is to-day, a
leading member of the Liberal party, with
(the charge that be bas made in his speech
that the Liberal party was responsible for
the manner in which he was received at
the meeting at the Monument National?
I think it is altogether ungenerous on his
part to throw out such accusations when
he was not interrupted by Liberals, but by
people with whom he had been associated

SENATE
in the campaign of Drummond and Arthabaska. And why was he interrupted? Because his position then was in direct conflict with that which he had previously
occupied, and it was a surprise to those
with whom he had been associated not long
before, and displeased them; and now it
seems to me he should take the consequences of the dual position he deemed it
advisable to occupy at those two different
periods, and not charge it upon the Liberal
or any other party.
I need not refer to the position that the
honourable Postmaster General took on
the Naval policy in the election of Drummond and Arthabaska. It was a matter
of debate in the House of Commons, and if
honourable members desire to refer to the
admissions then made by the honourable
member I would refer them to the Commons Debates for 1910, pages 145 and
146. I will not take the time of, the House
to read those debates, but the honourable
gentleman then admitted the whole thing.
I will cite just a small portion. The Hon.
Mr. Brodeur, now a judge of the Supreme
Court, was speaking. He said:
Another gentleman who spoke at those meetings was the hon. member for Champlain (Mr.
I may say that most of these exBlondin).
tracts are taken from Le Devoir, their organ,
and I have every reason to believe that they
are correct. Here is what the hon. gentleman
said on the 25th off October, at St4 Louis de
Blandford:
"You are intimidating the people in waving
the English flag, and adding that we must contribute always and everywhere to the defence
of that protector of our constitutional liberties ;
but we will not be made to forget that in 1837
in order
it was necessary to bore holes init
to breathe the atmosphere of liberty."
Mr. Blondin: I deny most of these statements in Le Devoir. I did not till to-day have
any knowledge of that report, and I can explain it.
Mr. Brodeur: It is an unreliable paper by
what the hon. gentleman says, then why is he
having Le Devoir distributed in his county.
I am surprised at that.
Mr. Blondin: I sec by the speech of the
right hon. the Premier that not only may Le
Devoir be at fault sometimes, but even himself.
Mr. Brodeur:
The same bon. member,
speaking at St. Louis de Blandford said:
"The English have never done anything for
the French Canadians. We do not owe them
anything. French Canadians have nothing to
care about the opinion of the other provinces
upon this naval question. They can and must
settle the questions which concern them without consulting others. Those very ones who
disembowelled their forefathers on the Plains
of Abrahàm ask of you to-day to be slaughtered for their sake."
Is that false, too?
Mr. Blondin: Yes. The speech which I was
answering is not reported there. If it were,
you would understand it better.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Mr. Brodeur: Well, we will take another one,
of the 30th of October:
"England has gone so far as to grind down
the colonies as did Imperial Rome of old."
Mr. Blondin: Absolutely false.
Mr. Brodeur (reading) :
"The only liberties which we enjoy have been
snatched. England has not conquered Canada
for love or to plant the cross of Christ as did
France, but to establish trading posts and make
money. She has sowed the world with hatred,
quarrels and wars. We have had enough of
England and the English."
Mr. Blondin: I did not say the first phrase,
and I think Mr. Beland will deny it also.

Then Mr. Béland says:
Mr. Béland: I may say that I was present at
that meeting, and I remember exactly the
words pronounced by the bon. member for
Champlain, and as far as I can remember, that
is an exact reproduction of his speech.
Mr. Blondin: I do not deny that that was
said, but it was not said by me.
Mr. Brodeur: Well, it is very unfortunate,
Mr. Speaker. After all, the Prime Minister was
perfectly justifled yesterday in saying that a
victory won by such means was disastrousdisastrous to the Conservative party, and today they are ashamed of the work they have
donc.
Mr. Blondin: I am not ashamed. I will repeat them to you to-morrow.

Now, I say the honourable gentleman
made admissions then which he repeated
the other day in this House, and he should
bear with good grace the consequences
of his conduct at that time. I see no reason
why it should be made the occasion of his
abusing the honourable member for De
Lorimier as he did the other day.
The honourable gentleman invited us to
compare the position which he occupies
with that of the honourable member from
De Lorimier. He claimed to be more representative of the people than the honourable
member for De Lorimier. As far as that
gentleman is concerned, he occupies such a
position, not only in this country but elsewhere, myself and other honourable gentlemen in this House would be proud to
occupy. The honourable Postmaster General should not lose sight of the fact that
he ran in an election as a minister and was
defeated; and it was after he was defeated
that he was entrusted as a member of this
House with a department. The honourable
member should bear in mind that there was
no precedent either in England or in this
country of a minister rejected by the people

being brought into the House of Lords in
England or the Senate in Canada and entrusted with a portfolio and the administration of a public department. Therefore I
think the honourable gentleman should
be more discreet in comparing his position
with that of other honourable members of

this House.

Now, I am not going to quarrel with
my honourable friend in regard to the
speech that he made; I leave my honourable friend from De Lorimier and my honourable friend the Postmaster General to
fight it out. They are both quite equal
to the task. But I do here solemnly protest that it was a vile accusation to make
against the Province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I am not making
any.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The fact is just
the other way. Does not the Postmaster
General know that the finest and biggest
and most successful recruiting
meeting
that was held in Canada during the war
was held in Montreal in the month of September or October, 1914, at which both parties, the Liberal and the Conservative party,
were present in the persons of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, the late Hon. Mr. Casgrain, my
friend Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the Hon. Mr.
Justice Maréchal, Col. Gaudet, myself, and
others? All the speeches were delivered in
French. There were 12,000 people in Sohmer Park, and there were 15,000 who could
not get in; and I never in my life assisted
at a more enthusiastic meeting. I say that
that was the finest and best and the first
recruiting meeting held all over Canada;
yet we are told here now that nothing was
going on but the use of dynamite, the
burning of barns, etc.-and by whom?
By the only representative that the Province of Quebec had in the Government
of the day. I say that my honourable
friend ought to be ashamed of himself for
making statements of that kind in this
House, not only before the House, but
before the whole country.
Some hon. SENATORS: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He talked also
about the "isolation" of Quebec.
Those
are crocodile tears coming from the honourable gentleman; they are crocodile
tears coming from the party to which he
belongs. So far as Quebec is concerned,
she is not worried one single bit, and never
did worry, over what people are pleased
to call her "isolation." She did not worry
during the war when she was attacked
from right and left by the Conservative
party under an organized campaign against
her. She did not worry one bit then, and
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT.

neither is she flattered to-day by the excessive compliments and adulations to her
by the same party, which bas urgent need
of the support of the province of Quebec to
enable it to retain power. 'She was neither
scared by the threat then nor is she to-day
carried away by the adulation. The province of Quebec was never more comfortable and never more prosperous than she is
to-day. She is leading the other provinces
in almost every field of activity. Why should
my honourable friend talk glibly to this
House about the "isolation" of the Province
of Quebec? The Province of Quebec is not
a bit isolated.
That province is perfectly happy. I am sure that very recent
events ought to convince everybody that
the Province of Quebec is not worrying at
all about representation in the present
Cabinet.
She does not want it.
Why
should a member from Quebec, the only
member of the Cabinet from that province,
come here and shed crocodile tears over
the "isolation" of Quebec?
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, in endeavouring to say a few
words in regard to the Speech from the
Throne, I desire to join in the congratulations that many other speakers have already extended to the mover and the seconder of the Address.
I want also to add my congratulations
to the honourable member (Hon. Mr. Turriff) who spoke yesterday and announced
himself as the leader of the Progressive
party in this House. We are indebted to
the honourable member, I think, for several things, particularly for bringing to
our attention the location of the crossbenches in the Senate. They are admirably located, it seems to me, with the honourable gentleman from Repentigny (Hon.
Mr. Legris) on the honourable gentleman's
right, the honourable member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) in front of him,
the honourable member for Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Boyer) on his left, and nobody behind
him. I feel that the gentleman occupying
the cross benches is quite secure.
I would, however, like to make seriously
one or two remarks in reply to some of the
expressions of the honourable member from
Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff).
He regretted, and perhaps properly so, that the
Tariff Commission had not yet made any
report. Having been one of the members
of that Commission, I -beg leave to make
to my honourable friend at least a partial report now. May I inform him that
during the inquiry in Western Canada, one
of the interesting things that were

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
brought to the attention of the Commission
was the fact that the farmers in the West,
through their chief organization, the Grain
Growers, were being solicited and urged
to buy, and were being supplied with copies
of a large catailogue offering farm mnachinery and equipment of every description
for field, farm, and bouse, every single
article of which was not made in Canada;
and I may say that a copy of that large
catalogue was submitted to the Commission and forms part of the record. May
I express the view that if the gentlemen
whom the honourable member announces
himself as representing in this House were
to purchase some of their machinery in
Canada, that would materially aid the unemployment !situation, which lie seemed
yesterday to think was of littie or no consequence, but which I beg to assure him is
a very serious matter in this country at
this time. There was purchased outside
of Canada almost seven million dollars'
worth of ordinary farm implements in
1
1919; that is, exclusive of tractors.
would suggest that if seven million dollars'
worth of additional business in the way
of manufacturing farm implements had
been carried on in Canada it would have
materially relieved our unemployment situation. That is only one example among
many that might be quoted.
My honourable friend, in referring to
tariff details, which time will not permit
me to discuss and which it would be inappropriate for me to deal with on this
occasion anyway, deplored what hie alleged
to be the fact, that tariff rates generally
on goods entering Canada were higher than
the tariff rates upon goods entering the
United States. I beg to assure my honourable friend that, after a very careful
study of tariff matters extending over
several months, I am absolutely convinced that quite the contrary is the case.
It is to be noted that our tariff rates upon
the articles in which my honourable friend
and those who follow him but do not sit
behind him are interested are probably the
lowest on almost any of the articles that
are generally in use. While it is true that
the duty on a good many farm implements
is something like 12à per cent, yet upon all
the farm implements of every description
imported into Canada during the year 1919
the average duty paid was 4.55 per cent,
and in that year over fourteen million dollars' worth of -tractors were brought into,
That, I respectfully subCanada free.
mit, honourable gentlemen, is not an unduly severe burden lipon our agricultural
population.

103

May I illustrate the fact in another way?
We have in Canada approximately one
hundred million acres of land under cultivation. That is the equivalent of one
million farms of one hundred acres each,
and the fact that the total duty paid on
agricultural implements imported into Canada during the year was less than a million dollars means that the duty on imported agricultural implements was less
than one dollar per year per hundred acres
-another demonstration, I think of the fact
that our agricultural friends are not
unduly burdened by taxation on their implenients of production.
I had occasion to look at the other side
of the picture, to see what other people
were paying on their implements of production. I have in mmnd a single institution, a large institution, it is true, built in
this country within the last few years, and
I found that the duty paid on the equipment that went into that plant was a little
over $800,000, at the rate of about 27à per
cent.
I mention these matters, honourable gentlemen, in order to indicate by comparison
that the agricultural interests of Canada
have not been discriminated against, but
rather the contrary, and I hope that any
impression that they have been discriminated against will be removed by a careful
study of the facts on the part of those interested.
The honourable member for Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) expressed what I am
sure was bis personal view when hie said
that there was no necessity for any man
in Canada to be out of employment because
there was work for aIl. It bas fallen to
my lot, and it has not been an altogether
pleasant task, to give special attention to
this particular matter during the past two
or three years. May I attempt in simple
words to portray to you a few facts in
connection with- the question of employment and the effect of unemployment upon
the whole industrial and national life? I
state to 'you; honourable gentlemen, sincerely 'what I believe to be a fact, that unemployment and the fear of unemployment
are the most prolific sources of industrial
unrest in the world. Even though our
artisans may to-day be employed and may
have what they terni a regular job, which,
they expect to con tinue to hold indefinitely,
subject to good conduct and good service,
there is still at the back of their heads ahl
the tume the fear that some unforeseen
catastrophe, such as a financial reverse to
their employer, ore some national calamity,

L04

SENATE

may occur that will affect the industry, and
that they may find themselves out of employment, and that the reserve that they
have built up in the form of a small home
for their family may be swept out of existence, because they are no longer able
to obtain employment in their locality. In
many countries this possibility has given
rise to the thought that something ought to
be done to enable the honest, willing worker
to insure himself or be insured against unemployment and perhaps want, which is
almost sure to follow, just as we have long
regarded it proper for a man to insure his
life against accident or his property against
fire. There are many reasons why it is
difficult to work out a practicable plan, and
it is mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne that the Government is at present
conducting an investigation into this important question. I would like to make
clear to honourable gentlemen what has
been done in this direction, and what was
the instigation of the movement.
Honourable gentlemen may recall that in
this House two years ago I announced the
intention of the Government to conduct an
inquiry into industrial conditions in Canada. For that purpose a royal commission was appointed. Chief Justice Mather,
of the province of Manitoba, a gentleman
whom we all respect and whose ability we
all recognize, was made chairman of that
commission. Two gentlemen selected by
the Manufacturers' Association of Canada
were appointed members, two gentlemen
were appointed on the nomination of the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada.
and one member was appointed from the
House of Commons and one from this
House. The seven gentlemen composing
that commission made a very careful inquiry and close study, lasting nearly two
months, and finally presented a report.
They were not entirely agreed; two of the
members differed, in degree at least, from
the other five; but the report returned to
the Government by a substantial majority
of that commission contained some important recommendations. I will not weary
the House by reading them in their entirety,
but will just give you the well-considered
judgment of those men, whom we all, I
am sure, regard as capable, and who had
taken evidence on the subject throughout
Canada and made a careful study of it.
The report stated in part, as follows:
The chief causes of unrest may be enumerated as follows:
1. Unemployment and the fear of unemployment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Then they go on to enumerate several
other causes, and they say:
We have placed unemployment first because
we found that there was the greatest unrest
where there was the most unemployment. Unemployment was found in several of the larger
urban centres.

I omit considerable detail which may not
be relevant. Then they proceed to say:
Some of the more permanent factors in the
unemployment problem are the seasonal nature
of many industries, due to climatic conditions,
lack of continuity in large construction works,
and the great distance between some industrial
centres.
Present unemployment is in a measure due to
the curtailment of production in some industries becaise of the lack of ocean tonnage.

This applied to the conditions existing
at that time.
Owing to the unsettled conditions we found
everywhere a great reluctance on the part of
those possessing unemployed capital to risk it
in new enterprises or in the expansion of those
already established.

That was one of the contributing causes
of unemployment, as honourable gentlemen, I am sure, recognize. Then the commission proceeds to recommend as follows:
Even with the most complete machinery that
can be devised, it is difficult to see how a certain amount of temporary unemployment can
be avoided if we are content to rely upon the
ordinary course of supply and demand.
This
margin of unemployment could, however, be
largely reduced, if not extinguished, by State
and Municipal expenditure upon work of public utility. Such a policy will need to be carried out with care and closely watched from
the standpoint both of public economy and industrial conditions. Employment of this nature
can never form a permanent substitute for that
arising from industrial alctivity, and it would
be worse than folly to keep men engaged upon
stand-by government or municipal work when
the industries of the country were ready to receive them.

That means, in brief, that governments,
federal, provincial and municipal, should,
in the opinion of the commission, as far as
possible so gauge their works as to absorb
surplus and unemployed labour at seasons
when ordinary commercial industries do
not require it.
At the same time it would be legitimate to
anticipate to some extent work intended to be
done in the near future in order to give employment at the moment when it is most needed.

Then the report proceeds:
But supplying the unemployed men with suitable work for the present will not entirely
solve the problem. Before the labourer can be
made contented the haunting fear of unemployment must be removed from his mind.
This is something which affects all wage
earners, but more especially the casual labourer. He can never be sure just when his employment will terminate and he will be left
without the means of subsistence.

further to carry on that investigation, because we have found that some of the
countries at least that have passed legislation on this subject and have tried to
work it out in a practical way, have met
with difficulties wbich they did not anticipate. Therefore we propose to go slowly
and to try if possible to find a practical
plan for a solution of the problem, and
to see what can be done towards its
adoption. But this is Êtili in the stage of
investigation.

haunts the wage earner and make him a more
contented and better citizen.

SENATE
If I shall not be burdening the House too
seriously, I should like to go back to the
armistice-not back to 1854, as my honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) did, but to 1918. When the
war came to an end I think everyone in
this country who stopped to think felt that
Canada had a most serious problem facing
her in the re-establishment in civil life of
something more than 300,000 soldiers then
overseas and in hospitals, and about 260,000 civilian war-workers who by-reason of
the armistice found their employment discontinued. Anticipating a situation of tha
sort arising, Parliament in 1918 enacted
legislation bringing into existence what was
known as the Employment Service of Canada Act. Through that organization, with
the hearty co-operation of the provincial
Governments in almost every case, and with
the assistance of organizations of all sorts
outside, as well as individual citizens, that
problem which was facing us, and which I
think honourable gentlemen realize seemed
to be a tremendous one, faded away and
within a year's time practically every person in Canada who was willing and anxious
to work had an opportunity of employment.
May I say that from March lst, 1919, up
to February lst, 1921, more than 755,000
men and women found employment without cost either to themselves or to their
employers through the instrumentality of
the Employment Service of Canada.
That condition continued to prevail with
little alteration until the summer of 1920,
when, about midsummer, things began to
slacken in the business world; and by October, 1920, Canada was finding itself facing an unemployment situation. By means
of our employment service, and with the
hearty co-operation of employers generally,
the Department of Labour has been able
by the adoption of a certain system to get
accurate and prompt information as to the
fluctuation of labour and labour requirements. Every week between four and five
thousand employers in Canada, each of
whom employs more than 25 men, tell us
how many men they had last week, how
many this week, and how many they will
require next week. We know almost in
advance what their requirements are likely
to be.
I think it would be interesting to indicate what has happened since October last.
From the 15th of October to the 8th of
January, a period a little over two and a
half months, the barometer kept steadily
going down. In October the falling off
from 2,000 to 4,000 men per week, and the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON

ba'rometer continued to drop until near
the end of the year when these figures
reached the alarming proportions of a little
over 41,000 men and women per weekand up to January 8th it was still going
down. One hundred and thirty-eight thousand odd workmen who were employed on
the 15th of October were out of employment on the 8th of January.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend indicate to us the main cause
of that?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Contraction in
manufacturing. The manufacturing industry in all its phases showed the largest
falling off of any industry. Lumbering
usually shows a marked increase in the
number of men employed at that season
of the year; but unfortunately that did
not occur last fall except in certain localities. The Maritime Provinces, for instance,
did not show their usual increase in
absorbing labour in the lumber woods;
neither did British Columbia-in fact, it
fell off.
But that 138,000 means something more than 138,000 men; it means
that every night from October 15th to
January 8th, without counting Sundays,
about 2,200 men went home with empty
dinner pails, and have not had a full one
since.
The honourable gentleman for
Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) says that
is nothing; no man need be out of a job
if he wants to work and cares to go where
employment can be obtained; and he disposed of that question with the summary
hard-hearted statement that that was nothing, that no man need be out of a job if
he wanted work and cared to go where
employment could be obtained.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I be permitted to ask what is the present condition?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will come to
that in a moment.
Honourable gentlemen, those 2,200 men
who went home with empty dinner pails
every night since October 15th, have in
many cases, possibly the majority of cases,
wives and children dependent on them,
and looking to them to supply the necessaries
of life-food, and clothing-and such other
comforts as are possible. I say to you
that even in a country with as small a
population as ours, when men who are willing and anxious to work are thrown out of
employment by hundreds and thousands
through no fault of their own, and they and
their dependents find themselves in need, it

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
is the duty of the State to proteet the
interests of the State and to see that the
condition does not occur which inevitably
will follow if nothing is done for these
people. The large employers of labour
realize this. They have eomne together
and have agreed as to what should be done.
We are trying to work out a sane solution, flot hurriedly, but after careful examination, and meanwhile to build up a machine
by which such legisiation may be properly
administered when the time cornes to put
it into effect. I hope and I feel sure that
the honourable gentleman fromn Assiniboia,
on calm reflection on ail the facts, will revise
the view which hie expressed yesterday.
My honourable friend also, I believe perfectly honestly and sincerely, questioned
seriously the usefulness of a certain
business organization employed by the
Government for the purpose of reorganizing and rendering more efficient and
economical soine branches of the Publie
Service.
The honourable member referred in particular to the Arthur
Young Company, which company was engaged by the Civil Service Commission a
year or two ago upon the strength of a
report filed by certain well-qualified gentlemen who, investigated conditions in the
Printing Bureau. I think a certain Mr.
Lewis was the chairman of that.Committee;
the late Mr. Slack, the 'n of the Montreal
Gazette staff, and another gentleman whose
naine I forget just for the moment, were
on the Committee. They made the recommendation to the Civil Service Commission
that it was absolutely essential that saimething should be done to reorganize and put
upon a business basis the Government
Printing Bureau. The Civil Service Commission, already greatly overburdened with
work beyond their ability to performn within
the time in which it ought to, be done, found
theinselves utterly unable to, give personal
attention to that matter and felt that they
were flot competent to enter into so large
an undertaking. Therefore they engaged
the best experts that were obtainable, men
who had done similar work for private
corporations in this country but who happened to be located in another country.
Those gentlemen came here and did the
work. Without any desire to weary the
House, may I say that a year after that
work had been completed the Civil Service
Commission went back to the original Committee which bad made the recommendation, and said to them: "Gentlemen, we
would like your idea as to the succesa or

otherwise of the reorganization work done
in the Printing Bureau," and that Coinmittee, over the signature of Mr. Lewis as
convener, filed a report with the Civil Service Commission setting forth their views,
obtained froin observation of the results.
I think honourable gentlemen will agree
that such a report must be accepted as a
fair one. I think both Houses of Parliament practically agreed with the original
recommendation of that Cemmittee, upon
which the work was subsequently done. I
will read the essential parts of this report
for the information of the House. It is
dated January, 1921, and it states:
F'oilowing your request, we have recenitly
made an InsLpectiion of the Bureau and its -recorde w4th a view to furnishing a eupplementary report to ours submitted on Februa.ry
14, 1919, on conditions as they are now, that
certain sugSestions and recommendations then
made have been acted upon.

The report of February 14, 1919, is the
original recommendation, I think. They go
on to Say:
We are amazed!
What was probably as
ineffi-clent and unhaWpy an organisation (as
ould very well be found anywhere has been
changed Lnto oneï we do flot hesitiate to say,
as efficient on the average ias any in <Canada.
The work was undertaken fea.rlesly aind
carried out cou.rageouely and apparently wlthout political interferenice. New standards have
been set, and although high, wîth the practices
and priilples that have been applled, can
be not enly maintainked but improved upOn.
We belt-eve that 'it has been very satisfactorily demon!strated that even a G'overnment
institution can be so organized and operated,
If net interfered wlth, as to mjke It compare
favourably with a high cis
and purely commercial one.

Then. they go on with somne details with
which I need not weary the House. But
you will be interested in knowing the practical resuits as viewed by this Committee.
The Committee states:
,Som-% of the outstandlng economides and
achievemen-ts are as follows:
There has been effected a reduction in staff
over ail three branches, from 1.171 on June lst,
1919, to 749 on October 2Oth, 1920, a reduction
of 36 per cent.
Some of the heaviest reductions: In the Composition end from 368 te 180, or 50 per cent;
Bindery, from 281 te 159, or 42 per cent; Stationery and Distribution combrned, from 160
te 94, or 40 per cent; Proof Reading Roem,
fromn 65 te 26. or 60 per cent. (26 men under
one foreman are now doing the work that ws
being done hy r>5 men under two foremen at
the time of the last report.)
The pay roll covering Printlng, Stationery,
and Distribution branches for the present flscal
Year (after deductlng 12, per cent interest for
comparative purposes) -

That is the annual increase in salaries
of employees and so on-

SENATE
-should show a decrease of approximately 30
to 35 per cent, or, in the aggregate, from $425,000 to $475,000.
The Linotype equipment bas been reduced
from 32 to 20 machines, or 37 per cent. The
product per machine hour bas been increased
110 per cent.
The Monotype keyboards' production bas increased approximately 33 per cent. The ratio
of casters to keyboards has been adjusted
and the Monotype end, with slight extra equipment, will be well balanced.

This report winds up by stating:
Gentlemeit, we congratulate you on your
courage and your efficiency, and only wish that
our fellow Commissioner and good friend, Mr.
E. F. Slack, had lived to see that the great
deal of real work he put into the former report had made possible so great a public
economy.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Could the honourable gentleman let us know how many officials have been added to the Printing
Bureau since that report was made?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shall be glad
to endeavour to obtain that information for
my honourable friend; but I beg to assure
him that the number of officials is less than
it was at that time.
Now, coming down to the more immediate
present, and referring to another organization of experts that have been doing
some efficiency work in the Government
service.
My honourable friend stated
yesterday that a certain firm known
as Griffenhagen and Associates had entered into a binding contract with the
Government for one year, and SO forth.
I beg to assure my honourable friend that
his information is erroneous. In the first
place, no contract was entered into.
An
understanding was arrived at as to terms,
etc., terminable at sixty days' notice at any
t:me; and had the special committee of the
Cabinet having this matter in charge felt
at any time during the past year that the
Government was not getting value for the
money expended, most assuredly it would
not have continued a service of this nature.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is a wonder
it continued as long as it did.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will explain
fully, I think, to my honourable friend in a
moment. It was obvious that any association undertaking to reorganize the whole
Civil Service had at least five years' work
ahead of it. The company or association
that is engaged to do this work is a Canadian company, it is incorporated in Canada, 40 per cent of those connected with it
are Canadian citizens, and I think the sane
company bas been employed by large comHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

mercial and industrial concerns in this
country and is now engaged in doing
exactly the same sort of work for them,
because it was the only association or
organization of the kind that had experts
in all branches competent to do such work.
In one of the two departments to which
special attention was given, namely, the
Customs Department, the Minister of Customs himself will tell you that the complete
reorganization that will become effective
on April lst next will mean a very substantial saving, quite in excess of the
Printing Bureau figures. My honourable
friend from Assiniboia offered one criticism which I think was a proper one, but
to which I think there is a very good answer. He pointed out that while the work
was proceeding, a substantial number of
civil servants taken from the various
branches of the Service were engaged in
assisting and, as he put it, doing work for
those gentlemen. That was not the case,
however. It is true that a number of men
from several departments, including one
from my own and several from the department presided over by my honourable
friend the leader of this House, had given
assistance and valuable assistance; but at
the same time they were obtaining important information which they did not before
possess as to modern efficiency methods in
business. And now, after one year has
elapsed, it is felt that it is quite possible
to proceed along the same lines, and to introduce into other departments of the Service some of the improved efficiency methods
that have been brought into this one, without the continued aid of those outside gentlemen and of this outside firm. I submit
to you, honourable gentlemen, that as a
business proposition it bas been an absolutely profitable one to the country, and
that the whole difficulty, boiled down, is
contained in one word, that is, that the
name of the association with which the
understanding was had and which has
been doing the work was not one that was
popular in this country at that time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend has not answered the question which
I put to him as to the condition of unemployment. I think my honourable friend
bas forgotten it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I quite overlooked it. Since January 14th the prospects have brightened. During the week
ending January 22nd there were 12,834
more men reported employed than in the

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
preceding week; but the number dropped
to a decrease of 2,000 in the week following, and up to the present it is remaining
about stationary. The prospects are, however, of a substantial improvement coming
in the immediate future.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is that because
of more manufacturing? Would that be
the reason for the betterment?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My own personal view is that the rather abnormal
increase in the latter part of January was
accounted for by the number of firms
which had resumed operations after having
practically closed down during the holiday
period for repairs and other purposes. As
1 have pointed out the falling off in the
week preceding Christmas was 45,000,
which I think was due perbaps, to that
abnormal condition.
The honourable leader of the Opposition
during the course of his remarks in this
Hýouse, which were carefully and thoughtfully made, I know, referred to a question
which has caused a good deal of comment
both on the lips of our people and in the
press, namely, the work of the Board of
Commerce. I would not refer to that at
this moment except for one reason, and
that is that, after the resignation of the
permanent members of the Board, the
Board was temporarily filled up to carry
on-filled up by men who received no
compensation whatever for their services.
One of those men 'happened to be the
Deputy Minister of the Departmnent of
Labour; and, gentlemen, I cannot sit idly
by and see any impression left that is unfair to an honest officiai of my departmnent.
1 do not think that my honourable friend
intended to leave any such impression, but
1 want to make clear what was done in
connection with the Board of Commerce.
The order which finally resulted in the
resignation of the temporary members of
the Board was not an order issued by
themn because of any pressure brought to
bear upon themn by anybody, but because
on June llth, 1920, the permanent Board
then in existence had issued an order, or
a communication, to the sugar manufacturers in Canada. Before reading the
order I 'wish to explain that the sugar
manufacturers were in June, 1920, faced
with the situation of being required, by
reason of the limit placed upon them and
upon their profits by the Board of Comnmerce, to purchase raw sugars at prices
far in excess of what they were able ta
obtain for the refined product. There was
naturally kicking at that, and the Board

10E

of Commerce in reply to them at that time
said:
The Board will flot recognize prices based, on
replacement values on a rising market. It will be
its duty in good time, as It hopes, to as carefuily protect the trader on a.falling market by
permitting hlm to average his cost down, as it
must now carefully protect the consumer In
pulling the proper average coet up.

Within a very short period after that
communication was sentHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Does my
honourable friend defend that principle?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am simply
stating the facts in justiceHon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is my
honourable friend's object in quoting it?
Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSON: I will come to
that, if my honourable friend can exercise
patience; I am sorry if I am wearying him.
That promise or pledge having been given
by the permanent bona fide members of
that Board in June, 1920, their successors
-the temporary members I have referred
to, of whom the Deputy Minister of Labour
was one-felt themselves obligated te implement the promise made by the Board
which they at that time temporarily represented; and an order was issued fixing the
price of sugar in October at a level that
would save a part of the tremendous losses
that the manufacturers were incurring by
reason of the depreciation in price outside
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend, was the Government
consulted, and did it assent to that?
Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSON:' The Government was not, and knew nothing of it
until the order was issued. That' order
issued by the temporary Board of Commerce was one which, of course, aroused
a great deal of condemnation and criticism
throughout Canada, and upon investigation the powers of the Board were found
to be limited in regard to the legality of
the order, and that ended the matter. I
understood the remarks of the honourable
leader of the Opposition to indicate that
in his opinion the inembers of the Board
assumed the responsibility of issuing. that
order without any reason behind it. The
reason behind it was that those gentlemen,
acting temporarily upon the Board, felt
bound to implement the pledge given. by
the permanent Board composed of the gentlemen of whom you ail know.
Passing from that subject, may I refer
very briefly to another, which I think will

L10

SENATE

be of interest to the members of this
House? It is one on which very conflicting
opinions have been expressed to me and
to the Department by employers and by
labour men; that is, the increased or decreased efficiency of labour in production.
In August, 1920, by reason of many inquiries for information in connection with
this subject, the Department of Labour
took steps to obtain what might 'be regarded as authentie information upon it,
and communicated with thousands of employers throughout Canada, asking them
for their experience.
That information
bas been received and tabulated, and appears in the February number of the
Labour Gazette. I will not go into it in
detail further than to tell you that you
can read it there, and I think you will find
the results interesting and illuminating.
It is simply the evidence of the employers
of Canada themselves on this subject, and
I will leave you to read it for yourselves.
There are one or two other subjects I
would like to mention, and one I feel I
must mention. In doing so I hope that no
honourable gentleman present will think
that I am trespassing on ground that I
should not tread.
Since this Session
opened there has been some controversial
discussion confined to one particular part
of our country, and, indeed, boiled down,
to a few individuals. Remarks have been
made that would indicate to a listener that
the intention was to convey the thought
that the conditions referred to were general
throughout a particular province. I want
to say, honourable gentlemen, that I deplore any discussions or antagonisms of
that sort being dragged into this House;
but inasmuch as this has occurred, and
having resided in the Province of Quebec
for six years myself, though a native of
another province, I feel that I know the
people in the Province of Quebec fairly
well. I want to say to all honourable
gentlemen present that the ordinary
French Canadian citizen is, in my opinion,
a type of humanity to be admired. They
are honest, they are industrious, they are
confiding-in my humble opinion, their
being too confiding leads them in many
cases in the ways of misunderstanding.
As honourable gentlemen present know,
I have not mixed up in political
controversies, and do not profess to
be an authority on political questions,
but during the year 1918 I had occasion
to come into intimate contact with what
was going on in the Province of Quebec
and some of the influences at work in that
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON,

Province. In February, 1918, the Government of Canada decided that, because
of the heavy clouds that were hanging over
our boys in France, when God only knew
what was going to happen when the spring
campaign opened, they were prepared, as
the Allies all were prepared, to resort to
any expedient that was necessary to win.
Therefore one of the things that was done
was to call to Ottawa fifty-five gentlemen
representing organized labour throughout
Canada, and I think a larger number of
ladies representing every ladies' organization that' we could think of in this country.
After explaining the necessity, we proposed to them that they approve of cooperating with the Government in taking
an industrial census of our people, to the
end that, if necessity should require, the
Government would know just where every
person in Canada would be best fitted to
give the highest service in any capacity.
In addition, I may say incidentally, in.
passing, that registration resulted in the
discovery of more than 2,000 unregistered
aliens in Canada, who, as a result of the
registry, were quickly picked up and put
in internment camps where they did not
carry on their nefarious propaganda. But
that is merely a side issue. What I want
to do is to point out some facts-kindly,
I hope, and with regret-for the purpose
of trying to make honourable gentlemen
realize the futility of carrying on indefinitely a warfare on these contentious questions of the past. Notwithstanding the fact
that it is three years now since those
incidents occurred, they have never been
mentioned because it would not do any
good; but when the honourable gentleman from Ottawa the other night intimated-did not state plainly in so many
words, but intimated-that the Government of Canada was responsible for
hiring men to commit crimes, I determined there and then that this House
should be placed in possession of some facts
that would enable honourable gentlemen in
this flouse at least to know whether or not
the Government was responsible for the
carrying on of some things that were done
in that Province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I gave way to
my honourable friend this afternoon, and
to his predecessor, and to my honourable
friend from Compton yesterday, with gladness.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to point
out that my honourable friend is not stat

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
ing what 1 said. I did flot hint at anything
of the kind. I said that was the evidence
submitted before the court in Montrelthat a Government detective had paid $25
for the dynamite that was used for the
dynamiting of Lord Athoista n's residence.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Prior to the
remark that my honourable friend quoted
he asked my honourable friend the Postmaster General who supplied the money.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I did; I asked
that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Perhaps it was
you.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My statement
was, and I repeatSome Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -that a Government detective had sworn in court-and 1
gave his name, Desardins-that he had
paid $25 to men to buy dynamite. That is
what my statement was. That is a matter
of record.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. That is quite
true, but I think nmy honourable friend
gave the impression to this House, or to
any person hearing the stafement or reading it, that that is a reflection upon the
court and flot; upon the Government.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I want to
continue, if I may, and point out a few
things that occurred, to indicate to honourable gentlemen opposite that it is ohviously not the Government or the supporters of this Government who are respon.
sible, or have been responsible, for many
of the unpleasant things th«at have occurred
in the Province of Quebec. It was in February, 1918, that the Government, after
bringing together 55 representatives of
Labour,' many of them. from Quebec, and a
larger delegation of ladies, a substantial
number of whom were from Quebec, ohtained the endorsation and co-operation of
those organizations for the taking of the
registration. What happened? I do not
recail the name of the paper in Montreal
that published the article, but if I mistake
flot there appeared on March 9th a news
item regarding a committee which had been
appointed, or appointed itself, known as the
Canadian Women's Patriotic League, and
the list of ladies constituting that committee contained sev eral names very similar
to those of some honourable gentlemen
sitting opposite. That organization started
work, and on March l2th, within thre
days of the date of its inception, it directed

111

a communication to the then Prime Minis'ter, Sir Robert Borden. I will not read
it ail, but will read a couple of paragraphs,
-ahl that is relevant. The letter states:
At the announcement of new legisiation concerning the registering of young girls and young
men over the age of sixteen, the hearts of
mothers have been troubied anew.
It is for
this reason that we corne to beg of you flot to
interfere with this deliate question, which
wouid resuit In the exasperation of the tair sex
and cause agitation of grave and unfortunate
consequence.
Do flot Imagine for a moment,
right honourable sir, that we could tolerate
to see thosé adolescents placed with strangers
of doubtfui morals, where their morality would
be more or less exposed.
Rather would we
make a rampart of our bodies than submit
to such drastic measures.

There are several more paragraphs of
a similar nature, which perhaps it is not;
wise under present circumstances to read.
That will indicate what I have in mind.
Sir Robert Borden replied to that at considerable length and with great care, setting forth clearly and plainly the purpose
of the registration. He sent to me a copy
of their communication and his reply, because I happened to be Chairman of the
Registration Board. I have Sir Robert's
reply here. It is somewhat iengthy, and
I am sure it is not necessary to read it
unless honourable gentlemen so wish. But
what followed, notwithstanding the assurance of the Prime Minister and notwithstanding the fact that I supplemented
his letter by sending to, those ladies a copy
of the regulations adopted by the Registration Board, together with a long communication giving them ahI the details, so
that they could not £ail to understand?
And I had the communication translated
into the French language before sending
it to, them. The work went on, and before
registration day arrived-hundreds of young
girls whose homes were in rural districts
in the province of Quebec were called home
from their employment and kept under the
supervision of their parents for a considerable period, because those poor women out
in the country believed the rot that had
been circulated amongst them.
And I
indicate to you where I think the idea and
the plan originated.
Just one other point. In carrying on
that work of registration we found that in
probably six or seven rural districts in
that province, ahi but one being south of
thé St. Lawrence river, open opposition and
antagonism were encountered. We neyer
said a word about it, but did the best we
could. When the thing was over and the
accounts came in for adjustment from the
deputies ahi over Quebec who had done the

SENATE
work, many of them enclosed statements of
what had occurred. I have not bothered
with them, but I have on record here about
42 telegrams that came from people who
were either molested or seriously threatened, or who had property destroyed or
damaged by dynamite explosions or by fire.
Registration was forcibly prevented. In
some cases the cards, after the registration
had taken place, were forcibly taken away
and destroyed in a bonfire, with hilarity.
I have in mind one postmaster in particular who was threatened. The Postmaster
General (Hon. Mr. Blondin) knows full
well that this is perfectly correct, because
his department received many more reports
than I did of the threats that were made
against local postmasters and how they
were boycotted by the people in the community because they presumed even to perform their duty in handing out to the
addressees the communications that came
in connection with the administration of
the Military Service Act as well as the
registration. Honourable gentlemen, I am
not going into details and will not read
any of those documents. It is unnecessary
to do so.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Read just one or
two. This is all new to me, and I live in
Quebec. It is very interesting to learn
that we were so near a rebellion and never
knew it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before reading
them, may I say to my honourable friend
that I suppose the danger does not now
existHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, read them
if you do not mind.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -but the persons who .sent them in most cases urged
that their identity be not revealed, because
of the fear that they had of reprisals. So,
I will read the telegrams, but with your
consent will omit the signatures; but the
honourable gentleman can see them if he
desires.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is no good unless we know the name and the place.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But the name
and the place are both given.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is no use
in reading it if the honourable gentleman
is not going to give the name and the
place.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I feel that in
justice to those loyal people who tried to
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

do their duty to Canada during that time,
it is not fair to them that IHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, do not read
them.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -that I should
favour my honourable friend with what he
wants, now.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Robertson) should
not have spoken of it at all, then.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A telegram
from Beauce county-perhaps it is all right
to come within the county-reads as follows:
We are forced to begin anew every day,
owing to the fact that those whom we appointed as deputy registrars in the different
parishes send their resignations and their work
has to be donc over again.

The post office is at a certain point in
Beauce. Here is a telegram signed by the
party responsible, who was an official:
The post office in which registration booth
Little damage
was located was dynamited.
done.

From another point in the same county
a telegram as follows:
House of deputy dynamited. Very little damage donc. Schoolhouses in which registration
booths were located were all guarded to prevent
people registering.

From another point in the same county a
telegram reading as follows:
Registration booth crowded, but citizens deto register were prevented from doing

siring
so.

From another place in the same county
a telegram as follows:
Between four and five hundred people registered, but completed cards stolen during the
night of June twenty-fourth. The cards were
in deputy's desk, and thieves took desk and
all.

A telegram from another point in the
same county reads:
About 150 completed cards at one registration booth were stolen during religious service
on Sunday, June 23.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is strange that
we never heard of this before
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: From another
point in the same county:
Dynamite exploded close to certain residence
on night of June 8.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it the same
party who sent all these telegrams?

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON (reading):
Considerable damage was done.
Complaint
nade to Attorney General of Quebec on June 29.

I may add for the information of my
honourable friend and those interested that,
notwithstanding the fact that complaint
was laid, it was not possible to get satisfactory action, or get any action in most
cases, by way of bringing the culprits to
justice.
Honourable gentlemen, as I say, that
information bas been for three years in
my office and I have not given you more
than a patch. I have not touched at all,
and do not intend to touch, on one phase
that is most glaring.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Do you believe
it yourself?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I most assuredly do, because a number of these statements came to us under oath: affidavits
had been taken by the parties before notaries. They all came unsolicited. At that
time, attempting to take a registration of
all the people in Canada on a single day,
and having to deal with more than 45,000
persons, two-thirds of whom were giving
free voluntary service, I was not looking
for any additional communications or
trouble.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if he received details of that kind from elsewhere?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: None whatever.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: None whatever?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: None from anywhere else in Canada. The only reason
why I bring this forward at the present
time-and I regret to have done it, except for the necessity-is that I want this
House to know the truth-that the present
Government of Canada and the recent Government under Sir Robert Borden are not
and have not been responsible for these
things that have been going on there.
The difficulties that have occurred are
largely due to organizations such as the
one I mentioned as having been started
within a few days of the time that the
Government announced the decision to
register the people of this country. It
is underground work of that sort that is
largely responsible.
Honourable gentlemen, let me say to you
in all sincerity that I hope we shall see
an end of this sort of thing. I have lived
in the province of Quebec for nearly six
years; I have served in a public capacity
S-8

113

a large number of men there for about
fourteen years, and have a great many personal friends amongst the people of that
province; and I want to say that I heartily
endorse what the Postmaster General
stated the other day, that there is no better
class of citizen in Canada than the French
Canadian citizen, if he knows the truth.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then are you
not surprised at this?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: You
do not live in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I know as much
about Quebec as the honourable gentleman
does--quite as much.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Just one other
observation. When we recall that our
former respected Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Borden, received notice, I think, on
more than one occasion, that. his presence
in the Province of Quebec was not desiredHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is true.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -and that the
Minister of Justice and the Minister of
Marine and Fisheries, both ministers from
the Province of Quebec, were publicly
stoned in one of the principal cities of
Quebec because they dared to stand on the
public platform and ask the people of
Canada to back our army, then overseas
and suffering, it is clear that it was not
the Government nor the Government's
supporters who threw those stones.
I hope that honourable gentlemen opposite will in future show a desire to forget the past, and try to live in harmony
and work for the interests of all the people
of Canada, regardless of nationality or
creed. Let us sink our differences and not
continually rake them up, as was done in
the discussion of the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne last year, and
as has been done again this Session by the
same honourable gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Would the honour
able gentleman allow me one question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. BOYER: At what place were
those stones thrown, and at what season of
the year? If I remember aright, that meeting took place in the winter, and the only
things they could get would be snowballs.
I do not know where the stones came from.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I was not
present, but I can assure my honourable

REVIsED EDITIoN

SENATE
friend that there are stones in the vicinity
of Sherbrooke both in summer and winter.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Sherbrooke!
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Not Sherbrooke!
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh!
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Honourable
gentlemen, I rise to make a few remarks
on the Address. Before doing so I wish to
extend to you, Mr. Speaker, my most hearty
congratulations on the honour that has recently been conferred upon you, in your
being made one of His Majesty's Privy
Councillors. In being se honoured you have
brought honour to your native province as
one of her illustrious sons. I know, Sir,
that I voice the sentiment of every honourable gentleman on this side of the
House when I express the hope that it
may please a kind Providence to permit
you long to retain the very important position which you occupy as Speaker of the
House, and at the same time enable you to
offer His Majesty the best possible counsels from the province of Quebec. I know
that honourable members on both sides of
the House will join with me in this wish.
Speaking on the Address, I desire to congratulate my namesake the honourable
member from Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster), a business man from the province of
Quebec, a man of large financial and comrmercial interests, upon his ability to address this House in two languages. I regret that I do not possess the ability to
speak French, which I consider to be in
some parts of this Dominion an absolute
necessity. It is a graceful thing at any
time for a business man to be able to express his ideas, as the honourable member
from Stadacona did the other day, in two
languages.
May I congratulate also the seconder of
the Address (Hon. G. V. White) upon his
very able effort. Having been associated
with him as a member of the House of
Commons, I was not surprised. He is an
old parliamentarian. If you will excuse
the expression, I may say he comes from
racing stock. He bas proved himself to be
a worthy son of a worthy sire, and I hope
and trust he may be spared for many more
years not only as an ornament of the
Senate, but as one of our most prominent
It was in the course of that
members.
notorious campaign that took place in the
riding of Brockville in 1898 that I received
from bis father, the late Speaker White
of the House of Commons, in listening to
him discuss on the platform the questions
of the day, the inspiration that possibly
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

I might sometime take part in the public
affairs of this country. Many of the older
members of either House will remember
what a wonderful campaign that was. It
brought more disgrace to that riding than
it ever suffered either before or since, because of the fact that during that campaign
a great many fraudulent ballots were
printed and by them his opponent, Mr.
Comstock, of Brockville, was elected, and
the people of that riding were robbed of
their franchise. The late Sir Wilfrid
Laurier refused to permit an investigation.
However, since that campaign I have
always considered it to be a great advantage for any man to be able to stand
on the public platform and discuss in an
intelligent manner the questions of the day.
One question that was asked in Canada
from the East to the West was: who
printed those fraudulent ballots? I have
yet to learn the answer. I have one of
them filed away as a keepsake and it may
be of interest at some future time. The
honourable member for Pembroke (Hon.
G. V. White), in the effort that he put
firth in this House the other day, was only
upholding the traditions of bis race. He
bas inherited the ability to discuss the
questions of the day. It is also a very
great pleasure for me to be able to congratulate the honourable gentleman from
Pembroke on his war record. I should
have liked to hear him enlarge upon that
subject, as he is one of the few members
of this House who went overseas and
actively engaged in the defence of the Empire and the fight for freedom and democracy. He gave us some most interesting
figures during his address, and I am sure
that if it had not been for that great sense
of modesty which he possesses he would
have been able to give us very much more
information. I am going to take the liberty
of speaking for a few minutes alang that
line in order to show you what the Union
Government of Canada, when endorsed by
the citizens of Canada, was able to do in
bringing aid to the Empire at that particular period.
We are all proud of the position that
Canada occupies to-day, more especially
in view of the record which she made during
t'he war. I do not think for one moment,
honourable gentlemen, that the right kind
of red blood flows in the veins of that Canadian who would not be proud of the efforts
put forth by Canada's citizen army. I ask
you to recall a memorable morning in April
of 1915, and I ask you who it was that

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
stood in the way of the great Teutonic
horde which was endeavouring to break
through the thin red line of the British
in order to fall on Calais? Why, honourable gentlemen, it was none other than our
own Canadian boys, who by their valour
and heroism proved to the world that they
had no superiors and very few equals as
soldiers in the field. No less a statesman
than Mr. Lloyd George, Premier of Great
Britain, bas admitted that it was the
Canadians who saved the day and that they
by their efforts on that occasion saved
Calais.
I believe, honourable gentlemen,
they saved the civilization of the world.
I think it was that eminent statesman,
William Pitt, who once said that the people
of Great Britain would save themselves
by their courage, and that they would save
Europe by their example. By doing as they
did those good loyal Canadian boys perpetuated the traditions of the race from
which they sprung, and we all rejoice in the
fact that they acquitted themselves with
such glory. The efforts of Canada's citizen army have commanded the admiration
not only of the Bwitish Empire to which
we belong but of every one of Britain's
overseas Dominions; and I believe there
is no country on the face of this world
to-day where those efforts are more
appreciated than they are across the line
in the great republic to the south of us.
It is my pleasure to go frequently into
that country, and I believe, honourable
gentlemen, that the people of that country
appreciate more than they ever did before
the position which we occupy. But when
you stop to think, it is not to be wondered
at, that those nations whose boys journeyed
together down to the valley of death to
safeguard for us and for future generations
the liberties and the freedom of the democracy that the centuries of the past had won
for us should from this day forth regard
themselves as brothers, sealed in a bond
of blood, who will not sell back again for
untold gold that which their sons purchased
with their lives. We have placed ourselves
before the nations of the world in the proud
position of being one of the most prosperous and progressive young nations that
God's sun in heaven shines upon to-day.
I listened with great pleasure the other
day to my honourable friend who spoke
of the transportation question of this
country. I sat in silence waiting to see if
he would touch upon what the Government
of this.country succeeded in doing in transporting our armies across the great Atlantic

S-8j

ocean and back again. Why, honourable
gentlemen, they made for themselves a
record that I think will never be surpassed
by the people of any other nation in the
world. And the debt that we owe to General Mewburn and his staff for the safe
transportation of those troops is beyond
anything I can say to you at this time.
But that is not all the Union Government
succeeded in doing, I care not by what
standard of efficiency you may see fit to
measure them.
The people of Canada established what
I think might during the war be termed
a world record-I care not from what
viewpoint you judge them, whether from
the viewpoint of loyalty, patriotism, or
citizenship.
Speaking .of the loyalty of our people,
I ask you what nation in the world displayed more loyalty to the mother land
than Canada. In August, 1914, when the
great German Emperor in his wisdom saw
fit to declare war the mother land sent
forth her far-flung battle cry to her overseas colonies and dominions. What was
the response of Canada's loyal sons? Why,
honourable gentlemen, they.came forward
in such great numbers that the Government of this country found it impossible
to fully equip and train them before sending them overseas. From whence did they
come?
They came from the far West,
from the shores of the sun-kissed Pacific,
they came from the west and north of the
great Rocky Mountain ranges, and from
the three great grain and cattle producing
provinces of the plains; and old Ontario
sent ber quota, as well as the other eastern
provinces down by the sea. Yes, honourable gentlemen, that was the best indication of the loyalty of the people of this
country.
Now, if you want to judge the Canadian
people from their patriotism, I ask you
where will you find a better standard than
the one they set in the contribution of
vast amounts of money to the mother
country and for the relief of our own boys
overseas?
I believe the people of this
country have for their ideal as high a standard of citizenship as is to be found in
any country in the world. After twelve
years practical experience in public life, I
have come to the conclusion that Canada's
greatest need to-day is not more politicians
but more real statesmen-men of vision,
men of confidence, men who possess a soul.
They must have a vision that is wider than
the interests of any ole political party;
they must be men who in such a crisis as

SENATE
that through which we have just passed
can come out from their own political
party and serve their country as patriots,
They must be men of
not partizans.
vision, men who possess a soul that throbs
for the welfare of our people. With such
men and with the many advantages that
Canada possesses, if honestly and fairly
governed, and with her boundless resources,
if properly conserved, in my humble opinion she is bound to maintain the high and
exalted position which she has attained,
and still be known as the chief overseas
Dominion in that fabric of construction
which goes to make up the great British
Empire-the Empire whose drum-beat encircles the world, the Empire on which
God's sun in heaven never sets. Such is
the Empire to which Canada belongs.
What a heritage for a free-born Canadian
to possess-an Empire whose flag, wherever it has been planted, stands for the
same purpose: truth, freedom, and justice
to all!
Speaking of the efforts of this Government, from whatever viewpoint you regard
them-whether in men, money or the
think,
munitions which they furnishedhonourable gentlemen, I have said sufficient to establish that they proved to be the
master men of a great young nation. As
to Canada's record in the war, she furnished the vastest army that came from
any country of the same population. She
has paid the price of nationhood both in
blood and treasure, with the result that
to-day there are sleeping in the fields of
France and Flanders nearly 60,000 of
Canada's loyal sons.
They sleep there
quietly, honourable gentlemen, but their
devotion and patriotism to a great ideal
still lives and will continue to live so long
as the maple leaf is permitted to endure.
Another gentleman who made a record
for himself during the war is the exFinance Minister, Sir Thomas White. He
bas made his name immortal by the happy
thought of borrowing from our own people
the money required to finance our war
effort. I think, honourable gentlemen, that
to him belongs a great share of the credit
for the position which Canada occupies
to-day. The honourable gentleman from
Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) yesterday
spoke of the situation that existed in the
Western provinces. If it had not been for
the ability of our ex-Minister of Finance
I fear that the great wheat production of
Canada, as well as the dairy production,
would have been of no avail. But Sir
Thomas White by his own efforts solved
Hon

Mr. WEBSTER.

the problem, by borrowing from our own
people the money necessary to finance the
wheat industry-and surely, honourable
gentlemen, his efforts were successful. His
efforts were so successful, honourable
gentlemen, that to-day Canada stands in
as good if not in a better position than
any of the Allied nations.
Now that the war is over it is the duty
of Canada's public men to divert their
attention to other things, and to do what
they can to help develop the public resources with which our country bas been
so bountifully blessed. We have resources
almost innumerable. The brief time that
I have at my disposal will not permit me
to mention but very few of them. I spoke
last Session of the development of Canada's great water powers, which are knowr,
as our "white coal." We have other resources awaiting development.
I hope
honourable gentlemen, to see that develop
ment accomplished at no distant date.
Probably one of Canada's greater needs
to-day is immigration-immigration of
men of the right type-and I am hoping
that the Government of this country will
encourage immigration from the British
Isles, because it is our object to keep thiE
country part and parcel of the great British
Empire.
The honourable gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) spoke yesterday
of the probable results of the Fordney Bill.
I do not look upon the Fordney Bill as seriously as my honourable friend does.
Possibly the working out of that Bill may
prove to Canada a blessing in disguise. I
am not a very old man, but I can remember
when the American Government in 1876
saw fit to erect a high tariff wall against
Canadian dairy products. The people of
the United States were producers of the
same line of dairy products as were the
Canadians. What was the result? We
found a market for our dairy products in
Great Britain; and here let me say-and
I say it with great pride-that no nation
in the world furnishes Britain with a higher quality of dairy products than the
Dominion of Canada.
Now, to speak of the wheat problem. I
talked to one of the representatives of the
great Pillsbury Mills of Minneapolis the
other day, and he told me that the gentleman who introduced the Fordney Bill did
not understand the situation. He said:
"We must have a certain amount of Canada's No. 1 Northern hard wheat mixed
with our softer grain or else we must give
up the European market to your Canadian
people."
That man was practical; he

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
clearly understood the necessity of having
Canada's hard wheat in order to raise the
standard of the low-grade fiour made from
the soit wheat of the United States. That
possibly may be the solution of that particular question. That Bill, no matter from
what point you may view it, may yet result
in improving the standard of our wheat
going across the line.
There is another matter that I should
like to bring to the attention of the Government, and that is the embargo on our cattle
going to Great Britain. Whilst Great Britain rejoices in the fact that she lives under free trade, that cattle embargo is only
another form of protection. It is well
kilown by the producers of cattle in this
country that our cattle have no pleuropneumonia. If this cattle embargo remains
it only remains for the protection of the
producers of cattle in the old land. I think
the Dominion Government and the provincial Governments should take steps to have
that embargo removed at no distant date,
and if they do so our cattle industry will
not suffer by the introduction of the Fordney Bill.
I said that Canada's future lay in the
development of her resources; but at the
same time I claim that if we have the
right kind of public men-men who can
see the interests of this great Dominion
which extends for 3,000 miles from coast
to coast-there will be no East nor West
but one solid front from the Atlantic to
the Pacific, one Canada which is our native
home.
I know that the people of the West think
Canada is suffering because the manufacturers are established in the East; but I
hope to see at no distant time some large
manufacturers establishing themselves at
some points in the West where they can
obtain fuel cheaply, as they can in the
province of Alberta. There is no reason
why a few progressive manufacturers in
that country could not produce everything
necessary for the settlers of that country.
Canada to-day enjoys many advantages
which are not enjoyed by some of the countries which participated in the great war.
We have heard within the last three days
some complaints in regard to Canada's
merchant marine. . No less an authority
than Admiral Von Tirpitz, the man
who was going to sink the British
fleet with submarines, admits what?
That the Grand Fleet of Great Britain
was the means of winning the war. Sir,
I quite agree with him, and whilst production on a larger scale was engaged in

during the war, it would have been useless
had it not been for Canada's geagraphical
position, for we would not have been able
to transport our productions to Britain,
where they found a ready market. But
now that the war is over and the dove of
peace has unfolded her wings and spread
them over the warring nations, Canada
stands out pre-eminently before the world
as the one nation that went into this fight
not from compulsion but from the lotier
motive of obtaining justice,' liberty, and
freedom for the smaller nations. I know
that every good loyal Canadian will rejoice with me to know that that same old
flag that has continued to brave the battle
and the breeze for the past thousand years
is still permitted to float proudly from the
mizzenmast of England's Grand Fleet, and
from her position there will announce to
the nations of the world that England is
still mistress of the seas and that Britannia
rules the waves, and I trust she may*continue to do so.
Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, I have no desire or
intention to make a speech upon the Address; but I want to read, if I may be
allowed, an article which summarizes an
exhaustive statement made by the Guaranty Trust Company of New York regarding German trade. I wish to do so because I interested myself in a Bill which
was defeated here at the last Session, in
connection with which I made some remarks on what I thought would come to this
country in the future by reason of the depreciation of the mark in foreign countries. I think this article is one of real
value, as it conveys some interesting and
desirable information to this country. It
says:
It was stated by a British official not long
ago that "Germany is still a perfect industrial
machine, running at low speed it is true, but
undamaged as yet in its vital parts, and would
respond readily to any stimulus." This opinion
is supported by the Guaranty Trust Company of
New York, which bas just issued an exhaustive
statement on "German plans to extend foreign
trade." It is declared that from the armistice
in November, 1918, until March, 1920, an enormous volume of goods was smuggled out of

are swarming, not only in fbrmer neutral countries, but in ail other European and in all Asiatic countries.
They offer low prices, long
credits, and quicker deliveries.
It is estimated that sales of German toys

silk embroidered, are offered in Nottingham
at a lower price than the cost off manufacture in
that centre of the British lace industry. According to the Secretary of the National Union
of Manufacturers, many articles are offered for
sale in Great Britain at half the price for which
they can be obtained from British makers. German tools are offered at four shillings each
which cost fifteen shillings in London. "Bosch"
magnetos are offered at £5 each in cases of
five which cannot be purchased in England for
less than £12. Three or four ton lorries are
quoted at £600, for which British dealers require double that figure.
Children's rackets from Germany sell for
72 shillings a gross, as compared with the
British price of 156 shillings. A three-quart
kettle of British manufacture sells at three shillings and ninepence, and the German kettle at
sixpence.
German scissors are sold at nine
shillings a dozen and those of British manufacturc at twenty shillings; German pianos at £70
which could not be purchased in England for
twice the money, and German milling machines
at £'75 which cost £108 to manufacture in
Great Britain. A railway in Argentine asked
for quotations for 10,000 car wheels. The low
bid from the United States was $45.50 each, as
against $18.31 by the Krupp firm in Germany.
In Mexico German hardware sells 25 per cent
below American prices.
A multitude of other instances could be
cited to show the danger of the situation which
tas been created by low exchange. cheaper
German labor and the reorganization of German industries. In ahl the neutral countries of
Europe there is a demand for more stringent
legislation against German "dumping."
The
Stockholm Iron Institute. of Swelen, demands
that duties against Germany be increased by
500 per cent. The Swedish electrical industries
declare that cost of production in Germany is
between two-fifths and two-thirds the cost of
production in Sweden.
Holland is alarmei
over German competition.
German goods are
again pouring into the Argentine and Brazil.
It is stated that "a growing volume of imports
from Germany is reported at Chinese ports."
Japan has strengthened its regulations against
"dumping," and ail round the world the nations are arming themselves with defensive
measures against trarle rivals until the stern,
sore, tard effects of the war are overcome.
It is necessary to the restoration of stable
world conditions that German industries should
be re-established and her goods purchased by
other countries.
But other countries cannot
neglect the interests of their own factories and
their own workers.
Reconstruction is still a
difficult problem even in Canada, in Great
Britain and in the United States.
With the
prospect of new legislation in Britain to protect
key industries, a certain increase of tariff in
the United States, and higher duties in Australia, South Africa, Japan and nearly ail European countries, it is remarkable that in Canada
alone, where rates of tariff are lower than in
many other countries there should be such a
determined agitation to expose Canadian factories and Canadian workers to still more severe competition from the exchange-aided industries of Europe and the manut'acturers of the
United States when the balance of trade against
us in our dealings with the adjoining country
is already five hundred millions of dollars.

I might say, in addition, that I think
it is the duty of this Government to
Hon. -Mr. LYNCH-STAU'NTON.

protect the people of this country against
all countries where there is an extraordinary depreciation in the value of their
currency; and I think that, in ascertaining
the price paid for goods imported from
foreign countries, the currency of the country whence goods are purchased should be
valued at the price at which it was taken
immediately preceding the war. If we will
not so mark the goods which come from
a foreign country as made in that country,
we certainly should not allow foreign
goods to come in at nominal prices,
if we have a tariff which is built for
the express"purpose of protecting our industries. That we should have a tariff
any person who has lived in Canada for
his lifetime, if he has reached middle life,
must know. We have had an experience of
forty years under a tariff, and we had an
experience of forty years before the tariff.
Since 1878 Canada has put on all the
growth she ever put on. Before 1878 for
forty years Canada was stagnant; and
how any person can desire now to aim a
blow at the tariff for the purpose of getting into power passes my understanding.
The motion for the Address was agreed
to.
GOLD AND SILVER MARKING BILL.
SECOND

READING.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON moved
the second reading of Bill C, an Act to
amend The Gold and Silver Marking Act.
He said: I would like to make a remark
or two in moving the second reading of
this Bill, in order that it may be understood by the House. The Gold and Silver
Marking Act, in section 10, provides for the
marking of rolled gold plate, rolled silver
plate, silver-filled plate, etc. I will just
read the section:
1. This section applies only to plated articles
wholly or partly composed of the materials
known to the trade as "rolled gold plate," "gold
filled," "gold electro-pite," "rolled silver-plate,"
"silver filled," "silver electro-pîlate," or of such
materials of like nature as are defined and designated by regulations made by the Governor
in Council.
2. There shall not be applied to any such
article any mark other than a mark authorized
by this section.
3. If any such article has applied to it any
mark it must have applied to it a trade mark
registered in accordance with The Trade Mark
and Design Act.
4. In addition to such trade mark there may
be applied ail or any of the following marks:
(a) a mark indicating truly and correctly,
in accordance with the provisions of subsection
1 of this section, the designation, as known to
the trade or as established by regulation aforespid, of the material;

FEBRUARY 24, 1921
(b) numerals intended to identify the article or pattern and not calculated to mislead
or deceive;
(c) the name or initiais of a dealer.

Rolled gold plate, in watch chains for
example, may be nine-tenths lead and
onte-tenth gold, or it may be ninety-six per
cent lead and four per cent gold; and
there is no mark by which a purchaser can
tell whether it is nine-tenths or one-tenth
gold, or what per cent of gold it contains.
I arn instructed that a chain which bas ten
per cent of gold will last forever with a
gold appearance. A chain which bas two
per cent of gold will last perhaps for six
months. They are both put before the
public, and dealers are allowed to sell both
at the same price, and the purchaser cannot tell what he is getting. A firm of higli
repute could put upon the market those
articles with a very low percentage of gold.
Now, what is desired is that the makers of
those articles may be allowed to stamp on
them the percentage of gold or silver, as
the case may be, that they contain. So this
Bill proposes to add to subsection 4 of section
10 of the Act the following paragraph,
which says that in addition to ail or any of
the marks mentioned, there may be applied
this:
(d) a mark
the fineness of
article and the
weight. at the
livered by the

indicating truly and correctly
the gold and of the silver in the
proportion of each to the gross
time the article is sold or demaker.

Honourable gentlemen will notice that
nobody is bound to, but every person may,
put that mark on the goods, and I thinkc
it will commend itself to every gentleman
in this Chamber. The Department of
Tirade and Commerce bas been consulted,
and I understand that they are quite in
favour of this amendment to the Act. I
therefore move the second reading of this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: How will the public
decide?
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGH-EED: I am
not opposed to the principle of the Bill, but
I should like to obtain some further information as to whether the Department of
Tirade and Commerce bas given full consideration to the Bill, because I recall that
this Act some few Sessions ago was productive of a great deal of controversy.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Not on
this.
Hon. Sur JAIMES LOUCHEED: No, thih
of course is entirely a new feature, and 1

simply rose to say that while the House
might agree to the principle of the Bill, this
being the second reading, yet I should like
to consuit the Department of Trade and
Commerce as to whether representations
had been made by the tirade that this Bil
would be agreeable to the manufacturiflg
section of the trade.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: 1 may
say to the honourable the leader that I
was told by the gentlemen who asked me
to introduce this Bill that it had been submnitted, and I have taken it up with the
Law Clerk, and he has advised me as to
what took place. As the honourable the
leader says, there was a great deal of controversy about the Act; but it was because
when this section 10 was introduced no
person could define what was meant by
rolled gold, rolled gold plate, or rolled
silver plate. So it was made as understood in the tirade or as settled by the Governor in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
we go into committee we can deal with
that.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes, 1
amn only introducing it in the belief and
on the understanding that it is approved
by the Department.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: 1 was going to ask
how the purchasing public would understand the cabalistic marks that would be
put upon jewellery 'or other products in
the tirade.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I amn
not *an expert, but I understand that the
percentage of gold and the fineness of gold
will be marked so, that he who runs may
read. That is my understanding of it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
will have to put a pretty big sign on it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

P.E.I. RAILWAY AND CANADIAN
NATIONAL SYSTEM
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. MURPHY inquired of the Government:
Why is the Prince Edward Island Railway
not classified as part of the Canadian National
Railway System, and why are the expenses of
the car ferry systemn specially charged to the
Prince Edward Island Railway, and why are
the expenses of the car ferry between Mulgrave and Point Tupper charged to the Canadian National Raibway System?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Prince Edward Island Railway is a part
of the old Canadian Government Railways
System and as sucb is a part of the Canadian National Railways. At the time this
ferry service was inaugurated, it was decided by the management that the Prince
Edward Island Railway would get credit
for ahi earnings accruing from the ferries
and be charged with ail expenses for operation. As the car ferry was put in service
principally for the benefit of the Island, it
is considered proper that the operations
shouhd be included in that part of the
System.
The car ferries operating between Muigrave and Point Tupper are
considered part of the Truro-Sydney
Division, and the expenses and earnings of
said ferries are therefore included in the
operation results of said division.

largely identified in the development of
business and other interests in that progressive province. For a number of years
be was a prominent member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, and
while in that Assembly had attached himself deeply to bis fellow-members with
whom he was associated. His sudden taking-off in the heyday of life was a loss
to bis adopted province and likewise to
this Chamber.
The death of Senator McSweeney on the
2nd February, a few days before the opening of this Session, came to us with surprise and regret. Although be, like Senator Douglas, had exceeded the allotted span
of life by many years, yet we were not prepared to hear of bis sudden demise. He
had been a member of this Chamber for
twenty odd years and during that time
enjoyed not only the respect but the affection of those with whom be was associated.
He was a peculiarly representative man in
bis native province. He was one of the
successful merchants of Canada. He laid
the foundations of and built up a prosperous and successful business, which is
fairly well known throughout the Dominion.
He was -a man of great public enterprise
and was closely associated with the leading
institutions of the city and province to
which e belonged. While in this Chamber
he did not speak frequently from bis place
on the floor of the House, yet his views on
all public questions were received with respect and confidence. His experience and
judgment on questions and problems affecting the various measures which from time
to time commanded the attention of the
House were of valuable assistance to this
Chamber in its deliberations. It is owing
to representative business men such as the
late Senator McSweeney that this Chamber
to a very large extent commands the confidence of the public and our deliberations
and judgment are regarded as of value in
the transaction of public business.
As I recall the names of those Senators
whom I have mentioned, and cast my mind
back to our sittings of last Session, I can
visualize those five members sitting in their
places, interested in the business of the
House, participating in our activities and
reasonably confident that there were before
them future years of usefulness. Their
taking-off within the short time since we
were last assembled reminds us of the uncertainty of life and of what shadows we
are and what shadows we pursue. I am
warranted in saying that the Senate of
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Canada recalls with pleasure their presence during their many years of life with
us, and records our deep regret at their loss.
We convey to their sorrowing families and
immediate friends the deepest sympathy
which we feel in their bereavement and loss.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, I desire to add a few words to
what has been so well and ably said by my
honourable friend as to the loss that the
Senate has suffered through the death of
the five senators to whom he bas referred.
I personally was very much shocked when
I heard of the death of Senator Dennis.
I had no idea at the end of last session
that he was suffering to the degree that
he appatently was, and that he had to undergo an operation. He was a man who
impressed his personality on all the m!mbers of the Senate, especially those with
whom he came in contact, and they iealized that he was a public-spirited man
who took his work in the Senate seriously
and was always trying to promote the
welfare of the country. His services as
a public man were recognized in bis own
part of the country when be raised the

sum of $10,000

to

erect in Halifax a

monument to the Nova Scotia heroes who
feil in the South African war. He was
on one. occasion thanked by the Viceroy
of India and others when bis newspaper
raised the sum of $15,000 for the faminestricken people of India. He was interested also in raising the sum of $13,500 to
send to Japan, where the crops had failed,
in the year 1906. Those incidents show
the great interest that Senator Dennis
took, not only in bis own country, but
also in the things that affected the EmIt
pire and other parts of the world.
sbowed the largeness of heart of a man
who, while so busy with bis own work,
and, as my honourable friend (Hon. Sir
James Lougheed) bas said, so successful
as a business man, yet had time to devote
himself to matters apart from the pursuit
of bis own affairs. I am sure that we all
regret very much the loss that this Senate
bas suffered in his death.
Senator Douglas had lived, as my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
has said, more than the allotted span of life,
but bis also was a life that was full of
work for bis country. Not. only did he
perform the duties of a clergyman, but
he was qualified aiso as a medical man,
and when be went to the Northwest he
was prominent in the agricultural life of

MARCH 1, 1921
that country, He did a great deal, by
the example that he set to other stockraisers, in improving the quality of stock
in the Northwest. In every way bis work
was of benefit to the country.
Senatur Prince was also a man of very
.urge interests in Canada. Coming as ha
did, in the first instance, from the province
of Quebec, he brought to bear on the
development of the western country a
different point of view from that of people
who bad corne in ftrm other parts of the
world. His work in the Northwest, in the
early development of the country bas
been of great advantage to Canada. He
served in 1885 in the Northwest rebellion,
was mayor of Battleford a number of
times, and otberwise lu various ways was
prorninent in the if e of the country.
As my bonourable frleud bas said, Senator Sbatford was born in Nova Scotia,
and very early in life went out to tbe province fromn which 1 corne. H1e was particularly promineut in the development of
what is known as the upper country. 11e
was engaged successfully in business 1it
his brothers and other members of bis
farnily, and did much in helping to develop
the country known as tbe Okanagan valley,
especially in the fruit industry. After
haviug carried out a very considerable development there, Senator Shatford went
to Vancouver, where he became largely
interested in various linos of business and
in promoting the general development of
British Columbia. For a number of years
he was one of the most popular members
of tbe legislature of that *province. H1e
came to the Senate only three years ago,
but I tbiuk every Senator wbo was acquainted witb hlm realized that bis work
was of value to the Senate and to tbe
country, and mnust very much regret that
he was eut off in the prime of life, aud
that we no longer have hirn arnongst us.
Senator McSweeney was a member of
this Chamber for the space of twenty-two
years, and was a verSj useful and capable
inember. H1e was an Irisbrnan by descent,
and I might say he was the right kind
of an Irishman, who took a great interest
in this coûntry of his adoption. 11e was a
prominent man of business, and a man of
cheerful disposition and happy manner
which. made for hlm many friends.
We on this side of the House join in the
expressions of sympatby for the familles
and relatives of tbose gentlemen, and of
regret at the loss that this Chamber has
suffered ln their death.

ACCOMMODATION FOR SENATORS
IN HOUSE 0F COMMONS
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr,. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I would like to find out what
rights a Senator has over in the House of
Commons. Last week I was brought to
tirne twice for no great offence-no offence
of any kind, so far as I know. I was sitting in the Senators' gallery, in which al
the seats were occupied. A lady came in,
and I gave hier. my seat and stood at the
back against the wall, when an officiai
came up and said, "I arn very sorry, sir,
but you cannot stand there." I said, "Who
said I could not stand here 7" He said, "An
officiai down below sent up word." I will not
say what my answer was. I do not like to
be subi ected to that sort of thing. Again,
yesterday 1 was in the rear corridor of
the building at the House of Commons end,
and wanted to walk into the gallery, and as
1 passed through the corridor on this side
of the Commons chamber-a great wlde
corridor that runs along the full length
of the Chamber-a man came up to me,
very politely, I must say; and said, "Are
you a member of the House of Commons?"
I said, "No." He said, "Well, you can't
corne here." I said, "I arn a senator."
"That; does not make any difference; you
can't corne in here; I arn very sorry, but
my instructions are not to allow any Senators in here." I do flot want to suggest any
retaliation; I think that would be beneath
use; but
the dignity of this honourable H9«
it does seemi to rne curious if a member
of the Parliament of Canada cannot pass
through the corridors alongside the House
of Commons Chamber, or cannot stand
up inl his own gallery with his back against
the Wall when there is no place for him to
sit down. 1 think, Mr. Speaker, it is your
duty and the duty of the leader of the
Governrnent to see if something cannot be
done to remedy this state of aif airs. It
is most unsatisfactory, and unbecorning
to the dignity of the Senate, that its members should be treated lu that way.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I may say that I
had a similar experience in going through
that lobby that7 the honourable gentleman
has just referred to. I said I was not a
member of the House of Commons, but was
a Senator, if that counted for anything.
He said, "No, it doesn't count for anything."
I retired.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Senators often
want to go to our gallery to listen to the

124

SENATE

speeches. Several times I have had to
stand for a long time, all the seats being
occupied, I do not know by whom, but
evidently not by Senators. I think the
messenger in charge of the Senators' gallery in the House of Commons should be,
as in the olden days, one belonging to this
House, and knowing who belongs to the
Senate. I have seen many people there
who, though they might be very desirable
people, did not seem to take the interest
in the debates that some of us would have
taken; and that gallery is very small,
and has not very many seats anyway.
Senators may want to go and listen to a
debate, perhaps in view of a discussion
that is going to take place later in this
House, and I think they should have an
opportunity of getting a proper seat, and
not having the gallery filled with people
who have nothing sto do with the Senate.
I trust that the Speaker of this House and
also the leader will see that in future
the messenger in charge of the Senators'
gallery will be one who belongs to this
House, so that he will know who are Senators, or who are not.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
I have much
sympathy with the fighting member for
Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff).
He bas
announced himself as a fighting member
of this House, and I think he is progressive
in this matter anyway. When I first came
into this House I had occasion to make a
complaint similar to what my honourable
friend from Assiniboia has made to-night.
I went there one evening with some gentlemen who were not quite as vigorous or as
able to take care of themselves as I was,
and I saw them trying to obtain a proper
position. One of them was Senator Forget,
who complained, and I said, "I will get
you there, and I can stand back and listen."
We made a complaint-it was in the old
House before the fire-and there was an
improvement. But really I must say the
situation is ridiculous, and I do not know
that it is altogether attributable to the
officials in charge; I think possibly some of
it might be taken. to heart by ourselves.
I know members who go in there and fill
up the seats. It is true, as has been said,
that they have put us off into a corner,
and given us about half the number of
seats that we had last year. We go there
to listen to the debates and come to a
reasonable conclusion on the discussions
that are taking place in the House of Commons. When we are not in session ourselves I think that is our duty. But we
have not room enough there, and in my
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

opinion a good many gentlemen are lacking
in courtesy to their fellow Senators for
the reason that they fill up the seats with
men and women who come from outside
and are only there for the time being,
and who should not fill the places that
are designated for us-which, indeed, are
only about one-fifteenth of what we should
be given in order to have a reasonable
chance to listen to the discussions pro
and con from Opposition and from Government, and then to come to a proper conclusion in this House. I think the honourable gentleman bas proven himself a progressive by bringing up this matter, and
I believe that we should have a proper
opportunity of listening to the debates in
the other House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: During the
last Session I had occasion to meet the
Speaker of the House of Commons several
times, and asked for the largest space
possible. The Speaker assured me that he
would do all that he could to satisfy the
Senate. I also agree that we should have
a messenger from the Senate to be there,
a man who knows all the Senators. But
I must remark, at the same time, that if
members of the Senate go there with five
or six friends, men or women, the messenger is placed in a very serious position,
for he will perhaps be unable to find seats
for gentlemen who belong to the Senate,
and as a matter of course the wives and
daughters of Senators, who have a right
to go there. Ladies now have the vote, and
therefore we must be prepared to recognize
them. But I will see the Speaker once
more, and we will do the best we can.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow
at 3 p.m.

CONSIDERATION OF DIVORCE
PETITIONS
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT presented the
tenth report of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, and moved that this report be
taken into consideration to-morrow.
Hon. L. G. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, it has not been the practice in the
Senate to take these reports of the Divorce

MARCH 2, 1921
Committee into consideration on the day
after they are presented. The rule has
been to allow some reasonable time, say
four or five days, to elapse from the time
the report is presented until it is taken into
consideration; and the reason of that is
plain enough on the face of it. In some
cases the evidence in these divorce matters
may be rather long-winded, or it may be
contradictory. I think that the members of
the Senate should have reasonable opportunity at their leisure to read over the
evidence and consider the propriety of
granting the relief which is asked for.
I noticed that yesterday there were five
reports from the Committee, and after the
entry in our Minutes of the presentation of
the reports there was entered the fact that
the rule.had been suspended. The evidence
was practically shut out from the consideration of members of this House. There
may. have been some good reason for that,
but it has not been explained to us. I
regret that my hearing is not as acute
as it was some time ago. Clearly we should
be careful about these divorce cases. The
Committee on Divorce, particularly under
the chairmanship of the honourable gentle.
man from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)!
had established a reputation which put it
I think, on the level of any Court in th(
country; but that reputation was gained by
the fact that the Committee, and the House
in some cases, took time and were deliberate
in making up their minds as to whether the
evidence justified the granting of the
petition or not. I for one object very
strenuously to our taking these reports into
consideration on the day after they are
presented. Yesterday we did not have even
the one day's notice. I think that these
reports should not be taken into consideration, at any rate, before the beginning of
next week.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
gentlemen, I remember perfectly well that
during the last two or three Sessions several days have been granted for the consideration of these reports by the honourable members of this House; but this has
always been done on the advice of the
Chairman of the Divorce Committee, because by rule 24h there is only one day's
notice required "for the adoption of a
report, not merely formal in its character,
from any standing committee." According
to our rules, one day's notice is certainly
sufficient. But, as I have already renarked, during the last few sessions many
days have been granted, but it bas been at

the request of the Chairman of the Divorce
Committee. I presume that if to-morrow
somebody objects to the adoption of this
report on the ground that members have
not had time enough to study the question,
the Senate will grant a few days more for
consideration of the matter.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Honourable gentlemen, I have no feeling in this matter at all,
but I think the honourable gentleman from
Halifax, (Hon. Mr. Power) has very good
grounds for the objection he bas taken. I
am unequivocally opposed to divorce, and
for that reason perhaps would not be an
impartial judge. The Committee's report
is in the hands of the Senate: as to that I
defer to the honourable gentleman from
Halifax, who bas been here longer than I
have. I feel that under the circumstances
we are the last stage in seeing whether
justice is done or is not done, and while, of
course, we never object to the ruling of
His Honour the Speaker, I think the point
of the honourable gentleman from Halifax
is well taken.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Honourable
gentleman, so far as I am concerned, I have
not any objection, and I do not suppose
the members of the Committee have any,
to mnore than one day being given for the
consideration of these reports. But I have
yet to learn of any honourable gentleman
taking the trouble to carefully consider the
evidence that has been given. If, however,
it is the desire of the House that a longer
time should be given, I have no objection.
The motion was agreed to, on division.

FOR SENATORS
IN HOUSE OF COMMONS
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
gentlemen, in pursuance of the discussion
which took place in this House yesterday,
I had the honour to meet with His Honour
the Speaker of the House of Commons this
morning. We discussed the question of the
space to be allowed to Senators in the
House of Commons' gallery. He desired a
little time to consider the matter, saying
that he would write to me, and I have just
received a letter which will be read by the
Clerk.
The Clerk then read the letter as follows:

SENATE
HousE OF COMiONS CANADA,
SPEAIKER's OFFICE,
OTTAWA, March 2nd, 1921.

Dear Mr. Speaker: Since our conference this
morning I have had an interview with Lieut.Colonel Bowie, Sergeant-at-Arms of the House
of Commons, with respect to the use of the
Senate Gallery in the House of Commons chamber, and in view of the information which follows I am sure you will agree with me that it
is rather surprising that there should be any

which was inaugurated since I became Speaker,
on the advice of the Sergeant-at-Arms. and one
which, I may say, did not obtain under the
previous Sergeant-at-Arms, who declined to
have any Senate attendant in the precincts of

was effected solely with a view to the convenience of the Senate and sometimes at the
inconvenience of the House of Commons and
its organization. Your body therefore bas full
control of the space allotted, which I beg to
especially bring to your attention comprises
thirty-six seats whvereas in the old House of
Commons' chamber there were but twenty-four,
this notwithstanding the fact that the present
House of Commons chamber contains 177 seats
less in the galleries tlian existed in the old
building.
May I further with all deference bring to
your attention the fact that the over-crowding
in your gallery is due to the large number of
visitors who are placed in the gallery by memI have frequently seen

members of the Senate bring in two, three.
and, in one instance. five persons. not one of
whom was the wife, daughter, son, or member
of the family of the Senator in question. I am
sure that if a little more care were exercised
in respect to the use of the gallery there wouul
be little or no difficulty. There have been one
or two complaints on the part of the members
of the Senate who, when seen standing, were
requested at the instance of the Sergeant-tArms to take a seat. The Sergeant-atAris
informs me that it bas been a rule, to bis
knowledge, for thirty years that no one should
be permitted to stand in the galleries. I know
from my own experience that this rule bas obtained in the past in your Chamber, and I recall
particularly being ordered to take a seat myself on one occasion when I bad risen for but
a moment. I found no fault at the time, much
less did it occur to me to refer ta the matter
in the House of Commons, because I realized
that it was esseutial for the quiet and order of
the Chamber that all occupants of the gallerles sbould remain seated. I am not aware that
a rule of this character could be successfully
carried out if exception were made in the case
of members of the Senate. In those rare cases
where the space allotted is legitimately overtaxed. I shall bc very happy to endeavour to
provide a seat, if space is available, in either
the Sýpeaker's Gallery, the Reserved Gallery.
or any other available suitable space in the
House of Commons Chamber.
I have also to say that it is the desire of
the House of Commons ta extend every.courtesy to members of your body and to make
every possible provision for their comfort and
convenience.
May I in conclusion respectfulliy suggest
that it would be only just to the House of
Commons if any member of your body, who

feels he bas suffered any undue inconvenience
or indignity, would be so considerate as to take
the matter up with yourself instead of making
public announcement in the Senate, a report
of which is published in the newspapers and a
wrong impression created, when the whole
matter could be adjusted satisfactorily and
without difficulty.
Yours faithfully,
EDGAR M. RHODES,
Speaker of the House of Commons.
Honourable JosEPH BOLDUc,
Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa, Ont.

Hon. Mr. TESSIER: Take a lesson fron'

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:

said about Senators walking in the corri.
dors?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: We talked of
that matter at the same time, and the
Speaker of the House of Commons told me
that Le would be able to give me an answer
in regard to that to-morrow or the day
after.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: As one of the members who supported the honourable gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff)

last night, I must say that probably the
fault is with ourselves. The same thing
occurred some six or seven years ago, when
gentlemen of this Chamber went into the
gallery of the House of Commons and took
their friends in, leaving the gallery full, so
that when the honourable gentleman from
Assiniboia or the honourable gentleman
from Montreal went in there was no place
for him. I mentioned a personal experience
last night in reference to my honourable
friend Mr. Forget. I said: "I will get you
a seat; I can stand up." The seats at that
time were occupied by five or six or seven
or eight friends of the Senators who had
taken them into the gallery of the old
House. I had gone in to hear an important
speech-I am not going to dignify the man
making it by giving his name-and as all
the seats were filled, I went over and stood
behind the Press Gallery where a gentleman came to me and said that I was going
to be called down for standing there. I
said: "You send the official to me." However, as I said in the beginning, I think
the fault is largely with ourselves.
Hon Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, it is very regrettable that this incident Las taken place, and it is very regrettable that it was aired in this House
at a time when the House was open to the
public. It should have been done before
the doors were opened, and then members

MARCH 2, 1921
would not have been placed in the position
which they now occupy by reason of that
very clever letter of the Speaker of the
House of Commons. We find ourselves in
the position of having made a complaint
which has no foundation in fact, and, as
I say, the Speaker of the House of Commons has scored very cleverly. Whenever
this House has a grievance against the other
House, I would most respectfully suggest
that it be taken up behind closed doors
and threshed out so that we may get rid
of the chaff and shall have nothing but
pure wheat when we present our complaint.
If that is done, we shall not be placed in
the humiliating position in which we are
now placed by this very clever letter of the
Speaker of the House of Commons.
THE SESSIONAL INDEMNITY
QUESTION OF INTERPRETATION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I would like to know
what interpretation is to be given to clause
35 of the Act relating to Sessional Indemnity. I think it is appropriate to ask what
it means. If I understand correctly what
has been said by the officers of this House,
the clause means that when the House
adjourns for three days or more the time
of the adjournment does not count in the
attendance of a member unless he is
present on the day of adjournment. Will
the honourable leader of the House be
kind enough to inform us what we are to
understand by that clause? If my understanding of it is correct, I think the law
ought to be changed, because anything
may happen to prevent a member from
attending on the eve of the adjournment.
Suppose an honourable member is coming
from British Columbia, something might
prevent him from being present on the
day of the adjournment, and thus a portion
of his indemnity would be deducted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I regret
very much that I am not in a position to
interpret the law for my honourable friend
It

has occurred to me, however, that since
this Act bas been placed upon the statute

scarcely expected. I have never seen a
statute cover so many situations. I know
of no condition under which' an honourable gentleman of the Senate can absent
himself without being at once confronted
by this statute, which requires him to be

it that would permit the Senate to part
company with any of its members during
the Session.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: The honourable
leader of the House must not forget that
a member must attend three-fourths of the
sittings of the House in order to get his
indemnity.
Yes,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
and I think that perhaps the draftsman
of the statute had that in view-.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would draw the
attention of my honourable friend from
Mille Iles to the fact that this statute was
framed after due deliberation.
In the
past there bas been a certain amount of
leeway allowed to honourable gentlemen
who were away because of personal sickness, or sickness in their family, or death,
or other serious cause: the amount was
put in the estimates and voted for them.
So it is up to this House and the House of
Commons to put that provision in this Act.
TRANSLATION

OF THE DFBATES
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I want to draw
the attention of the House to our Minutes
to-day. On page 47 I notice that a communication was handed in to His Honour
the Speaker in reference to the translation
of the Debates, and that it was referred
to the Internal Economy Committee.
While it is a matter involving a question
of expense, it seems to me that it should
also go before the Committee on Debates
and Reporting, because the question of the
capability of the man whom it is proposed
to engage to translate our Debates would
properly come before the Committee on
Debates and Reporting, and not before the
Internal Economy Committee.
I do not
see why it should be referred to the latter.
Hon. Mr. POWER: It affects the question of salary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
a question of. money: it is a contract: it
does not affect the Debates.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does the Internal
Economy Committee go into the question
of the qualification of this man to fulfil
his contract properly?
Of
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
course, I should say so. I might say to
my honourable friend that when the communication was presented it was referred
to the Internal Economy Committee.
I
have not looked into it myself, but I have
always been under the impression that

SENATE
contracts about to be entered into or to be
considered invariably go to that Committee. Perhaps at first blush one would be
under the impression that this should go
to the Debates Committee, but it does not
affect the Debates, because the translation
of the Debates will take place just the
same as hitherto. It is a question for the
Committee to consider whether it should
be let by contract or in any other way.
There is nothing, however, to prevent the
matter from going also before the Debates
It will probably be all the
Committee.
better if it is considered by both committees.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I may say in regard
to this matter that the precedents connected with such matters as this are altogether in favour of the report being referred to the Internal Economy Committee.
In 1917 the Clerk made a report to His
Honour the Speaker with respect to the
amenuenses of the Debates Reporters.
That report was referred to the Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts. Again in 1920 the Committee
recommended that the Clerk be authorized
to make the necessary arrangements for
the translation of the Senate Debates for
that Session. The Senate approved of that
recommendation, and the Clerk arranged
accordingly-arranged, as a matter of
fact, with the very gentleman to whom the
present reference relates. Bourinot states
that the proper procedure is to refer such
matters to the Internal Economy Committee. He says, at page 197:
This committee also considers and reports
upon .all matters which may be submitted to
it connected with the officials and business arrangements generally of the Senate.

I think that that includes the appointment, and recommendation regarding the
appointment, of the official to whom reference bas been made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I did not
notice the report when it was presented
yesterday; otherwise I would perhaps have
suggested that if there was anything appertaining to the Committee on Debates
and Reporting it was that report, because
it refers to the translation of the Debates,
and it concerns those members of the Senate
who need to read in their own language
what has been said in another language.
The reference to the Internal Economy
Committee throws upon that committee the
responsibility of satisfying itself as to the
qualifications of the party who submits
the present tender, because it is an offer of

a contract. I have just learned that there
was a contract last year, and that this is a
demand for its renewal. \The Internal
Economy Committee will have to do the
work that the Debates Committee would
have had to do, namely, enquire as to the
work that was done by the same party
last year, see if it was satisfactory, and
decide as to the proper remuneration. The
Debates Committee will nat have this resp'onsibility, that is all.
REVISION OF PUNISHMENTS BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion of Hon. Mr. McMeans, the
House went into Committee on Bill B, an
Act to amend the Criminal Code so as to
provide for the revision of excessive or
inadequate punishments. Hon. Mr. Gordon
in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I would like to ask
the honourable member from Winnipeg if
this was the Bill that was brought before
the House last year.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: This is precisely
the same Bill.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: When the Bill came
up last Session I objected to it for reasons
which I then stated. I would like to understand whether this Bill means that, if a
case bas been tried before a judge and
sentence pronounced by the presiding judge,
the case may be brought before a judge of
the Court of Appeal who bas not beard
the evidence and bas nothing but the notes
of the trial judge to guide him?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Then my objection is
that the appeal judge may not be in a
position to consider the sentence as well
as the original judge; therefore the trial
judge should deal with the matter. I do
not at all see the advantage to be derived
from the introduction of this Bill. No doubt
sometimes a sentence given by a judge may
be too heavy or too light, but errors are
committed by all of us, and who says that
the judge in appeal may not also make an
error?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to ask
the honourable member if on the trial of
criminal cases in Quebec the evidence is
not taken down by shorthand reporters.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: In most cases, yes,
but in a court held by a judge of the ses-

MARCH 2, 1921
sions the judge je authorized to write the
évidence himself.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Do these judges in
Sessions try indictable offences?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: This Bill does not
provide for the revision of ail sentences
that are pronounced iu a criminal court.
It provides that before any revision can
take place the applicant muet go to a
judge of the court of appeal and muet make
out a prima facie case before hlm. He
muet show that somne great error bas been
committed, otherwise the judge will refuse
to grant him leave to be heard. If, in the
opinion of the judge of the court of appea,
some error has been made, he may grant
leave that the court of appeal may look
into the matter and rectify any such error.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Error in law?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No, error in pronouncing sentence. The Bill was drafted
for the purpose of meeting exceptional
cases. Judges, however juet, ln trying cases
and senitencing prisoners often commit
errors. It does not happen ail the time.
1 amn not saying that the administration
of criminal justice is not as perfect ln
Canada as ln any country in the worid,
but I personally know cases in which
judgee have given sentences which they
would gladly have revised the next day if
they had the opportunity. There le not today in the British Empire any country
except Canada in which there is no appeal
in criminal matters.
This question came up in England somne
years ago, and it bas been pretty well discussed in this House. The English Government sent a commission to America to
find out what had been done there and,
after a great deal of hesitation, they established ln England a court of appeal for
Court bas

criminal cases, and
authority to re-try cases, and it can change
a sentence for murder. That court has
received the highest praise fromn the English
journais, including the London Times, and
there is no question that it bas wrought
a great deal of good and bas 'been very
beneficiai to the country at large. Our civil
courts of appeal wili sit perbape for two
or three days and listen to an appeal involving a sumn of $50; and if lu error
a man has received a sentence to penitentiary for corne offence which, under ordinary
circumetances, if >tried by another judge,
would not involve a sentence of more than

129

one year in jail, that man shouid have the
right to go to a judge of the court of appeal
and say, "This le a grievous mietake, and
we want to go bef ore the court of appeai
to rectify it." Surely there is no harmi in
that.
It must be remembered that police magistrates are appointed without any legal
training, in Ontario and the West, and
that their jurisdiction has been so much
enlarged that they can inflict very severe
sentences. 1 know of a case in which a
niagistrate in a city gave a sentence of
21 years for the stealing of an overcoat.
Fortunately for the individual whom. he
had sentenced, the magistrate had exceeded the maximum penalty laid down by
the Code, and the court of appeal raduced
it. In that case, if the magistrate had
flot made a mistake the man would stili
have to serve hie 21 years. It is unnecessary to multiply such instances.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does the honourable gentleman say that there le no appeal in criminal cases?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Not in the matter of sentences.
Don. Mr. FOWLER: You mean that
where the sentence has been pronounced
there le no appeal againet the eentence;
you do flot mean that there ie no appeal
againet the conviction?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There may be
an appeal on other grounds such as one
on the ground of no offence. 1 know of
a case in my own experience where a
echoolmaster was sentenced to six monthe
in jail for an- offence againet a young girl,
and a petition was largely signed by the
women of the country asking that the
judge who sentenced hlmi be dismissed
from the bench. Six monthe after that,
in a similar case, a man was given a sentence of seven years in the penitentiary.
I arn not saying that the man should not
have received that sentence, but I say
there was such a glaring difference in the
two sentences that in a case of that kind,
where a blunder ie made, there should be
some meane of rectifying it. I admit that
this Bill is defective, as it does not go far
enough.
There should be a court of
criminal appeal in Canada as there je in
England. There le not much hope of reformiing a nman who le locked up in a penitentiary under a sentence for a great
many years; he le gone.

EETIM UDrPixO

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Would it not be
better to refer the matter to a committee
of judges?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I think a bench
of four judges would be better than one.
When I first introduced this Bill I suggested that the Attorney General should
give the consent, but I think it was
the honourable member for Hamilton
who sug(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
gested that it should be a judge of one of
the courts.
The Bill has passed the House on three
separate occasions, and I may say, honourable gentlemen, that I received the other
day a very flattering testimonial from the
Prisoners' Aid Society of Montreal, thanking us very much and congratulating this
honourable body on having taken this
matter up. Canada is a very large country, and from ocean to ocean in many
cases a Bill of this kind would work to
great advantage.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: The objection I see to this Bill is that it permits
of an increase of the punishment. I should
think there would be great difficulty in
that. I have no objection to diminishing
the sentence, and do not see how that
would involve any difficulty. Some judges
act like crazy men or fools in the length
of the sentences they impose. I say that
without fear of successful contradiction.
There ought to be, not absolute uniformity,
but some degree of uniformity of sentence.
The judge hears the trial and knows the
gravity of the case and the circumstances
surrounding it, which may tend to mitigate
the punishment to be imposed; therefore
the judge, if he has common sense-which
unfortunately all judges have not-is the
best person to determine what the sentence
should be. He is better fitted to determine
it than any advisory court could possibly
be. But we have observed so many cases
of absurd sentences inposed by judges that
I would be in favour of some such power
of revision as is provided for in this Bill.
However, I confess I see great difficulties
in increasing a sentence if it is too low.
Suppose that in a case of manslaughter a
judge, not balanced as a judge should be,
were to impose a foolish sentence, such
as twenty-four hours' imprisonment, how
would you increase that sentence? You
would not have time to get the machinery
of the law in motion before the accused
would be a free man.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Send him back
again.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You could not
very well do that. The man would have
gained his freedom. How would you get
him back again?
You cannot play fast
and loose with a man in that way; you
must have some charge on which to arrest
him. If an unduly severe sentence has
been imposed upon a person subject to the
law, it ought to be diminished. Unduly
severe sentences do not tend to uphold or
vindicate the majesty of the law, and I
am not in favour of them; but it seems to
me that this Bill will not provide a proper
remedy if it contains the word "increase."
I am in favour of the principle of the
Bill, for the reason that I have already
stated.
If all our judges were sensible
and intelligent we would not need this law;
but unfortunately our method of selecting
judges is such that misfits are appointed
only too often, and therefore it is necessary
to have some guide for them to follow.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
How would
you recommend that appointments be
made?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: By divine selection.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: In reply to the
honourable gentleman from Sussex (Hon.
Mr. Fowler), I may say that I agree that
the provision for increasing the punishment
is a doubtful one to put in the Bill,
but it must be borne in mind that the
only person who can make application to
the court of appeal to increase the sentence
is the Attorney-General of the province, and
the matter may safely, I think, be left in
his hands. The case must be an exceptionally glaring one before be would take action.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Can the honourablè
member answer this question: what would
happen if the judge in appeal were of
opinion that no sentence should have been
pronounced? He may diminish or be may
increase the punishment, but there is
nothing in this Bill providing for the case
in which be is of opinion that no punishment
should have been imposed. What is he
going to do?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The application
to the judge is only for leave to bring the
case before the court of appeal, and if in
the opinion of the judge it is a case that
should be brought before that court, that
court would deal with the question. As I
said before, ti>e Bill is not wide enough;
there should be a criminal appeal in all
cases. This Bill is merely a step in the
right direction, and if I succeed in bringing

MARCH 2, 1921

181

considerable number of abuses, then I think
it would be the duty of Parliament to
remedy them.
There is this point to be borne in mind:
it is desirable that there should be an end
to a law-suit, and I think that giving an
appeal in a criminal case, as this Bill does,
would simply tend to prolong litigation and
probably increase expenditure. That is one
of the points that I think the honourable
gentleman in charge of the Bill should
bear in mind.
Then, there is one omission in the Bill.
As I say, speaking for myself, I have a
fairly open mind on the subject, but if
honourable gentlemen will read the clause
as it is proposed to be passed, they will
see that there is no time limit. Clearly
there should be some time limit within
which the appeal should be made.
Hon. W. H. BENNETT: The honourable gentleman has perhaps forgotten that
last year, when the Bill was in the committee, it was strongly urged that there
had always been, and under the present
system there would continue to be, 'an
appeal to the Minister of Justice; but the
drawback in that was that before the
Minister of Justice would move at all in
the matter he asked the trial jiidge to
make a report. Judges are only human,
and if a judge has made a strong charge
to the jury against the prisoner, or if,
without a jury, he has himself decided
against the prisoner, it is naturally pretty
hard to get him to reverse his decision.
That point was discussed at considerable.
length when the Bill was considered on
the two previous occasions.

S-9à

the question to the attention of the Government and the House of Commons, they may
do something with respect to criminal appeals. I sincerely believe that this country
should have some way of rectifying errors
and abuses that have crept in, or may creep
in any day, in connection with criminal
trials. Honourable gentlemen are aware
that the severity of a sentence may depend
upon the section of the country in which
the accused lives. Sometimes it depends
upon whether he is living in a country
district or in a city. I have been told of a
judge of Ontario who was appointed by the
Ontario Government as a commissioner to
investigate penitentiaries, and who, when
he visited them as commissioner, extended
a wide invitation to the prisoners, "Come
and let me hear what you have to say." He
said that he was much impressed by the
protests made by some men who had been
sent down for long terms and by the fact
that others who had committed similar offences were in for much shorter periods.
He came to this conclusion, that in country
districts the sentences were very much more
severe than those imposed in the cities.
I do not want to take up the time of the
House any longer, but I would impress upon
honourable gentlemen this one point, that
it is only in cases of exceptional and glaring
acts of injustice that this measure would
be used. I do not suppose that in the case
of an ordinary sentence, even if it were a
little severe, or if it erred in the other
direction, an application would be entertained by the court of appeal. But this
measure is to provide for exceptional cases.

DOMINION ELECTIONS ACT AMENDMENT BILL
,CONCURRENCE

IN COMMONS
MONTS

AMEND-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED 'moved
concurrence in the amendments of the
bluse of Commons to Bill A, an Act to
amend the Dominion Elections Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen will
probably remember the Bill now under consideration as passed by this Chamber. Upon
its reacbing the House of Gommons certain
amendments were made which will be found
on pages 47 and 48 of the Minutes. They
deal, 1 may say, entirely with election
procedure.
The object of the first amendment is to
permit of the use of the lists which were
prepared for the by-elections which recently
took place in East Elgin and West Peterborough. Honourable gentlemen will readily appreciate the desirability of using the
more recent lists. That will avoid the
necessity of putting imbt motion the machinery provided for in the original Bill in
order that there should be a revision in the
urban polling divisions and that in the rural
districts the lists should be added to.
The next amendrnent, which. is to be found
on page 48 of the Minutes, has to do with
carrying on what might be regarded as
analogous to an election in which two
candidates are before the electors. There
are three bodies particularly interested in
the plebiscite which is to be' taken in
Ontario: the Dominion Alliance, Ontario
branch, the Ontario Referendum Committee,
who are promoting this plebiscite, and are
engaged in securing ail the votes they
can-

Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: That is, the
"Drys."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
the "Drys"ý-and the Citizens' Liberty
League, with whom some honourable gentleman may possibly be in sympathy, represent the "Wets." It is proposed that these
bodies shaîl be regarded practically as candidates, and that the Dominion Alliance and
the Ontario, Referendum Committee shall
jointly act as a candidate would in the appointment of scrutineers and agents for
their side and that on the other hand the
Citizens' Liberty League shahl likewise provide the means by which scrutineers shail
be appointed as representing the views
which that body holds.,
These are the only substantial amendments which have been made. They peculiarly concera the machinery to be set in
motion when the vote is taken.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It is somewhat
difficuit to understand exactly how these
ameadments corne in, as ahl I have before
me is Bill A as it passed the Senate. Perhaps my honourable friend will explain a
little more fully.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 hava
the amendments before me.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We have not the
reprinted Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, we
have not the reprinted Bill; but, as it is
desirable to have the Deputy Governor corne
down, possibly to-morrow, I arn anxious to
have the Bill passed this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There is one other
point that I would like to raise. The proposed subsection 2 is to take the place of
section 52 of the Dominion Elections Act.
I do not quite see why in this particular
case, if I understand the clause rightly,
one or the other or each of these associations bas the privilege of appointing two
agents to a polling booth.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The two
associations who are promoting the vote
act jointly; the Citizens' Liberty League
acts separately. So there are only two
parties-the Dominion Alliance and the
Citizens' Liberty League.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: They each appoint
an agent?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Tha
Dominion Alliance and the Ontario Referendum Commnittee act jointly in appointing
an agent, because their interests are iden-

4

SENATE

tical, and the Citizens' Liberty League appoints another agent.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The first part of
the proposed subsection reads:
The Deputy Returning Officer, the Poli Clerk,
one or other alternately, of the two agents or
electors representing the persons interested in
promoting an affirmative, and one or other
alternately, of the agents or electors representing those interested in proioting a negative
answer to the question submitted, and no
others, shall be permitted to remain in the room
where the votes are given during the time the
poli remains open.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
they will be in alternate booths. That is
to say, there will not be two agents representing the Dominion Alliance and the Ontario Referendum Committee in the one
booth. There may be an agent of the
Dominion Alliance in one booth, and an
agent of the Ontario Referendum Committee in another booth; but in each booth
the Citizens' Liberty League will have an
agent, so each booth will be manned by
parties representing the affirmative and the
negative of the vote.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: At whose instance
is this change in the Act being made? At
the instance of the Dominion Alliance?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It has
been made in the interests of both.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: At whose instance?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: At the
instance of the Dominion Alliance, I am
informed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And they, of course,
would be exceedingly careful to safeguard
the rights of the Citizens' Liberty League, I
should say, knowing their breadth of mind.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
being done at the instance, of the two associations promoting the vote, but the Citizens'
Liberty League is acting entirely independently of them.
The amendments were concurred in.

THE PARLIAMENTARY DISTRIBUTION OFFICE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I desire to draw
the attention of my honourable friend the
leader of the Government to a notice that
I received from the Parliamentary Distribution Office in regard to reports brought
down. One of those mentioned is the Trade
and Navigation Returns. I inquired for
this report and was told that there was
no such report published. I took the matter up further, and it seems that the Trade
and Navigation report is not being published, but that the Report of the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue is
being published in lieu thereof. It seems
curious that a notice of this kind, which
is entirely misleading, should be sent out.
I would ask my honourable friend whether
the same statistics are included in the
Report of the Department of Customs and
Inland Revenue as were formerly contained in the Trade and Navigation Returns.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
commend to my honourable friend a perusal of the report before him. If it does
not contain the information formerly contained in the Trade and Navigation Returns, we will take the question up later
on. This is no doubt along the line of
economy and efficiency which we have been
trying to practise.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would my honourable friend have the Parliamentary
Distribution Office notified of this matter?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No
doubt it is the result of long habit.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I could not get

post office.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
is strange. It has been distributed, I understand.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It came out only a
little while ago.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
no intention of urging the House to adopt
it if copies have not been distributed, but
in moving the second reading I desire to
make an explanation of the Bill, and if
it not desirable to give it the second
teading to-day my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Bostock) can say so. The reason this
measure is brought up at the present
stage is that similar legislation is being
or bas been introduced into the Ontario
Legislature. This Bill is the outcome of
a conference between the Ontario Government and this Government with a view of
maintaining the level of the Lake of the
Woods.
The International Joint Commission bas urged upon this Government
-and the government of Ontairo is likewise interested-that the level of the Lake
of the Woods, for power purposes and
owing to riparian interests, should be
maintained within a range of 51 feet. I
think the minimum would be 1,050 odd
feet and the maximum 1,061 feet above
the level of the sea. To accomplish this
purpose it is proposed, as honourable gentlemen will see who have the Bill in their
hands, that there shall be established a
board upon which both governments shall
be represented. The board shall consist
of four members, two to be appointed by
the Governor General in Council and two
by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.
It will be observed also that the necessary
legislation to authorize this Bill shall be
enacted by not only the Parliament of
Canada, but also the legislature of Ontario.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

The Bill sets forth the machinery which
the Board shall put in motion. It does not
contain anything of an arbitrary nature.
It is felt that a board organized in the
manner proposed will be able to carry out
the recommendations which have been made.
As honourable gentlemen may know, the
Lake of the Woods is regarded as an international body of water. Part of the Lake
of the Woods is on the American side, but
the greater part is on the Canadian side.
The waters flow to the north, emptying
finally into Hudson Bay. A great deal of
power is developed or will be developed
from the waters that flow into the Lake
of the Woods. Consequently it is very desirable that supervision should be exercised over the use and distribution of the
water flowing from the Lake of the Woods
into the Winnipeg River as well as the
water of the English River flowing from
Lac Seul. These rivers flow on to Lake
Winnipeg and thence into Hudson Bay.
There is, as honourable gentlemen know,
a great deal of power now being generated
in the province of Manitoba, and unless
there is some proper regulation of those
waters the very large undertakings which
have been entered into and the capital
which bas been expended in the development of power upon those streams will be
seriously jeopardized. It is felt that the
purpose in view can be best accomplished
by acting upon the suggestion which has
been made by the International Joint Commission, on which, as honourable gentlemen know, both Canada and the United
States are represented. This Bill is in
harmony with the recommendation which
they have made. With this explanation
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does the honourable leader of the Government want to
press for the second reading this afternoon?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; not
against the wish of the House.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I find a copy of the
Bill on my file here. But, as I say, I asked
for it this morning and could not get n.
and I would like to have an opportunity
of studying the Bill before speaking on
it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: All
right.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I was going to suggest to the honourable leader of the Government, for reasons
that I could state now, that it would be

MARCH 3, 1921
well to refer this Bill to one of the committees, either Trade and Commerce or
Railways, Telegraphs, and Harbours. It is
out of the question for honourable members
of the House to understand all that is in
this Bill unless they have first the Treaty
between Canada and the United States
which was entered into in 1909 and ratified
by the two countries in 1910, and have also
the report of the International Joint Commission that was appointed under the
Treaty and reported in 1917. That Commission began to function in 1912, and took
five years to make its report. Honourable
gentlemen need those documents, and also
the map of the country between Port
Arthur and Lake Winnipeg. There is a
map that shows the whole watershed of
the Lake of the Woods. As I understand
the Treaty between Canada and the United
States, the idea was to refer all present,
past, and future disputes about boundary
waters between the two countries to a Joint
Commission; and Canada and the United
States were to pass the necessary legislation to give effect to whatever was agreed
on by the Joint Commission. In order to
understand the question you need those
three things that I have mentioned, and
I think that copiés of them can be had
for every member of the House. If this
matter stands over for say, forty-eight
hours, and some one sends to the office of
the International Joint Commission, he
can obtain copies of the Treaty, the report
of the Jôint Commission, and a map of the
country, and when you have those three
things, you can intelligently discuss this
Bill.
There are three points that I think
require consideration. In the first place,
there should be some explanation of why
a new Commission is wanted. I should
think myself that it would be desirable to
avoid creating a new commission. Of
course, I can understand why the province
of Ontario should say, "We have no representative on the Commission, and there
are provincial interests at stake;" but two
of the men on the Canadian side of the
International Commission could very well
act in this matter, and if you wish to give
Ontario representation, it could be provided for in that way without the creation
of new offices. The appointment of two new
commissioners would probably mean an
expenditure of between $15,000 and $20,000
a year. Furthermore, Canada was repreCommission by very
sented on the
strong men-Mr. Magrath, Mr. Powell,
and Mr. Mignault who is now in the

137

Supreme Court of Canada. This commission had been for nine years studying
the situation, and they have the thing down
to the finest point. I do not see why you
should bring in new men and shove those
other men to one side. I would expect to
find some strong reason why you cannot
Comuse the Canadians on the Joint
mission, who are au fait with all the facts.
That is one point.
Then there is a second thing that requires some explanation. The Joint High
Commission recommends a maximum and
a minimum level, but in order to justify
you 'in maintaining that level they recommend that what they call "flowage damages" be first provided for. What they
mean by flowage damages is this. If you
raise the Lake of the, Woods beyond its
normal level, it is going to overflow farms
on both the American and the Canadian
sides. They estimate that the damages will
amount, in round figures, to about $250,000,
probably two-thirds of that being payable
on the American side and the other third
in Canada. This Bill, as I understand,
does not provide for that. But there is
here in Ottawa a communication from the
Government at Washington, either direct
from the Secretary of State or through
the British Ambassador, in which the
United States Government propose a settlement, offering to submit a draft Treaty to
Canada to clear up these damages, and,
I take it, also to deal with this question
of the maximum and the minimum level;
but of that I h'ave not the details. AIthough, as I understand, the communication from Washington was received by
the Canadian Government about last
November, yet up to a few days ago no
reply had been made. I would like to
learn from the honourable leader of the
Government all about that communication
from the American Government, and
whether or not it bas been answered, and,
if not, why has there not been an answer.
In passing this Bill we must see to it that
we do not come into conflict with the
Treaty, or with the American Government,
and that we are not superseding or disturbing work that has been done by the
International Joint Commission, because
you will find that in Article 3 of the Treaty
it is provided that the two goverrgments
shall work through the medium and on
the recommendation. of the Joint Commission.
Another thing that you will require to
deal with is what is called the watershed
of the Winnipeg River. The whole water-

138

SENATE

shed of the Lake of the Woods is very large,
between 28,000 and 30,000 square miles.
It is drained by the Winnipeg River into
Lake Winnipeg, as I understand, but the
head waters begin back near Port Arthur.
The Height of Land, I think, is not more
than fifteen or twenty miles west of Port
Arthur. Then you have a series of lakes,
then Rainy Lake and Rainy River, emptying into the Lake of the Woods. They are
all part of the watershed that supplies the
water flowing into the Winnipeg river.
If you look at the last subsection of clause
3 of the Bill you will see that this Board
is given power:
To regulate and control the level and flow
of such other waters of the watershed of the
Winnipeg river as the Governor General In
Council and the Lieutenant Governor in Council
may both agree to place under the jurisdiction
of the said Board.
Under that section the Governor General
and the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario
can put Rainy river and Rainy lake under
the jurisdiction of this new Board. If you
look at the report of the International Joint
Commission you will find that they have
dealt with this very thing and are asking
for authority to control all the dams and
all the obstructions in those waters.
I am not going to weary the House with
the details; I am simply outlining this question and am pointing out that unless we
have all material placed before us, we cannot thoroughly discuss this Bill, and I am
suggesting either one of two things-I am
not particular which: that it should be discussed before the whole Senate or before
a committee of the Senate. The advantage
of sending it to a committee of the Senate
would be that the committee could send
for either Mr. Magrath or Mr. Powell and
get some information and some help in
order to arrive at a conclusion. My own
view, so far as I can forrn any opinion
about it, is that the question, so far as the
irternational waters are concerned-Rainy
lake, Rainy river, and Lake of the Woodsshould be left in the hands of the Joint
Commission. The Winnipeg river, English
river, and Lac Seul, as I understand it,
are entirely in Canadian territory, and the
United States bas nothing to do with them.
If the Government want to appoint a commission to deal with them, well and good;
but again I say that I do not see why they
do not avail themselves of the very full and
exact knoWledge of the men sitting on the
International Commission rather than go to
the extent of appointing new men. I do
not know whether the leader of the Government would prefer to send the Bill to a comHon. W. B. ROSS.

mittee or to have it stand over until a copy
of the documents could be laid on the desk
of each member of the House so that he
might have a thorough understanding of
the question.
Hon. ROBERT WATSON: Honourable
gentlemen, I am not going to refer to this
matter from an international standpoint,
but rather from the standpoint of the province of Manitoba. I think the necessity
for this legislation is due to certain concessions having been given by the Ontario
Government to Backus enabling him to develop water power at International Falls,
which will of course affect the level of the
lake.
The point I am more particularly interested in is the effect that this legislation may have on the present generation
and transfer of power throughout the province of Manitoba, because it would affect
the flow of the water in the Winnipeg river.
This is a very serious matter, because the
city of Winnipeg is dependent not only on
the river for its power, but on the water
in the Lake of the Woods for its water
supply. There is a conduit of about 100
miles in length which supplies the city of
Winnipeg with water from the Lake of the
Woods. I trust the suggestion made by the
honourable gentleman frorn Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) will be acted on, and that
the province of Manitoba will have an opportunity of presenting its case before the
Committee and having the interests of the
West safeguarded in this legislation. We
have had some experience of Backus before.
He got concessions on the Rainy river for
developing power, and we thought we had
protected the citizens on the Canadian side
of International Falls and had made sure
that one-half of the power would be available for them. Mr. Backus, however, very
adroitly managed a scheme whereby practically the whole of that power was diverted
to the American side. So in dealing with
this gentleman we have to be very careful,
and, I submit, it is only reasonable that
this Bill should be referred to a committee
of the House where outside interests might
be heard. I am sure the province of Manitoba would take advantage of the opportunity to be represented, because only a
few weeks ago the Premier of Manitoba, I
think in conjunction with the authorities
from Ontario, visited Ottawa and discussed
this matter with the Federal authorities.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Can the leader
of the House say whether there is any water
flowing out of the Lake of the Woods from

MARCH 3, 1921
that part of the lake that la on the Amenicani side of the line? My own impression
ia that there is not, and that the only interest the United States can have in the
level of the water la in so far as it might
flow over on farma on the American side
of the line.
As the honourable gentleman from
Portage la Prairie (Hon.,Mr. Watson) has
pointed out, the Winnipeg river la altogether on the Canadian side, and practicaliy ail the power thus far developed in
Manitoba is developed on that river; therefore I think the water should be kept at a
good level. If legisiation of this kind la
necessary, I agree with my honourable
friend from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)
that we shouid have the very fuileat information before finally dealing with it.
Practically every time we have deait with
American interests in connection with our
water-powers, we have corne out at the
amaîl end of the horn, and we do not want
to, give Backus an opportunity to do us up
anyfurther in regard to a river that is
I trust
entireiy in Canadian territory.
that every opportunity will be given to the
members of this House to learn ahl about
this matter, and that we may be able to
get the information already gathered by
the Joint Commission.
Hon.'L. McME ANS: Honourable gentlemen, I merely rise to endorse what bas
been said by the honourable gentleman
from Portage la Prairie eas to, giving the

be a very serious matter to the province

Hon. G. W. FOWLER: If the honourable

Mr. Watàon) la correct in stating that

his fingers at the Canadian Government,
and they were easy enough to lie down
and permit him to break the regulation
which ail the Cainadian mills were honourabiy fulfilling, and to say that he would
not abide by it. To-day the Ontario Government-for what reason we know not,
but we may surmise-have made a grant
to this man of what almost amounts to a
principality. He seema to be almost a
favourite of that Government. It seems
to me, if the honourabie gentleman
from Portage la Prairie is. right in
saying that it is because of this
Mr. Backus that this move is being made,
the matter should be carefuily taken up
and looked into. I arn quite in accord
with the suggestion of my honourable
friend from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)
that it would be perhaps as we l to, appoint a special committee. At any rate,
the inatter shouid go to some committee
where it would be thoroughly thrashed
out and understood, and no member shouid
be allow to vote on it without having a
knowiedge of what he is voting for.
Hon. FREDERIC NICHOLLS: I am
quite in accord with the suggestion of my
honourable friend from Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross). This, apparentiy, is a very
important matter that may or may not
have international consequences, and I
freely confess that so f ar as I am personally concerned I arn absolutely without the information necessary to enabie
me to cast an intelligent vote. If the Bill
la referred to a special committee or to
either of the Standing Committees suggested, we certainly shahl be able to corne
to a far more intelligent conclusion than
we can at the present moment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I arn
afraid that my explanation to the House
when 1 inoved the second reading of the
Bill could flot have been very iliuminating.
Honourabie gentlemen seemi to misunderstand yet what the object of this Bill is.
The 'object of the Bill is to prevent private
interests, such as have been referred to by
the honourable gentleman from. Sussex
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) and the honourable gentleman fromn Middleton (Hon. W. B. Rosa)
coming here and throttling or strangling
the public interest of this country in regard
to water-power. This Bill is the outeome
of a conference between representatives of

SENATE
the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba and
of this Government for the purpose of protecting the public interest from private
enterprises which, up to the present time,
have been a menace to these western waterpowers. If honourable gentlemen want the
private interests to be represented and
the members.of this Chamber who may not
be on the Committee to be excluded from
the deliberations, then I say send the Bill
to a private committee. The whole object
of the Bill is to protect the public interest
so that no private interest can throttle
the great projects which are being undertaken in the provinces of Manitoba and
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If this Bill is the
result of a conference of the three Governments, may I ask the leader of the Government why only two of them are represented on the personnel of the Board?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
because, às my honourable friend will readily see, the province of Ontario owns its
lands and water-powers, whereas the rivers
in the province of Manitoba are. vested in
this Government. That is to say, the provinces of Manitoba bas not title to the
waters in that province, and therefore this
Government represents that province on
this Committee because we are dealing with
our own properties. The beneficial results
and rights are enjoyed by the province of
Manitoba. The province of Ontario, having title to the lands and waters within
its boundaries, bas said that if the two
provinces and the Dominion were represented it would mean two parties against
one, because the interests of the Federal
Governmerit and the interests of the province of Manitoba are identical; consequently, Ontario bas said: "We must have an
equal voice upon this Commission." For
that reason we could not give representation
to the province of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would rot the
interest of the Federal Government after
all be rather that of a trustee or a guardian?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
it exactly. We are representing the province of Manitoba. This Bill was agreed
upon at a conference which took place in
the Department of the Interior, at which
were present the Prime Minister, myself,
and the representatives of the two provincial Governments.
My honourable friend from Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) lias intimated that the
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

duties of the Commission might be performed by the Canadian section of the
Joint Commission. That would be impossible. My honourable friend will readily
see that the Canadian section of the International Joint Commission could not assume
the responsibility of idministerim; local
conditions. If it were to do that, it would
cease to be an International Joint Commission. Consequently, by reason of the
fact that in the past there has unfortunately been an alienation of great public interests in the provinces of Ontario and
Manitoba, it has become necessary to have
a distinct Commission to represent the
provinces and to protect the waters of the
Lake of the Woods against any interference.
I am informed that His Honour the
Deputy Governor is waiting. If it is the
desire of the House that the second reading of this Bill should be postponed until we
have another sitting I am quite willing;
but I may say that the Government is
opposed to having the Bill sent to a special
or select committee. This is a public Bill
and is of sufficient importance to be dealt
with by the entire Senate. I shall be only
too glad to, furnish all the information
possible, and to place upon the Table of
the House any maps, plans, documents,
treaties or anything of that nature, so
that the House may be fully informed of
all the facts of the case. I can assure
honourable gentlemen that the object of
this Bill is to maintain the very interests
for which honourable gentlemen are contendng.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: My alternative suggestion was that the Bill be discussed by
the whole House, after these three things
have been laid on the desk of each member:
the Treaty, the report of the Commission,
and a map of the country. These three
things would give you the necessary information, and I think bundles of copies
are available.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

RFA]YING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:' Honourable gentlemen, I amn very unwilling
to press for the second reading of this
Bill this afternoon unlesa I arn witbin the
judgment of the House'. I wouldsuggest
that, inasmuch as a similar Bill bas been
introduced by the Government of Ontario,
and, I understand, read a second time in
the Ontario Legislature, we sbould give
this Bill a second reading this afternoon,
and then there will be ample time at the
Committee stage to go into ail the inatters
referred to by my honourable friend from
Middletqn (Hon. W. B. Ross.) As I said
before, 1 sbould be very glad to place upon
the Table of the House, at the Committee
stage, ail the information and all the documents that can possibly be had. It seems
to nme, therefore, that no good purpose
would be served by simply postponing the
second reading of the Bill, because, notwithstanding the apprehiension wbicb bas..
been expressed by bonourable gentlemen as
to the interests involved, we are ail in
favour of the principle of tbe Bill. Tbe
principle is simply that we should provide
the necessary machinery to conserve tbe
public interests in that section of Canada.
With the understanding tbat, every opportunity will ge given rat the Committee
stage to deal with the matter in whatsoever
way tbe House desires-either to consider
it in Committee of the Whole or to refer
it to a select Committee-I shall consider
myself entirely within the judgment of the
House. I tberefore move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not want in
any way to interfere with my honourable
friend's desire to have the Bill read the
second time this afternoon, but, as I have
already explained, I did not have an opportunity of seeing the Bill before I came
into the 'Chamber. I bope that when we go
into Committee my bonourable friend will
alîoV a rather wider discussion than ià
usual, at that stage, and that any question may be raised on the principle of the

*Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable leader says that hie will lay tbe documents on

to cause to- be laid on the desk of each
member copies of those documents to which
I have referred; that is, the Treaty, the
report of the Committee, and the map. 1
understand there are bundles of those to
be had from the Commission. One must
take these documents to bed with him and
study them if hie wishes to, understand the
matter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
documents are available, as mentioned by
my honourable friend,. I shall be only too
glad to bring down a number of them.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bili
was read the second time.
ADJOURNMENT

0F THE

SENATE.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED, by leàve
of the House, moved that the Senate adjourn until Tuesday, March 8, at 8 p.m.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentiement, I object to meeting at night. The
rule of the Senate is that the Senate shall
meet at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and 1
do not know of any reason why we should
depart from the rule, and I object to a
suspension of it. It suits the convenience
of perhaps half-a-dozen gentlemen to
have the Senate meet at 8 o'clock on Tuesday evening, instead of at 3 o'clock, but
it dnes seem to me that we are putting a
large majority of the House to serious
inconvenience -in bringing them here in
the evening, vihen some of them like myself are getting to be rather too old to go
about in the evening, and when we might
just as well or a good deal better meet in
the afternoon. There is this further to be
said about the matter: that when the

is really no object in adjourning until

the hour of meeting.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would involve our meeting to-night, and
I would flot like to give any assurance to
the House that I shahl be in a position to
proceed with it to-night.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Hlonourable gentlenmen, I wish to give notice of two amendments to the Bill. I need not discuss them
now. The advantage of giving notice of
these amendments is that they will be
printed and honourable gentlemen can then
see what they are. The purpose of these
is merely to safeguard the international
treaty and the recommendations and orders

made by the International Joint Commission under the treaty from being invaded
by this new Bill. If this safeguard is
made clear, then so far as I can see there
will be no objection to the new Bill.
I intend to move in ameudment to para-graph a, on page 1, the insertion of the
fdllowing words:
And subjeet to any international control that
rnay be agreed on by the Governments of the
UTnited States and the Dominion of Canada,
and provision being made for the payment of
any damages covered by such regulation and

. Paragraph d is very wide, but it can be
kept right by an amendmnent of the kind
which I propose. Under this paragraph
the new Board will have the right--to regulate and control the level of such other
waters of the watershed of the Winnipeg river
as the Governor General in Council and the
Lieutenant Governor in Council may both agree
to place under the jurisdiction of the said

LAKE OF THE WOODS CONTROL
BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill B,
an Act respecting the Lake of the Woods
Control Board. Hon. Mr. Daniel in the
Chair.
On section 1-short title:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before we proceed with this Bill may I ask: are not
these waters part of the waters under
the control of the International Commission? Can this legislation be proceeded
with? Has the Government obtained the
permission or authorization of the United
States of America for the passage of this
measure? Is the United States Congress
passing similar legislation? I am sorry I
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend had been here when I
moved the second reading of the Bill he
would have known the purposes for which
it is before us. The International Joint
Commission made an investigation into this
whole question and recommended that a
commission of control should be appointed
for the purpose of maintaining the levels
of the Lake of the Woods. I mentioned
the levels; I think they are between 1,050
odd and 1,060 odd feet above the level of
the sea. However, the difference between
low water and high water would be about
51 feet. This legislation would be, or
should be, in accordance with that recommendation. I need scarcely point out to
the House that, inasmuch as Canada is
equally interested with the United States
in the International Joint Commission, it
would not givè any consideration to the
passage of legislation that would be in
conflict with the Treaty in which we are
interested, one-half of the members of the
Joint Commission being
International
Canadians and the other half belonging to
the United States.
This legislation is the outcome of a conference that has taken place between this
Government, the Government of Ontario,
and the Government of Manitoba, and the
three Governments are united not only as
to the desirability but also as to the necessity of this legislation. When the Bill was
called for the Committee stage yesterday,
I moved that it stand until to-day, on account of a telegram which was received
from the Premier of Ontario, stating that
owing to representations which had been
made to him he would like again to discuss the matter with this Government. We
have since taken up the subject with the
office of the Premier of Ontario, and we
learn that Mr. Backus, who has very large
interests in the Rainy river districtHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And Fort Frances.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -and
also near the Lake of the Woods, is desirous of the three Governments staying their
hands until representations can be made by
him.
I do not propose that this Bill should be
delayed at the present stage to suit the
convenience of any private interests, if they
are not here to make representations to us,
inasmuch as it is proposed that the Senate

MARCH 9, 1921
adjourn at a very.early date. My view
is that, there being no business before us,
we should give the third reading to this
Bill to-day, and adjourn the Senate until
the 29th instant. I arn going to make a
proposai to that effeet hereafter. But the
interests of Mr. Backus or any other private interests will be eafeguarded by this
Parliament before this Bill becomes law.
I spoke to the Prime Minister this morning and mentioned that it was proposed
that the Senate should adjourn possibly
to-day or to-morrow, and that it was very
desirable that we should deal with this
niatter, because concurrent legisiation
dealing with the sanie subject bas been
introduced into the Ontario Legisiature.
The Bill in the Ontario Legisiature is a
replica of this Bill-precisely the same;
and the Bill has been agreed upon by the

should pass the Bill as it is, because any
departure from it would destroy the understanding we have had with the province of
Ontario. Consequently I wouid not be in
a position to accept any amendment such
as my honourable friend from Middleton
(Hon, W. B. Ross) has proposed. In the
meantime Mr. Backus or other parties representinig private interests could appear before the Gommons and be heard. The
Prime Minister has assured me that if the
Bill passes this Chamber every opportunity
will be given when it goes into the Gommons
for representations to be made there.
Therefore it is with some confidence that

power developed. It is estimated that there
is a possibility of deveioping water power
on the Winnipeg river to the extent of
500,000 horse-power. The city of Winnipeg is furnisbed with power from that
river.
In the province of Ontario the Engiish
river fiows from Lac Seul. It is estimated
that 250,000 horse-power can be developed
on the Ontario side of the boundary line.
With that possibility of developing 750,000
horse-power, it is very desirable to maintain a uniforni flow, not only from the Lake
of the Woods, but also froni Lac Seul, and
on the Engiish river and the Winnipeg
river. Hlonourabie gentlemen will readily
understand that absence of control wouid
jeopardize the various enterprises on the
Winnipeg river, or those enterprises which
may be below the point at which the interruption or disturbance takes place and
which are dependent upon its power.
Hon. Mr. DA;4DURAND:
I thought
that under clause 3 the Commission 'was
given power to build for the purpose' of
regulating the flow of those waters-that
it would have the right to build dams and
other works.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
might be, but at the present time it is
thought that this control can be exercised
without carrying out any works of that
kind. 0f course, I need not point out to
my honourable friend that if such works
shouid be carried out they would have to
be carried out by the joint consent of both
Governments. The greatest safeguard in
the Bill before us, as to private interests,
lies in the fact that the three Governments

and if the water in the lake is to be kept

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The

composed of four members, when each two

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Neither
the Government of Ontario for this Government would consent to the other having
a mai ority on the Commission; and, as the
interests of ail are identical it is flot anticipated that there will ho any division or any
difference of opinion or action on the part
of the representatives of the province of
Ontario and the representatives of this
Government.
. Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does the chairman have two votes in the case of a tie?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no:
they will have to agree among themselves.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: If there should
be a deadlock what would happen? As
I understand the Bill, the Dominion Government is really acting as trustee for the
province of Manitoba, which has no direct
representation. Ontario bas its own representatives. In case of a deadlock there is
no provision for any reference, -and even
if four are considered sufficient for the
Commission, surely it is quite unusual that
no provision is made for the Exchequer
Court or the Governor in Council or any
other body to act as referee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say to my honourable friend that there cannot be any trouble on that score. In the
firet place, the Government of Canada represents the province od Manitoba in this
sense: the waters of the province as well
as the lands of the province are vested in
the Dominion; there is no titie vested in
the province of Manitoba, and that province could flot assert any right as to the
waters or the lands; hence this Govern.ment acts practically as trustee for the
province of Manitoba. Manitoba is in the
position of a beneficiary. If there should
be any differgnce between the representatives of Ontario and the representatives of
this Government, that difference must be
adjusted by a conference of the three Governments.
That is an easy thig to
bring about, because, in its final analysis,
this Commission only represents the miachinery *by which the three Governments
may more conveniently adjust their differences.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Manitoba is not
represented.
Hon. *Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It i*s

In the earlier stages cf the conference it
was suggested that Manitoba should be
represented on the Commission, and we
were quite content that that should be the
case; but the province cf Ontario said,
and very naturally:
IfI that ho the case
there is a. majority of the other two Governments against this province, and to that
we shall net consent."
Finally, the province of Manitoba recognized the difflculty
and the unwisdom, of seeking to impose
such a terni upon the province of Ontario,
and gracefully yielded. The interests of
this Government, as I have already said,
are identical with-those of the province of
Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman says that Manitoba gracefully yielded. I would quite understand
that if Manitoba in that way relieved itself of any expenditure. I see that clause
9 of the Bill says:
The expenses of the Board, lncludlng the
remuneration of the members of the Board,
"hall be paid out of such fundu as may be
appropriated by the Parliament of Canada and
the législature of Ontario respectlvely'for, payLng

If Manitoba is te be a large beneficiary,
how is it that it does net join in?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Because the property is vested in this Gevernment.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: When this, Bill
was introduced the other day I made some
observations cf a rather critical nature,
net knowing the true inwardness of%the
Bill. Manitoba is more interested in this
legialation than this Government or the
province of Ontario. I arn inclined te
think that the Joint Commission has something te do with the regulation of the level

certain level, Winnipeg gets ber supply of

in their hands a sort of floating power.
Ordinarily the level is just between the
minimum and the maximum flow, but there
must be in the hands of the Joint Board
power to reduce the flow below tlýe minimum
to meet necessities that may arise fromn an
extraordinarily dry-season or soiinething of
that kind.
Then sub-clause d says: they shall have
powerto regulate and control the level and flow of
such other waters of the watershed of the Winnipeg river as the Governor General In Council
and the Lieutenant Governor in Council may

the sald Board.

On its face this Bilî,gives this new Board
control over the Rainy river and Rainy
lake. 1 think that at somne stage of this

legisiation it ought to be made quite clear
that when the new Commission come to
deal. with Rainy river and Rainy lake, they
must act subjeet to the International
Board, because if they do not they will be
acting in direct confiict with the Treaty.
This Bill at first sight seemed to be a
very simple one, but there are a good many
angles to it. I am perfectly satisfied, as
I stated the other day, that a very good
source of information for this House would
be one or ail three of the Canadian Comnmissioners on the Joint Board. I think Mr.
Magrath or Mr. Powell could tell us in
haif-an-hour or an hour just what the
merits and demerits of this Bill are, and
whether it needs any amendment. My
point is simply thib: it should be made
clear on the face of the Bill that so far
as the international waters, the so-called
boundary waters, are concerned, they
should be left undisturbed in the hands of
the Joint Commission. If that is done, sO
far as I can see, the legisiation would beunobjectionable.
Honourable gentlemen )from Manitoba
or Ontario may see private interests in the
background, about which, of course, I know
nothing. But I think the Bill ought to go
to a Committee, in thià House or the other

*149

House, and those Commissioners ought to
be examined. If Mr. Hudson is here, or
any'person fromn the Ontario Government,
they could appear before the Committee,
and could give further information.
The leader of the Government says that
we cannot afford to amend this Bill at ail,
because of something that is going on in
the Ontario Legislature, and that if we
amended it the Government would have to
withdraw it -because it would not be in
unison with what is going on in Toronto. I
suppose in Toronto they will say the samne
thing-that they cannot amend it because,
if they do, it will nlot be in unison with
what is being done here, and the Bill wil
have to go through in its present shaje.
That is a rather awkward position. If 1
correctly understood the leader of the Government, hie said that the Prime Minister
bas given him the assurance that when the
Bill goes to the other House an opportunity will be giyen to ail parties to be heard
-and perhaps that may be the best thing,
although I do not think it is quite satisfactory, so far as this House is concerfied, if we do not thrash the thing out to
a finish ourselves But I do not want to
be stubborn aboui the matter, and if it
is going to help things along and lead to
an adjournment I withdraw my amendments for the present, being satisfied to
have called attention to what I think is
a matter of importance.
Hon. Mr. D)ANDURAND: The Government does not intend at ail to invade the
powers given to the International Commission?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
May I point out to my honourable friend
the recommendation of-the Commission? 1
arn reading now from the final report, at
page 37, where it says: "The Commission
recommends," and so on, and:
The dams and regulating works at the outlets of the Lake of the Woods when Its level
rises above 1,061 or fains below 1,056, ses. level
datura. Between these levels supervision and
control shall be exercised by the approprlate
authority in Canada for the beneflt of Canadian
interests.

My honourable friend overlooks the
fact that a distinction must be drawn between Canadian interests in an international boundary water and interests which
may be on the boundary. Now let me
read the next clause in regard to the works
referred to by my honourable friend:
In the case of regulating works at the outleta
of Ralny and Namakan lake&--

150

SENATE

Those are the waters which my hanaurable friend is seemingly apprehensive of
our interfering with-the proposed international supervision and
control shall be exercised with a view of protecting ail rights and promoting the development of ail interests, bath publie and private,
on Rainy river and on the laites controlied by
such works, and aiso with a view of provtding
sufficient storage capacity in the lakes and discharging water therefrom at a rate which wiil
prevent those lites from exceeding the level of
497 for Rainy lake and 508.5 for Namakan lake.

But this Chamber mnust keep in view
that what we are doing is protecting
Canadian interests, flot international interests. We are protecting Canadian entesprises which, aithough they may be indirectly
associated with international
waters, are developed on waters on our
side of the line. This legisiation, as honourable gentlemen will see, is directly the
outeome of the recommendation made by
the International Joint Commission.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman £rom Middleton (Hon, W. B.
Ross) is quite right-we are Iegislating
in this case for Canada only.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 0f course, we
know that the levels of the various international waters are already regulated to
the inch by the International Waterways
Commission, and they will continue to be;
and, if they can exercise their power to
regulate in other places, they can exercise
it also with regard to the Lake of the
Woods. This measure, to my mind, is just
like a fifth wheel to a coach. But there is
no harmn in passing it: it can do no harm,
even if it does no good. I arn quite willing
that we should proceed with the Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I arn quite willing,
but I would caîl the attention of the honourable leader of the Government to a
paragraph on that same page 37 of the
report:
Furthernore, the Commission
le of the
opinion, for the purpose of regulating the
waters of Rainy lake and the lakes controlled
by Kettie Falls Dams, that it should at once
be vested with authority to exercIse controi
over ail structures and regulatlng worka extending acrose the International boundary and
the Canadi-an channei at Kettie Falls.

That is what the Commission asked.
Now, if you look at paragraph d you will
see that the new Commission is given
power "to regulate and control the level
and flow of such other waters of the
watershed of the Winnipeg river."
Bon. Sir JAMES LOUGHJEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
My
honaurable friend contends that those
waters are in the watershed of the Winnipeg river?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. WATSON. They do not i nterfere with the boundary line at ail.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: They are undoubtedly
in the watershed of the Winnipeg, river.
Where does the Winnipeg river corne frorn?
It cornes from the Lake of the Woods.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is on a rnuch
lower level.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Not at ail.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes; where the
works are.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: The watershed of the
Winnipeg river is the extent of country
which supplies the water that runs into
the Winnipeg. What is the watershed of
the Mississippi? Every part of the country that contrihutes water to the Mississippi is a part of its watershed. If there
is any doubt on that point, let us refer
to the International Joint Commission.
There is just one other point ta which I
desire to caîl attention, now that we are
dealing wîth this repart. It is deait with
at page 40. There were three questions
put to

the

Joint

Commission.

The first

question was whether it was feasible to
fix a uniforrn level for the Lake of the
Woods. They said no, and yes-that within certain limits you could do it. There was
a qualification on that, ta which I have
already referred. Then there was a second
question put: "If you do fix on a level,
what darnages are you going ta cause?"1
You will find on pages 39 and 40 of the
report the answers ta these questions. The
answer ta question 2 is that it would cause
damages ta keep the water between the
maximum and minimum levels that they
-ive; that damages would be caused an the
United States side ta the extent of $164,000 and on the Canadian side ta the extent
of $81,000, and that $1,15,000 would be required for pratective 'works ta avaid further damages. Sa there is an amount of
$360,000 ta be provîded for. -With regard
ta paragraph a on page 2, 1 considered
that, befare giving power ta control the
outfiow of the waters of the Lake of the
Woods, that section aught ta have gone on

Commission say will be caused, shahl be

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

SENATE
Yes.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This final report of
the Commission was made, I think, in 1917.
Although nearly four years have elapsed,
no action has yet been taken.
My honourable friend from Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) refer'red the other day
to some correspondence that he understood
had passed between the United States Government and the Canadian Government; but
so far my honourable friend the leader of
the Government has not told us whether
any action is being or has been taken in
regard to it. The present position, as I
see it, is that the International Joint Commission made certain recommendations asking for authority to control the boundary
waters, but no such authority has yet been
given. It occurs to me that if we are
giving the present board control of the rest
of the waters, which are in Canadian territory, something should be done to control
those boundary waters as well, because the
water of the Rainy river comes partly from
Minnesota and partly from Ontario, flows
ultimately into Lake of the Woods, and
must have some effect on the level of the
lake. Therefore it would appear that the
Government, when taking such action as
is proposed by this Bill, should also be
prepared to state to the House what action
they intend to take with regard to those
other waters. Personally, I cannot see
how you are going to divide the one set
of waters from the other. They are all in
the same watershed and they all ultimately
flow into the Winnipeg river. Of course,
the people of Manitoba are much more
interested in the question of power on the
Winnipeg river than they are in anything
else; but the International Joint Commission had to consider other questions besides
the supplying of water to power plants on
that river, and it should, I think, be placed
in a position to deal with these boundary
waters.
Now I want to point out something that
is stated at page 90 of the report. Honourable gentlemen who have read it will see
that the International Joint Commission's
report was signed by all six commissioners,
but the American commissioners reserved
to themselves the right to make certain
other statements or supplementary recommendations, and on page 90 they say:
To secure the proper construction and operation of the controlling works in the outlets and
inlets of the Lake of the Woods and In the
waters tributary thereto, or a system or method
of regulati-on that will insure "the most advan-

tageous use of the waters of the Lake of the
Woods and the waters flowing into and from
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

that lake," for the purposes stated in the
reference, and a settlement of the questions and
matters of drifference. between the parties to
the reference, each Government must obtain,
within the jurisdiction of the other, certain
property rights.
Apparently the United States commissioners considered that that was an important question and should be dealt with,
but I do not think from what my honourable

friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) stated
to-day that this question has been considered, and I would like to hear from him
what the Government thinks in regard to
the matter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
subject has not yet become acute; it has not
been thrust upon the attention of the
Government. It will be time enough to
deal with that subject when we are forced
to do so. My honourable friend must keep
in view that entering upon the passage of
any legislation dealing with rights of this
kind involves more or less expropriation,
and it is very desirable that there should
be no disturbance regarding such questions

until the public become so interested in
them as to necessitate action on the part
of the Government.
But the questions
with which we are dealing here are becoming very acute. For instance, the Ontario

Government

bas been dealing with Mr.

Backus in regard to certain power sites on
the English river, notably that of White

Dog Rapids, the development of which
would seriously interfere with the development of power on the Winnipeg river.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: With the flow of
water.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Yes.
It might seriously jeopardize all the interests on the Winnipeg river.
Therefore
these matters have been thrust upon the

attention of the Government,

and it is

necessary to deal with them at once. But
I have no apprehension that there will be

any difficulty in meeting the requirements
respecting any international works-at
least, works immediately tributary to the
boundary. The works with which we are
at present dealing are peculiarly Canadian.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Question; question.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In answer to my
honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed), I would say that I do not altogether
agree with him in that matter. He seems
to advocate taking up this question piecemeal, and, although the interests to which
he particularly refers are the more important at the present time, I think he will

MARCH 29, 1921
find that on page 39, where the Commission
answers question number 2, reggrding the
value of the lands in the United States and
in Canada, it is careful to say:
The Commission therefore finda that the areas,
with values au at December, 1915, for which

flowage rights should be obtained, are as folIowa:
The year 1915 is a long time back, and
I think that every honourable gentleman
will realize that the longer you put off
dea]ing with questions of this kind the
more expensive and troublesome they become. Now that this matter has come up,
the Government should be prepared to consider it and deal with it as a whole, rather
than, as my honourable friend suggests,
in parts as they may come along.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
seems to be enough difficulty about this,
without entering into a larger sphere of
difficulty. I move the adoption of clause
1.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-purposes:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend f rom, Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross),
I understand, proposes to withdraw his
amendments; but it might be useful and
for the benefit of the public to have some
idea of just what the effect of those amendments would be., My honourable friend
suggekted tbat it might be possible to consider those amendments in another place,
but if they are not deait with here we shall
not have the benefit of the explanation of
the honourable gentleman from Middleton.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If they
come here again, my honourable friend
could give us the advantage of his views.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I rather think that
it is a question which we ought to consider
ut the present time, whether this Bill is quite
in the form in which it should be. I know
my honourable friend does not wish to have
any amendments; stili it seems to me the
Senate should discuss the whole question
and learn exactly what we are doing with
regard to the Bill. I think there i. something to, be said for the amendment that
my honourable friend from Middleton has
suggested in paragraph a of clause S.Hon. W. B. ROSS: Paragraph a isthe
provision as to which I gave notice that I
would move the amendment which you will

153

find printed in the notices of motion for
to-day. That amendment was meant to
guard against two things. I have.already
referred to them and do not want to weary
the House by dealing with them again. I
wanted to have that provision worded so
that -it would be clearly understood that
when this new Board is regulating the outfiow of the waters of the Lake of the
Woods it would be subject to the order and
direction of the International Joint Commission. I pointed out that the maximum
and the minimum flow, referred to here,
might have to be departed from, and the
International Commission might have to direct the Board to go by other figures, although it capnot tell to-day what those
figures would be nor when the occasion
might arise.
The other point in connection with this
clause referred to, the gi'Ving of power to
the newBoard to regulate and control the
flow between the maximum ,and the minimum figures, given by the Internation~al
Commission in its recommendation, without first providing for payment of the damages which the Joint Commission said
would be occasioned. I do not; think *itis
good legisiation to give this new Board
power to proceed without providing for
those damages.
But I have no hope of getting ail the
members of this House to understand this
matter without calling on the members of
the Joint Commission to come before the
committee and explain their views. If Mr.
Magrath and Mr. Powell came here and
told me there was nothing in what I was
saying, or that it might be met in another
way, I would not have another word to
say. In the meantime, as I understand the
situation no'w, we are in a sort of predicament and we must pa.ss the Bill in its
present form, because' similar action is being taken in Toronto. Moreover, the Prime
Minister promises that all the objections
will be fully heard when the Bill is sent
to the other Hlouse. So I do not see anything better that I can do ut the present
time than withdraw that amendment.
Hon. Mr.- BOSTOCK: I sÉould like to
point out that the Commission, in their
report to the Government, 'in dealing with
the water-power interests on the Winnipeg river, say at page 49:
The Commission belleves that ail nboeêusry
rights should be acquired at the present Urne.
so that ail Interesta concerned may know the
ordinary stage at which it la prop0Ud to hold
the lake and the highest contour to which
damage may possihly extend at nme trne In
the future under unprecedented conditions of
ratntall and run-off.

1b4

SENATE

That is another point in favour of considering this matter as a whole rather
than dealing only with the question of the
control of the waters of the Lake of the
Woods and those of English river and Lac
Seul. I think that honourable gentlemen
who have read this report will see that
the two can hardly be divided, and that
in dealing with this legislation in this way
we are in danger of still more complicating
the situation instead of putting things on
a better basis, as we should hope to do.
What we want to do is to help the people
of Manitoba and the people of Ontario
as much as we possibly can; but if they
agree that the legislation does not go far
enough, I think the Senate should be in a
position to deal with it and improve it.
Paragraph a was agreed to.
Paragraphs b and c were agreed to.
On paragraph d of section 3-as to other
waters:

for the same reason I gave with regard
to the other amendment I can withdraw
this one too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does not the
honourable gentleman realize that this Act
would be subject to the terms and limitations of the Treaty?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Why not say so?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
assuming that we actHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: -within

and carry out the orders of the International Joint Commission.
Paragraph d of section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 to 8, inclusive, were agreed
to.
On section 9-mode of payment of
Board's expenses, etc.:

Hon. W. B. ROSS: This is the second
paragraph in respect to which I gave
notice of motion. As I pointed out before,
on the face of it there is no limitation to
the powers of the new Board. Can anyone deny that Rainy river and Rainy lake
are part of the watershed of the Winnipeg
river? They are just as much a part of
the watershed of the Winnipeg river as
the English river and Lac Seul.
The
waters from Rainy lake and Rainy river
flow into the Winnipeg river, and if that
fact does not make them part of the
watershed I confess that I do not know
what a watershed is. The Winnipeg river
bas no watershed at all unless Rainy lake
is part of it; and this clause on its face
would give jurisdiction to this new Board.
I would have added to the clause:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The leader of
the Government said that the Federal Government represented Manitoba.
If the
Federal Government is acting as trustee
for Manitoba, does it intend to charge anything to Manitoba?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
natural resources of Manitoba are vested
in this Government, and as this Government obtains whatever revenue is derivable
from them it is only right that we should
be burdened with the charge.
Section 9 was agreed to.
Sections 10 and 11 were agreed to.
On subsection 3 of section 7-(re-considered)-penalty for obstruction:

but subject to the terms and limitations of the
Treaty of June, 11, 1909, between Great Britain
and the United States and any regulations made
thereunder by the Joint International Board.

It may be said that this legislation,
though it is absolute on its face, would
be checked when it got into a court of law
by some person invoking what has been
done by the Commission. I do not think
that is good legislation. I think this new
Commission should be warned from the
outset as to its jurisdiction and as to interfering with something not within its
jurisdiction, and that the farmers on the
shores and the people of Fort Frances
whose property has been destroyed by
water should not be driven into the courts
unless it is unavoidable. I suppose that

AHon. Mr. BLONDIN: No.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The acoustic properties of this room are so infernally bad
that it is impossible to hear what is being
said. Something was said about $100, and
my colleague and myself thought it was
in reference to salaries of country postmasters.
I thought if the Government
could afford to increase them to that extent
something might be done towards reducing
taxation.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I am sorry to
state that $100 would be an improvement
on the maximum salary paid in certain
instances. I regret that I could not make

the West a tremendous amount of trouble
bas existed under the present systern. I
have neyer been able ta understand why
the post office officiais always objected ta
rnaking this change. Perhaps when we go
into Committee the Postmaster General
may be able ta inform us how he managed
ta educate these officiais and induce them
% ta adopt this policy which I think will be
of great advantage ta the country. The
other clauses of the Bill can probably be
discussed better in Committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Where is there
any mention of $100 in the Bill? I do not
see it.
Han. Mr. BLONDIN:,' My honourable
friend is right; there is no mention of $100.
I should have stated that we intend ta do
away with the irnit. This is an experiment. In the first instance we intend ta

be induced ta go further.
Under clause
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
2 it is intended ta forward a letter which
is insufficiently paid, and to collect not only
the deficiency but a penalty. I understand
that heretofore it has been the practice ta
notify the sender that the letter was insufficiently paid and for him ta pay the
penalty. Was it the sender who paid?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The receiver.
I cannat UnHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
derstand why thé receiver should be penalized. Under this amendment the letter will
be forwarded and the postman will ask the
receiver ta pay flot only the deficiency, but
double« postage. Why is that?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: That law is flot
new. As the Post Office incurs some additional trouble or expense in handling such
letters, because it requires the services and
the time of one o~r two officers, I suppose
that the penalty is imposed ta caver those
extraordinary costs.
But the reHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ceiver of the letter is in no wise in fauit.
Hon . Mr. BLONDIN: But would my
honourable friend ask the Post effice
officiais to go ta the trouble of collecting a
cent or two from the sender -whose nome
is not known ta them? It is impossible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The complaint
of the public wili be that in very many

instances these insufficiently paid letters are
circulars or printed matter, and the person
receiving them wili have ta hunt for a cent
or two or three cents to pay the penalty. I
realize, of course, that the Department
should stand no loss: but I think the penalty
should be paid by the sender. In my own
case nine times out of ten these insuffi-ciently paid letters have not been of interest
or of importance to me; and the same must
be true in many other cases. I have often
wondered why the Department infiicted the
penalty on the receiver of the letter.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I think my hanourable friend bas pointed out the very reason
for the imposition of the penalty. Suppose
we did not impose any penalty; then insufflciently paid letters wauld become an
abuse. Small as the penalty is, it is a
barrier to that abuse.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The practice now is
that if a letter is sent without being properly stamped it is opened and sent back
to the sender of the letter and he is called
upon ta pay up.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:

No.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I receive quite often
returned letters because the office boy has
omitted to stamp them. As I understand
subsection 2 of the Bill, it requires the person to whom the letter is sent to pay the
double postage. I arn afrsaid that would
open the door to an abuse. Many persans

as a great deal hangs on it, we can quite
understand; but I would like to ask the
Postmaster General a question. Have we
a parcel post between this country and
England?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Or do we have to
pay letter postage?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Parcel post.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You have a parcel
post at parcel post rates?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: We have parcel
post practically with the whole world. We
have it at different rates. I shall be glad
to supply my honourable friend with the
schedule.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The tariff?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Honourable
gentlemen, dealing with the first clause of
the Bill, I observe that what is intended is
apparently to assist the mail order houses;
that is, you are going to insure the mail
matter to the extent of $100 or -possibly
$1,000-whatever amount rnay be fixed on.
I thought, after the discussion we had
last session in reference to the mail order
houses, my honourable friend the Postmaster General would have brought down some
amendnient to the Act in that respect. I
think it is unfair to permit parcels to be
carried from one end of the Dominion to
the other at a rate less than one-half what
the express companies charge. It is unfair to the merchants throughout the country, and it assists those people who have
the mail order houses and do not pay taxes
in various parts of the country. I thought,
and I still think, that the Government
should amend the Act in that respect and
should increase the rate on parcels. Anyone who understands the situation knows
that parcel post takes up two-thirds
of the mail car; that is, in districts where
these large mail order houses are established. I think that some remedy should
be provided. There is in the department
considerable data showing the quantity of
mail carried by parcel post, and it can
easily be ascertained that it is very much
cheaper to send matter in that way than
I would like very much to
by express.
have the Postmaster General take up this
question and have it dealt with. I do not
intend to travel over the ground I
covered last year. I thought that my honourable friend would in the meantime have
examined the matter thoroughly and
Hon.

Mr. FOWLER

ascertained if some change could not be
made in the way indicated at the last Session of this House.
Then, as to section 2, I never could understand why the person receiving a letter
should be penalized to the extent of double
the postage.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
to take the letter.

You do not have

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Everyone bas
a certain amount of curiosityHon. Mr. FOWLER: They pay for it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: -and if a letter comes addressed to my honourable
friend, I am perfectly satisfied that he will
take it even if he has' to pay double the
postage.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Surely.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
should you be penalized?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
not?

Then

why

Why should you

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Why should
you be called upon to pay anything more
than the ordinary rate?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Someone must be
penalized, either the country or you.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, the country is not penalized, because the country
gets the postage. The postmasters in the
various parts of the country are not paid
very much.
Why impose on them this
duty of collecting a double rate? A single
rate should be sufficient. As the law stands
at present, according to my understanding
of it, if a letter comes addressed to me
which should bear, say, six cents postage,
and has only four cents on it, before
receiving that letter I must pay four
cents instead of two cents; so that the
double rate goes to the department. At
present, if the letter is not stamped at
all, it goes to the Dead Letter office, I understand; but ordinary letters with insufficient postage for instance, letters having
a two-cent stamp instead of a three-centwould go straight to their destination, but
the receiver is bound to pay the double
rate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

If he likes.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: If he likes;
and I think that as a rule he does pay it.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: There is no harm
in that.

MARCH 29, 1921
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But the unfairness ie in charging the penalty. It ie
sufficient to receive the ordinary rate without the penalty.
I think it is a great improvemont to provide for a letter that is not; stamped at ail
being, sent to its destination, instead of
te the Dead Lotter office *here at Ottawa
and having a notice sent to the addressee,
and, when the addressee sends a lettor
to Ottawa with. the postage, forwarding
it to him.
9%e law some years ago
was the same as what my honourable
friend is now proposing: he ie only going
back to what was the law; and I do not
think it should ever have been changed.
The only objection I eee to section 3 is
this. The ferryman xnay live in one of
the western territories a long way from
the Exchequer Court. I know that judges
of the court do travel from one end of
the Dominion to the other, but in a dispute
with a ferryman it is hardly likely that
the Exchequor Court would send a judge
out West to try a single case. I certainly
think the old system, that you are changing, that of disposing of the dispute by
arbitration, would work very*much botter
than the expensive machinery of the Exchequer Court. So far as I can. see, section 3 is no improvement on the Act as
it now stands.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, I have just this ovening received a
letter from the United States which has
two cents postage. That is enough, is it
not, when the lotter ie not over weight?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is supposed to
be.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Still I had to
pay six cents extra on this letter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:' That is a
penalty.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I suppose it is
a penalty. Strange to say, this ie simply
a duplicate of a letter which I received in
my office in Montreal and on which the
office boy also paid six cents. *That
is
twelve cents-and I owe the poor office boy
the six cents yet.

warded in future. That bas always been
the custom, as far as I know: it bas provailed for years and years. If there is no
stamp at alI on a lotter it goes to the
Dead Letter office; we ail know that; but
if there je not enough postage it is taken
to the person to whom it is addressed and
ie tendered to him. Ho is asked if he will'
pay two cents or three cents more postage,ý
or as the case may be. That practice bas
obtained as far back as I can remember.
The addressee can -say, "Yes, I will take
a look at it."' If ho thinks it is a circular
or eomething like that, ay~ does not want
it, ho says, "No, I do not want it." That
is ail there is to it. That is nothing new.
I do not know why this Bill bas been
brought in.
But, as I say, it is rather
curioius that while we are discussing this
point this ovening, here ie one letter in
duplicate on which twelve centEr bas been
paid, and it had sufficient postage, bocause
it bears a United States two-cent stamp.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It was over weight.

EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON (for Hon. Sir
James Lougheed) moved the second reading of Bill 19, an Act to amend the Exchequer Court Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a short Bill, a simple piece of legislation,
the desirability of which will be apparent
to all without any detailed discussion.
Briefly, the Bill enables the Commissioner
of Patents to appear before the Exchequer
Court, whenever any person appeals from
the decisiop or ruling of the Commissioner,
for the purpose of defending the position
which he tdok or the reasons which caused
him to make the decision which he bas
rendered. Likewise it provides that the
Commissioner may himself carry an appeal
to the Supreme Court from the Exchequer
Court, just as the private individual or
the applicant for a patent is now privileged
to do.
The legislation proposes to do
exactly what has been the custom for years
past; but in a case that occurred recently,
I am informed, it was discovered that while
the Commissioner had been permitted to
defend his action before the Exchequer
Court without question, yet he was not
entitled by law to do so. On one occasion
his right to do so was questioned. The
purpose of this legislation, as I understand
it, is to give the Commissioner of Patents
the rights and privileges which he has
been enjoying up to the present, but to
which it appears he was not strictly entitled under the Exchequer Court Act as i.t
now stands. The Minister of Justice, in
another place, I think bas made quite cleathe desirability of the enactment of these
amendments.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, it would seem that this Bill should
be an amendment to the Patent Act and
not to the Exchequêr Court Act. It deals
entirely with the Commissioner of Patents,
as to what he may do and what he may
not do. Making it an amendment to the
Exchequer Court Act is liable to mislead
anyone who has to do with it, because it
would be supposed that the question of
the powers of the Commissioner of Patents
would be more likely to be dealt with in the
Patent Act than in the Exchequer Court
Hon. Mr. MURPHY.

Act. My honourable friend did not explain
exactly why it is made an amendment to
the Exchequer Court Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The Exchequer Court Act, being the one which
gives the individual applicant for a patent
a right to appeal, I should assume that
under the same law the Commissioner of
Patents should have the right to speak in
defence of the decision which he bas rendered. Likewise, if the individual appealing
from the decision of the Patent Commissioner has the right under the Exchequer
Court Act to appeal to the Supreme Court,
if the necessity should arise for an appeal
by the Commissioner, his right would be
under the same Act. I do not propose to
attempt to argue this matter from the
standpoint of law; but from the standpoint
of common sense it seems to me to be the
logical thing to do.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

CANADA AND THE EMPIRE
MOTION FOR RETURN

Hon. L. O. DAVID moved:
That an humble Address be presented to Ris

His Excellency will cause to be laid before the
Senate all correspondence exchanged between
the Imperial Government and the Government
of Canada in connection with the representation
of this country, either in the British Parliament or in any council, Its participation in the
administration of the British Empire, its contribution to the wars of the Empire and to the
establishment of a British or Canadian navy.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, before
this motion is put, I want to explain in a
few words the object of it. There is no
doubt that there is in this country a good
deal of anxiety as to what will take place
at the coming conference in London and
as to what measures will be adopted touching on relations with England and with
the other British colonies. Certain English

it might be questionable .whether or not it
ought to be brought down and made public
property. With that reservation, as to the
propriety of making public certain documents which might be included, there is no

friend's motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: honourable
gentlemen, with reference to the remark

indicating that there may be documents
which it might not be appropriate to bring
down to this Chamber, I would draw his attention to speeches which wére delivered in
the House of Commons in England a year or
two ago on the functions of Parliamen:
and its relation to the Cabinet. There has
has been established an Inter-parliamentary
Association composed of members of the
Chamber of Deputies in France and members of the British Parliament. The British parliamentarians had occasion to cross
over to Paris and spend some time there
studying the working of French parliamentary institutions. They were surprised at
the considerable degree of control that the
French Parliament exercised over all
matters, more especially over foreign affairs.
On their return to London, in a very interesting debate which took place, they
stated that the British Parliament was
absolutely deprived not only of all control.
but of any information as to what was going
on between Great Britain and the other
nations; that all these matters were vested
in the inner cabinet council of Great Britain and remained practically a closed book
to the members of the House of Commons
and the House of Lords, who knew nothing
of the many treaties and arrangements
made between other nations and Great
Britain; whereas they found that in France
there existed in both branches of Parliament
a committee on foreign affairs, which was
functioning quite regularly and actively,
and when the budget was brought down,
or when the committee desired, it could
call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and
question him behind closed doors, and ba
made au fait of all that was going on. The
committee kept close supervision over the
actions of the French cabinet. The Britisn
parliamentarians felt that there was in
France a true sense of parliamentary responsibility; that there the cabinet council
was an executive committee existing by the
will of the majority in 'he popular chamber;
and that the memners of that chamber

knew what was going on and took their
share of responsibility in the world-widc
game which every nation is playing. It
seems to me that, since we are tending towards a national status, it would be proper
for both branches of our Parliament to examine into the working of the committee in
France which I have mentioned, and perhaps similar committees in other countries
-we know what action is taken by the
American Senate-in order that Parliament
may play some part in the foreign affairs
of this country and may know something of
what is occurring in international matters,
in which henceforth we shall be more and
more interested.
The motion was agreed to.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Blondin, the

Act to amend the Post Office Act. Hon.
Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
On section 1-insuring mail matter
(limit of $25 omitted) :
Hon. Mr. BOYER: (Translation.) How
will time be saved? What is the difference
between the time necessary to register a
letter and the time taken to insure a parcel?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: (Translation.) The
proposed amendment does not affect the
registration of letters, but only that of
mailed parcels. The registration of parcels
has been added to that of letters. The addition of this new service in the alrealy
overburdened branch of registration has
caused encumberment. We are not seeking
a more economical system, but one which
is more expeditious and which will give to
the public the same guarantee and will at
the same time avoid the encumberment to
which we have had to submit in the past.

MARCH 30, 1921-16
The amendment presented to-day suggeste insurance instead of registration, and
insurance will be a simpler proceeding. It
will constitute-a separate branch from that
of letter registration. The registration of
a letter necessitates considerable writing.'
It must be tranemnitted from hand to hand,

will it arrange for it with an insurance
company?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: (Translation.)
In the event of the insured parcel being

sender?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: (Translation.)
Up to the maximum amount authorized.
We are making an experiment which does
not involve any new principle, as the insurance of postal matter is already in
force up to the maximum amount of $25.
If the Department and the public are satislied with the experiment; the amount may
be increased.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman has juet stated that the
firet amendment he proposes in this Bill,
to replace paragraph V of subeection 1 9f
section 9 of chapter 66 of the Revised
Statutes of 1906, doee not affect the registration or insurance of lettere, but affecte
only the parcel post. I would like to have
a littie more light upon that point, because it strikes me that the clause to be
dropped covere ail mailable matter.
The
interpretation clause says:
"Mailable matter"' includee any letter, packet,
parcel, newepaper, book or other thing which,
by Ibis Act, or by any regulation made In pursua nce of it, may ýbe sent by post.

The clause which it je proposed to replace reade as followe:
-establîsh a eyeftemn providing for indeminnty
for losees of regjstered mnailable matter, sucli
lndemnity in no case to exceed twenty-five
dellars for any one registered piece, or the

dollars, and fix an Insurance fee or a ecale
of Insurance fees to be prepald in respect of
sucli mailable matter, and, from tinie to, tume,
make such regulations as lie deemes necessairy
for carrying out euch systeni.

The clause which je to be eubstituted
reade as follows:
-estauleh a systeni provlding for Insurance
againet lose of milable matter, and fIx ah
Insurance fee, or a scale of Insurance fees to be
prepald In respeot of such mallable matter, and
frc.m t0 tume make such regulations as lie deemns
necessary for the carrylng out of sncb eystemn.

I do not inelet on the etatement which
the honourable gentleman bas juet made,
except to draw hie attention to the fact
that the clauee seeme to cover more than
the parcel post. I simply rise to draw
hie attention to the fact that the law which
je sought to be amended. fixed a m~aximum
amount of insurance of $25, while the
amendment which he bringe in will leave
it to the department to fix the amount of
insurance. I have not eufficiently etudied
the economy of the old Post Office Act
to know what justified the fixing of that
amount, and why the fixing of the amount
should now be left to the postal authorities.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: My honourable
friend will find the explanation in paragraph k on page 5 of the Post Office Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The other
question ie why you drop the maximum
amount of insurance and take to yourself
the right to fix the amoiant?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Twenty-five dollars bas not been found to be enough. The
parcel poet ie being used to a coneiderable
extent for the transmission of articles of
value.
It , e only in order to meet the
wiehes of the public that we ask for
the privilege of increasing the maximum
of the ineurance.
SHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I suppoe
there will be a sliding ecale according to
the value of the article.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Oh, yee. We do
not intend to give the people of Canada, a
bonus. The rule of the Department is that;
everything vlone muet be done on a selfsupporting basis.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think it wae last
Session that the Postmaster General fixed
a fee of 10 cents for every registered letter. Will that be done away with now and
the sliding ecale instituted in place of it?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The 10 cents was
established by Act of Parliament. It is not
in my power to change it.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: What proportion
of the post offices are offices where one
can register letters?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I could not give
my honourable friend the exact number
off-hand. There are in round figures 13,000
post offices in Canada, and I think I am on
the safe side in stating that between 3,000
and 4,000 are what we call accounting post
offices.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do I understand my
honourable friend to say that, as the law
stands to-day, a registered letter pays a
fee of 10 cents in addition to the ordinary
postage, and that when this Bill becomes
law, if the sender of a letter or a parcel desires to insure it, he bas to pay a further
insurance fee in addition to the 10 cent
registration fee?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The amendment
does not affect letters. The rate of registration of letters will remain at 10 cents,
and the Department, in case of loss, will
be liable to the extent of the maximum
amount of $25. But we are providing for
a system of insurance for the parcel post.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But if one
wants to add more insurance to a registered
letter, will he not be able to do it under
the regulations of the Department?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: No.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: He can
send it by parcel post.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: No. He would have
to register his letter. I would not advise
him to send it by parcel post.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But in the
letter there may be valuable things of
small volume.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Then the letter
will be treated as a parcel, and will fall
under the parcel post and can be insured.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If I understand,
you pay for the carriage of the parcel,
and you can insure up to any Imount beyond that.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I think the Bill
is rather too radical to commend itself when
it is well looked into. As I understand,
at present about 4,000 post offices are
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

registry offices. I think perhaps if inquiry
were made it would be found that there
were more. A great many small post
offices in the country are registry offices,
which as a rule are situated in stores. It,
has not come out in the discussion what
losses have been incurred in the past by
way of insurance of parcels. The general
public have an idea that when they register a letter the Government is responsible
in case of loss; but of course that is nct
so,' though the Government is responsible
up to $25. In these days of quick locomotion a designing man who is an entire
stranger might go into a neighbourhood in
an automobile and go into a post office
to register a letter. Any one who is conversant with them knows that these offices
are frequently attended to by the wife or
the daughter of the postmaster.
The
stranger puts down a box and says: "It
contains $1,000; I am willing to pay the in-

surance on $1,000."

The woman, knowing

the routine, accepts the fee for tie insurance. The parcel is perhaps addressed to
a fictitious address, and is never called for,
and when it is opened it is found to contain a bundle of waste paper, and the department is liable for the loss.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Well, I will take
another case. Suppose when the parcel is
received at the end of its journey it is
alleged that it has been opened and that
it contained jewelry worth $1,000. Anyone who knows anytiing about the experience of the express companies knows that
time and again frauds have been perpetrated upon them, and here you are going
to open the door for an indefinite amount;
Parliament does not know what it will be.
Hitherto Parliament bas said that the
maximum must be $25. Under this amendment the regulation may provide for $1,000
or $5,000. What is going to be the result?
Designing men can go into -these country
post offices where there are unsophisticated
women in charge. In Ontario you rarely
find a man there. With his automobile the
postmaster spends the best part of the day
going around the country collecting eggs
and butter which he takes into town and
sells to the merchants there, and the store
is left practically in the hands of his wife,
or his small boy, or his girl. They are
familiar enough with the routine to act in
accordance with the tegulations. I dare say
that if such a law as this goes into effect
the department will have a great deal of
trouble on its hands, and the Dominion will
meet with a considerable loss. I would sug-

against the Canadian Government. Is
there any arrangement by which the Canadian Government, in such a case, recovers
from the American Government, and vice
versa?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The machinery for
investigation is provided. Both Governments co-operate in the investigation, and
whoever is found at fault is held responsible.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Thé Minister bas
just said that if a persan claimed that he
had put $25 into a letter, for instance, the
Department would take his word or his oath
for it and pay him the money. Would it
not be better, when a person is registering
a letter containing money, to have the
money counted by the clerk who accepts the
letter, in order to make sure that the money
is in it? A man might say, if the letter
has been lost, "It was $100 that I had in
it," or "It was $25," whereas it might have
been only $5. We know that people intending to commit fraud do not hesitate
about taking an oath. So would it not be
well to provide that before the post office
accepts a letter it should be opened in order
that the Government official may count the
money to ascertain how much there is in it?
Then, if it were lost, the sender would be
entitled to that amount.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The principle underlying all the present organization is that
we must trust the public, and we have proof
that we have not been misled in that respect
because the losses are insignificant. In the
second place, how would the public like a
ruling by the Department requiring them
to present their letters open to show what
is in them?
Hon Mr. CASGRAIN:

that is sent is transmitted by money order

Yes, but cash

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: s I feel sure that
most registered letters do not contain any
value. You register your letter in order
to obtain proof that it has been received
by the addressee. The loose money sent
by registered letter amounts practically to
nil.
Hon. MrCASGRAIN: Well, it would
not take long to count it, then.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The express
companies require money to be counted
before they will send it. Why not adopt
that rule in regard to money in your
system.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I will take the
suggestion of the honourable gentleman
into consideration. I suppose there must
be some reason against that too. But I
want to point out that with the parcel
post it is the same.
Hon. Mr BELCOURT: No.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Each parcel presented will be examined.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The contents
of the package will be examined?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
That covers
the point.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: For what purpose? In order to place a value on it. The
postmaster will not be able to value a
watch, for instance, or a ring, or anything
of that sort.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
They

I suppose we
would proceed along the same lines as the
express companies.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Then you will
not do what you said you were going to
do.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I was speaking
about registered letters.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: My honourable
friend has just asked, "How would the
public like to have the money counted
before the letter is received?"
Having
lately returned from Spain, I remember
sending some money from Saragossa ta
Madrid. I went with the hotel-keeper to

were counted; they were put in an envelope, sealed, and then the postmaster put
a thread through the four corners, joined
the two ends and sealed them. I had his
receipt, witnessed by the hotel-keeper, who
was the only man I knew in Saragossa,
with a guarantee that that letter would be
delivered within three days, and if it was
not received at its destination at the end

MARCH 30, 1921
of three days the money was to be refunded
to me. If that worked perfectly in Spain,
why would it not; work here?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I do not think that
there is any necessity for changing the
regulations s0 far as registered letters
are concerned. For about 20 years I had
a post office in the country. It was looked
after xnostly by emdployees. I know of one
case where the party receiving a registered
letter complained that there was in it $5
less than claimed. The post office investigated for months to get at the bottom of
the matter. I know of one or two other
cases where something like that occurred
and the investigation was very thorough.
The fact mentioned by the Postmaster General that last year, in the carrying of
$300,000,000 or $400,000,000 worth of mail
matter, the losses amounted to only about
$10,000, is proof that the systemi at present
in vogue is a very good one, and no doubt
the revenue from the registration f ar more
than pays the losses.
There is a little information I would
like to get fromn my honourable friend the
minister. If I understood him rightly, he
said that out of about 13,000 post offices
there were only 4,000 registration offices.
Do I understand that a person can register
a letter in only about one-quarter of the
post offices in Canada? The office that was
in my store supplied half-a-dozen offices,
and my recollection is that in every one
of those little country offices, which in those
days paid only, $10 a year to the postmaster, a person could register à letter. What
does my honourable friend mean when he
says that there were only 3,000 or 4,000

to the Department to make a proper regulation to put the systemn into operation.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.

the attention of the honourable minister
to this. His addition is not; sufficient. I
think hie should add, "in each case," or

Hon. Mr. BENNE TT: May I ask the
Postmaster General if I understood hirn
aright that $10,000 was paid by the Departmnent to persons who proved that they
had lost money in registered letters?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I was speaking
from memory. It is my recollection of
the report of the Postmnaster General for
last year that the total losses amounted to
close to $10,000. I have sent for a copy
of the report and I shall be able to give
my honourable friend the information in a
f ew moments.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: If that is the
case, that the Department is paying losses
in registered letters, after they have been
proved, and if that information goes out
to the public, I think that the Department
will have a great many more applications.
During the few years I have been in politics hundreds of people have corne to me

containing a sum of money was opened in
some particular post office in Canada and
the money taken out by some official, the
Government has made good the deficiency.
I think that must be where the losses have
occurred.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend why it is that, when
there is such a small loss in transmitting
money by registered letter, the Department
should collect so large a fee as ten cents?
It should be remembered, as my honourable
friend stated a little while ago, that a great
many such letters. do not contain any money
at all and that, as I can quite see, a large
proportion of them merely contain notices
or similar information, the sending of
which requires to be proved later. Why
is it that the Department charges so large
a sum as ten cents? Would not the Department greatly benefit by reducing the rate on
registered letters?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: To the former
rate.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would not the
revenue be larger if the amount were reduced, say, to five or six cents?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The registration
division of the Department is one of the
most costly, owing to the number of clerks
and the additional work that registration
involves.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it 300 or 400
per cent more than for the ordinary letters?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: All I can say to
my honourable friend is that the rate of ten
cents charged in this country is charged also
in England and in the United States. It
is the rate charged the world over. In the
second place, we were losing a great deal
in that branch of the service. Thirdly, the
ten-cent rate in effect to-day hardly meets
the cost of that branch.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Do I understand that there is no assurance that the
sender who has registered a letter and who
claims that there was no money in it will
be recouped if the money does not reach its
destination?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:

Provided the letter does not reach its

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: If the letter is

if our officers, who are experienced, recommend it, we order payment up to $25.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is actual

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
The amendment was agreed to, and section 1 as amended was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-obligations of ferrymen
(Exchequer Court substituted for Arbitrators):
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would the honourable the Minister explain why he is
making this change? It seems to me that
it is going to be very troublesome and
difficult for persons living in country districts to be obliged to appeal to the Exchequer Court to have the charge revised,
which I presume is what is meant here.
The ferryman is under obligation to convey
the mail and the mail-carrier across the
river or other body of water. Heretofore,
under the law, if he cannot agree with the
postal authorities as to what is the right
fee, arbitrators have been appointed in that
particular district. That is a system which
the ordinary man can understand, and he
would be likely to know some person to
whom he could appeal to present his side
of the case. But to refer such a dispute
to Ottawa if the ferryman lives away up in
the northern part of Saskatchewan or
Alberta-for instance, in the Peace River
country-will, it seems to me, be a hardship.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think a good change
to make in that would be to do as was done
two years ago with regard to claims under
the Act respecting the Canadian National
Railway. It is provided that a person with
a claim against the railway may sue in
any superior or county court. I think it
would be well to have this clause read, "The
amount to be paid shall be fixed by any
superior or county court," instead of "by
the Exchequer Court of Canada."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Leave out the
Exchequer Court.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Let the amount be
fixed by any one court.

MARCH 30, 192119
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
It
should flot be fixed by court at ail, in nly
judgment. It shoûld be fixed by the Railway Board. It will cost a man a great deal
of money to go to court.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think that in al
cases there is a scale of fees for ferrymen.
Why should they charge the mail-carrier
anything more than would be charged the
ordinary farmer coming in with bis produce? Ini my province a scale of fees is
established by the municipal councils in the
various counties where there are ferries4
and the mail-carriers are charged the same
as others. At any rate, if in other provinces that state of things did not exist
and there were no scales laid down, it wouli
be an outrage to require a man to go to
the Exchequer Court of Canada. I would
suggest that the postmaster be given the
right to fix the fee.
Hon, W. B3. ROSS: Not at ail. That
would be grossly unfair. He would fix it
to suit himself.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: My honourable
friend takes a wrong view. H1e is assuming
that the Postmaster General of Canada
would be a dishonourable nian'and wouid
not fix a proper fee. I take it for granted
thAt a man occupying the position of a
.Minister of the Crown would, if the .question were left to him, fix a suitable. and
proper fee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That would be
arbitrary. There are many things in this
world that are arbitrary, and sometimes
thinga are flot arbitrary that ought to be.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: May I ask the honourable member, if his farm were being
taken by one of the departments, would he
allow the Department to fix the value? H1e
would ask at once that the question be referred to some court.
Hlon. Mr. FOWLER: Proportion has
something to do witb these matters. The
fee for conveyance across a river would be
only a small fee anyway. It is flot fair to
compare the price of a farmn with a fee
for a carniage acrosa a river.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: But if the ferryman controlled many votes would, he flot
receive a big fee?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It depends on the
purpose for whicb you are hiring hlm.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Would
the Postmaster General tell us what is the
largest fee paid for ferrying?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: About forty cents, I
should tbink, would be the higbest paid.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHI-STAUNTON: Would
the Postmaster 'General inform us wbat is
the bighest fee tbat is paid to any man for
carrying the mail? It seems to me that you
are making a tempest in a teapot by sending, to the Exchequer Court of Canada the
settlement of wbat I imagine is a very
trifling matter.
,Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the
bonourable gentleman at the same timeHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I would
like to get my answer.
Hon. Mr. 'DAN DURAND: The honourable gentleman may answer the two questions. What are the occurrences that are
to be covered by such an enactment? A
mail-carrier assumes the obligation of
carrying from one point ta another, and if
there is a ferry crossing included in bis
run, be pays for the ferry. I would like
to know wbat are the contingencies tbat
are to be covered by tbis clause.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The Post Office
Act provides that whenever an unreasonable amount is asked for by the ferryman
the matter must be settled by arbitration.
That clause bas remained a dead letter, I
tbink, ever since Confederation. There bas
neyer been any discussion between the Department and, for example, the ferryman
on the ordi nary river. The trouble that we
are lhable to bave may occur on the large
boats-for example on the St. Lawrence
river. That is where the trouble occurs.
A man had a contract witb niy Departmnent
in wbîch he bad agreed to performi the
service between a certain city and another
place. On the way he had to cross the St.
Lawrence river.- On the boat by which he
used to cross with a couple of bags the rate
charged ta ordinary persons was 5 cents, I
think, for one person alone, 5 cents per bag,
and 10 or 15 cents for a horse and rig; but
bedause that man was an employee of tbe
Post Office Department the company chose
ta ask $500 or $1,000 a year, an absolutely
unteasonable amount. We *arbitrated. We
were hauled bef are the court and the
amount claimed by those gentlemen was
sustained by the court, and tbe expenses
for lawyers' costs, and capital, were $2,000.
Hon, Mr. BOYER: Good for the lawyers.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
That
is the reason why it should not go to the
courts.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: That is why we
thought we should have these cases referred
to the Exchequer Court, which sits in different parts of the Dominion, and, as my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has said, it is not a matter of very
great importance, because, I am sure, when
people know that they are bound to face
a court with a clear law against them, they
are not likely to exact from the Department any unreasonable amount.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: All the contracts
with our carriers provide that they must
carry everything the Department asks them
to carry.
Are they
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
annual contracts?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Some are annual
contracts and some are three-year contracts.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You are adding
to the duty of the carrier and you are
yourself going to fix the rate at which
he is to do the work.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Has my honourable friend considered the fact that under
this Act, by providing a system of insurance for mail matter, he is adding to the
responsibility of those with whom he has
contracts for carrying the mails? The
mail-carrier is going to be under a heavier
obligation to the Department than formerly.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: A contractor is
always welcome who asks for tne cancellation of his contract, if he bas good
reasons for it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It seems to me
that the suggestion of the honourable gentleman from New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
Fowler) would meet this case a great deal
better than it would be met by sending
it to the Railway Board or the Exchequee
Court. Provide in the Act that if the
ferryman refuses to carry mail matter he
shall carry a mail contractor on the same
terms as are usual.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
him.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The suggestion
strikes me very favourably.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Did not those
who received $2,000 get fair treatment?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Well, the Department was not fairly treated.

This is to protect

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it to protect
him with regard to the amount he bas to
pay for ferry; but the mail-carrier with
whom you have a contract to-day is going
to have added to his present obligation
that of carrying insured matter.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:

He always had.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, not with
regard to other things than letters.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
do you do with the railways?

How

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We could
perhaps report progress, and the honourable
gentleman could examine into the question
and bring the Bill back next week.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
Yes, I should
prefer to bring it back next week.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You are going
to increase the responsibility. If not, I
do not see why we have the Bill before us
at all.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
We are only
changing the court of jurisdiction.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Before that
is done there is one point that might be
taken into consideration. The ferryman
would be bound in the case of the mail to
do a certain fixed service at certain hours
in order that the mail would be delivered
at the proper time. There will be something implying a greater responsibility upon
the part of the ferryman in the case of
serving a mail-carrier than in the case of
serving the ordinary public.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My question bas
reference to , the added responsibility
which you are putting upon the mari
with whom you have a contract.
He
will have to carry a larger. quantity
of insured matter than he had before.
How will that affect the contracts now in
existence with the Department?

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Suppose that in
spite of that, for one reason or another,
the ferryman refuses to carry a contractor
unless he pays a certain sum. That is
what bas occurred. A ferryman bas exacted
from the contractor $5 a trip, though he
had only two bags for which he should
have been charged 10 cents, and if the

NATIONAL TRANSCONTINENTAL
RAILWAY
QUEBEC, TERMINALS

Hon. JULES TESSIER moved:
That an Order of the Senate do issue for
copies of ail correspondence between the Govern-

münt and the Board of Trade and City Council
and Harbour Commission of Quebec, since lazt
Session, wlth regard to the diversion of the
Northwestern grain trade to New York, the
alieged non-fulfilment by the Government of
it.3 urndertakIngs with regard to the terminale of
tht' Transcontinental Railway at Quebec, and
of the Memorials addressed to the Prime Minister on these subi ects.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, in asking for the production of these documents,
I arn not; inspired by any idea of criticizing
the Government; but I must direct attention
to certain facts»which are of the utmost importance to the district and Province of
Quebec.
We are desirous of obtaining the fulfilment of promises made by the Government
when the construction of the transcontinental road was decided upon in 1904, which
promises were confirmed by the Transcontinental Railway Commission in 1910. We
would like to see the execution of the necessary .works to facilitate the entry into
Quebec of alh our transcontinental railways
and the subsidiary lines. We wouhd, like to,
cee the harbour of Quebec put in a position
to accommodate the transfer by land and by
water of wheat, cattle, pulpwood, and other
goods destined for exportation which are
diverted front Canadian ports in favour 6f
American ports. We would like to see
proper arrangements made to give us a
good and rapid ocean service.
The Quebec Board of Trade has submitted
to, the Government a very well prepared
statement explaining what is desired, and
I do hope that the Governmént wilh meet
that demand with favour. I have often
wondered why the Government have spent
50 much money in' dredging .to make artificial harbours, when we have natural barbours at the head of navigation offering s0
many advantages as the harbour of Quebec,
which could be made one of the best on the
continent. We have a fronrtage of nearly
three miles on the St. Lawrence running
from Champlain market to Sillery, which.
cpuld easily give accommodation to one hundred vessèls if the Government would onhy
do the proper work. I do sincerehy hope
that in the interest of the trade of the whohe
Dominion the port of Quebec will be treated
as one of our great national ports. The
correspondence between the president of the
Quebec Board of Trade and the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, from Juhy to
October hast; the Memorial presented to the
Privy Council on the l9th January hast by
the Mayor of Quebec and the representatives of the Quebec Board of Trade and the
Quebec Harbour Commissioners; and state-

SENATE
ments submitted by both the latter bodies
to the Railway Commission at its sitting
at Quebec on the 3rd of February; ail go
to show the existence of a situation of the
gravest importance to the nation, a situation almost without precedent in the history
of Canada.
These documents prove, beyond contradiction:
1. That the Government has utterly disregarded its written promises to the city of
Quebec, as to terminais for the Transcontinental railway, made by notarial deed
passed in 1910, whilst keeping possession
of the valuable terminal property which it
obtained from the city on the faith of these
promises.
2. That the Government railways are
being çperated in a manner hostile to the
interests, not only of Quebec, but of ail
Canadian seaports, by favouring the export
of the grain of the Northwest by New York
instead of Canadian ports; and to such
an enormous exterit that in six years
518,000,000 bushels of our grain were sent
via Buffalo and New York, and in 1920,
when a good crop again permitted a large
export, the evil seemed to be growing instead of diminishing, because no less than
94,000,000 bushels of the new crop have
been shipped from Fort William via Buffalo.
3. That this has been brought about by
the unwise and unnecessary tariff adopted
by the Government railways, by which a
barrier of 36 cents per bushel on all-rail
export wheat is put up against shipments
from Winnipeg to Quebec, making it possible to send wheat to New York, by rail
and lake, for 32 cents per bushel, when experts say it could be carried over the
Transcontinental railway, all rail, to Quebec for 17 cents.
4. That this unwise policy is not only
depriving Canadian seaports of the export
trade of the Northwest, which was solemnly
promised them in Parliament when the
Transcontinental and Grand Trunk Pacific
railways were undertaken, but is compelling the farmer of the Northwest to pay
for carrying his grain to New York nearly
double the cost of carrying it to Quebec,
and that during the last eight years at least
$70,000,000 of Canadian money has been
paid to United States railroads and lake
boats for freight on this export grain, which
might have been spent in our own country,
and which would have gone a long way towards reducing the deficits in the operation
of Government railways under the load of
which the whole country is groaning.
5. That the Government is taking the
receipts of two very prosperous local railHon.

Mr. TESSIER.

ways built by the'Quebec people, and aided
by the city, without accounting to the owners of the property for their revenue, and
refuses or negleets to pay for the minority
stock of these roads owned by Quebec
people, although the Toronto holders of the
majority stock have been paid by the Government.
6. That the management of the Government railway, the time of its trains, and the
neglect to use the costly bridge at Quebec
or to allow others to use it, have caused
great dissatisfaction in Quebee.
I hope a day will come when it will be
possible to obtain a just settlement of these
questions.
Hon. THOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable
gentlemen, the question raised by the honourable gentleman from De la -Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Tessier) is indeed a very serious
one. It is important not merely from a
Quebec point of view, but also from a
Canadian point of view. A fact which
unfortunately cannot be disputed is that at
the present moment, notwithstanding the
immense sacrifice made by the people of
Canada to build three Transcontinental railroads, the great bulk of our grain trade is
diverted to American ports. I am no expert in commercial and transportation matters, but we have the opinions of men who
have studied the question and who have
a knowledge of the facts.
I would like to quote a document addressed to Sir Robert Borden on the 26th
of September, 1919, and signed by twentytwo senators and members of the House of
Commons, representing the provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
They made the following statement:
Canadian seaports have not benefited by the
handling of the ocean traffic of the railway;
but, on the contrary, a yearly increasing proportion of our western grain trade has gone to
New York for shipment. Senator Bennett, in
a recent speech in the Senate, stated that fourfifths of it bad gone that way.
It bas been stated that the special rate of
freight made two years ago, by the Government
Management of the Transcontinental railway,
upon export grai.n from Winnipeg to Quebec, ail
rail, saved three cents per bushel on wheat, as
compared with the rail and lake to New York
or to Montreal.
This special rate of freight which was fully
justified by the fact that this railway saved more
than 200 miles in the distance to tide water,
was declared by the Minister of Railways tn
the House of Commons, although a low rate, to
be profitable to the railway, but it was canc lIed when the recent advance in all railway
rates took place, and bas not yet been renewed,
so that the grain shipments from Quebec, which
had made a good beginning, have been arrested,
and the railway has not had a fair opportunity
to prove its abili.ty to do the work for which
It was built.

MARCH 31, 1921
The fact that marine Insurance from New
York is cheaper than from Montreai, Québec,
Halifax or St. John aise inilitates greatly
against Canadian seaports.
In view of the Importance ta Canada of giving
the farmer of the North-West the lowest possible freight rate on hie grain, and thus adding
many millions annually ta the value of hie
crop, and af putting a stop ta the alarming
Miversion of our trade to the United States ports
ta the detriment af Cariadian seaports, we
would respectfuliy suggest that the Government
shculd renew, or cause ta be renewed, the
special rate af freight upon expert wheat and
other grain over the Transcantinental railway
fram Winnipeg and other western points, or
Armstrong ta Quebec;
that 1lt make such
arrangements that the marine insurance rates
from Canadian seaports shaHl be the samne 'as
frora New York, and that s'ufficient additianai
grain storage be built at Québec, Halifax and
St. John ta handie the business in Canadian
grain, which, we beieve, it will be possible ta
win back frorn New York, if these suggestions
are adopted.

The gentlemen who signed that document were flot Quebec pepple; they were
ail Westerners; and their testimany in
favaur of aur eastern ports has a -special
value. These viewvs and facts, with others
more directly relating to the development
and implrovemeùit of the Quebec harbaur
and of the Quebec terminals, were brought
forcibly ta, the attention of the Government, first by the Quebec Board of Trade
during the summier and fali of last year,
and later on, in the months of January of
the present year, by an influential and representative deputation headed ,by the
Mayor of Quebec. They were very courteausly received, and were given a fair hearing by .the Prime Minister and his calleagues.
0f course, under present circumstances
the problem may not be an easy one ta
salve; but I trust that the Government may
see'its way towards a satisfactoryý solution, and will take every means possible ta
stop, or, at ail events, ta mininiize that diversion of aur Canadian trade ta American
ports which is so detrimental ta, the interests of aur country.

EXOHEQUER COURT BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED

On motion'of Han. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went inta Committee an Bill 19,
an Act ta amend the. Exchequer Court Act.
Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
1
On section 1-Commissioner of Patents
may appear by caunsel:
.Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Will my honourabrle friend explain what is actually the,
purpose of this Bill? I do nat understand
why it is necessary for us ta, empawer the
Commissioner of Patents ta appear before
the Exchequer Court either personally or
by counsel. I should have thought that
if a case came up the Cammissioner of
Patents would be authorized ta appear
and give reasons for his action.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
'The
difficuity that has confronted the Government, because it is a matter in which the
Government is peculiarly interested, has
been owing ta the fact that previaus ta,
1913 the appeal, if one might termi it Sa,
was ta the Gavernor in Codncil. In 1913
legislation was brought down giving jurisdiction ta the Exchequer Court ta hear appeals in patent cases. That court granted
ta the Cammissioner of Patents the privilege ta appear before it, although that was
nat, I understand, expressly provided for
in the Act. In a recent appeal from the
Exchequer Court ta the Supreme Court,
in which the application was made on behaîf of the Commissioner of Patents, I
understand, a judge of that court held that
the Commissioner had no locus standi ta
appear as a party ta the praceedings, and
consequently lie was refused a hearing. It
is therefore desirable, as honourable gentlemen will readily perceive, that there
should be an express enactment ta, the
effect embodied in the Bill, sa that no misunderstanding may accur, because it gces
without saying that if there be an appeal
in a patent case the Cominissioner should
have the oppartunity of being represented
as a party before the court.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask if
the Crawn was represented before the Exchequer Court?

.74

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It could
as I understand, be represented through
the courtesy of the Court, by the Commissioner of Patents.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As a matter of
fact, was the Crown represented, or the
Commissioner?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
Commissioner did appear before a Judge
of the Supreme Court, and the Court
would not hear him.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was that in
the Court of the first instance?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. The
Exchequer Court extended the courtesy of
permitting the Commissioner to be heard;
but the Supreme Court would not grant
him the right to appear and 'to be heard.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend know whether application was
made in the Exchequer Court to make the
Commissioner a party to the proceedings?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
unaware as to that. It was stated by the
Minister of Justice in another place that
the Court refused to hear the Commissioner.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
That, is on
appeal.
But had the Commissioner
appeared in the trial court-in the Exchequer Court?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes.
The Exchequer Court permitted him to
be heard by courtesy, although there was
no express condition or express provision
in the Act that he could appear before the
Court. The Court naturally desired that
the Commissioner should, as a party, present the case on behalf of the Crown.
But when the appeall went to the Supreme
Court the reverse was the case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I assume that
was because the Crown had not been made
a party before the trial court. Is it my
honourable friend's opinion that on an
application to the Court the Commissioner
of Patents, if he so desired, would have
been made a party to the proceedings?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
might have been made as a' matter of
procedure or practice, as would appear on
the pleadings of the Court. What the
practice is I cannot say. However, the
Government is advised by the Department
of Justice that this is really necessary if
the Commissioner of Patents desires to be
made a party in a proceeding before the
courts.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should have
thought that if the Commissioner of Patents
had made an application to be made a
party to the proceedings in order to defend
the interests of the public or the Crown
there would have been no difficulty, and
that the difficulty arose because that proceeding was not taken in the Exchequer
Court. Had he been made a party, he
would have had a locus standi before the
Court of Appeal. I do not quite see the
necessity of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I could not hear
what the honourable the leader said, as
one cannot hear in this Chamber when he
is three or four seats away. I should like
to know what reason there is for providing
that the Commissioner of Patents shall
have the right to advocate a case in any
of the courts.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He is
the one officer of the Crown who is more
familiar than any other officer with the
case in question. I will not say it has not
been the practice to make him a party to
the proceeding, because I am not familiar
with patent practice in either the Exchequer Court or the Supreme Court; but in
the case to which I referred he apparently
was not made a party, although he was
heard in the Exchequer Court, and when
he made an application to appeal before the
judge of the Supreme Court, the judge of
that court held that lie had no standing in
the court and therefore could not be heard.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Well, he was
not a party to the proceeding.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Precisely. That simply reduces the question
to this. If the pleadings should omit to
make him a party and consequently it comes
down to a technical question of the form
of procedure, he cannot be heard.
Is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
there not a misunderstanding about this
section. The section says:
The Commissioner of Patents shall be entitled
to appear on behalf of the Crown and as representing the interests of the publie and be heard
by counsel.

What the section is to bring about, as I
read it, is what the honourable member for
suggested
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
should be brought about, that the commissioner should become a party to the action;
but not that he should be heard, excepting
It says, "and be heard by
by counsel.

MARCH 31, 1921
counsel." As I understand the section, it
is' not to give him the status of an advocate in the court. Is that what the intention is-to give him status as an advocate?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; it
is to give him the necessary authority so
that he inay becoine a party to the proceeding. It seems to me that, as representing the public, or as representing that
particular branch of responsibility on behall of the Crown, he should be made a
party. He is peculiarly the person that
should be made a party to the proceeding.
If not him, I do not know whom you should
rnake a party.,
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: He
can intervene as the King's proctor does in
England.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes;
and I presume that the Commissioner of
Patents will not appear in person before
the court, but will appear by counsel.
Hon.,Mr. BELCOURT: I have no objection to the Bill at ail, but I want to point
out that in this particular case the Coinmissioner of Patents, if he had insisted on
his rights, could have been made and would
have been made a Party to the proceeding
and Would have had a standing in the
Court of Appeal. I understand that what
my honourable friendl is really aiming at
is to provide that the right of the Commissioner to appear shall not be dependent
upon an application to the court, but that
he shaîl have that right in any case without applying to the court.

POST OFFICE BILL
FLJRTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE'
AND REPORTED

The Senate again went into cammittee
on Bill F, an Act to amend the Post Office
Act.-Hon. Mr. Blondin. Hon. Mr. Gordon
in the Chair.
On section 8-obligations of ferrymen
(Exchequer Court substituted for arbitrators):
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Honourable gentlemen, when the comnxittee adjourned yesterday we were discussing clause 3. The
suggestion. was made that instead of the
proposed amendment a new one should be
adopted; consequently, I would move:
That In the flfth Une of section 88 îvIl the
words after the word "service' be struck out
and that the fallowing be substituted therefor:
"ahlil in no case exceed what la ordinarily
charged ta the public."

Sa that the whole clause as amended will
rèad as follaws:
3. Section eighty-elght of the said Act 18
repealed and the following le substituted tlherefor:
"88. Every ferryman shall, upon request and
withaut deïlay, convey over his ferry any caurier
or other persan travelling wlth the mail, and

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I desire to draw
my honourable friend's attention to this
point. I noticed when he was speaking
he used the works, 'Iappear by tounsel."
If he will look at the Bill he will see that
the side note says "appear by couinsel,"

wdlling ta pay, the amount ta be paid shall be
flxed by the Exchequer Court of Canada.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want ta point
out to niy honourable friend that his
amendment does not alter the situation,
because there is no 'sanction ta the provision in case it is not carried out. A
ferryman may charge more than what he
charges ordinarily to the public, and there
is no provision made with regard to that
at ahl; there is not evefi a remedy created,

which the court could be asked to grant.
The amendment as you now have it is simply words without meaning and bas no
sanction.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:. The Post Office
Act provides for the imprisonment of anybody interfering with the carrying of the
mails.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that would
not be the case.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The trouble we
had'in the- past was that there was no law
stating exactly what the charges ought to

ferryman shall not charge more than he
would charge to the public. Suppose that
a dispute should arise between the ferryman and the courier, the ferryman would
have to convey the courier, and instead of
appointing arbitrators, as was provided
for in the former law, we would simply go
to the ordinary court, and leave it to the
court to decide what would be the proper
sum for the courier to pay. As it is stated
in this amendment that the sum must not
exceed what is charged to the public, I do
not see that we shall have any trouble.

charged to the public.

is entitled to charge the public. There is
no sanction. There is not even a remedy
created, to enable the mail-carrier to recover.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But suppose he
does charge more, what then?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not the
case I am putting. I agree with my honourable friend when he puts that case, but
I am putting an altogether different one.
I am putting the case of the ferryman who
has taken the mail-carrier across and then
exacts from him considerably more than
he . would get ordinarily from the public.
The law says that the ferryman shall not
do that, but if he does do it, what sanction
or remedy is there? You do not provide
for any.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: We go to the
court.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The courier will
be carried with his mail. The ferryman
cannot stop him.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: When the ferryman wants to collect more than what is
due to him, he shall not be paid. That is
the answer.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But suppose
that the courier, having to deal with a man
bigger and stronger than himself, finds it
necessary to pay more than the proper
rate? Suppose the ferryman says, "I will
not let you get off unless you pay me."
The man who wants to charge more will
try to get more, and there is no sanction
in case he does. Suppose the mail-carrier
does pay him twice or three times what he

honourable friend suggest?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know

Exchequer

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I suggest that
you must have some sanction to that.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: There is a sanction in the general Post Office Act, which
provides for the imposition of a penalty
on anyone who interferes with the carrying of the mails.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But the ferryman in this case is not interfering with
the carrying of the mail. He bas carried
it; he bas got the courier across; but he
says, "You have to pay me"-so much.
And if the courier does pay the excessive
charge, what remedy is there to recover
the money which bas been overpaid? There
is no sanction.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Well, let us take
a concrete case. Let us suppose for a moment that the ferryman refuses to carry
him-

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask my
honourable friend how the ferryman does
exact that excessive amount? How can
he? He has taken the courier across; he
is on the other shore. He goes to him and
asks him for a sum that he bas not the
right to collect. The other man refuses,
and rightly so. What then? Will the
courier be compelled by physical force to
pay? Is that the contention of my honourable friend?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
likely.

Possibly. Very

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: He will? Then
that would be a case of assault and battery.
Then the courier has ail the sanctions of the
Criminal Code. What else does my honourable friend want?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not the
case I put, at ail. A courier, for some
reason best known to himself, choses flot
to have the fight which my honourable
friend bas. just described. He says: "I
arn not going to fight over this. I will pay
you rather than fight." H1e pays, and he
bas no remedy. That is the end of it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In that case,
cannot the courier then dlaim the money
that he has overpaid?

You do flot
Say so.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Certainly.

I have no objection to the motion passing

it seems to me that each week should take
care of itself. We have not so very much
to do in this Chamber at the present time
that honourable gentlemen who are favorable to such an adjournment should flot.

THE LATE HON. SENATOR CROSBY
TRIBUTffS TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: About
the time this Chamber adjouîned for the
Easter holidays we were grieved to hear
of the death of oui late colleague, Senator
Crosby. H1e appeared in his place at the
opening of the House and made a vigorous
speech upon the Addîess in îeply to the
Speech from the Thione, leaving an impression upon the House of vitality and
vigour, both of mind and of body. A few
days after we were surprised to leain of
his serious illness, followed by his almost
sudden death.

XDITION.

178

SENATE

Politics to the late senator was as the
breath of life. He had for a generation
been prominent in the counsels and in the
battles of his party. For many years he
was interested in the municipal affairs of
the city of Halifax and was honoured by
the confidence of his people in being elected
to the mayoralty of that city for several
years. For some years he sat as the
representative of the city of Halifax in
the House of Commons, and was afterwards
appointed to this Chamber, in which he
sat for over four years. During that time
there was no one more actively interested
in the discussions which took place upon
the floor of the House than the late senator.
He was a warm advocate of whatever
cause be espoused. No matter to what
extent he differed from his opponents, there
was a tolerance in his attitude on all questions that appealed to the broad sympathies
of his opponents and likewise to the public.
In this Chamber, where a measpre of repression is more or less applied by speakers
in giving expression to their views on publie
questions, it was a matter of interest to
the members of the Senate to observe the
vigour and the feeling with which Senator
Crosby invariably gave pronouncement to
the views which he entertained upon all
questions that he discussed.
On account of his striking personality
we shall miss him in the deliberations of
this Chamber. Our sympathies go out
to his widow and family in the bereavement which they have thus suffered.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, I desire to join with the honourable leader of the Government in the expression of regret that be bas pronounced
with regard to the death of Senator Crosby,
which I am sure came as a great shock to
all of us. When we heard of his illness
we did not realize that it was so serious
and might terminate as it bas done. All
of us who have known Senator Crosby
have observed that, as the honourable
leader has said, in anything he took up be
was energetic and forceful, giving expression to his opinions with a vim and
strength that impressed all who heard him.
Notwithstanding the strength of his opinions, on no occasion that I can remember
did Senator Crosby say an unkind word
about his opponents. He was always ready
to speak well of them, no matter how much
they differed with him. We shall miss
him in this Chamber. I desire to join with
my honourable friend in conveying an expression of our regret to his widow and
the members of his family.

incorporate the Canadian Bar Association.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would my honourable friend kindly explain the object of
this Bill?
'Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I think the Bill really
explains itself. There is now an association
of the members of the various provincial
Bars, for the whole Dominion. The association is' unincorporated, and it is desired
to incorporate it so that it may own
property and carry on its business as a
corporate body. This will in no way affect
the different provincial bar associations, nor
enable any member to practise at any bar,
but is purely for the purpose of selfimprovement and for encouraging good-will
among the members of the association belonging to the bars of the different provinces.

bar associations?

INQUIRzy

Han. Mr. BOSTOCK inquired of the Government:,
1. Have any communications or messages of
any kind passed between the Canadian Government, or any member of it, with the British
Government, or any person on behaif of the
Britieh Government, with reference to the
appointment of a successor to, Hîs Excellency
the G0overnor General?
2. If so, what is the purport of these communications?

S-12à

3. H-ave the names of any persons been submitted to the Canadian Governmeflt wlth a view
to ascertaining whether or not these persons
would be acceptable to the Canadian authorIties?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not in a position to bring down any papers
or to answer the question. If any communications or messages on this subject
passed between the two Governments mentioned, this Governement would regard
the matter as being confidential and not
one as to which the papers should be laid
upon the Table of the House. The office
is one peculiarly within the authority of
the Imperial Goverament, and, while every
courtesy would doubtless be shown to Canada as to any appointment to be made, yet
it would flot be desirable that thîs Government should suggest any particular appointee for the office; nor is it, ini the judgment of this Government, desirable that
under present conditions the Imperial Government should in any sense relinquish or
divide its responsibility in any appointment so to be made.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIfN: So this is one
of the many questions in respect to which
we are not a nation-not even a sister
nation.

the Pacifie Coast which was negotiated between
Canada and the United States at the beginning
of 1920 been formally assented to by the governments of both countries?

THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
MOTION

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK moved:
That the Public Accounts of Canada and
Volumes 1, 2 and 3 of the Auditor General's
Report, for the fiscal year endi.ng March 31,
1920, be referred to the Standi.ng Committee on
Finance.

fHe said: I am not quite sure that these
reports have been brought down to this
House, but I presume there will be no
objection to the motion going through on
that ground, because I understand that the
custom is for the reports to be laid on
the Table of the Senate at the same time
that they are laid on the Table of the
House of Commons. If they have not already been laid on the Table of the Senate
I presume that is an omission that can be
easily remedied. I might draw my honourable friend's attention to the fact that the
fourth volume was laid on the Table in
another place yesterday. Possibly he would
allow the motion to be amended accordingly.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
no doubt that by the time the Public Accounts Committee of this House gets
through volumes 1, 2, and 3, we shall have
the fourth volume.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The fourth volume
is available now.
The motion, amended as ýsuggested, was
agreed to.
REPORTS

OF GOVERNMENT
RAILWAYS

are given the consolidated balance sheet
of the Canadian Northern railway, made
to December 31, 1919. I do not know
whether other honourable gentlemen of
this House have received it, but I received
a copy of that report some time in May
of last year. I should like to ask the
leader of the Government if we could not
have the report up to December 31, 1920.
I might poipt out that the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company the other day issued
their report to December 31, 1920, and
for the purpose of making comparisons it
would be useful if we could have the report
of the Canadian Northern up to the end
of 1920.
I would also like to ask my honourable
friend if it would be possible for the members of this House to obtain the report
of the Grand Trunk Railway Company to
the end of 1920.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
make inquiry as to the report of the Canadian National Railway; but as to the report of the Grand Trunk railway, I may
say that we have as yet no authority over
that railway..
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I beg the bonourable gentleman's pardon. The Grand
Trunk railway bas filed a report in the
Railway Department, and it bas not been
divulged.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
my honourable friend bas the information
now.

IMPORTATION OF LIQUOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

INTO

INQUIRY

Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK rose
accordance with the following notice:

in

That he will call attention to a press despatch
of the 7th of March, 1901, appearing in the
Citizen, a paper published in Ottawa, and will
inquire if the Government intend to introduce
legislation this Session which wdill enable the
Government of the province of British Columbia
to prevent the importation of alcoholic liquors
into that Province except when imported by
a duly authorized official of that Governnient.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I do-not
propose to take up much of the time of
this House, but I want to make a few remarks in order to place this question properly before the Chamber. The particular
item to which this inquiry refers, which
appeared in the Ottawa Citizen of the 7th
U March last, says:
Victoria, March 6.-The propoAed application
to Ottawa to prohibit importation of intoxicating
liquor into British Columbia, except through
the provincial government, does not mean that
there will be any delay in passIng the Government Control Bill, Premier John Oliver declared
yesterday. "My idea is that we should get our
bill paséed, and then we should prepare a bill,
with a view of getting the Dominion Parliament to pass it, supplernenting our legislation,
so that our act will not be shot to pieces
through lack of anythinýg," he said.
"ShouId Ottawa propose that we hold a plebiscite," he continued, "on the question of prohibiting importation, our answer will be that
this matter bas been before the people of British Columbia and bas the approval of the legislature, therefore, it is not necessary to take a
vote."
As the legislation by Ottawa should, be only
a formal matter, the premier believes that there
will be time for it to be put through between
the passing of the liquor bill by the legislature
and date it is to be bro4ght into force.

Which I believe is to be the lst of May.
If Ottawa accedes to the request of the province, there /will be no need for the $2.50 a
quart tax on private importations or the heavy
licenses proposed for whlesalers who might
want to compete with the govern'ment.
.

Since that time the Liquor Control Bill
of British Columbia has been passed, and,
I believe, is to go into effect on the lst of
May next. About the same time a question
was asked of the Prime Minister with regard to this matter, which I do not think
was put to him in a clear enough way to
enable him to answer it intelligently. The
question was asked by Mr. Stevens, who
said:
Another question I should like to ask is:
will the Prime Minister please state if, in the
opinion of the Government, the present Canada
Temperance Act, known as the Doherty Act,
wiIl prevent importation of liquor into provinces to the full extent of the prohibitory laws
of each province?

.

1

181

In answer to that question the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen said:
In answer to the first question, whether the
statement of the Attorney General has been
brought to my attention, I can say that it was
not until brought in the forrn of the question
to-day. In answer to the second question,
whether the Act known as the Doherty Act 1s
worthless, or invalid, I have no hesitation in
saying "No." As to whether provinces have
refused to avail thenselves of its provisions,
having adopted prohibitory measures, I would
say that no province bas done so, because it
la a Dominion Act and goes into effect by
virtue of the force of a Dominion statute,
irrespective of the will of any province, once
that province passes laws relating to liquor
within its own domain. As to whether the Act
prevents ingress of liquor to be used contrary
to the laws of the province, I say that it does;
those are its terms and the validity of its
terms has never been challenged.

What I want to point out to the House

in connection with this matter is that unfortunately Mr. Stevens in putting his question confused the Canada Temperance Act
with the Act of 1916, chapter 19 of 6 and
7 George V, which is sometimes known as
the Doherty Act. I think it is quite clear
to honourable members of this House that
the legislation that has been passed with
regard to the control of liquor in British
Columbia would not in any way come under
what is known as the Canada Temperance
Act, because the Canada Temperance Act
supposes that there will be total prohibition of the use of intoxicating liquor in a
province, and the procedure required is that
the legisiature shall pass a resolution asking the Dominion Government to hold a
plebiscite, and, if that is done, then the
people of the province have an opportunity
of saying whether or not they desire the
total prohibition of the importation of
liqour into the province. But this is not
at all the present position with regard to
British Columbia. The people of British
Columbia voted in favour of the Government control of liquor, and in accordance
with that decision the Provincial Legislature has placed on the statute book a law
which gives the Government the control
of liquor in the province. But the question
is whether, under the Act of 1916, the Provincial Government has the power to prohibit the importation of liquor into the
province. The provincial authorities apparently think that they have not, and in
order to try to control the situation they
have provided for a tax of $2.50-I.do not
know whether that is a gallon or a quart.
The $2.50 is to be paid by whoever imports the liquor. In that way an attempt
is made to keep control of it.

182

SENATE

I think I may say on liehalf of the people
of British Columbia that they are very
desirous that this question of control of
liquor should be properly and fairly handled; that there should be no abuse of it;
and that the Government, in trying to
control the liquor situation properly and
to prevent abuse of liquor in the province,
is entitled to obtain, if necessary, the assistance of legislation by this Parliament.
In the Bill as it was introduced in the
Provincial Legislature there is no special
clause that I can find dealing with this
question of importation, other than the
provision for the tax. By section 26 of the
Bill the sale of liquor by anybody except
the agent of the Government is absolutely
prohibited. Then section 28 says:
Excepit as provrided in this Act, no person
shall, wfithin the pnovintoe, by himsellf, his
clerk, servant, or agent, attempt to purchase,
or directly or indireotly or. upon any pretence
or upon any devilce purohase, or in consideration of the sale or transfer of any property,
or for any other consideration, or at the time
of the transfer of any property, take from any
other person any liquor.

The intention evidently is as far as
possible to prevent any persons from deal-

ing with liquor within the limits of the

province, and I think that all those who

voted last year in favour of giving the
Government the control of liquor are in
favor of that position.
The Act of 1916 provides:
Any person who by himself, his clerk, servant or agent, and any person who as clerk,
servant or agent, oificer or employee of any
other person, or of any Government rai.lway or
steamiship, whether Dominion or Provincial,
(a) shall send, ship, take, bring or carry
or cause to be sent, shipped, taken, brought
or carried to or into any province from or out
of any other province, or import into any
province
from
any
place
outside
of
Canada
any
intoxicating
liquor,
knowing or intending, that such intoxicating liquor
will or shall be thereafter dealt with in
violation of the law of the province into
which such intoxicating liquor is sent, shipped,
taken, brought or carried into any province
aforesaid; or
(b) shall sell or cause to be sold any intoxicating liquor, knowing or intending that
such tntoxicating liquor will be sent, shipped,
taken, brought,
carried or
imported as
from any other province, or from any place
outside of Canada, and thereafter dealt with
in violation of the law of the province into
which such intoxicating liquor is sent, shipped, taken, brought, carried or imported as
Lforesaid,
shall be liable on summary conviction to a
penalty for the first offence of not less than one
hundred dollars and not exceeding two hundred
dollars, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months, with or without bard labour,
and for a second offence to a penalty of not less
than two hundred dollars.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

The difficulty that I see in connection with
the matter would be the question whether
the person selling the liquor in another
province could be held to know whether it
was intended that such intoxicating liquor
should thereafter be dealt with in violation
of the law; and I presume that that is the
difficulty that has presented itself te the
Attorney General of the province of British
Columbia.
I have brought up this question because,
from the answer given by the Prime Minister in another place, it seemed to me that
the matter was left in a very unsatisfactory
and awkward position, and I thought it
only right to bring it to the attention of
the Government, in order that they might
give it proper consideration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I should like to answer
this question by asking my honourable
friend from Kamloops another question. I
think it is really for my honourable friend
to answer the question that is on the Order
Paper. Is he aware whether the Government of British Columbia has asked this
Government to pass legislation of any kind?
If it has not so requested, I see no reason
why we should do it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I presumed, from
the statement in this newspaper that I have
read, that an application had been made.
It was on that I based my remarks.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It does
not state that, and I may say to my bonourable friend that I am entirely unaware
of this matter having been brought before the Government.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOUK: The honourable
gentleman bas not had a chance of seeing?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I mean
in an official way.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Suppose someone wants to import wine for his own
private use, do the Government think that
under the British North America Act they
have the right to prevent him from importing wine, provided he pays the duty?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
province to another?

From one

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Into Canada.
Suppose that, as bas been the custom for
years, persons who are absolutely sober
import claret by the barrel from the other
side. Is it the intention of the Government to restrict the liberty to import claret
by the barrel, as some one very near me
often does? Do the Government claim they

183

APRIL 6, 1921
have that right? And do you think certain
provinces would have entered Confederation
if they thought their people were to be
deprived of having a glass of claret if
they wanted it?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. THORNE: Or champagne.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I hope
my honourable friend will not look so
severely at me, because I have not expressed
any disapproval of his importing a barrel
of claret, especially if he is sober. He bas
put it on that ground.
OIL SHALES, IRON ORE, COAL, ETC.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER moved:
That the following Senators, to wit: the
Donnelly,
Domville,
Messieurs
Honourable
MeMeans, Ratz,
Girroir, McLean,
Farrell,
Schaffner, Tessier, Thibaudeau, Turriff, Willoughby, and the mover, be appointed a special

fuel deposits of Canada.
2. Whether or not further and better facilities
might be placed at the disposal of the Department of Mines for the investigation of the
above subjects.
And further that the Committee be empowered to send for persons, papers and records,
and, subject to the approval of the Senate,
to employ such clerical aid as may be necessary
to properly carry on the Committee's i.nvestigation.

The motion was agreed to.

pleased to have an opportunity to be present when it came up again before the
House. The honourable member for Stadacona represents the division wherein is
situated the port of Quebec. He bas acquired considerable experience in the administration of his various business enterprises, some of which are located in the
city of Quebec. He was for several years
a member of the Quebec Harbour Commission, and made a special study of the
possibilities of Quebec to become a great
national port. He bas built and operates
one of the most modern coal plants of Canada in the very port of Quebec, a plant
which is to-day one of the principal sources
of revenue of that port and stands as a
monument to remind our business men that
enterprise and energy, coupled with modern
methods, are the chief factors in the development of trade. Had my honourable
friend's early training been in the grain
business I have no doubt that what he has
done to develop the coal trade in the port
of Quebec he could have accomplished with
the same measure of success in the grain
business. I feel, therefore, that if he will
give us his views on the questions raised
by this motion, they are bound to carry
very Valuable suggestions.
it was my privilege during the course of
the Session of 1917 to address honourable
members on this very subject. I then expressed a hope, that, with the completion
of the Quebec bridge and the acquisition by
the Government of the Canadian Northern
and Transcontinental railways, the port of
Quebec would be used for the export of a
portion of the western grain now finding
an outlet through American channels. Unfortunately my hopes have not been
realized. It is not my intention to repeat
to-day the remarks which I made at some
length on that occasion. I will merely add
that I am glad and proud, as one hailing
from Quebec, to note a new spirit among
its citizens. Young, energetic, and enterprising men of business are coming to the
fore and are giving much of their time to
the study of economic problems, affecting
not Quebec alone but the whole commonwealth. They have laid the case of the
district and of the port of Quebec before
the Government in a sensible and businesslike manner; but it will not rest there. I
trust, therefore, that just grievances will
be remedied as fast and in so far as it is
in the power of the Government to remedy
them.
One of the first things which, in my
humble opinion, should be done is to see
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE.

that the Quebec terminals are completed
and equipped on the lines agreed upon with
the city of Quebec. The Government is
bound in honour to fulfil that contract. I
submit that it is during times of trade depression that we should carry on public
works. By so doing we will provide work
for the unemployed and make the country
ready to take advantage of good times when
they return. In other words, I would say
to the honourable gentlemen entrusted with
the administration of this fast growing
Dominion: Plan and build for the future
while business is stagnant, money is cheap
and unemployment prevails. In times of
prosperity and industrial expansion, stop
expenditures on public works, economize,
and reduce the public debt by increasing
taxation, if you must, because the people
will then be in a better position to shoulder
the burden.
A campaign is now on which every good
citizen should help: it is to encourage the
purchasing of Canadian instead of American-made goods. May I suggest that this
campaign be extended to include the building of Canadian instead of American
ports?
And if my humble voice could carry beyond the precincts of this Chamber, I
would venture to address the eminent
statesman who, in the other House, occupies the seat once filled by that great leader,
Sir John A. Macdonald, whose popularity
in Quebec was second only to that of my
illustrious compatriot, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and I would respectfully say to him:
You are desirous of having my province
more largely represented in your Council,
and so are we. Those who wish you well in
Quebec, and their numbers are fast increasing, realize and appreciate your present difficulties.- They are not anxious that
you make undue haste in the choice of your
French Canadian colleagues. But-in the
meantime-an earnest effort to settle
grievances such as were submitted to your
Government in the memorandum prepared
by the city authorities, the Board of Trade,
and the Harbour Commission of Quebec
will be a step in the right direction; it will
help to dispel misunderstandings and to restore confidence.
Hon. LORNE C. WEBSTER: Honourable gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure
to support the motion made by the honourable gentleman from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Tessier) and spoken to by other
honourable members of this House. There
were, I understand, some agreements or
contracts between the Transcontinental

APRIL 6, 1921
Railway Commission and the citizens of
Quebec, entered into in the year 1904 and
confirmed in 1910, which the public bodies
of the city of Quebec claim are still unfulfilled. Perhaps I may be permitted to
summarize thèm as follows. Among the
papers asked for in this motion I understand there is a claim by the city of Quebec
involving some $600,000,
representing
money subscribed by the city of Quebec
towards the building of two local railways
which now form part of the Canadian
National Railway system. It is considered
that this minority stock, belonging now to
the city of Quebec, should be taken over
and paid for on the same basis as the stock
of Mackenzie and Mann, which, I understand, was paid for at the rate of some
18 cents on the dollar. I have no doubt,
honourable gentlemen, that this claim has
received and will receive the serious -consideration of our Government.
There was also an arrangement made
in regard to what was known as the
Champlain Street property, in exchange
for which, along with some other considerations, a suitable station building was to be
erected. The citizens of Quebec claim that
the temporary building erected does not
meet the requirements nor fulfil the terms
of the contract.
The Improvement of railway train service
in the district of Quebec, in order to afford
better railway accomodation for freight and
passengers, is also a matter , of . their
petition.
You are all fully aware of the natural
advantages and facilities possessed by the
harbour of Queb,ee-deep water channels
from Quebec to the sea, deep berths and
loading piers in the harbour of Quebec,
and docks capable of accommodating several
oceansteamers at the same time. A large
grain elevator has been built in the city
of Quebec at the instance of the Dominion,
and track facilities, with railway yards
suitable fur a large import and export
trade through the city of Quebec, have also
been provided. There converge in the city
of Quebec three transcontinental railways,
and nature -lias certainly designed Quebec
to be one of the large shipping ports of
this continent. I need not refer to thè
accommodation available for the shipment
of cattle, nor do I need, I am sure, to enlarge on the exceptional facilities for
passenger service whereby ocean passengers and travellers may embark to or debark from ocean steamers with the least
inconvenience of any port on the North
American continent.

185

Why was the Transcontinental railway
built into Quebec? It was built, honourable gentlemen, to save mileage in the haul
of Western grain for export; it was built
as a spout which would permit the flow of
Northwestern grain to ocean steamers; it
was built with easy grades and straight
lines, so that one locomotive can haul quite
as many cars over this system as over other
lines of railway that also centre in Quebec.
A locomotive can start a train with some
sixty cars on the level, and run right
through to Quebee. The mileage over the
Transcontinental is over 200 miles less
than that over the other two lines. I am.
informed the railways west of Winnipeg
also have the right by law to full access
to the advantages and privileges of this
railway, but I find that since 1916 not one
bushel of grain bas come from the West
on the Transcontinental railway, which was
built for the purpose which I have briefly
outlined, but that this grain goes instead
largely via American ports.
I think, honourable gentlemen, that some
measure should be possible to prevent the
diversion of our Canadian grain trade to
American ports. I realize that there is
no fixed rail and water rate on grain from
Winnipeg to New York. The railway rate
from Winnipeg to Fort William is a fixed
rate, but there is water competition governing fromi the latter port to Buffalo. As
far as I can learn, the rate to-day by
rail and water from Winnipeg to New York
is some 33.96 cents per bushel, while the
all-rail rate from Winipeg to Quebes stands
at 36 cents. This, I think, is perhaps largely
the reason wh one of the greatest natural
ports in America is not used to the extent
that it should be.
I quote from a report which has come to
my hand:
The Government returns show that during
six years there were 1,096 million bushels of
grain shdpped by water from Fort William, of
which 518 million bushels went to Buffalo for
export via New York, and that of the remaining 578 million bushels sent to eleators and
Canadian lake ports a large proportion was converted Into flour for local consumption; another
large proportion also went to United States seaports, and only a small percentage was shipped
at Montreal and St. John. This result is most
disappointing and alarming, after ail the sacrifices that Canada has made to secure this trade.

By some mysterious influence ocean shipments by the Quebec route were stopped
and grain continued to go through New
York by the lake 'route, and now not a
bushel is carried over the Transcontinental,
which was built for the express purpose
of bringing this trade to Canadian seaports.

SENATE
There is one more important subject,
honourable gentlemen, which I should like
to touch upon for a minute or two, and
which affects not only Quebec, but Montreal and the whole Dominion: that is, the
disadvantage under which we are labouring
at the present time in regard to marine
insurance. Canadian ports are discriminated against, in comparison with American
ports, at the present time, and a much
higher rate is demanded for insurance on
cargoes from those ports, and, as you are
fully aware, there are valuable cargoes,.
amounting to many millions of dollars a
year, which require to be insured.
In view of the efficient work done by
our Marine Department, and the fact that
aids to navigation of the most approved
kind have been established, and that we
have one of the safest routes in America
to-day, this is a question whieh should be
carefully and fully considered. I am aware,
honourable gentlemen, of the financial
problems which affect not only our country
but the whole world at the present time;
but if some arrangement can be worked
out whereby Canadian grain can be carried
by Canadian railways and handled at Canadian ports and exported through Canadian
steamers, then I feel that additional wealth
and additional prosperity will come to this
country. It is in this spirit that I commend this matter to the consideration of
this honourable Chamber, feeling sure that
what is in the best interests of one port in
Canada is also in the best interests of the
Dominion as a whole.
Hon. FREDERIC NICHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, I had no intention of
rising to address the House on this qdestion, and I want to confess at the start
that I know very little in regard to the
details of the situation that has been so
capably outlined by the honourable gentleman from Stadacona (Hon. Mr. Webster).
I have learned enough, however, to determine me to look into this question further,
and to study what appears to be really
a considerable menace to this country. We
are talking all the time about purchasing
in Canada; we are at the moment face to
face with a serious depreciation of the
Canadian dollar; and when I learn that

over 100,000,000 bushels of wheat have

been diverted from Canadian ports to
United States ports because of a difference
of less than 3 cents a bushel, it seems to
me that is something
that should
make us all sit up and take notice.
I have had the opportunity since the opening of the House of just glancing at the
memorial that has been submitted by the
Hon. LORNE C. WEBSTER.

Quebec Board of Trade, and by that I
notice that eighty per cent of the grain
shipped from Winnipeg goes to American
ports. In these days, whpn we are face to
face with the tremendous deficits of our
railways, it seems to me absurd to call
upon the Government to lower the freight
rate instead of raising it in order to make
both ends meet. But, after all, while this
may not be a cure, if you give business
consideration to a business question you
may be able to work out some method and
reach a conclusion which may be satisfactory. What bas made England the great
exporting country she is? If she had been
making, say, 10,000 articles at $10 apiece,
the total would be $100,000. If she looked
for a profit of 20 per cent, that would give
ber $20,000 from a total production of
$100,000. But suppose she says, as she bas
"What we
said from time immemorial:
want is quantity; by increasing production
we can not only reduce the cost and meet
world competition, but also reduce the cost
to the consumer." Let us figure that out for
a moment. If instead of making 10,000
articles at $10, Great Britain makes 50,000 articles at $7.50. What is the result?
The. cost to the consumer is reduced by
$2.50, and the country makes ten per cent
profit on $375,000, or 37,500 instead of
$20,000. I have not studied the statistics
myself; but my authority is the honourable
member for Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster), and I have not the slightest reason
to doubt the statement that not one bushel
of grain bas been carried since 1916 over
the National Transcontinental railway,
which was built expressly for the purpose
of transporting grain. If that road were
so equipped and operated that, instead of
carrying 1,000 bush-ls at $10, it would
carry 50,000 bushels at $7.50, it would certainly be most advantageous to the
country.
I have been very much interested in what
bas been said by the honourable member
from the Gulf (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance) and
by the honourable member for Stadacona
(Hon. L. C. Webster); but in reading the
resolution that bas given rise to this debate, I cannot see that it would bring us
very much farther. The motion is simply
that an Order of the Senate do issue for
copies of all correspondence. We may get
the correspondence and the matter may rest
there. I think that someone should move
a resolution that would lead to a thorough
investigation of this whole situation. It is
not a question of politics or of geographical
position; it is purely a question of business

APRIL 6, 1921
-a question of proportion and calculation.
I hope, honourable gentlemen, that something may be done to secure a study of
this question in the interest of Canadian
shipments through Canadian ports.
We
have our merchant marine, and we have to
find work for it. We have thousands of
miles of railway that are non-supporting.
If we can attain the desired end of finding
traffie for our own railways and for our
own merchant marine, thereby helping to
improve the rate of exchange and to divert Canadian money from New York by
keeping it in Canada, we shall have accomplished something for the welfare of the
country at large.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to add but a few
words to what has been said on the question which has sa opportunely been brought
before this Chamber by the honourable
gentleman from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Tessier). The purpose of this resolution is
to lay before this House the complaint of
the city of Quebec regarding the diversion
of the no'rthwest grain trade to New York.
All that has been said in favor of an effort
being made to have the Western crops carried to our own seaports has the full approval, I am sure, of all the members of
this Chamber.
There is a question which runs parallel
with this, and to which I think attention
should be drawn. We have heard the complaint about our trade being diverted to
American ports, but there is the question
of the return freight from the other side
of the line, with which, I think, we could
well afford to dispense. It consists of the
coal imported from the United States. You
have all observed the millions we have
yearly paid to the United States to bring
anthracite from Pennsylvania to our cities.
We all deplore our railway situation, but
I am convinced that if some attention were
given to the solution of the coal problei
there would be freight for our own railways in the hundreds of thousands of tons
of coal to be shipped from the West to the
East, to the great advantage of this country in the miniig of the coal, in its transportation ta the East, and In the promotion
of that national trade which should be developed to the fullest extent. Our Alberta
coal deposits are immense. The mine
owners of Alberta have already succeeded
in sending their coal as far east as Winnipeg. Our mine owners of Nova Scotia
have succeeded in bringing their coal to
Montreal. They have not done sa since the

18'

beginning of the war, but previous to that
time they shipped coisiderable quantities
of coal to Montreal. May we not hope that
by a slight effort the coal from Alberta
could be shipped east from Winnipeg to
Fort William and thus reach the province
of Ontario? Could we not likewise succeed
in getting coal from the East shipped a
little farther west than Montreal, so as ta
supply the whole province of Quebec and
part of, eastern Ontario? I recognize that
we have been in the habit of using anthracite, but in many countries people have
heated their homes with soft coal. Great
Britain bas done sa and is still doing sa. I
am convinced that a process could be devised for transforming our soft coal of the
West and of the East in such a way as to
make it acceptable to those who have hitherta used anthracite. We have in Alberta
coal that has been briquetted.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
katchewan?

What about Sas-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend from Portage la Prairie asks,
"What about -Saskatchewan?" They have
their lignite mines, and there is lignite also
in Alberta. I am convinced that if this
Parliament and the Government would give
serious attention ta the problem, we could
free this country from a position of dependence upon the United States. Would
it not be a splendid thing for Canada ta
obtain its fuel supply from the immense deposits in the Rocky Mountain district and
in the extreme East, and thereby create
wealth for the country? It would create
wealth at the mines and in the transportation of their products, and would help to
overcome the high exchange rate from
which we are suffering. I offer thesé few
remarks without having - given much
thought ta the question; but it occurs to me
that, as our Western coal has reached Winnipeg and our Eastern coal has reached
Montreal, it should be a fairly easy problem
ta make our coal shipments from the West
and from the East meet at some point on
the shores of Lake Ontario.
Hon. A. McCALL: I have given a little
study in years past ta the question that is
before the House, so ably brought forward
by the representatives of the cities of Quebec and Montreal, and I would like ta offer
a few remarks. It is certainly a great disappointment ta the people of Canada, after
their enormous expenditures upon transportation lines, to find that about half the
products of the West reach the ultimate

[88

SENATE

consumers by American channels. But we
must face conditions as they are, and I will
direct my few remarks to that point.
When the product of the West reaches
the lakes at Port Arthur or Fort William
it becomes, to a large extent, open to general competition.
The American buyer
goes there and buys largely. We cannot
control the movement of that grain any
longer. He prefers to send it through
American channels, and it is for that reason, and because he buys largely, of wheat,
flax-seed, and oats, that diversion of these
commodities takes place.
But there is something more than that.
The honourable member who has just
spoken bas referred to the question of
returned cargoes. Now, let us imagine the
grain merchant on Monday morning opening up his week's operations.
He goes to
his office and he gets quotations from Liverpool. He has in a short time quotations
from Winnipeg to operate that day.
He
immediately gets quotations on freight
from brokers in Montreal and in New
York. There is a difference, as there is
always likely to be, depending upon the
volume of freight moving and the volume
of return cargoes across the ocean. The
quotation he gets from New York is more
favourable than that from Montreal.
Either he is compelled to turn down his
day's operations, or a contract is placed
and he makes his purchase and makes his
sale. He cannot do otherwise and stay in
business. He makes his purchase in Winnpeg-we will say 1,000,000 bushels, which
is only a very small quantity.
He bas
negotiated his freight, and the shipment
follows. In working out that transaction
he takes into consideration the question of
time. His purchase carries interest and
insurance. Now, two vessels start from
Fort William at the same time, each carrying 10,000 tons of grain.
One reaches
Buffalo, and the other, at the same hour,
reaches Port Colborne. The shipment from
Buffalo can be made over five or six doubletracked railways and can arrive in New
York harbour in perhaps 48 hours, or a
little longer. The shipment via the Canadian route must go through the Welland
canal to Kingston and then be transhipped
to barges going to Montreal, and then be
transhipped to the ocean steamer. Honourable gentlemen may remember that the
late Senator Richardson spoke at length
in this House on that question. He was an
acknowledged authority on transportation
and was the largest shipper of wheat in
Mon. Mr. McCALL.

Canada at the time, and he made it, to my
mind, quite clear that we could not contro!
the movement of grain by the American
route under present conditions. The American route would be eight or ten days
shorter than the other. The interest and
insurance and carrying charges for that
time would be a very comfortable profit.
Honourable members understand that
grain is handled on the very closest margin,
one-half or one-quarter of a cent a bushel,
or sometimes without profit, and many a
shipper is glad to get out even with a
small loss. With that handicap of time
against you there is certainly presented a
rather discouraging prospect of controlling
the shipment of the products of our own
lands through our own channels to our
own markets. By the enlargement of the
Welland canal, and, later on, the enlargement of the St. Lawrence canal, a 10,000ton lake vessel could proceed direct to
Montreal and tranship there; or possibly
the ocean freighter could be built on a little
broader lines with somewhat lighter
draught, so that it could make the trip
through the lakes to Fort William or to
Duluth, where a great deal of Canadian
We ought to
grain is shipped at times.
offer a route that would be in time and in
rate more favourable than the American
channels.
That brings us right up to the question
of further expenditure for transportation
facilities. Sometimes in reviewing our
transportation problems it would occur to
one who is not closely informed of the situation that it is perhaps a mistake to have
developed the harbours of Port Arthur
and Fort William rather than to have
built from Montreal or Quebec direct to
the Winnipeg gateway a double-tracked
line, so that grain would never come to the
lakes and never be exposed to American
competition. We older men remember that
at the inception of the Grand Trunk Pacific
the proposition was made that we should
proceed by the shortest line-over the line
of least resistance-from tide-water to the
Winnipeg gateway. We.have not succeeded,
and that is a matter of regret to us all.
But Fort William and Port Arthur have
been developed at very large expense to
the Treasury of this country, and we have
the Transcontinental line, possessing all
the advantages that have been stated by
my honourable friend here, and it is still
a wonder to me that that route has not
been developed more largely for grain shipments.

APRIL 6, 1921
There is the question of rates. If the rate
from Winnipeg to Quebec is three cents
higher 'than the rate from Winnipeg ta
New York, certainly the management of the
National system of railways could well
afford ta make a concession. of the difference, in order ta bring the traffic through
Canada and give employment that is se
badly needed just now for our National
railways.
Moreover, we have a Canadian merchant
marine. I think honourable members all
realize that by this time. It would seem
that a route could be established that would
move grain from the West ta Quebec harbour during the season of navigation, and
that the storage, interest, and insurance
would be at sufficiently low rates ta enable
grain to proceed during the winter ta the
port of St. John, which we are developing
at an enormous expense.
This jis a large question-perhaps a
little beyond the grasp of many. -I will
admit it is a little beyond mine. Perhaps
the return that has been asked for will
help us ta understand it better. It is still
early in the Session, and a committee might
be named ta examine this matter more
thoroughly. If there is anything lacking
on the part of the Government, or of our
trade organization, or shippers, or if there
is anything that -they can do that bas not
been done to develop fully our transportation systems, we ought to have all the
facts before us in order that we may see
just where we stand. I need hardly add
that thé railway problem is our greatest
problem and that honourable members of
this House and gentlemen in the other
Chamber are a good deal in doubt as to
what is the best thing ta do. But, what:
ever may be done, I am sure that the people
of this country will face the problem as
they have faced many other problems, with
courage and ability, and that in time
they will work out a solution which well be
for the good of our country.
Hon. W. H. BENNETT: I am sure the
city of Quebec owes a debt of gratitude
ta the honourable gentleman from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Tessier) for intro- ducing .this resolution, and ta the honourable gentleman from Stadacona (Hon. L.
C. Webster) for the way in which he has
supported it. I do not intend ta say any-,
thing in regard ta the terms of the resolution, which, of course, will as a matter of
course pass; but, since the discussion has
become general on the question of transportation, with the indulgence of the House
I shall make a few remarks.

18!

In the course of the remarks of honourable gentlemen, one undertaking or another
bas been referred ta as having had its beginning in the past twerity years. If Canada could blot out many of the transportation undertakings of the last twenty years,
it would be better for the country. But this
is ne time for vain regrets. We have the
National Transcontinental railway, the
deepening, of the Welland canal, and the
threatened enlargement of the St. Lawrence canals, and withal an annual expenditure of $600,000,000. A question which is
deserving of the consideration of every man
in this House and of every man who has
the interest of the country at heart is: is
it not time ta give this unfortunate-in
this respect-country a chance ta breathe
se that we may know where we really are
to-day?
I heard figures of grain rates quoted by
the honourable gentleman from Stadacona.
I understood him ta say that the rate from
Winnipeg ta New York was 33 cents and
the rate from Winnipeg ta Quebec over the
Canadian National was 36 cents. And the
question is asked, why, although an elevator has been built at Quebec, no grain bas
gone into it. I think the answer is easily
given. It is because no person was prepared ta ship grain that way, as money
would be lost by so doing.
Now, let us take the railway mileages
from Winnipeg ta Quebec. The mileage of
the Canadian Pacific railway from Winnipeg ta Quebec is 1,584 miles; the mileage
of the Canadian National railway is 1,396
miles; or a difference in favaur of the
Canadian National of 188 miles.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, it is 1,350
miles between Winnipeg and Quebec by the
National.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: That would make
a difference in faveur of the National road
of about 200 miles. • Well, if the National
road bas not carried a bushel of grain by
that way, neither has the Canadian Pacific
railway. And what is the reason? It is
because the Canadian Pacific railway bas
another system of transportation which
excels that in point of expense. It has from
Winnipeg ta Fort William a rate of about
11 cents a bushel; a rate ta Port McNicoll,
by water, of about 2 cents a bushel; and
a rail rate ta Montreal of 3 cents a bushel;
or a total of about 16 cents a bushel from
Winnipeg ta Motreal. Add ta that charges
for elevation of say 4 cents, and in round
figures you have a rate of 20 cents, which

SENATE
is better by 16 cents than the rate to Quebec. Of course, the National railway has
a better haul, but the experience of the
success of the other road should prompt
people to meditate.
What was the position of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway? It was a huge concern
having untold millions invested in it; it
was practically losing the grain trade that
it had carried to Fort William. The Canadian Pacific Railway depended on the rail
carriage from Owen Sound to Montreal.
The company then built a line of railway
from the lower part of Georgian bay,
Port MeNicoll, which compares with
any other line on the continent, because on it can be hauled a train of
70 cars, each containing 1,500 ibushels.
The building of this line necessitated a
large expenditure, and I assume that it
was not undertaken without due consideration; and the fact that they have worked
up the enormous trade of 50,000,000
bushels per year-because that is what it
bas been in the past few years-must be
a' sufficient source of satisfaction to the
owners of that railway. They were enabled to do this by their fleet of five large
vessels on the upper lakes and other vessels.
In addition to this grain trade, they carry
every year an enormous quantity of four,
which goes over the same line of railway
and passes out to Great Britain and Europe.
The trouble with most people, I think,
in considering the grain question, is that
they do not remember that what is only
practically a trifling quantity of our
western grain really goes to the Old Country. The Montreal Gazette has published
a very readable book with regard to the
port of Montreal, and I take these figures
from it. There were shipped from the
port of Montreal 56,634,539 bushels of
assorted grain in 1920-a very considerable
amount; and yet, of that grain there was
exported to Great Britain: of wheat, only
15,508,764 bushels-the balance, nearly
45,000,000 bushels, being scattered among
the different ports of the continent; also of
barley, from Montreal, 5,000,000 bushels;
of oats, 2,500,000 bushels; of rye, 6,500,000
bushels.
Now. the question is where Canada
stands to-day, because we cannot be too
solicitous about the Canadian Pacific railway. We have a great engagement on our
hands to-day: we have acquired the Canadian Northern railway, and we soon will
have the Grand Trunk railway. We have
not only these lines in the East, but we
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

have lines in the West as well, and it
should be the interest of Canada and of
the Canadian Government to see that every
energy is devoted to directing the grain
trade through these two railway systems.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Why cannot they
compete?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I think if some
of these gentlemen were wise enough they
would remedy the situation. The Canadian Northern railway is to-day almost a
fair competitor of the Canadian Pacific
railway, and for the gathering of grain
in the provinces of the Northwest, it is a
little more than a fair competitor. Take
a map of southern Manitoba, and look at
the network of railway lines there belonging to the people of Canada; take the
map of Northern Saskatchewan and Alberta, and look at the expanse of country
traversed by branches of the Canadian
Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific
railways. There are lines all through that
country, and if it develops as we hope it
will in a few years, it will be growing many
more millions of bushels of grain. The Canadian Northern railway people claim that
they have carried out of the Northwest
within the last three or four years about
35 per cent of the whole grain trade of
the three prairie provinces; and when you
add to that the business gathered up on
the Grand Trunk Pacific, you will see that
we are going to have a huge aggregate of
the grain trade on the National railways.
When the Canadian Northern railway
came to the head of the lakes, what became
of the grain which had heen accumulated?
That railway had no lines at all in Eastern
Canada. There it stood at Port Arthur
with'35 per cent of the grain trade of the
Northwest to be taken up by whom? First,
by the Canadian Pacific railway, which
would carry some to Port McNicoll, and,
second, by the Grand Trunk, which was
reaching out to carry it to Midland, Goderich, Collingwood, Parry Sound, or other
places where it had elevators; then, too,
there was always the huge American maritime interest waiting to take it to Buffalo. It was not a matter of sentiment if
the owner of grain preferred to ship it
from the head of the lakes by the Canadian
Northern railway; his only interest was
to get it to the head of the lakes as quickly
and as cheaply as he could.
Now things have changed. Canada has
the Grand Trunk railway and its upper
lake ports, and must and will gather in
not only the trade of the Grand Trunk

APRIL 6, 1921
Pacifie railway and its branches, but also
the trade garnered by the Canadian Northern railway in the West. Where is that
grain trade to find an outiet? The Grand
Trunk Railway company have a line from
Midland, which, aà Eastern Ontario men
well know, runs ýo Peterborough and across
to, Belleville, 'where it strikes the main
line. If that line from Midland were ail
like the main line, the country would have
a great asset; but unfortunately it does
not corne up to the saine high standard. Yet
in the past, without having the trade
specially idirected to it, that Uine fromn
Midland and Tiffin, which is practically the
saine place, has carried upwardý of 40,000,000 bushels of grain in a season.
The country has these two great railways on its bands, and it must attempt
as far as possible to bring the trade of
the Northwest over them to Montreal or to
some other port that will compete with
Buffalo. It is idle to, talk about taking the
trade in its entirety fromn Buffalo, because,
in the first place, ail of thé 200,000,000 bushels--putting it at that figure-is not ail exported overseas, but niuch is converted into
flour in Ontario and the other provinces.
A large proportion always finds its market
in the United States, where it is converted
into flour.
Then there is another factor. If you
look at the map, you will see that thýe grain
trade from Milwaukee and the Western
States cannot bie carried to the Eastern
States by way*of Buffalo as cheaply as it
eau be carried by way of the Georgian Bay
ports and Montreal. That trade lias always
been a large one at Midland, and no doubt
the samne is true of Port MeNicoll.
Assuming for the sake of argument that
we could bring hall of the grain trade of
the Northwest over the Government railway system to ports on the Georgian bay
owned by the Government, the next problem
is, where are we going to, place it in oceangoing ships? In the summer months we
could take it to Montreal; but unfortunately
the graino for export; is only reaching
Montreal when that port is closing up, for,
as every person knows, the grain of this
season cannot be threshed until after Montrelhabu
is closed. I read'in a paper the
other day that the Grand Trunk railway
proposed-I assume with the sanction of the
Government-to expend $500,000 more ,on
harbour improvements at Portland. Well,
if we are to have a.winter port for these two
Government railways, the only thing.I see to
do is to utilize Portland, because it gives
our railroads the advantage of the main

haul, which is no inconsiderable thing, and
you could work up a trade ifrom. Fort
William to, the Georgian bay ports that
would be favourable to, Canadian shipping,
because only Canadian vessels could ply
between those ports. What next do y;ou do?
You give an enormous lot of employment
to this co-ordinated system of Government
railways; and you give themn the benefit of
that trade as far at least as Montreal or
the border, where I suppose there would
be aichange of train crews. But Canada
is going to, get some of that trade. I know
honourable gentlemen from St. John will
say that the Canadian Pacifie railway is
carrying grain riglit through to, St. John.
It is true that it is, but not in any very
considerable quantity. I think last year's
figures show that it would be hardly over
5,000,000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think the honourable gentleman is mistaken.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: It was your
colleague from St. John (Hon. Mr. Thorne)
who informed me.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I do not know what
the figures are this' year; but the last
figures I saw showed about 19,000,000
bushels.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Well, I hope that
is true and that I arn in error; but, as I
understood the figures, they were about
5,000,000 bushels. That may have been
wheat, and the balance may have been other
kinds of grain. But, assuming that there are
20,000,000 bushels, so much the better. The
Canadian Pacifie railway has its line
established and must do business, and I
hope it may makeé it pay so well that it
will take double 19,000,000 bushels through
there. I think it is our duty to makeé every
possible iinprovement iu the harbour if it
is required.
I do not want to say anything to discourage the carrying of grain over the
Canadian National railway; but if auy
honourable gentleman will but close his
eyes hie can think of the spectacle of train
after train coming down the line, with its
perfect gradients, its absence of curves,
etc., aud the trains going back-with what?
Empties. That is the drawback to ail these
long hauls to-day. The upper lake'system
is the system that commended itself to, the
Canadian Pacific, despite the fact that they
had a rather long haul down to St. John.
It is the system that commended itself to,
the Grand Trunk Company in times past,
for I know that Mr. Hays, after assunhing
the management of the Grand Trunk, on

SENATE
one of his visits to the town of Midland,
expressed very high hopes of the large
trade that would be developed between that
point and Montreal in the summer months,
and Portland inýwinter.
But before we plunge into any more huge
expenditures, once again I say, let the
country breathe. There are men who tell
you to-day about the advantages that would
accrue to this country from the deepening
of the St. Lawrence canals. Well, it is
a big undertaking to deepen the St.
Lawrence canals, and the man is more
than a dreamer of dreams who can in fancy
see a vessel which, with the enlarged canal
system, could take a cargo of 200,000 or
500,000 bushles of grain from the head
of Lake Superior over to Great Britain.
To my mind it is the height of folly. You
can bring to-day a 100,000-bushel vessel, or
a 90,000, down to Montreal, and at a very
light charge you cmn there transfer the
grain into an ocean-going vessel for export
to England. That vessel, of course, bas
its passenger rates, amounting to a large
item; it next has its mail subvention; then
it has what might be termed its express
rates on bacon, eggs, and general freight,
and, with the advantage of the large
receipts from those sources, it takes in the
grain practically for the purpose of ballast.
And yet dreamers will tell you that vessels will carry 300,000 or 400,000 bushels
of grain from the head of the lakes over
to Great Britain. What would she bring
back?
There are better plans before the public
of Canada, which perhaps may be advocated before this debate is closed. There
is the Sydney plan, which I really think
bas a great deal of merit. I heard it discussed by members of the other House.
Sydney is in this unique pçsition, that it
can catch the freighters of every country
in the world more quickly than any other
Canadian port, such as Quebec or Montreal, on account of its position on the coast.
Those vessels could go in there and load
with coal and come to Montreal, and then,
once loaded with coal, if there was anything
in the system of carrying grain in a freight
vessel right through to the old country,
they could do it. They would have had
freight both ways. But the Sydney booster
-shall I term him?-advocates this plan.
Perhaps he is envious of that elevator at
Quebec that is not in use. Establish a similar one at Sydney. Load the vessel with
coal. Then, on the return, load ber with
wheat and store it in the elevator at Sydney. It will be in storage there, and a
chance freighter that might otherwise be
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

going empty will take it at a low rate. I
think that before the St. Lawrence canals
are deepened the Sydney scheme had better be taken into consideration, because to
my mind it is away ahead of the plan of
deepening the St. Lawrence. However, I do
not think we need be at all afraid of that
for the present.
Once again I say that the honourable
gentleman who introduced this resolution
deserves the thanks of the House for having given us an opportunity of discussing
the question. The city of Quebec and honourable members who are resident there
are to be complimented on the arguments
advanced in favour of Quebec's case.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, I do not wish to take up the time of
the Senate at any length; but when the
honourable member from Stadacona (Hon.
L. C. Webster) was speaking, he made
reference to a subject in connection with
this transportation system the importance
of which appeals to me very strongly, and
that is the great difference in the rate of
marine insurance between our Atlantic
ports and the ports of the United States.
When I was appointed to this Chamber,
in 1912, I moved that the Senate
issue an Order for a return, which I
obtained, showing the rates of insurance
from all our Atlantic and Gulf ports from
the pofts of New York, Boston, Portland,
and other New England ports. I intended
to make this return the basis of an investigation as to why marine insurance was
so much higher against Canadian ports
than against United States ports; but as
it happened, I was forestalled in that by
the Minister of Trade and Commerce, who
took up the matter himself and dealt with
it, I think, quite thoroughly. He took it
up with insurance men in Canada and on
the other side, but be did not succeed in
obtaining any reduction in the rates of insurance. That was nine years ago. During
these nine years there have been considerable improvements in the aids to navigation in the Gulf and around our
eastern shores; so I think the time
is quite ripe for taking that matter
would probably
and we
again
up
do so with a greater measure of success
than was met with on the previous occasion. There is no doubt that the great excess of our marine insurance rates over
those required in the United States ports
is one of the principle 'causes militating
against the success of our Atlantic ports.
During this debate on the various causes
for so much of our grain going to New

APRIL 6, 1921
York, Portland, and other United State3
ports in preference to aur own, I have
been remind-ed of some very important
evidence that was given last year ta the
committee on the Hudson Bay of happy
memory. I refer ta the evidence given by
Mr. Payne, which. was very interesting and
important. To my mind it is a pity that
ail the, members af the Senate cauld flot
have an aportunity of reading his testimony. I do nat know what is his officiai
titieHon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: He has lost his
job.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:-but hie has something ta do with railway statistics and that
sort of thing.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: He used ta have.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: And hie told us samething of which I was flot aware, bearing
an the reason why sa much grain goes ta
New. York, say, in preference ta, Montreal
or Quebec. In his testimony he made this
statement, that the freight business,
strange ta say, does nat always fallow the
line of the cheapest rates; and hie instanced
the fact that, aithaugh. at that time grain
could be shipped at Mantreal at four cents
less than at New York, the bulk of it still
went ta New York. Now, there was some
reason for that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I know it.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: There must have
been some reasan. The reason hie gaveand I presume it is the correct one-is this,
that at New York, it being a large part,
there are always plenty of vessels available. The shipper wanting ta have bis
goods shipped at a certain time would
send them by the route on which hie could
have his desire carried aut. Sa it is nat
always the cheapest route that carnies the
business. Ail these things have ta be taken
into corisideratian when we are dealing
with such an immense scheme as that of
transportation.
It struck me, however, that this matter
being of such great importance not only
ta the city and port of Quebec, but ta al
aur ports and ta the whole transportation
system of aur cauntry, it was a pity that
a debate of this character should resuit
merely in the obtaining of certain correspondence. I 'Would suggest ta the honourable gentleman wha introduced this
Bubject that hoe go a littie further and move
for a cammittee ta sit on this matter gener-ally, and see if they cannat, not only by
S-13

gaining information, but by using pressure where it shauld bo used, do something
ta help this whale transportation system.
There ought ta be now a very good chance
of sùccess, particularly in reducing marine
insurance rates, which are naw such a
great disadvantage ta ahl the parts an aur
Atlantic coast.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:- Honourable
gentlemen, as I have given notice that I
intend ta speak to-morrow on the railway
situation in Canada, I do not wish at this
moment ta worry the Hause; but, in
justice ta the hanourable member from
Stadacona (Hon. -L. C. Webster) I must
paint out that the honourable member from
Simcae (Hon. Mn. Bennett) did not follow
what hie said. He did not say that it
wouid cost 33 cents ta, take wheat from
Winnipeg ta Quebec by the Transconti-nental. What hie did say was that it taok
83 cents and a fraction ta take it framt
Winnipeg ta New York by rail and water,
and 39 cents and a fraction fnom Winnipeg
ta New York ail rail. That is what hoe
said. The mover of this resolutian, the
honourable gentleman fnam De la Durantaye (Han. Mr. Tessier) abtained his
figures from the Quebec Board of Trade,
who must have gane ta considerable trouble
in getting them. Thein contention is that
wheat could be canried fnom Winnipeg ta
Quebec aven the Transcontinental fog 17à
cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I misundenstood the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr.. CASGRAIN: I kpaw yau ,did;
I am only putting it right.
The honourable member for Norfolk
(Hon. Mr. McCall) made a very good
speech, and it did my heart gaod ta hear
it. The hanaurable gentleman advacated
what aur aid friend the late John Charlton
advocated-a great nailway iocated far
fram the American boundany, so that there
wouid be na chance of the wheat finding
its way ta an American 'part: hie advacated
the Transcontinental. I have been singing
the praises of the Transcontinental in tixis
House for eighteen yeans. And the Transcontinental is a good thing, a splendid
thing; and it did me goad ta hear the
honaura ble member from Narfoik-it is a
pity we do not hear him aftener-because
hie made a very gaod speech, hie taiked
cammen sense throuÉhout.i
The honourabie member for Stadacona
(Hon. L. C. Webster) also spokç of the
advantages of using the Transcontinental,
and his nemarks aiso did my heart good.

rRVISBD XDInION.

SENATE
This is the first time I have heard anybody
on the other side of the House say it was
of any use at all. The honourable gentleman is perfectly right. Take the passenger
service. When an ocean steamer arrives,
what train do you see alongside that oceangoing vessel? A C.P.R. train, which takes
the people to Winnipeg and westwards.
And the C.P.R. has to carry these people,
from Quebec to Winnipeg, a distance of
1,581 miles. If those who are managing
the Transcontinental now were attentive
to their business they would have their
train right there and could take those
passengers from Quebec to Winnipeg over
a line that is only 1,350 miles long-220
miles shorter than the other, and over a
much better route. Now, I would like to
know who would desire to travel by train
in the summer time a distance of an extra
220 miles for pleasure, when he could,
after getting off the C.P.R. steamer, step
right into the Transcontinental train and
go straight to Winnipeg by a route that
is only 1,350 miles long?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Where are
those passengers mostly booked? Are they
not booked in the old country?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is what I
say: government operation is no good. Why
are they not booked the right way?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
C.P.R. book them.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, but if the
Government are going to have a transportation system, have they no agent to look
after their business? Let me ask the honourable member from Boissevain (Hon. Mr.
Schaffner), is that what you call government operation, to let the competitor get
all the trade? That is what I said it would
be-that the Government management
would be asleep while the other fellows
were getting the business. And you see the
beautiful result! However, would anybody
go C.P.R., or even Canadian Northern,
when he could go by that beautiful Transcontinental route, the equal of which, honourable gentlemen-and I say it on my
authority as an engineer-does not exist
on the face of God's earth. There is not
another road that has such straight and
long tangents; there is not another road
that has such an easy grade. The honourable member from Stadacona was right
when he said that on that Transcontinental
road one locomotive can do twice as much
work as it could do on the C.P.R. If a locomotive on the C.P.R. can take 25 cars, the
same locomotive on the Transcontinental
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

can take 50. But I am anticipating what I
intend dealing with tomorrow. However,
40 miles an hour, or 35 miles, is not ain
excessive rate of speed, and at 35 miles an
hour the distance of 1,350 miles would be
covered in less than 40 hours. If a passenger arriving from a steamer travelled
from Quebec to Winnipeg by the C.P.R., the
best it can do is 48 hours from Montreal
plus 6 from Quebec, or 54 hours-a difference of 14 hours. And there is naturally
more expense in operating the 220 additional miles. That is only one of the
points. But I do not want to be carried
away, for I hope that the honourable members of this House will be good enough to
hear what I have to say to-morrow. However it was quite pleasing to hear the
Transcontinental vindicated.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Vindicated?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes. Of course,
nobody who is familiar with transportation
matters can claim that rail transportation
can compete with water. On water Divine
Providence has given the right of way and
attends to all its repairs, etc. When wheat
can be shipped by water, that method will
always be cheaper than by rail. It is a very
wonderful thing if, as the honourable member"from Simcoe (Hon. Mr. Bennett) said,
the C.P.R. can carry wheat from Port McNicoll to Montreal at 5 cents a þushel, because they are charging twice that rate to
carry that same bushel from Winnipeg to
Port Arthur, which is the same distance.
That is very strange. However, the honourable gentleman spoke against the deepening of the St. Lawrence, and in that respect, I agree absolutely with him.
It
would be absurd. Even if the St. Lawrence
were deepened to 20, 25 or 30 feet, no
ocean-going vessel would go up there to
get freight, because the ocean-going vessel
could not waste its time going up the river.
The honourable gentleman, living at Midland, is well posted on navigation matters,
and he is perfectly right. The International
Joint Commission held a sitting in Montreal and heard the evidence of engineers,
etc. What do engineers know about navigation? That is not their business. It was
my good fortune to entertain the members
of the Commission at lunch, and I told
them: "You are losing your time. Why all
this evidence? Why don't you ask the people
who own ships whether they would
use that deepended canal or not?"
Why, it would have been very simple. All
they had tD do was to call up the C.P.R.
Ocean Service, or Mr. Bosworth, the chief

APRIL 6, 1921
of it. He Would have told them, that they
would flot send ships into those restricted
waters. Strange to say, insurance rates
are twice or three times as much in such
waters as in the open sea. Besides, the
building of ships is sa expensive that an
ocean vessel cannot afford to waste its time
in restricted waters and waiting to go
through canais. It is one of the craziest
schemes imaginable, engineered by somneone on the Mississippi river. But there is
nothing in that scheme, and it should be
frowned down because the people who own
ships-and it is very easy to ask themwould not send their ships that way. Lake
shipping and ocean shipping are two different businesses: they are flot analogous at
ail.
I arn glad that this question bas been
brought up. There is no doubt, as the hionourable member for Norfolk (Hon. Mr.
McCail) has said, that when the Transcontinental railway was first buit ail the railways west of Winnipeg were to be allowed
to use it. Why do the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company persist in using their
own lines to take grain to Montreai, or
even Quebec, when they have to haul it up
bill and down dale? Why do they not take
advantages of that wise legisiation by which
the Transcontinental raiiway was obiiged
to give running rights to the other rail-.
ways? It was to be a sort of spout, as Sir
William Van Horne said, to let the grain
of the West flow right down to the nearest
tidewater. I have asked some questions,
because I know that when the figures are
shown it will be seen that one of the best
parts of the Canadian National system, now
being operated by the Government, is that
part of the Transcontinental railway in the
province of Quebec.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, I was a member of the
lower House when the Transcontinental
and Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway Bis
came before that House, and on one occasion I had the pleasure and the honour
of moving an amendment iooking towards
the very thing which bas occurred. That
arnendment, I may say, met with the full
opposition of the Laurier Government,
which was the Government of the day, and
the members supporting that Gavernment.
I pointed out that Canada was incurring
a tremendous expenditure for the benefit
of the farmers of the West, the greater part
of which feul upon Eastern Canada, and
that . it was only fair and proper that
Eastern Canada, represented by the ports
S-13à

195

of St. John, Halifax, Quebec, and Montreal,
shouidderive some benefit from it, and th4t
the oniy way in which those ports could
benefit would be by having the western
grain carried over Canadian uines to those
ocean ports. I therefore moved this amend,
ment: that ail freight, whether it be grain,
or cattle, or whatever it rnight be, the product of the West or of the district through
which this road was to run, should be car,ried over Canadian Unes to the Canadian
ocean ports.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: "Hear, hear," says
my honourable friend; but bis colleagues
did not say, "Hear, hear," very much at
that time. That amendmnent received the
soiid support of the party with which I was
identified, and with which I aiways have
been identified, but it received the unanimous condemnation of the party with which
honourabie gentlemen opposite are identified, and I fancy that there are some honourable gentlemen sitting there now who
joined in the condemnation and voted
against that amendment.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: No polities in
this House.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: H1e is just stating
facts.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, I arn making
a statenient of fact. Mr. Fielding brought
down an ameudment which hie said hie
thought would meet the views of myseif,
the, nienber for Kings-Albert at that time.
His amendment was that ail fre4ght originating along the uine, not otherwise routed
by the shipper, should be carried over
Canadign lines to Canadian ports, w1ýich,
of course, as I said, did not nieet my view
at ail, and wouid not meet the conditions
at ail, and was simply a bit of camouflageaithough, that being before the war, that
Word was not in very frequent use; which
enabied the shipper to send the freight
where hie liked, and that the Grand Trunk
at that time had its principle ocean terminus
at Portland, and naturally was going to
send the grain through Portland. If that
aniendment as I proposed it had been
adopted, we would not to-day have this
compiaint, and the great port of Quebec
would be receiving its due share of the
business, and great financial results would
have accrued therefroni.
With regard to insurance, which my bonourable friends .from Montreal are rnaking
s0 niuch fuss about, claiming that insurance companies discrizuinate againat the
port of Montreal-

SENATE
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: All Canadian
ports.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Well, there are in
this House representatives from the city
of Montreal of great aggregate wealth.
Very wealthy men are sitting in this House
as members from Montreal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Name them.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, it would take
too long. I do not know a man from the
city of Montreal that I would except from
the millionaire class. Why do they not
get together? I would suggest, if the rates
are higher than they should be, commensurate with the risk, that they should get
together and form an insurance company.
What better investment for their surplus
wealth could there be?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The rake-off made
their wealth.

.>

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not want to
interrupt. You say why not form a company? Sir George Drummond, a very
wealthy man of Montreal, president of the
Bank of Montreal, tried to form a con
pany and it lost money.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then the argument
that my honourable friends have been
trying to make that rates are too high
is wrong. That statement does not bear out
their contention. If you lose money, how
could you expect the insurance companies,
which are composed of shrewd, clever
men, to carry on at lower rates?
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: The insurance
is largely effected in London, and covers
an average from all ports. You cannot
make a success of insurance by confining it
bo one or two ports.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
stitution

Lloyds is an in-

which keeps pretty well posted

in regard to the risks in various portions
of the world. it is a great gambling institution, I may say, a speculative institution, and takes great risks; and I would
think they would figure this out on a scientific basis. It does seem to me that that is
where you should get to work: you should
make your representations to the insurance
people, and get them to reduce the rates.
I do not know what else you expect, unless
it is to have the Government start a company. We have a very paternal Government; there is scarcely anything left for
individuals to do.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They could do it
as well as run railways.
Hon.

Mr.

FOWLER.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am sorry that my
prediction bas proved true. I would have
been very glad, in the best interest of the
country, if in 1904 I had been a false prophet when I said that we were spending
our money for the sake of building up foreign ports. But much to my regret it has
proved true.

THE RAILWAY PROBLEM IN
CANADA
DISCUSSION

AND INQUIRY

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the railway problem in Canada and especially
to the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and inquire If it is the intention of the Government to
abandon the arbitration proceedings.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, to-day
I intend to give you no words of mine, but
simply facts and figures in order that we
may dispassionately consider the question
of the railway problem that is facing us.
When we realize that the amount involved
is actually greater than the amount of all
the money that we spent in financing the
war we shall have some idea of the importance of this question. We are saved
the loss of life that there was in the war;
but there was one advantage with the war,
-it came to an end, whereas I for one cannot see when this railway business wili
come to an end. I do not know if any honourable gentleman can give us even an approximate estimate as to that, and I must
admit that it is absolutely beyond me when
I consider that the deficit for every running mile operated by the Government is
no less than $5,000. For eighteen years I
have been studying this question closely; I
do not suppose that anyone bas given
more time to it; and yet I cannot understand how this deficit can be $5,000 per
mile. We are operating in round figures

APRIL 7, 1921
14,000 miles of railway, and the deficit is
$70,000,000, so it is easy to figure out what
the deficit is per mile.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: In your compilation of loss or deficit of $5,000 per mile,
do you mean a running deficit in operation
or a deficit in operation including fixed
charges?'
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I take the deficit
mentioned by the Minister of Railways in
another place, although personally I think
it is much more than that. Mr. J. L.
Payne, Statistician of the Department for
many years, has published letters in the
Montreal Star in which hie says that the
deficit is $138,000,000. The figures that 1
have here are not mine. Some of them
-have cost ie-a lot of trouble, and the honourable gentleman from. the Gulf (Hon.
Mr. L'Espérance) knows the difficulty of
getting any information about this matter.
Yesterday we were trying to get some
figures as to the cost of carrying a bushel
of wheat from Winnipeg to New York, and
we could flot come.to any agreement; and
we had a talk with the Minister of Finance,
who for eight years was Chairman of the
Railway Board, and hie said that was. a
question that no one could answer.
Hon Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable gentleman tell us what roads hie means,
and where they run?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I mean the roadt
under the Government control and operation, outside of the Grand Trunk railway.
What I should like to get, and I think
every honourable memiber would like to have
it, is somne information as to how it is
possible, if any tickets at ail are sold, or
if anyone pays for any freight, to, mn behind to such an extent. It is one dollar for
every foot of the railway for one year.
How is it possible to lose that much money?
If there is any question that this flouse
should take an interest in lt is 2 this one.
I have searched the press, and I have not
taken an article frorn a paper that is not
a good friend of the Union or Conservative
Government; but I cannot ..find out why
the defleit should be sO great.
I do not know whether the deficit is
on the freight business or on the passenger
business. The figures that I arn now golng
to giire this flouse were a revelation to
me, and may be new to some of the other
members of this House. I connot state where
I got this information, because the gentle-manl who gave it to, me might get into
trouble if it were known that hie gave it.

191

.He is a very responsible person and very
high in the railway world, and the information, so far as I know, is perfectly correct.
On the Grand Trunk Railwày system,
which means flot only the Grand Trunk
in Canada, but the Grand Trunk in the
United- States-there are roughly 8,000
miles of road, of which 1,600 miles are in
the United States-on the whole Grand
Trunk system the freight earnings for tha
year 1920 were $77,542,723; the earnings
from the passenger business amounted to
$20,781,281; and the mail and express business amounted to $4,075,258. Honourable
gentlemen will notice by these figures, which-t
are authentic, that when the Grand Trunc
Railway Company through its agents received $5, $4 was for freight and $1 for passengers. Now, the problem. for us is to finà
out whether we are losing on the passenger
service or on the freight service.
How
can we be losing on the freight? When a
man hires a freight car and pays for it,
surely the charges must be sufficient to pay
for the service rendered. If that is so, the
loss must be on the passenger service. But
I do not draw that conclusion: I leave it
That is
to, honourable gentlemen here.
something to be found out. If this question were referred to a Committee, we
might perhaps get information fromn experts
of,the Railway Board or the Railway Department, or even the railways themselves, and
settle the *matter. I suppose the Railway
Committee has the right to caîl for persons
and papers, and if it were to take up the
question we could find out where thiB enormous leak is.
Then there is the Grand Trunk Railway,
of Canada, exclusive of the Grand
Trunk western lines and the Grand Trunk
New England lines. I take that to mean
exclusive of the lines west of Sarnia, and
the lines east of Montreal, like the Vermont
Central and the uine to Portland. The
freight earnings of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada were $55,102,054.
,Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand the
honourable gentleman to state, that the
figures which hie was giving did flot include
the Grand Trunk railway.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: At present I arn
speaking of the Grand Trunk railway alone.
I arn making a distinction between the
Grand Trunk railway in the United States
and (the Grand Truhik railway in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But when you refer
to the loss on the 14,000 miles, that is
exclusive of the Grand Trunk railway?

198

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Grand
Trunk railway does not come into that at
all.
The freight earnings of the Grand Trunk
railway proper in Canada for the year 1920
amounted to $55,102,054; the passenger
earnings were $16,948,180; and the mail
and express earnings were $3,239,811. There
is a note here which, I am sorry to say, I
cannot explain. It says: "Other revenue
from transportation or operations not included." I do not know what that means.
Now we come to the Canadian Pacifie
railway. The Canadian Pacifie during the
year' 1920 received from freight earnings
$145,303,400; from passenger earnings,
$49,125,739; from mail service, $1,498,231;
and from sleeping cars, express and miscellaneous services, $20,713,918; or a total
of $216,641,350.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I do not like to
interrupt, but would the honourable gentleman again give that comparative statement
of the receipts of the Canadian Pacifie
railway and the Grand Trunk railway?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: As soon as I get
through I shall be very glad to give it.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I want a fair
statement, and I would like the honourable
gentleman to repeat it.

for that amount, taking the weight of one car
to be 37,000 pounds and silver at one dollar
an ounce? And what would be the length in
feet of this solid silver train?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Honourable
gentlemen will notice from the figures I
have just read that of every four dollars
taken in by the Canadian Pacifie railway,
three dollars come from the freight business and one dollar from the passenger
business; whereas, in the case of the Grand
Trunk railway, out of every five dollars
received, four dollars come fron the
freight earnings and one dollar fro'm the
passenger earnings; so that proportionately
the Canadian Pacifie railway is doing a
much larger passenger business.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: What about the
mileage? What I want is a recapitulation
of the whole thing.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, I did not set
the examination paper; I am afraid I am
too rusty; but I was an examiner some
years ago. But these are very simple problems. They are for students who want to
be admitted to the study of land surveying.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What would the
distance be in shinplasters?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will give you
that when I get through.
Last Monday I happened to be in the city
of Quebec, where the land surveyors of
the province of Quebec were holding their
annual meeting and preparing questions
for the examination of students before
being admitted to the study of land surveying. This is one of the questions that were
put:
If the deficit for the last fiscal year of the
Canadian National railway is $70,000,000, how
many solid silver box cars could be constructed
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

It is a very simple matter to compute
the answer, which is: 118 solid silver box
cars; and the length of the train would
be 4,720 feet, or nearly one mile. And if
we take the Grand Trunk railway under
Government operation, I am willing to
stake my seat in this House that the train
would be over a mile in length.
Another question was also asked. It
was: "If it is true that we have spent two
thousand millions in dollar bills on the
war, if they were placed end to end what
would be the length of that line of dollar
Lills?" It works out at 228,853 miles; and,
while I have not had the time to verify
this, I.an told that it would reach from
the earth to the moon.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do you take exchange into consideration?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If honourable
gentlemen would like to make the calculation, it is very simple.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
thé honourable gentleman say who the
examiner was who set the examinatior
paper? Was it my honourable friend?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I cannot answeî
that; but in dollar bills it would make a
belt that would go 9M times round the earth
at the equator. If this amount, like the
other, were transformed into solid silver
box cars. it would make 3,378 of them.
I think the problem of this deficit is a
much more important one than the June
conference about to be held in London; and
I believe that the Premier of this country
should stay here, repair his fences and put
his house in order before going abroad to
see about things which, after all, the war
being finished, we are very little concerned
with, having absolutely no vote and' no
more influence in England than the wildest
Indian in the Northwest or the filthiest
Esquimaux. We have no vote, so I do not
see why our Prime Minister should not

APRIL 7, 1921
stay right here with. his colleagues, because, after ail, our Prime Minister is a
very bright man.
Some Han. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: But I do flot
think anybady in this House will say that
he is any brighter than Sir Wilfrid
LaurierHon. Mr. MURPHY: Oh, yes.
Hon.
Mr. CASGRAIN :-and when
Sir Wilfrid Laurier went over to England
the #lrst time, in 1897, they managed to
wriggle out of him the British preference.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:

Wriggle?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
And *he came
back here and raid: " I have given a preference of 33 per cent;" which meant that
they could send goods into this country, and,
instead of paying $8 an them, pay $2; and,
after they had done that, he said, "I have
asked nothing in return," and he got
nothing: he got what he asked for. Now,
I fear that if the Prime Minister goes he
will be treated as Sir Wilfrid Laurier was
and be drawn into some further expense;
and the Lord knows we don't want to go
to any extra expense, for we have enough
now an our hands. When Sir Wilfrid
Laurier went aver in 1907 he was accompanied by the Han. L. P. Brodeur, then
Minister of Marine and Fisheries. Mr.
Brodeur, when 1 knew hlm first, when he
came ta Mantreal, was nat only a Liberal
-or a Socialist-or a Radical: he was a
Nihilist: the burden of his speeches was the
downfall of the Ramanoifs. But they gat
around him in London and nmade an
Imperialist of him-so much sa, that
befare he came back, and long before there
was any thought of war, he took his son
out of college and put hini into the British
navy. He wa.s worked up ta be just as good
an Imperialist as I amn myself-and that
is going some. I wonder if Mr. Brodeur
likes Russia naw better than he did when
it was ruled by the Romanoifs?
The BI,-itish imperialists gat Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, wha was a man of peace, who
hated war, ta start the navy, and that navy
was Sir Wilfrid's undaing. If he had not
touched that he might have died Prime
Minister of Canada; but he started the
navy, and Quebec would not have it.
Quebec said, "You should not have it," and
Quebec won out, as it always does, for
Quebec took the praper means not ta have
It, and we did not have the navy. But what
thanks did Sir Wilfrid Laurier get fram

ý199

the English provinces for that navy? He
was laughed at; *they çalled it a "tinpot
navy"; they made fun of the Rainbow and
the Niobe, saying they were no good; so
he got it bath going and coming. In Quebec
they were against the navy. Ta get
the navy, and thus help the Empire,
Sir Wilfrid took up the reciprocity questian,
and ran it parallel with the navy, thinking
that the peaple would talk reciprocity and
forget the navy; but he fell between the
tivo stools. I remember that in the county
of Soulanges, and other canstituencies, the
candidates were asked if they were for or
against recipracity, and they simply said,
"I arn for recipracity and against the navy,"
because the people were against it, and
they saw ta it that there was fia navy.
Mr. Brodeur, who was aur Minister
of Marine

I want to know, also, what is the surplus
or deficit on that part of the Transcontinental from Quebec to the boundary Uine
between Ontario end Quebec. If anyone
can judge by passing along the road, there
should be a big surplus on that section. So
much pulpwood was taken ont of that
territory that when I went there professionally last f ail the great complaint ail along
the line was that they could not get enough
cars to carry the freight, and the freight
rate fromn La Sarre aifd the district of
Abitibi was $16 for a cord of wood when
going to the United States, and there must
have been at least $12 of that amnount
coming to the Canadian railway. As I said
in the press, I thought the quantity of
freight that was available there would mun

gathered from the pulpwood on the side of
that railway than ail kinds of freights

on any part
or

in
whether
where else.* There is an inexhaustible
supply of pulpwood there; enough, at the
rate of $16 a cord, to mun *eveiÉy mile of the
railway. There was $2,000,000 worth of
freight along every running mile of railway, and if the usual price were got for
that freight it would be sufficient to pay for
the railway over and over again. How they
can work out a deficit there le beyond my,
comprehiension, and if that can be explained,
I will be very glad.
Then there ie the Transcontinental line
running from the province of Quebec to
Manitoba. There is a long stretch there.
Is there any surplus or any deficit on that
section? We don't know. If there is a
deficit, is it in the passenger traffic or in
the freight traffic?
There is the same thing about the Transcontinental and the Grand Trunk Pacifie
railways and branches in the province of
Manitoba. Are they paying, or are we
losing money on them.? I see that the Honourable C. A. Dunning, Minister of Finance
in the so-called Liberal Government of
Saskatchewan, says that they are paying
lines, so there cannot be any deficit there.
We have a member of this House from
Saskatchewan who, was the leader of the
Opposition there at one time; he might be
able to tell us whether those railroads are
paying or not. If they are paying lines,
where does the deficit corne from?
I have asked the samne question in reference to the Grand Trunk Pacifie' Railway
and branches in the provinces of Alberta,
Saskatchewan,- and British Columbia-

whether there is a surplus or a deficit.
Lastly, I have asked this question:
The same on ail the lunes formerly operated
by the Canaelian Northern Rallway Systemglving the surplus and deficit on per mile of
railways now under the control of the Canadian
National railway-over and above fixed charges,
separately, in each of the above mentioned provinces, and the mileage of these Uines In each of
these provinces.

Now, honourable gentlemen, I am not expressing an opinion at ail, but only quoting
and putting before you in adispassionate
way what I have found by researches. I
am trying to give niy colleagues the benefit of many hours of work on this problem.
I find in the Montreal Star of November
3rd, 1919, an article which is addressed to
this House, and I will crave the special
attention of honourable gentlemen while I
read it:
The Party Whip
0f the ninety-three members of the Senate,

is a good thlng for Canada? Probaibly flot one.

I amn not speaýing; it is the Montreal
Star, which is conducted by Lord Atholstan, the biggest Imperiaiist in the country.
It continues:

threatens to bankrupt Canada, and possibly to
bring about a condition for which annexation
would be the oniy remedy.

Now, here is that great Imperialist, Lord
Athoistan, the owner, proprietor, and publisher of the Montreal Star, talking about
annexation. He goes on:
The people of Canada are watchlng the Senate
to-day as neyer before. The dlstrust of the
Grand Trunk deal ls dleep and is spreading. The
Senate is properly regaxded as the last line of
defence against a scheme questionable in Its
motive, wickedly wasteful of public money In
its details and ruinous to the country In Its
possibllties.

Now, just another short paragraph from
the Montreal Star:
The Nation's Credt
The Star's daily mail averages 2,000 letters,
coming from ail parts of Canada. By ths&.
means The Star ie enabled to feel the Pulse Of
publie opinion on matters that are commandlflg
attention, and le made aware that there la a
very strong feeling in most of the Provinces
against rallroading the Grand Trunk scheme.
The promoters of the sale are uslng extraordinary means to accompllsh their purpose.
They are even going s0 far as to, urge the Govemnment to appoint four new Senators pledged
in advance to support the Bill. The deficits on

SENATE
the American roads have been staggering, and
in Germany, where Government operation ls at
its best,' the deficit runs close upon $150,-

000,000.
And they have not many more miles of
railway than we have. The article proceeds:
The same schemers who saddled Canada with
*the bankrupt railway of Mackenzie and Mann
are engineering the G.T.R. deal. If a body of
men supposed to have some regard for their
country's interests can be prevailed upon to
pass an act that w-ill make Government operatien a permanent policy, God help Canada.

Now I wish to give you a few notes of
the Grand Trunk arbitration, from statistics of the Dominion of Canada, which
show that 43 per cent of the cost of building the C. P. R. had come from public
funds; 73 per cent of the cost of the C.N. R.;
60 per cent of the cost of the G. T. P.;
75 per cent of the cost of the G. T. P.
branch lines, and 100 per cent of the cost of
the National Transcontinental RailwayHon. Mr. MURPHY: Who voted that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Whilst the Grand
Trunk itself received only 6.64 per cent of
this money.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I asked the honourable gentleman a question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman please not interrupt? Fie
has no right to interrupt without my permission, according to all the rules. These
figures included lines to the value of $38,000,000 built and handed over to the Canadian Pacific Railway.
Land grants amounting to 32,000,000
acres were made by the Dominion Government to the railways, and at the same time
the Provincial Governments made land
grants to the tune of 11,000,000 acres,
making in all 43,000,000 acres of land.
Who got that? Ninety per cent of the
land grants-90 per cent, mind you, or 9
out of every 10 acres-went to the C. P. R.
and the C. N. R. Only 21 acres went to
the Grand Trunk Pacific proper or to the
Grand Trunk Pacific branch lines, and not
one acre went to the Grand Trunk Railway
-not one. It never received any land at
all.
Now, here is an article appearing in the
Montreal Gazette--: nd surely if the Government bas a friend in this country it
is the Montreal Gazette. This is entitled,
"Crisis bas arisen in G. T. R. purchaseGovernment may drop negotiations, leaving
road to extricate itself." It is dated
April 1:
in the Government caucusHon.

Mr.

CASGRAIN.

I do not know who could give any news
of what took place in the Government
caucus, but I am reading what was printed
in the Montreal GazetteIn the Government caucus to-day the Prime
Minister placed before his supporters the problem arising out of the Grand Trunk arbitration. It is understood that the Grand Trunk is
asking for an extension of time to complete
the arbitration proceedings, and also for a large
money grant to meet pressing liabilities.

I have taken the trouble to ascertain,
not what were the pressing liabilities, but
what was the amount immediately needed.
And what do you think it is, honourable
gentlemen? The amount which they want
right away is no less than $88,000,000.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: You were at the
caucus, were you?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The total is not
stated, but the Grand Trunk wants $88,000,000 right away.
The

arbitration

proceedings

were to have

been ceompleted by April 9, and the Government

is opposed to both extension of time and further financial assistance.

It

is said that the

railway company insists on the necessity of
financial aid, and the negotiations are threatened with complete rupture, leaving the railway
company to extricate itself.
In the caucus, it 1s reported, Sir Robert
Borden made a strong speech in defence of the
acquisition of the Grand Trunk as necessary
to the success of the National system. He also

-left

the impression that he was very much

opposed to further delay in reaching a decision

in the arbitration. There is no doubt that a
crisis has been reached in the railway situation,
and interesting developments may be expected
during the next few weeks.

really want to know the railway situation you should read the report of Mr.
A. H. Smith, a man of brilliant intellect,
who was president of the New York Central lines for very many years and who
bas devoted his whole lifetime to railroadMr. Smith says that in the United
ing.
States the rate for carrying one ton of
freight one mile is three-quarters of a
cent; and the same rate prevails in Canada, as the honourable the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who is an old
railway man, can corroborate. That is under private enterprise. In Australia, under
Government ownership, which has hal 20

APRIL 7, 1921
or 25 years' trial, the freight rate, according tp Mr. Smitlh, is two cents, or one
penny per mile-nearly three times as
much. 1 can see my friends the farmers
of the West paying three times the freight
they are paying to-day; and that is coining. But do neot whine, because you voted
Mr. Smith
for Government ownership.
says that in Australia passengers are carried at threepence, or six cents, per mile,
which is exactly twice as much as you were
paying before the recent increase.
I wish to draw the attention of the House
especially to the statement of Sir Henry
Drayton, our present Ministerof Finance.
He may be right, or he may be wrong. He
said: "The Government is entitled morally
and legally to make the Grand Trunk live
up to its contract." That meant, as was
said by the honourable gentleman from
Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon), that the
Grand Trunk Railway shareholders would
get just what was coming to them. I neyer
supposed that the Executive of this country,
or the House of Commons, or the Senate,
was a charitable institution. We are justified in being charitable with our owr
funds; but we are here as trustees of the
people. We are honoured with the confidence of the people, by their entrusting to
us the administration of their money. Why
should we give to the shareholders. no
matter how worthy they may be, the money
If that

were done by private trustees, they would
be sent to Kingston penitentiary or to St.
Vincent de Paul. We have no- right to give
these shareholders anything but what is
due to theni. Much as we would like to do
it, we have no right to exercise any generosity with other people's money. If we want
to belp them, well and good; but we have
no right to help themn with the public money.
Mr. Smith goes on to say that "now"ý
that means 1917, four years ago--the
sum of $30,000,000 would be immediately
required to equip the Grand 'runk properly,
and that $70,000,000 more would have to
be spent in the next five years. That meant
that $100,000,000 would have to be spent
soon. Four years have since elapsed. Well,
they are now asking for $88,000,000; we
are not very far from. it. If you look t
the report of Mr. Smith yon will see the
confirmation of that statement.
Then Mr. Smith makes a very strong
point when he says that if the Government
is to undertake to operate the three railways, namely, the Canadian Northerri, the
Grand Trunk Pacific, and the Grand Trunk,
in fairness to the shareholders of the Cana-

dian Pacifie railway the Government should
also take over that road. That statement
Mr.
appears on page 76 of the report.
Smith rejects absolutely and conclusively
the proposition of Government ownership
and operation. Hie dlaims that, knowing human nature as we know it, knowing that
the very warp and woof of our national
life is politics, it is impossible in a democratie country to carry it out.
Sir Hienry Drayton and Mr' Acworth
agree that the Government should not
attempt to take over' large railways,
especially to operate theni.
Then Sir
Henry Drayton proceeds to make recommendations, among which we find one that
is really amusing. Hie would have the railroad entrusted to five commissioners, and
lie says that these nmen should be absolutely f ree and independent of the Dominion Parliament. lie would have us
hand over to these five men property to the
value of one billion and a half dollars, to
be used as they please. That is Sir Henry's
report. They would have no Parliament
or Executive to consult. These five men,
albhoughi owing their appointment to the
Executive, once they were appointed, would
be self-perpetuating. They would be like
those flowers which are of both sexes and
reproduce theniselves without the assistance of another fiower near by. When one
member resigned or died, the remaining
members would appoint another; and s0 it
would continue. -I leave it to honeurable
gentlemen in this House to conjecture how
long these men would occupy their positions or be kept in office if they displeased
the Executive who appointed them.
I really believe that our Cabinet Ministers should remain on their jobs here and
not go at all to that conference in June.
And why should they go? We have been
told that we are a nation, which means an
independent state. Are we a nation or bre
we nlot? Are we an independent àtate or
are we not? If we are an independent state,
why should we go at the beck and cali
of some other state? Let us adjust thete
railway problenis, our own affairs, first.,
A few moments ago I spoke of the navy,
What is happening to-day in regard to the
navy? Hon. C. C. Ballantyne has accepted
fromn England a few old ships. But thee
was one thing that the authorities in England did not do: they forgot to send the
money to equip and operate those ships.
That was a great gift to receive! We shall
have to maintain those ships, and we shall
be keeping, something for others to use.
The case will be very much like that of

SENATE
the poor unfortunate husbands who come
before the Divorce Committee, and who
are supporting what is for the use of
others. At all events the husbands, in
applying for divorce, show their resentment, but we do not seem to resent the
treatment we receive. There is a word in
French for those who are affected in that
way, and I would refer English-speaking
members to the honourable member from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), who will
teIl them what it is. Mr. Henri Bourassa
used it in his paper, Le Devoir.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend has more experience in that line than
I have, and he might complete the explanation himself. But while he is on that
subject, may I ask him just one question?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Was he for or
against the Laurier navy?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Gracious! I was
not only for it, but I made the longest
speech in the Senate in favour of the
Laurier navy, and I wound up by sayingand I have always been consistent with this
declaration: "It will be an excellent thing
to build these thirteen ships. It will give
us a start in shipbuilding. There will be a
shipyard established, and we shall later see
the fruition.". And what have we seen?
Sixty magnificent ships that are now in
the Canadian marine, carrying the flag of
Canada across the seven seas. I was in
favour of the navy as a means of training
our men in shipbuilding. I am glad the
point bas been brought up. If you read my
speech you will see that in concluding I
made this prediction: "We shall see the
golden wheat of the Northwest carried in
our ships, manned by Canadian sailors and
proudly flying the flag of Canada on the
seven seas of the world."
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Hon. C. C.
Ballantyne accepted these few old ships,
and those who sent them over said to themselves: "Those poor Canadians are easy
and gullible and will take anything. We
will send them the ships, and they will
maintain them in the meantime, and in
the event of war we shall be able to use
them."
Seeing the honourable gentleman from Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner)
smiling over there reminds me that this is
just as if one of his neighbours went to the
honourable gentleman, who has a big farm,
and said to him: "Senator, you are a great

but you will work them on my farm." What
should we think of the mental equilibrium
of the honourable member for Boissevain
That is
if he accepted such an offer?
the kind of offer we are accepting
when we accept these old ships. We are
going to man and equip them and work them
-for
whom? For other people. Again
like the poor husbands before the Divorce
Committee; yet we are satisfied. .
We talk of being a nation. We are supposed to be consulted before anything is
done with the navy. But what took place
in the war? On the very day that war
was declared a gentleman who had had
dinner at the home of Mr. Asquith, the
then Prime Minister of England, was there
at ten o'clock in the evening, when some of
the Cabinet ministers had assembled. When
Winston Churchill came in Asquith said:
"Churchill, is the navy ready?" and Churchill answered: "It is on its way." Canada
was not consulted at that time. Australia
was not consulted. The Boers of South
Africa, who have the same right as we
have to vote in the League of Nations,
were not consulted either. Still, we are
a nation! We may be committed to war
overnight and we may not know it. War
may be declared to-morrow. Complications
with Germany may arise and troops may

A few moments ago I said that all we owed
to Great Britain was Christian forgiveness. If you want to know what was done
with our ships during the war, I refer you
to Mr. Edmund Bristol, K.C., Conservative
member of Parliament for the city of Toronto. Ask about his correspondence with the
then Prime Minister, and probably with
the present Prime Minister. Why, they
commandeered our ships and used them,
and they made 100, 200-nay, 500 per cent

APRIL 7, 1921
profit, and kept the nioney, ênd they have
it on the other side yet, although we need
it to pay the deficit on our railways.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Mr. Bristol is flot
suffering, is he?
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Mr. Bristol will
tell you ail about it il you ask him. What
about the indemnity? Are we going to get
any of that?
There were a number ôf
ships taken from the Germans. How many
of those ships did we get?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The honourable
gentleman is not courteous enough to
answer my questions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman please be quiet? I shall
have finished in a little while, and then the
honourable gentleman can talk as niuch
as he likes. What about the indemnity?
In another place a member from. oui province lias been asking about it. But we have
flot received any of it. We have flot even
been promised anything. People must be
pretty poor when they cannot evyen make a
promise. Even if we are to get nothing,
they .might jolly us along and say that we
might get something. But we are not even
pîomised anything. Remember, we spent
$2,000,000,000. France is supposed to get
53 per cent. Belgiuxn did not begin to suifer
as Canada suifeied, and did not furnish
as many men nor as much money es did
Canada. But she is going to get a big
rake-off. I travelied in Belgium myself
and I could not see very much destruction
there. I paid people to show me ruins
and they could not show me any.
Now, what has happened? Before the
war the aiea of the British Empire was
15,000,000 square miles. What is it today? It is 17,000,000 square miles. The
aiea of the British Empire has increased,
by 2,000,000 square miles and we will probably be called upon to go and police that
territory, and, if there is any trouble, to
send soldiers there.
,What about the six votes that King
George bas iiq the League of Nations?
Those six votes are one of the principal
reasons why the Treaty of the League of
Nations was not accepted by the United
States Senate. The Yankees may not be
good diplomats like the English, but they
would have, to be very poor diplomats il
they were willing to enter the League and
let the British Empire have six throws
against their one. How would the game of
dice go? They said: "No, that is not fair,"
and they would not go in.

20E

While I am on the question of expenses,
let me remind you that th.ere was not a
slicé of bacon eaten by our men on the
other side that we will flot have to pay
for. Last year England had a bill against
us of some $425,000,000 for sending oui
men to fight for lier. Every cartridge shot
off by the Canadian troops bas to be paid
for.
Those who are in favour of Government
ownership argue that it has not been given
a chance; they say, "Give Government
ownership a chance." I say "Amen" to
that: give it a chance. I have said that for
forty years. Did we not, for forty years
and more, give the Intercolonial a chance?
And what has been the result?, Did you
ever know the Intercolonial to pay interest
on tlje fixed charges, leaving operating expenses out of the question? When Hon.
A. G. Blair was Minister of Railways hie
was til the time going to the United States
to buy locomotives out of capital funds,
not out of the receipts of the railroad. One
reason given why we have deficits is that
it is because wages have gone up out of
sight-100 or 150 per cent; because the
price of material has gone up; because
everything has gone up. It is true that
costs have gone up; I admit that. But what
about the Canadian Pacific railway, which
runs into every towrn where the National
railways go? Not only does it do that, but
it pays the samne wages as the Canadian
National or the men would not work for
it; it bas to pay the saine prices for maternaIs or it could not get them. Hlow is
it that under private ownership the Canadian Pacific railway, paralleling this Government system, can pay not only operating expenses, not only the coupons on theïr
bonds, not only interest on ail their debenture stock, but 10 per cent on the capital
in addition? How can you explain that?
Hon. Mi. BE-NNETT: The honourable
gentleman knows that it is not out of the
earnings of the road that the 10 per cent
is paid . Seven per cent is paid out of the
earnings, and 3 per cent out of the land
fund.
Hon. Mi. CAS GRAIN: I am very pleased
to have the honourable gentleman admit
that they are paying even 7 per cent. Ilow
much. are the Government railways runnlng
behind? ,Seven per cent? Now that the
honourable gentleman has nientioned it, I
do remember seeing that the Canadian
Pacific railway paid 7 per cent out of the
earnings of the road and 3 per cent out of
the land fund, and that the shareholders got

SENATE

206

10 per cent. The land fund amounts to
something like $119,000,000, according to
the Acworth report. Of course, the Canadian Pacific railway bas been a fortunate
corporation: it bas received $359,000,000
from the Government in bounties, guarantees, and so on, and besides that it bas
received the right to charge what fares it
will. But it does seem to me that this
House would like to be ihformed as to how
it is possible for one railway paralleling
another to have the .tremendous deficit of
$5,000 per mile, when the other road is
earning probably $4,000 or $5,000 a mile.
What makes the difference of $10,000 per
mile between private ownership and government ownership? Surely, honourable gentlemen, we have enough government ownership now. We do not want any more
mileage under government ownership.. It
would be almost a crazy thing to ask for
more government ownership. There is an
arbitration going on now; we still have a
chance to avoid taking over that extra
mileage. You know the old saying, "Quos
vult perdere primum dementat Jupiter."
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:

Translate that.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: "Whom the gods
would destroy they first make mad."
If the railroad is left to itself it will
manage to extricate itself. I think I might
be allowed a personal allusion. For ten
years I ran a railroad of 100 miles in
length; it never had a lawsuit, never received a lawyer's letter, and it had the
highest mark in the post office for the regularity of the service. It ran 62,000 miles in
a year, 100 miles each way every working
day. And what were the total receipts of
the road? The gross receipts were $330
per mile, which shows what economy and
careful management can do. My whole
personal expenses that year, for telegrams,
telephones, travelling expenses, and so on,
amounted to £20. Any one can go to the
Railway Department and see the report of
the company. So when I am told that a
railway is losing $5,000 a mile I become
suspicious. This little road that I speak of
bas been extended to Gaspé, and to-day is
202 miles long, and it has not cost the taxpayers of this country one cent. The taxpayers and the public in that section are
being served, although I will admit that the
bondholders are not getting any money out
of it and never did.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
railway?
Hon. Mr.

CASGRAIN.

Is that the Gaspé

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The bondholders
never will getl a cent, but they are giving
service to the public. The density of population there is about 200 persons per mile
of road, and this road carries on, and there
are no complaints to the Railway Board
or by the Post Office Department. If this
country is to pay the bondholders of the
Grand Trunk railway, why not pay the
bondholders of the Quebec and Oriental,
and the Atlantic, Quebec and Western?
They have been suffering; they have never
got a cent since they invested their money
twenty-five years ago. It was a venture,
and it has been a loss. People are frightened. They say that if the Grand Trunk
railway goes into the hands of a receiver
the bankruptcy that will follow will be
terrible. After all, railroads are for the
public, and the public gets the very best
of service when a railroad is in the hands
of a receiver. All the railroads west of
the Mississippi river have been in the
hands of a receiver many a time. The receiver has only one ambition: it is not to
pay the coupons, not to pay the bondholders, but to give service to the public.
Would we have all this trouble if the
western
provinces, especially
British
Columbia, had not gone on guaranteeing
debentures on branch lines? That is where
the great trouble is, and honourable gentlemen know it as well as I do. Because
millions and millions have been guaranteed
by the western provinces why should the
prudent provinces be penalized?
Why
should my province be penalized?
We
have in Quebec 492 people per mile of railway, whereas in Saskatchewan they have
105, in Alberta 116, and in British Columbia 106.
The branches built in the
western provinces do not meet the
coupons.
I had quite a discussion
about that with the Finance Minister
of Saskatchewan. He said: "Here is my
surplus, $1,925,000; what shall I do with
it?" I said: "Simply pay your debts; pay
the coupons on these roads, and do not
ask Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick and Quebec, who never guaranteed
anything for anybody, to pay."
I thank you, honourable gentlemen, for
the very kind attention you have given
me to-day. I hope that some one may continue this debate, or that this matter may
be referred at some time to a Committee
where we can get some information, because, although I have made considerable
investigation, I cannot find out how $5,000
can be lost on every mile of the Government railways.

That an order of the Senate do Issue for
copies of ail correspondence between the Government and the Board of Trade and City Council and Harbour Commission of Quebec, since

Northwestern grain trade to New York, the
alleged nonfulfilment by the Government of its
undertakings with regard to the terminais of
the Transcontinental railway at Quebee, and 0f
the memorials addressed to the Prime Minister
on these subjects.

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable gentlemen, the honourable member
from Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener)
moved the adjournment of the debate at
my request, because in order to attend the
meeting of the Divorce Committee I bad
to leave before tbe rising of the House.
I do not intend, bonourable gentlemen, to
occupy the attentioni of the House very
long, because my duties on that Committee have left me no leisure and I bave not
come prepared with any of the figures
which, witb more leisure, I intended to
submit to the House. There are, bowever,
two or three aspects of the question that I
would like to discuss very briefiy.
The motion itself-and it is a very proper
one, in my opinion-has in view the negotiation between the Government and the
Harbour Commission of Quebec. But the
people of the Northwestern provinces undoubtedly look at this whole subject from
àn angle different fromn that fromi whicb
the people of tbe city of Quebec look on it.
I do not blame the inhabitants of the city
of Quebec, nor the Quebec Board of Trade,
for urging the carrying into effect of the
negotiations between them and the Government in connection with the routing of
freigbt to tbeir port. Nor do I find fault
with any of tbe representatives of, any
otber Eastern port for supporting its dlaimrs
and urging that,-grain should be sbippd
by way of the Georgian Bay or the St.
L'awrence-.e'ither by tbe all-water route or
partly by lake and partly by rail. But we
in the West, for whom tbe Grand Trunk

SENATE

208

Pacifie was primarily built-and such is a
matter of record and bas been recognized in
the course. of this debate-are principally
concerned with getting our grain to the
market in the cheapest way. If the termi-nal of the cheapest route be Quebec,
well and good; if it be Montreal, well and
good; if unfortunately it be New York,
via Buffalo, then our shipments will have
to go there. Personally I should be extremely sorry to think that we have not
in Canada sufficient enterprise to enable
us to forward our own Western grains to
the seaboard over Canadian railways and
Canadian waters. I regret exceedingly to
find that in the course of many years past
the proportion of the grain shipments from
Western Canada that found an outlet via
Buffalo and New York has been from 40
to 50 or 70 per cent.
There has been undoubtedly a commerIt was not based
cial reason for that.
wholly on the comparative freight rates as
between Buffalo and say Montreal or Quebec. There was another question involved,
namely, the return freight-the freight
coming back to our Canadian ports or to
New York, or Baltimore, or Boston or
Philadelphia, the main American ports
from which our grain is shipped by American channels. We must look at the load
factor, which unfortunately bas always
caused a discrimination against Canada.
We are not in the North American triangle, as it is called, and, unlike the American ports I have mentioned, we have*not
had the tramp steamers to depend upon.
Such steamers rarely come to Montreal.
The important factor, therefore, is not only
the outgoing cargo, but the return load
from Europe, and it bas favoured American as against Canadian ports. This bas
doubtless been due to the great population of the United States and the larger
markets there. But I say, as a Canadian, I
am extremely sorry to observe that from
40 to 60 per cent or any large proportion
of our grain should be forwarded to the
European markets via America channels.
There is now, as we all know, another
channel; that is, the Pacific ocean and the
Panama canal. Quite recently, as honourable gentlemen are aware, our newspapers
reported a trip made with a cargo of Canadian grain by that route. The grain, it
was reported, reached the English market
in first-class condition. Persons who are
far more competent than I to deal with
the question of grain shipments and rates
believe that it is feasible to ship grain by
the Panama route to the old country in
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

competition with the route via Eastern
Canada. They believe that grain could be
shipped westward from the centre of
the
example-from
Saskatchewan-for
government elevator located at Moosejaw,
where I happen to reside. The opinion has
been expressed by some of the grain commissioners-and their opinion on the subject is authoritative-that the grain could
be moved westward via Vancouver and the
Panama canal, in competition with the
eastern route, provided that the transit
through the Panama canal would be safe,
that is, that there would be no deterioration in the quality of the grain, by heating or otherwise. I think it bas been reasonably demonstrated, not only in this recent
attempt, but also in a prior shiprnent made
some years ago, that grain can be transported from the Prairie provinces, from as
far east as Moosejaw, or central Saskatchewan, via the Panama route. If that
be the case, it is quite obvious to honourable members that an all-water route would
be infinitely cheaper than a route by railway of equal distance, because shipments
going via the Panama canal have to be
hauled 7,000 or 8,000 miles farther than
by the all-rail route eastwards.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: The honourable
gentleman states that about 60 per cent of
our Canadian grain is shipped by American
ports. Can the honourable gentleman give
any reason why such a large percentage
goes through the United States? In my
opinion it is largely because so much of our
grain is sold at Winnipeg to American
buvers.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is quite
true that the exporter is usually a different
person from the buyer; but I do not think
the exporter ships via New York merely
because he prefers the American port; he
exports via New York because it is commercially cheaper.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: While 60 per cent
or 80 per cent of our grain is received at
Buffalo, all of that is not exported from
United States ports. A large proportion
of it is sold right in the United States.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: As stated by
the honourable gentleman from Simcoe
(Hon. Mr. Bennett, a proportion of the
grain going via Buffalo is undoubtedly
milled in the Eastern states; but I do not
think it is a very large porportion. Any
person who takes the trouble to look at the
milling statistics of the United States will
find that Minneapolis is the great milling

centre, and more milling is done there than
in ail the eastern states together. Minnea-

polis and Kansas

City are the two largest

milling.cities in the United States. Minneapolis greatly overshadows ail other cities.
However, we in the West are primarily interested in geting aur grain out by the
cheapest route.
The honourable gentleman fromn De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has just said tha t we must anticipate an increase i11 freight rates ta three
times what they are at present. ,Now, 1
make the statement-and I know something
about the grain business in the West and
the cost of production-that we absolutely
must have a reduction in freight rates if
we are going to continue profitabiy the production of wheat. Here are some figures
regarding present rates.
The rate from.
Moosejaw to the head of the lakes
has been 30à cents per hundred, or 19à
cents a bushel. That is not the present
rate, because there has been a reduction,
going into effect on the lst of January, and
it is 31 cents at present. But before this reduction of 5 per cent which has gone into
effect, it was 32J cents per hundred; that is
19k cents a bushel. In 1914 it was 18 cents.
is has spread frcim 18 cents to 31 cents.
The old rate in 1914 and before that date,
from. Winnipeg to Armstrong, which corresponds to Fort William, was 10 cents
per cwt. Atthe present time the rate is
18 cents. The rate from Armstrong to Quebec was formnerly 23 cents; it is now 42
cents. It is quite true, as has been stated
by, I think, the honourable member froin
Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster), that the
present rate from Winnipeg to New York
is somewhere between 33 and 34 cents a
bushel.
But what we are primarily concerned in
-and I say it with ahl gravity in this
House-is the necessity for something being
devised by this country whereby there would
be, not an increase, but a diminution in the
rates on grain from the Northwest. The
management of the Canadian National railways has -put in force, I know, many reductions in the passenger rates in the West.
Those reductions have been effected by the
discontinuance of certain trains, and with
that I have no fault to find. We are well
served on the Prairies, so far as passenger
trains are concerned, and the reduction of
passenger services has usually been, I think,
in the interest of economy. I have a Iist
from the Railway Commission showing the
passenger trains that have been taken off,
many of which were running at a cost ofý
$2.50 per mile and were earning considerS-14

209

ably less. The revenue from the hune betweeu Prince Albert and Swan River was
$1.46 per mile, and the cost was $2.50 per
mile. On the little branch line fromn Radville ta Beugough the cost of operation was
$2.50, and the return was 17 cents one way,
and 14 cents the ofher way. 1 might give
sev *eral other quotations of the samne kind
to show that the management of the Canadian National railways have been rendering good service in the West in cutting off ,
in view of present conditions, a number of
unnecessary passenger trains and thereby
effecting econoniy, because those trains were
being operated at a loss. It is well that our
own people in thie West should know that
public- opinion supports the railway management in the curtailment of those services.
Let us take, by way of illustration,
the C. P. R. or the Grand Trunk. We al
know that when we stop calling at a certain
station the whohe town makes an outcry
and sends deleglates to meet the management and to urge that the train should
stop there, even though the whohe schedule
must be disarranged. I for one am pleased
to see that they have the boldness- ta do
as they have done. But that is not dealing
with the freight rates. Wheat has been at
high prices for the past few years.
The
prices have been high in 1917, 1918, 1919
and 1920; but they are uow going down.
Anybody who looks at the Chicago market
to-day will find that July wheat there 'is
at $1.10. 1 am of the opinion that wheat
cannot be grown in the Canadian Northwest and marketed at a profit at that pricé,
owing to the increased cost all round. The
costs have diminished somewhat, but I am
of the opinion that the growing of wheat
is still uuprofitable at that price.
Now we are faced by another difficulty,
and that is the enactment of the Forduey
Bill. I have had the advautage of being
recently in the Western states. We ahl
have the oportunity af reading the discussions which are taking place in the United
States Congress. While it is rash ta predict what may be done by the United
States, 1 do not think there -is any doubt
that the Fordney Bill or a measure fashioned along similar lines will pass the
United States Congress. During the last
year we have fortunately had the advantage
of a large export trade, particularly in
grades 1 and 2, ta the Uniýed States. We
have made large contracts '*ith the United
States. Neyer in an previous year had we
shipped as much, or nearly as much grain to
that country. If the Fordney Bill or any
similar measure shouhd go into effect we

EVISU3D 11DITION.

SENATE

would find great difficulty in gaining access
to the American market, which is a profitable access.
There are many differences between the
marketing of grain in the Canadian Northwest and in the United States. In the
United States, owing fo their very much
greater population, they do not export in
normal years at the outside more than onethird of their grain, either in the form of
wheat or flour, divided, in round figures,
about 50-50. Relatively their export of
flour is very much higher than that of
Canada. Our export does not correspond
with.theirs at all. Their export of flour is
very much higher, relatively, than that of
Canada. They export from 25 to 35 per
cent of their grain in the form of wheat
or flour, whereas in Canada we are exporting about 80 per cent of our wheat. The
result is that we have to find a market
abroad for our surplus wheat to a greater
extent than they have. There are times,
or whole years, when the domestic price in
the United States market exceeds the export price. Normally, we concede the principle that the price of wheat is fixed in
Liverpool. There are many years, or portions of years, as I say, when the export
price has been exceeded by 10 or 15 per
cent in the Minneapolis market owing to
the fact, perhaps, that the United States
has oversold. It has been only on very
rare occasions that Canada bas oversold
and the domestic price has exceeded the
export price. Therefore I say that the
situation of Canada cannot be compared
with that of the United States. The wheat
problem is the great problem. While we
export 80 per cent of our wheat, we only
consume 20 per cent; therefore the United
States has a home market that we do not
possess.
We cannot compare Canada with Argentina. Argentina is in a very different position. A ship will make a trip from one
of the South American ports, Rio de Janeiro or Buenos Aires, in approximately
twice the time it takes to make the trip
from New York to Liverpool. A moment
ago I said that we shipped wheat from the
middle of Saskatchewan via the Panama
canal, shipping it a distance that is vastly
greater than the distance from the Argentine ports, so you will see that we are faced
by a very dangerous competitor in that respect.
Let me deal with another phase of the
question. I see the representative of the
third party (Hon. Mr. Turriff) present.
The wheat question is an acute question on
Hon. Mt. WILLOUGHBY.

the prairies. The farmers take the not
unreasonable position that their products
to a very large extent are governed by
world prices, and that they are getting no
return for the protective duties which bring
some advantages to the East. That point
of view is not confined to members of one
party alone, and I am free to state that I
have always taken the attitude that our
support of protection in the West-and I
have supported it, and I am not pretending
to deny it-is largely based on the duty of
building up Canada as a whole; and for
that we are willing to sacrifice to some
extent what might be to the material
advantage of the West in view of the wider
benefits that may accrue throughout Canada. Other provinces, such as British
Columbia, have their own gains to make
from a policy of protection; but the
people of Saskatchewan find their market
abroad, and it is governed by world conditions,-and I do think it is the duty of the
Government to find some way, no matter
where else the shoe pinches, to make the
freight rates on grain from the prairie
provinces, to the markets of the world,
either East or West, as low as it is possible
to make them. One dollar and ten cents is
the July price in Chicago to-day; we are up
against that kind of competition. Wheat
has been steadily going down since last
August, and I make these remarks hoping
that they will fall on the ears of the Government and that they may be able to make
some representations to those who control
the operations of the railways and to the
Railway Commission. There is nothing
else that will serve the West as well. I was
speaking particularly of Saskatchewan. I
hope the Government will take into consideration our peculiar condition and will deal
with it, not merely sympathetically but
effectively. As Canadians we are all interested in the development of Saskatchewan,
the greatest wheat-growing province of
them all. If we could get our freight rates
adjusted the question of the duties we pay
on imports would fade into insignificance.
We have had a Commission appointed
at the instance of the Saskatchewan Government, and among other thingis they
have suggested that we should go more
extensively into stock raising. They even
suggested that we should increase the size
of our farms, perhaps to 640 acres, the
average size now being about 480 acres.
Think of what going into stock raising
would mean to the ordinary farmer on a
grain farm. He is expected to reserve say
80 acres for pasture; he would have to take

APRIL 7, 1921
say 50 acres for fodder ground for bis
stock. That leaves 350 acres. Under oui
systemn of cultivation it is necessary to
leave in fallow every year one-third-of the
land, so that every three years it is ail
left in fallow. So, taking out one-third for
fallow, or roughly 115 acres, you have only
225 or 230 acres left. In other parts, of
Canada, owing to the greater rainfall, it
is flot necessary ta leave fallow land to
such if any extent. If the farmer,' on bis
200 or 230 acres, grew 20 busheIs to the
acre he would have say 4,000 bushels, of
which he would seil 3,000 bushels. If hie
could save 3 cents a bushel in bis freight
rates on that grain, it would amount ta
$90. I arn putting it at a low estimate.
The tariff imposed on him is not worthy of
consideration in comparison. Give himi a
cheap autiet for bis grain so that he may
seil it at a price that will be remunerative,
because, if the business is not remunerative,
that country is going to go out of cultivation.
Wheat-growing must be made
remunerative, because the farmer of the
Northwest is as good a citizen as anyone
else. He« is thrifty and energetic, and if
that country is not good for grain raising,
it is good for nothing.
Therefore, I again reiterate what I have
said, 'that 1 hope the Government will
bring about a reconstruction of the grain
rates. We are already paying, according
ta the statement of the Railway Commission,
15 to 18 per cent more than the rest of
Canada, and on the long hauls there is no
doubt that the rates are not on a parity
with the rates in Eastern Canada. Not
only do we want that situation rectified,
so that we may be put on terms of equality,
but we want something better. We are not
getting any particular benefit out of the
Customns tariff. I arn willing to submit
to it as a good Canadian citizen, but I
want same eompensating advantages. If
the rnost beneficial economical policy foi
every individual could be ciytallized into
legisiation, that would be the best policy
for Canada, and I find fia fault with it. I
think the people of the West are public
spirited in their outlook. They are willing
to take some of the lose, but they want
compensating advantages in the way of
cheaper railway rates; and, if we get those,
I think things will go well with the West.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Turriff, the
debate was adjourned.

like a chance to comply. Fuithermore,
those gentlemen who reside in Ontario orQuebec can retire to their homes over the

who are here in Ottawa until Parliarnent
prorogues would much prefer to have sittings of the House, and .it is hardly fair
to the Western memibers to ask them ta

GEE DIVORCE PETITION
REFUND OF FEES

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT moved:
That the fees paid upon the petition of Ella
Maude Gee praying for a Bill of Divorce, be
refunded to the Petitioner.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the
petition referred to was presented at the
last Session of Parliament, but was not
proceeded with. The fees were paid; but
as the parties do not intend to proceed with
the Petition they are asking to have them
refunded.
The motion was agreed to.
THE GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like to
draw the attention of the leader of the
Government to some papers relating to the
Grand Trunk situation that were brought
down by the Premier in another place, I
think two days ago. I think every member of the Senate takes such an interest
in this question that he would like to be
informed, in the same way as the members
of the House of Commons are informed,
as to what is contained in this correspondence. I hope my honourable friend will
be able to have a copy of the correspondence made and laid on the Table of the
Senate.

SHIPMENT OF CANADIAN PRODUCTS
VIA AMERICAN PORTS
MOTION FOR SPECIAL COMMITTEE
POSTPONED

Hon. D. O. L'ESPERANCE rose to move:
That a Special Committee of 11 Members of
the Senate be appointed to inquire into and
report at this Session upon the conditions which
are responsible for a large portion of our export trade (more especially the products of the
West) to be routed via American i.nstead of via
Canadian ports, and that such Committee shall
have power to call for persons and papers; and
that the said Committee do consist of the
Honourable
Messieurs
Casgrain,
Tessier,
Watson, Turriff, Nicholls, McCall, Willoughby,
Thompson, Chapais, Webster (Stadacona), and
the mover.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, with the
leave of the House I would like to add to the
committee the names of Messrs. Bennett,
Tanner and Todd.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is only a
notice of motion?

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: It is a moton
if the House will permit. It is the same
motion as that of which I have given notice,
except for the addition of the three names.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Let it stand as a
notice of motion.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I might inform the
honourable gentleman who has given this
notice of motion that it is an unfortunate
thing that in this House there are supposed
to be only certain provinces in Confederation, and no other provinces have any
rights. One province which is important
as one of the first in Confederation, and
which was the cradle of the Dominion, is
not regarded at all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Which
province is that?
Hon. Mr. TODD.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: You would probably know if you knew history.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If there is any
objection to the amendment, I think the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance) would do well to add the names to
his motion and allow it to stand until tomorrow or the day after.
The motion stands.
NATIONAL TRANSCONTINENTAL
RAILWAY
QUEBEC TERMINALS

The Senate resumed from Friday, April
8, consideration of the motion of Hon. Mr.
Tessier:
That an Order of the Senate do issue for
copies of ail correspondence between the Government and the Board of Trade and City Council and Harbour Commission of Quebec, since
last Session, with regard to the diversion of the
Northwestern grain trade to New York, the
alleged nonfulfilment by the Government of its
undertakings with regard to the terminals of
the Transcontinental railway at Quebec, and of
the memorials addressed to the Prime Minister
on these subjects.

Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I was very glad to see the honourable gentleman from Quebec (Hon. Mr.
Tessier) bring up this question of the transport of the produce of Western Canada to
the markets of Europe via Canadian ports.
The Board of Harbour Commiissioners of
Quebec have taken an active interest in
this matter, as they feel that their harbour
and their city have been rather neglected
and side-tracked. While they, no doubt,
take a great interest in this matter, I belive the wheat-growing provinces of Western Canada have even a much greater interest in the manner in which the products
of the West are conveyed to the market
of the world.
In my judgment, honourable gentlemen,
the question of the route to be taken depends absolutely on its relative cheapness.
If the wheat can be transported from the
western provinces to Europe via Quebec,
Montreal, St. John, or Halifax as cheaply
as it can be sent via United States ports,

it will go that way; but if it cannot be
shipped through Canadian ports as cheaply
as through Amierican ports, then I do not
think it possible that the grain can be
shipped that way.
Wheat, as you know, is an article that is
handled in very large bulk and at a very
small profit per bushel, and the price per
bushel between the sellers or exporters in
the city of Winnipeg and the purchasers

APRIL 12, 1921
in the city of Liverpool will be influenced
very largely 'by a difference of even one
When an
quarter of a cent per bushel.
order cornes from the Old Country, the exporters in Winnipeg have to consider the
cheapest way of getting the wheat across
the water. The freight rate fromi Winnipeg and the West to Montreal or Quebec
versus the rate £rom Winnipeg to New
York is not the only thing to be taken into
consideration. We have to take into consideration also the rate from the harbour
on this side to the destination in the Old
Çountry. But there ýis more than that to
be considered: there is the time taken in
transporting the wheat from Winnipeg to
the port of destination, and if it can be
shipped more quickly, say by a week, by
one route than by another it makes ail the
difference in the world, 'because it takes a
lot of rnoney to make a shipment of wheat.
The exporters go to the bank and borrow
the money until they get paid for the
wheat, and if, (by taking a certain route,
they can shorten the time taken in transporting the wheat, that is the route by
which they will ship it.
Then there is the question of insurance.
There is no0 doubt in my mind that so far
as Quebec and Montreal are concerned we
are flot likely in the near future to get as
low an insurance rate as can be had from
American ocean ports. This is because you
have from Montreal four hundred miles and
from Quebec two hundred miles of more or
less narrow water. From St. John and
Halifax I do not know exactly why the insurance rates to Liverpool should not be as
favourable as the rates from the American
ports-I do not profess to be well enough
up in that question to say whether they are
or flot; but if they are not, I do not see the
reason why.
There is another question to be taken into
consideration, and that is the question of
labour. The question of freight rates on
the railroads nowadays largely comes down
to the question of labour; but -I know of
my own knowledge, and from residents of
Quebec for many years, that there has
always been more or less union control of
labour in Quebec and that higher wages are
in effeet there than in Montreal, for instance. I remember a few years ago one
of the large steamship companies put on
large boats. They made up their mnds
that those boats would not come up any
further than Quebec city. I had been wondering why Quebec city, with its beautiful
water front, with water 40 feet deep for

215

miles along the front without any dredging
or any expense whatever, had not forged
ahead as one of the great export cities of
Canada. The manager of this steamship
company told me that after bringing these
large vessels onîy as far as Quebec for a
few montbs they had come to the conclusion that they could not continue, as. it
cost tbem, I think-it is a good many years
ago 110w and I arn not just sure-thirty to
thirty-five per cent more to load or unload
freigbt in the city of Quebec than it cost in
the city of Montreal. So they changed
their decision and brought their vessels up
to Montreal. That is a subject that might
well be looked into by the cornmittee when
they take up this question.
Is there any
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
difference between winter rates and summer
rates?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I do not think
there is any difference on the railroads.
Now, supposing that you can land your
wheat as cheaply at Quebec as you can land
it at New York, you corne to the question
of ocean rates. I do not know that ocean
rates from New York are so much cheaper
than tbey are frorn Quebec-probably they
are some cheaper; but New York possesses
a great advantage in that there are ten
vessels leaving there for the old country to
every one that goes 'by the St. Lawrence.
The result is that if you land a million
bushels of wheat in New York you can get
it aboard a vessel and on its way at once.
Wheat, as a rule, is not carried i11 tramp
steamers; it is carried by the large passenger liners at a low rate because they want
a certain amount of heavy freight
as ballast to keep the ship steady and
in that way to belp the passenger traffic.
Package freight does not accomplish their
object nearly as well as wheat. Then there
is 110 delay as a rule in shipping wheat by
New York, and that is a matter wortby of
consideration.
It seems to me that a great deal of useful
work can be done by the Committeemoved
for to-.nigbit, and that they should get to
work as early as possible and gather ail
the information available so that something
may be done in order that our crop, or
part of it anyway, shaîl be shipped by
our own route. We have put hundreds of
millions of dollars into railways in this
country for that purpose. The main purpose for which these through lines were
built was to keep traffic going east and west
instead of north and south. It does move
east and west for a considerable dis'tance;

SENATE
but if ail our grain has to find an outlet
through American ports, then we have
made a great mistake in building these railroads. That is a question that can be determined to a certain extent.
The present rate on the Government
railways from Winnipeg to Quebec is 36
cents a bushel. When the Grand Trunk
Pacific was inaugurated we were told that
wheat could be carried on that road for
six cents a bushel, or just one-sixth of the
existing rate. It looks very much to me
as though the management of the Canadian
Government railroads were deliberately
trying to kill the Grand Trunk Pacifie
railway. The management is practicaly
Canadian Northern all through, and has
been ever since the roads were taken over
by the Government. I think my honourable
friend the leader of the Governinent should
explain why it is that it costs 36 cents a
bushel to carry wheat from Winnipeg to
Quebec when the rate originally promised
was six cents. What is more, three years
ago the Government gave a rate of six
cents a bushel on wheat from Armstrong
on the Transcontinental to Quebec. Armstrong corresponds with Fort William on the
Canadian Pacific railway. The present
Minister of Railways stated that wheat
could be carried at that rate without a
loss. But I want to be absolutely fair, and
say that he afterwards qualified that statement. But, if wheat could be carried from
Armstrong to Quebec at six cents a bushel
three years ago, very little more would be
the proportionate rate from Winnipeg to
Quebec, and why should the present rate
be 36 cents? The Harbour Board of the
city of Quebec states that wheat can be
carried from Winnipeg to the city of Quebec
at 18 cents a bushel, and they say that they
are prepared to come before the Government or the Railway Board and demonstrate
that. I understand that the Transcontinental railway and the Grand Trunk
Pacific railway are not under the Board
of Railway Commissioners, so that in order
to get the facts it would be necessary to get
the consent of the Government railways
management to an investigation. That is
a point that I think the Committee should
consider-whether the Harbour Board of
Quebec is right that wheat can be carried for
18 cents from Winnipeg to Quebec or
the Government is right in saying that
it cannot be carried at less than 36 cents
without a loss. With ail due respect to
everybody, I may say that I cannot believe
for one moment that it costs 36 cents a
bushel to carry wheat from Winnipeg to
n_

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

Quebec. You can load a train of sixty
cars of 1,100 bushels each in Winnipeg and transport it to the city of
Quebec with one engine and one crew,
and make good time all the way.
Now, what does that mean?
It means
that one trainload of wheat from Winnipeg
to Quebec would bring in a freight revenue
of $23,760. Of course, a good many of
those cars might have to return empty;
but even suppose they ail returned as
empties there would be revenue equivalent
to $11,880 each way. Now, we know that
it does not cost that much; if it does, then
let the Government go out of the business
of running, or trying to run, any railways
that cost that much. I do not for one
moment think that it would cost so much.
At aIl events, the Quebec Harbour Board
say they are prepared to prove their case,
and I think it is up to the Government to
see that the board of management of th»
Government Railways give them an opportunity to do so, and if they cannot that is
their look-out. It seems unreasonable that
such a charge should be necessary to haul
wheat on a road like that, which is practically almost without grades; at least, it
has no grades which an engine cannot take
by starting on a level. The rate given
by the Quebec Harbour Board is 18 cents,
instead of 36 cents, and this would amount
to $11,880 for the freight of a trainload of
wheat.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It would be $15
a mile.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: There are many
trains running that do not get $2 a mile
every trip, but this rate would give them
$15 a mile. The cheap rate on wheat from
Armstrong to Quebec was cancelled some
three years ago, and much higher rates
have ruled ever since, and practically no
wheat is now going over that road.
In my judgment, this matter relating to
the city of Quebec-and the same remark
applies to the railways-appertains to the
department of my honourable friend the
Minister of Labour. The wages being paid
for labour on the different railways in Canada make it absolutely impossible, in my
opinion, to carry wheat or any other product cheaply. The wages paid on the railways must be brought down. To my mind
this is one of the first things to be done.
I do not mean to cut the wages of the
labouring man to a low, unfair figure, but
under the present schedule of overtime and
double overtime we find numbers of men
running up bills until it is almost impos-

APRIL 12, 1921
sible to carry on a railway. I notice in the
report of the Government railways for last
year or the year before that out of every
dollar collected for freight and passenger
traffic 75 cents or 78 cents were paid for
labour alone.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Eighty-five cents.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: One of the big
men of the Canadian National Railways,
who had been for many years with the
C.P.R., told me that within the last few
months there were hundreds of men, engineers and conductors, on the Government
lines as well as on the C.P.R. who at the
present time were drawing from $5,000 to
$6,000 a year. That was told to me by a
man who knew what he was talking about.
Now, if men are drawing such wages as
that, you cannot have reasonable freight
rates; and such wages, which to my mind
are unreasonable, will have to come down
with other things in order to make the
Gavernment roads pay anythiiig like their
operating expenses, without reckoning any
interest whatever on the investment, and
yet keep the freight rates within reasonable
figures. If freight rates are kept up as at
present, they will force stagnation of business; it cajmot be otherwise. When passenger raies are raised unduly people can stay
at home; but freight must be hauled,
whether at a loss or a profit. I do not blame
the Government for their action in increasing the wages, because the action of the
Government of the United States forced it
on the railroads of Canada, and our Government could not very well help it. But now
every paper in the United States contains
reports of one big interest or another
making cuts of from 10 to 15 per cent
in the wages of their employees, and
the men are accepting the reductions. The
cost of living in a good many lines is becoming somewhat less, and wages will have
to come down as well as other things. Wheb I observed that a Committee was
being moved for I thought that I might
defer my remarks until we had more information such as the Committee might
bring out. On the other hand, I thought
it might be well to speak briefly, as I have
done, and draw the attention of the members of that Committee to these various
matters that should be looked into. Whçn
the Committee bas deliberated on this question we should be in a better position to
deal with this subject than we are at present. I have thrown out these few suggestions in the hope that the Committee

AMý

217

may take them up and obtain as much information as possible, and when this is
secured we can deal with the question more
fully. It must be remembered that we have
hundreds of millions of dollars invested in
railroads, and tens of millions invested in
our harbour improvements; we have ships
owned by the Government, 15 of which, I
understand, are tied up to the wharves in
the city of Halifax, while others are running around the ocean looking for freights.
It seems to me that there ought to be some
way of securing information that would enable us to make some effort to carry our
freight through our own country. We all
know it would be a very great advantage
to do so, with the present rate of exchange
against us, for the less freight business we
do in the United States the better our rate
of exchange will be. I trust, therefore, that
something will come from this Committee
that will enable us to manage better than
we have done in the last few years; and if
there bas been anything in the way of discrimination against the Grand Trunk I
trust the Government will see to it that the
Board of Railway Management will see that
every part of the Canadian Government
railways 'gets fair play.
The motion was agreed to.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I should like to
call the attention of the leader of the
Government to the fact that certain reports
have been brought down in another place
that have not yet been laid on the Tab'e
of the Senate. I have a list of them here.
Perhaps my honourable friend will allow
me to send it over to him.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is my
honourable friend aware of the papers
that I laid on the Table yesterday?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I understand that
my honourable friend laid the Public Accounts and the Auditor General's Report
upon the Table.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And cetain papers relating to the Grand Trunk
xailway purchase.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes. I will read th,
list that I have:
-Main Estimates, year ending March 31, 1922.
Supplementary Estimates, year ending March

I think it is desirable that these reports
should be brought down in the Senate at
about the same time that they are brought
down in the House of Commons. I know
my honourable friend has a great deal to

THE RAILWAY PROBLEM IN CANADA
DISCUSSION AND INQUIRY

The Senate resumed from April 7 consideration of the inquiry of Hon. Mr.
Casgrain:
That he wilI cail the attention of the Senate
to the railway problem in Canada and especially
to the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and inquire if it is the intention of the Government
to abandon the arbitration proceedinge.

Hon. P. C. MURPHY: Honourable gentlemen, I give credit to my honourable
friend from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) for bringing this matter to the
attention of Parliament.
'An Hon. SENATOR: Louder.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Some honourable
gentleman says "Louder." That shows the
acousties of this building.
Before proceeding I should like to point
out that there were two alnost analogous
motions on the Order Paper. The honourable gentleman fromn De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr,. Tessier) introduced a motion
almost anailogous to the one I am now
discussing; and hast night the honourable
gentleman from, Assiniboia (Hon. Mr.
Turriff), speaking on this motion, and I
to-day speaking on the other one, are discussing practically the samne thing.
The railway situation in Canada to-day
demands the consideration of every serionsminded citizen. I congratulate the honourable gentleman from the Gulf (Hon.
Mr. L'Espérance) and the henourable
gentleman f rom Stadacona (Hon. L. C.
Webster) on having brought to, the attention of the House the importance of having Canadian produets find their outiet
through Canadian ports. They elaborated
their arguments and gave their reasons,
and 1 agree with them that if we are
ever to become a nation in a' true sense we
must have ports and we must have population. In order to understand this question we mnust know the economic conditions.
I wish to compliment my honourable friend
£rom Simcoe (Hon. Mr. Bennett) upon the
way in which he deait with the case. He
gave reasons why the Canadian Pacific
railway got the business and carried it to
Canadian ports, althoughi our own Canadian National railways have more hines
throughout the country.
For the benefit of the people of the West
we have gridironed the West with railways which are at the present time a

financial curse to us. It is admitted on the
best authority that we are at least fifty
years ahead of our time in this respect and
that if we are not; to lose our nationality
and be submerged in keeping up a pace
commensurate with this "wild west"' building of railways, we must increase our population. I am free to admit that our population was greatly increased by immigration
between 1900 and 1910; but, because of
the quality of that immigration, measured
by the standards of to-day, 1 do not know
what its total benefit has been to Canada.
We find to-day that we have to restrict this
rapid inflow; and, in a word, we are "handpicking" immigration, by means of the
money test. I do not believe in this test.
In my opinion physical and mental fitness
should be the only test. Money counts for
very little. It may depreciate fifty per
cent in a week owing to exchange conditions, and while I would exclude imbeciles, mental degenerates and those physically unfit to be the fathers and mothers
of the future citizens of Canada, I do not;
think a man should be excluded because he
has not $250 in his pocket on arrival in
quarantine at Quebec. 1 just want you to
consider for a minute, some of you gentlemen who to-day can count your money by
the millions, where you wouhd have been
if your ancestors had been dumped in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence or deported back to
the fatherland at the time they struck
quarantine, either at New York or at Quebec, simply because they did not have a
certain amount of money.
However, this is not the question. In
introducing what we now know to be a millstone around the necks of theý people of
this country, a oelebrated man uttered what
seemed to me at the time to, be a classical
blasphemy when he used the phrase, "We
want to have something ail-Canadian, East
and West, within our own territories," and
when he hehd up his hands in pioùs ad-:
monition to the majority of his supporters
-who knew his policy was wrong-and
said, "Would to God we are not now too
late."
Now we have the actuality. We may be
too late; but we have got ourselves into
such a position that we must do something
to, save the situation. We did ôur best;
every one shouldered the burden.' We have
taken over the Canadian Northern railway,
which, it is admitted, passes .th ough the
best territory in Canada. We tsk it over
because of the crisis in Canada's affairsa crisis in the history of the world. We

bad to save our credit, and we did that
which, under ordinary circumstances, perhaps sober-minded men would not have
done. We also took over the Grand Trunk
railway, and I am free to stand up here
in my place and say that I voted in favour
of taking it over, but with trepidation, because I anticipated just what has occurred.
Financial figures and financial ciphers and
workers behind the scenes put a burden
upon the people that they would not have
accepted if they had known what it meant.
But wé do not want to haggle over that.
We have taken a responsibility put upon
us by our ancestors.
There is an East and a West. I do
not mind my honourable friend from De
Lanaudiere, who was discourteous to the
member from Boissevain
(Hon. Mr.
Schaffner) and myself the other day, and
who, in a half-hearted way, ungraciously
allowed the question frorn the honourable
member from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). In answer to the question of that
honourable gentleman, "Did you support
that policy?" my honourable friend opposite said, "I not only supported it, but I
made the longest speech in Parliament in
favour of it." It is no trouble for the
honourable gentleman to make a long
speech: he could not do anything else.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That was on the
Navy question.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: My honourable
friend reminds me of the moose which,
when it wants to sit down, travels round
and round 'and round in a circle,
and then travels round and round
and round the other way until it
comes to the place where it wants to sic
down, and then sits down. His speech
and his attitude are well described by our
late colleague from Halifax, and I do not
think, as a physiological student, that I
could even admit the opening complimentary phrase of that gentleman.
However, we have this octopus of a railway situation on our hands, and we might
as well act as men and grapple with it in
the best way possible. It is a serious situation, a situation that makes thinking men
sit up in the face of present world conditions, where exchanges are all awry and
when we do not know from day to day
what cataclysm may be brought about by
a clash between labour and capital.
The honourable gentleman from Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster) and the honourable gentleman from the Gulf (Hon.
Mr. L'Espérance) are capable of looking

after the ports of the Upper St. Lawrence;
but I have something to say for the Maritime Provinces.
The question of public ownership bas
been brought into this debate, and its
As the fathers of
efficiency criticized.
public ownership, we in the Maritime
Provinces should necessarily have some
voice in this matter. We are the original
public owners as far as railways are concerned. As far back as 1836 a railway was
built in Nova Scotia, which was subsequently extended to Lévis in Quebec and
left hanging in the fields for God knows
what reason for many years. " Inefficiency again," you may say; but latterly
it found its way, by devious means well
known by some of my honourable friends,
to the commercial metropolis of Canada.
Public ownership with us gave every
satisfaction, whether it was efficient from
a business standpoint or not. I want to
draw the attention of honourable gentlemen to the fact that the building of the
Intercolonial railway to Lévis was not a
commercial proposition but was in conformity with the terms of Confederation
of the Maritime Provinces; and, more than
that, in the beginning it was a military
road and was built not as a commercia
proposition. Therefore, its gradients and
curvatures are bad in many places, all
making for extra cost in maintenance. It
was run for a long time as a political machine-and even political machines are not
all run wrong. I do not know that there
is any improvement. It was at least as
good under so-called political machine conditions-and I am not now talking politices
-as it is to-day with all your full-fledged
officiality who are supposed to be experts
and efficiency experts at that.
We in the Maritime Provinces-and 1
am speaking now' for the territory I represent-have certain rights and we pay,
proportionate to our population, as much,
if not more, as a consuming population to
the exchequer as the people of the other
provinces of Canada. We have rights that
are inalienable-and guaranteed by the
ternis of Confederation-rights much deferred while we are paying to make the
western wheat fields of which we are proud,
but which have never given us, so far as
the Maritime Provinces are concerned, a
commensurate return, a success. We bought
the Northwest Territories, which are now
provinces, from the Hudson Bay Company,
we helped to build the C.P.R., and we have
given of our brawn and our brain to the
population of that West some of the best

APRIL 18, 1921
men that are in those provinces to-day. We
have gridironed the country flfty , years
ahead for those people, and have assumed
the vast financial repponsibility that je now
weighing so heavily on our people without
any benefit to them; and what have we
received?
Speaking for my own home personally,
the province of Prince Edward Islandand a person must be modest in speaking
personally, and modesty as you know is not
one of my attributes-we had to wait practically 50 years for the fulfilment of the
elemental ternis of Confederation.
We
handed over our railroad, which is classified
as a debit by such a well-known expert as
Mr. Payne, for nothing. It cost us $4,000,000; and, if my judgment of history je
worth anything, it was used as a fulcrum
to force Prince Edward Island into the Confederation, and I arn not sure yet whether
or nlot that was to the advantage of Prince
Edward Island. As I have said, we gave
this railroad gratuitously and received no
credit for it in the original termes. It is
true that the Intercolonial railroad, as figured ont by Mr. Payne, has shown a deficit,
which he bas capitalized, which would show
an enormous fixed charge for earning
power. But when we stop to consider what
was given the C. P. R. by the people of this
country to implement; the termes of Confederation, I think that my western friende
should be willing to grant that in the vernacular "they have no kick coming";, and
when you consider what we have done since
by the building of other lunes, and coneider
also the fixed charges on Canada, of which
the Maritime Provinces, and especially
Prince Edward Island, which did nlot have
its termes fulflled for 50 years, is an integral part, I think we have reason for
grievance.
I have laboured this for the purpose of
appealing to the common sense of everybody that we have a grievance when we
ask for the proper facilities of having our
railroad, which we gave for nothing, broadgauged to enable us to send our freight
frorn the routing-point to its destination
without transfer, and we demand also that
a deficit on the Prince Edward Island railroad be not ehown by charging up $14,000,000 for the operation of the car-ferry
steamer yearly against the owner of the
Prince Edward Island'railroad, while at
the samne time the Muigrave and Hawkesbury ferry is maintained as an integral
part of the Canadian National Railway
system.

221

Economnically we are to my mind up
against the proposition to keep faith with
the Maritine Provinces. I think it would
be better that what je known as the old
Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island
system should be operated under separate
management than that we should be
charged with the sins of the West. We
have put up
too long with
this
kind of jug-handled policy.
Originally this was a narrow-gauge system built by somne nigger-in-the-woodpile men who were behind the scenes, and
who could get a contract. In those days
iailroad building was not well understood.
The contractors got sO much a mile for
'building, and they went around creeke and
crevices, and avoided grades, and ail that
sort of thing. Finally they had built some
sort of road. It was not very good in the
old days, but it cost the country $4,000,000.
When our représentatives came up here-I
was not born then, or was born not long
before-those men put it over them, and
they handed over the railway. As a matter
of fact, they had reached a stage at which
they could not borrow rnoney. The province
was 500 per cent solvent, but certain influences prevented them from borrowing
any more money in England, in order that
they might be forced into Confederation.
Unfortunately for the party element, the
parties got into antagonism, and one rau
to Ottawa and the other ran to Ottawa, each
trying to make the best of the bargain and
take the province out of the chaos, when
they could not do anything else with the
financiers of London. Although the Province was almost 1,000 per cent solvent and
there were great possibilities for fruition,
they had to corne and beg at the doors.
Now, we gave the railway for nothiug, but
we have asked and we now ask that it be
broad-gauged. The car ferry, bas ,been
built. ut took us fifty years to drive the
Government to that, but we have absolute
communication now. Part of the railway bas
been broad-gauged-from Charlottetown
to Emerald, from Emerald to Borden, and
from Emerald to Summerside; but we want
the rest of it broad-gauged and we want the
line to route us straight through, so that
vegetables shipped in the morning can corne
through the same day and will not have to
be transferred.
Here is one of the termes of Confederatien, which bas been vitiated by non-fuifilment for yeare:
Efficient stearo service for the conveyance of
mail and passengers to be estaýbllshed and maintained between the isiand and -the mainland

SENATE
of the Dominion, winter and summer, thus
placing the Island in continuous communication
with the Intercolonial railway and the railway
system of the Dominion.
That is a plain statement of fact. If
that means anything it means the same
degree of efficiency for Prince Edward
Island as along the North Thompson river,
where there are two lines, although there is
not an inhabitant for four hundred miles
on either side of the river: one train blows
its whistle at the other. If I can interpret
a statute that was made in good faith, this
means that justice should be done, and I
have fought with the Government that bas
not done it before, whatever Government it
was. The fault lies with both Governments.
and with the traditions of the times. But
millions are as nothing to-day. Millions
can be got to-day for a jerk-water road for
about thirty of a population, which will
probably be derelict in five years.
The people of Prince Edward Island have
the compact and they have justice on their
side, and I desire to urge upon this House
that that compact should be carried out and
that our citizens, our manufacturers and
our people generally should be placed in a
position to develop the "Garden of the
Gulf," as it is called, and the garden of
Canada. As I have said, I do not desire
to labour the question any further, but I
thought this was a good time to draw it to
the attention of the Senate.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, the railway question is of importance to Canada and, I think, of interest to all of us, and this may be a fitting
opportunity to make just a few observations
concerning it.
My hon. friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) who
introduced the subject in this House made
some preliminary remarks, to one or two of
which I would like briefly to refer-not at
all for the purpose of differing with him, but
in order to remove any misunderstanding
that might arise from his remarks. In
the honourable gentleman's opening remarks he referred, among other things, to
the Prime Minister's war effort, saying:
And so far as giving the last man is concerned, I don't see that he gave many sons,
although there are members in this House who
sent one, two, or three sons to the war.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: And they do not
boast about it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I just want to
point out, honourable gentlemen, that to
my certain knowledge the Prime Minister's
eldest son bas not yet passed his sixteenth
birthday, and therefore it should not be
Hon. Mr. MURPHY.

permitted to be thought anywhere in Canada that the Prime Minister even had a
son of military age. I do not think that
my honourable friend intended to convey
the impression that he had.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Nevertheless
his words were subject to that interpretation.
My honourable friend referred also to
a number of subjects not directly connected
with railway matters. I will not go into
details concerning them: but he did propound certain questions which he thought
ought to be answered, with reference to
deficits, by provinces, on the railways now
owned by the public. I think it is probably true that the earnings of the railways
owned by the Government and operated by
the Canadian National Railways are known
by divisions, but not by provinces, and it is
certainly true that the deficits can scarcely
be accurately classified by provinces. The
reasons, I think, are obvious.
My honourable friend, in speaking of the
general failure of the public ownership of
railways, referred to Australia as one illustration in support of his opinion. I
would point out, in connection with the
Australian railways, that conditions in
Australia are very different from what they
are in Canada-that the Australian railways are not a complete system, as our
own are, but are divided into groups and
have different gauges. In order to transport a car-load of goods from one end of the
Commonwealth to the other, it is necessary
to tranship at least twice, which adds
tremendously to the cost and must greatly
reduce the efficiency of operation of the
state-owned Australian railways.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does that apply
to passengers?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Six cents a mile!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The only parallel that we have in Canada to that situation is in the province of Prince Edward
Island, whence mg honourable friend wha
bas just spoken (Hon. Mr. Murphy) comes;
and when we notice that the deficit of the
Prince Edward Island railway is about
$1,000 a mile more than that of the other
lines owned by the Government of Canada,
notwithstanding the fact that it is located
in what is called " the Garden of the Gulf,"
ene of the most fertile portions of Canada
from the agricultural standpoint-and ag-

ricultural production is the chief soprce
of traffic for a railroad-we at once
realizeHon. Mr. MURPHY: Will the honourable
gentleman pardon me? I missed that point.
I have here the figures regarding the cost
of transfer at Borden, and I intended to
give tlhem to the House, but forgot to do so.
It would mean a great saving if that road
were broad-gauged, or if at least the broadgauging of it were started, from my own
place to Summerside. The honourable gentleman knows that as well as I do.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was just
coming to the point which my honourable
friend has made,Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The figures are
there.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -namely, that
as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so,
and the Prince Edward Island railway
becomes a standard gauge railway, the
cost of operation will be very materially
decreased..
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And that is the
-only parallel to the Australian situation
that exists in Canada to-day.
But the railway problem is one of long
standing and the difficulties are probably
due to many different causes. I think that
one of the chief causes can be clearly shown
in some figures that I shall undertake to
quote. Canada began railway building in
1836, and from that time until 1898, a
period of sixty-two years, there were constructed in Canada 16,670 miles of railway,
or about 272 miles of road per year during
that period of sixty-two years. I assume
that the people aud Governments of that
period felt that the railways were being
constructed in accordance with the growing necessities of the country. During that
time the population of Canada increased
by almost 5,000,000, or about 100,000 less
than 5,000,000 people. In 1836 we had a
population of 436,000; in 1898 there were
in Canada 5,371,000, according to information which the Bureau of Statistics gives
me. So that while our population increased
by 5,000,000 Canada built 16,000 miles of
railway, or at the rate of 272 miles per
year. But, for some reason or other, which
we need not perhaps reflect upon at the
moment, from 1898 or thereabouts the epidemic of railroad building in Canada became very pronounced. During the seventeen years from 1898 to 1915 there were

built in Canada 18,706 miles of railway,
or, I think, exactly 1,100 miles per year;
and during that period our population increased by less than 2,000,000 people. It
occurs to me, therefore, honourable gentlemen, that the fundamental cause, or one
of the fundamental causes, of our present
railway difficulties is that over an extended
period railway building in Canada was
carried on at too rapid a rate. That gives
us an idea of the situation, say, up to 1915
or 1916. We all know that the Intercolonial
railway has in only one year in its history
paid operating expenses. We know that
the Grand Trunk Pacific and Transcontinental lines were bankrupt in 1917, both of
them. We know that the Canadian Northern was faced with liquidation. And we
know that all of those properties named
were brought into one system, known as
the Canadian National railways, and that
those broken-down wrecks, which individually it wàs impossible to operate except
at substantial loss, were brought under
Government control, in the hope of remedying so far as possible a bad situation.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I desire to
draw the attention of the House to the
situation in which were placed all the railways now owned by the state. Let us turn
our minds for a moment to the Canadian
Pacific Railway, which we all recognize as
an economically and efficiently operated system. I submit that it has not its equal in
the world. In 1916 the Canadian Pacific
Railway gross earnings were 129 million
odd dollars, and its operating expenses were
80 millions and a quarter. After paying
expenses of every sort, including dividends,
it had a net surplus of fifteen and a half
millions in that year. Let us draw a mental picture of the situation of the Canadian Pacific as compared with all the railways that about that time came into the
Canadian National system, in order that
we may fairly give credit to each of the
managements of those two great systems
now existing, for what they have done.
Let us see how the Canadian Pacific has
got on since that time. Because of the
war, wages increased and the cost of materials advanced rapidly. The total cost
of operation of the Canadian Pacific railway, for example, was 128 per cent in 1920
over 1916. To be accurate, the operating
costs or working expenses of 1916 were
$80,255,000, whereas in 1920. they were
$183,488,000, or an increase in operating
expenses of 1031 million, or 128 per cent.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Was the mileage
increased?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Canadian
Pacific railway mileage meanwhile was not
increased very greatly. I have not the
exact figures. But I want to point out
this,Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is something wrong there, surely.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -that while
the gross revenues in 1920 were 216h millions, having increased 67 per cent, or $86,000,000 odd, the working expenses of the
Canadian Pacific increased by $103,000,000,
or 128 per cent. I submit, honourable
gentlemen, that that was a necessary and
unavoidable expense or the Canadian Pacific Railway Company would never have
incurred it; and the point is, that if it was
necessary and unavoidable for the Canadian Pacific to increase its operating expenses to the extent of 128 per cent in those
four years, handling approximately the
same quantity of traffic, then it is obvious
what must occur on the system knowi. as
the Canadian National Railways, which
was made up of a number of systems that
were bankrupt prior to 1916.
Perhaps it would be interesting to the
House to point out the comparative traffic handled in 1916 and in 1920 on the
Canadian Pacific. In 1916 that road
handled 13,822,000,000 tons of paying
freight one mile. In 1920 it carried 13,856,000,000 tons one mile, or an increase
of two-tenths of one per cent. That is to
say, the revenue freight traffic of the Canadian Pacific, according to their own annual report, was two-tenths of one per
cent more in 1920 than in 1916; and for
carrying that traffic they received $86,000,000 more by reason of increased freight
rates, while their operating rates increased $103,000,000, or 128 per cent.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
Does the Minister know how much was the increase
between 1914 and 1917?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: None whatever. There were no changes in either
rates or wages at that time.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I am talking
about the carrying.
I have not
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
those figures. Reference was made by my
honourable friend opposite the other day
to the earnings per mile of road. That, to
my mind, is a very important factor in
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the cost of operation. In 1916 the Canadian Pacific earned $6,860 per mile of
road; that was, freight earnings.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Freight alone?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Freight alone;
and in 1920, for carrying only two-tenths
of one per cent more freight, its earnings were $11,072 per mile, or an increase
of $5,212; yet all of it was absorbed, and
more too, as I pointed out. At the end of
1920 the Canadian Pacific, notwithstanding its splendid position, notwithstanding
its net surplus of over $15,500,000 in 1916,
found all of its extra revenues exhausted,
and all of its net surplus wiped out with
the exception of $450,000. I therefore submit that, with that showing on a road
which we all recognize as efficiently managed and economically run, it is a wonder
that the deficit on the combination of lines
which the Government took over and attempted to operate is not very much larger
than it is.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Not properly coordinated.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think my
honourable friend has in mind the opinion
that he held a year ago-that it was unwise to undertake to add the Grand Trunk
Railway System to the existing lines owned
by the state. On that occasion I occupied
soine time in showing why I thought it
was very desirable that the Grand Trunk
Railway System should be brought into
the National System. I do not propose to
repeat what I said then, except to say that
that opinion has in no way been changed,
and that I believe very strongly that if the
Canadian National Railway System is ever
to be profitable it must have access to
sources of traffic in Eastern Canada in
order that it may have the advantage of
long-haul business. To-day there is not a
single point east of Fort William-with
the exception of Ottawa, where we have
connection with the New York and Ottawa
Railway-where the Canadian National
Railway System connects with any line
running into the United States, except
through the Grand Trunk.
Over those
American connections, we sent more than
$500,000,000 worth of goods last year, and
received from the United States almost
twice that quantity. How can we expect

Now I want to deal briefly with what

the necessity and the causes of the increase
in cost of operation of railways. My views

and statements made with reference to the
causes and the necessity or lack of necessity of the increases that were made in
wages to railway employees. I have followed
that matter probably as closely as most
Canadians, being quite intimately connected
with and interested in it, as in all other
labour questions; and it is my judgment
that the advances to the railway employees
in Canada have not been excessive as compared with advances in all other lines of
industrial activity, or indeed those made in
the compensation to our own Government
employees. I am not going to weary the
House with any lengthened arguments in
connection with this, but will simply attempt
to point out three or four facts which are
matters of record, and in which I think all
will agree, and then briefly endeavour to
show how certain suggestions that have
been made may represent an isolated case
but do not represent the general situation.
I have said that wages increased approximately 100 per cent on our Canadian
railways. That is true, and I think the
pamphlet showing evidence of that bas been
distributed by the Department of Labour
to every member in both Houses of Parliaent. The cost of living in Canada has increased more than 100 per cent during that
period. From 1914 to 1918 there were no
increases of any general character given to
railway employees in Canada, though there
were individual exceptions. But in 1918,
the cost of living having risen substantially
from 1914 to i1918, particularly during
1917, the situation became utterly intolerable from the standpoint of the railway
men, their purchasing power, their earnings, being greatly decreased. The same
thing occurred in the United States, where
the Government had taken'over the administration of the railways, and undertook
to deal with this problem in a national
way. While negotiations were proceeding
over there early in 1918 many of the railway employees, through their respective
organizations in Canada, presented a request to the various railway companies for
a revision of their wage agreement. I think
that negotiations ýbegan with what are
known as the shop trades-men engaged in
car shops, round houses, and general shops,
car repairers, etc.-at all the various terminal points, representing a little over 30,000
men on a]l railways in Canada. They were
in negotiation with the railway companies
through a joint committee representing ail
the companies, from about April to July.
The requests that they presented to their
employers on behalf of the Canadian Railway employees in those classes of service
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

were somewhat 'higher than the rates fixed
by the United States Government by agreement with workmen there representing
these same classes of employees; and in
July, 1918, there were some prospects of
difficulty in reaching a conclusion as to
what should be the adjustment here, Those
negotiations, notwithstanding statements
that have appeared in the press, were always conducted between representatives of
the employees on our Canadian railways,
who were Canadian citizens in every instance, and the Canadian railway companes.
In July, 1918, various other classes such
as the train service and maintenance of way
employees, who keep the tracks in order,
the station agents, the telegraphers-all
had represented to the railway companies
their desire to have their wages agreements revised. No negotiations had taken
place between those employees and the railway companies up to that time. In July,
1918, the Railway War Board, representing
the managements of practically all Canadian railways, had a conference in Montreal, and voluntarily reached the decision
that it was advisable that Canadian railways should simply adopt what was then
known as the McAdoo Award, which had
come out a week or two before that, as
applicable to Canadian railway employees.
Notwithstanding statements to the contrary, the McAdoo award as adopted in
Canada was adopted voluntarily by the
railway companies, who subsequently came
to the Government and asked for an increase in freight rates in order to compensate them for what was obviously necessary in order to pay the increases to their
men.
I hesitate to make any statement that
seems directly to contradict a statement of
any other gentleman, but I think it is quite
unfair to the railway employees, and indeed
unfair to the people of Canada, because
it makes railway employees dissatisfied
and disgruntled, when statements are made
that do not represent the facts as affecting
them. I feel constrained, therefore, to refer
briefly to press reports emanating from
Victoria, B.C., yesterday, in which the
Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners is reported as stating that the
McAdoo award was given to the Canadian
railway workers not because it affected
Canada but because slick gentlemen from
the United States journeyed to Canada
and threatened they would call a strike in
this country if the award was not given
to Canadian workers. The Commissioner

APRIL 13, 1921
is further reported as saying that it was
difficuit to imagine anything more humiliating than that labour leaders in the
United States should be able to hoid a pistoi to our heads.
If the Commissioner is correctly reported
hie is obviously nlot familiar with the facts
connected with the adoption of the-McAdoo
award in 1918 by Canadian railways, as I
have briefiy outlined to you the details.,
It is nlot true thai any gentlemen from
the United States made any threat of the
nature stated.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Did they came?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They did not.
I think it is true that fia representative of
any of the international railway organizations from. outside Canada has taken up any
matter since 1910, when, on the occasion
of the Grand Trunk strike, twa officiais
came over here and succeeded in settling
the strike after it had been initiated by
the employees themseives. It is true that the
Canadian railways did decide ta adopt the
McAdoo award in 1918 and apply the samne
te their employees; but the decision of the
railway officiais was reached voluntariiy
and not because of any demands for the
adoption of the McAdao award made by
representatives of the employees. It is
forthermore true that every executive afficer
of avery railway arganization in Canada la

New, honourable gentlemen, I feel that
it is oniy fair ta -our 200,000 Canadian
raiiway empioyees to make lihese facts
known ta the Hanse and if need be ta the
country. It is incorrect ta state that any
pressure was brought ta bear upan either
the Canadian railway officiais or employees
respecting the adoption of the MeAdoo
award by any interests outside Canada.
The question then arises naturaiiy in the
minds of ail gentlemen as ta whéther ar nat
the rates that have been set in the United
States are fair ind reasoinable as applied
ta Canadian conditions. May I say that
prior ta 1917 it was my duty and privilege
ta be closely cannected with the making of
those agreements with Canadian raiiways,
and it *was always the pride 6f the
employees an the Canadian Pacific raiiway,
at ieast, and in fact' an most of the railways in Canada, outside of the Grand
Trunk, which at that time had the same
standard of rates, that the prevaiiing
S-15à

227

rates in Canada were slightiy higher than
those in the United States, especiaiiy in the
southern states. There were reasans for
that. We know that aur climatic conditions
are much mare severe than those generaily
prevailing in the United States; that the
cost of praviding a comfortabie home, fuel,
and warm ciothing for a railway man and
bis dependents here is higher than the
average cost in the United States, and this
was generaily recognized. But, natwithstanding that, the raiiway companies themselves came ta the conclusion that it was
reaiiy fair ta advance wages in Canada
on the samne basis as they were advanced
in the United States.
Now we might for a moment profitably
inquire whether or not those rates were
fair. Let us see what the rates are at
present. In passing, .however, I might say
that the McAdoo award of 1918, ta which
such exception is taken, was subsequently
found ta be quite inadequate ta meet exieting requirements, by reason of a further
increase in the cost of living, and in 1920
the United States Government further increased the rates, which exampie was again
followed by the Canadian railways.
Now let us see what the facts are as the
rates exist at present. There are between
20,000 and 30,000 railway employees in
Canada who keep the tracks safe for the
trains ta travel over. What do they get
by way of compensation? Under the United
States award, which la condemned as being
unfair, and which it is claimed should not
be applicable ta Canada, but has been
adopted by aur railways and by aur
empioyees, the raiiway eectianmen in Canada, in Ottawa for example, get 48 cents
per hour for their services. That figure
can be verified by laoking in a railway
schedule, or in the document which bas
been distributed by the Department of
Labour ta honourabie gentlemen.

certain station was $160 a month. I noticed
also that he was the only man about the
place, and that he had been called outside
of office hours forty-four different times.
In addition to that he had put in fifty-two
hours overtime; that is, he had been called
upon after bis regular day's work was over
to remain on duty. That man was on duty
virtually night and day. The result was
that he got more out of his overtime than
he got out of his salary. I admit that that
does not indicate the best of management.
In bis overtime he probably gave only half
service, that is, he probably put in half as
many h'ours as a second man would, and you
could employ a second man who would give
eight hours a day for less money than this
man, and better service at less cost would
have resulted.

he gets the overtime pay for those eight
hours. I have heard of that as one of the
glaring cases of extravagant charges.
Would my
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

any sort should be on duty, and that if his
services were not required for any particular hour he should not be paid for that
hour?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: In discussing this
question the other day I was informed, on
what I thought was good authority, that
in a case such as the honourable gentleman has just mentioned with reference to
telegraph operators, no time less than
two hours was allowed for overtime in
any day,-that if an operator came back
after his eight hours and was engaged
for ten minutes he was paid for two hours;
that if a further interval elapsed and he
was engaged for another ten minutes he
was paid for another two hours and the
pay would be louble pay; and that by doing that extra twenty minutes work he
would be entitled to double pay for the
day. Is that right?
Hon.

Mr.

ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. I am glad
that my honourable friend has mentioned
that. That is a fair sample of some of the
statements going around to-day. If a train
crew is going out on a train and the train
is cancelled, the crew is paid for one quarter of a day. If a telegraph operator goes
home at night and is required to meet a
train at two o'clock in the morning, or if
a freight train comes along and is delayed waiting for late passenger trains,
they call the operator. He may live a mile
or more from the station, or in the station. He gets out of bed and cornes down
to the station, for which he gets two hours
pay; but he is liable for one hour's service. The railway companies, like everybody else, are anxious to get all the service they can for the money they pay out;
and when a man is sent for to give an
hour's service he generally renders the service. I can state quite positively that I do
not think a single instance of the kind mentioned by my honourable friend could be
pointed out as having occurred anywhere
in Canada.
I fear that I have dragged these remarks
out to too great length, but I felt that it
was fair to our railway employees and to
our people that something should be known
of the other side of the question, because
recently there have been many remarks
made that seem to express only one opinion.
There are about 200,000 railway employees in Canada, and every time an unfair or incorrect statement is made such
as the one I specifically referred to a few
moments ago, it makes those employees
feel disgruntled and think there are influences at work in the country trying to
discredit public ownership, and they ask
themselves, 'What is the use of trying to
make public ownership a success?" They
throw up their hands, and say, "If no one
else cares, we do. not need to," and it tends
to destroy the morale on our Canadian National system, which I am anxious should
not occur.

Federal grants under "The Canada Highways
Act," chap. 54 of the Statutes of Canada, 1919?
2. What are the highways in respect to which
agreements or Federal aid have been reached
between the Province of Manitoba and the
Minister of Railways?
3. Have any sums been paid to the Province
of Manitoba under the "Canada Highways Act"?

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I beg
to move the second reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not want to
interrupt my honourable friend, but I do
not think the Bill has been printed. According to our Minutes it is not printed
in English or in French.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
informed that it has been printed and distributed. My honourable friend may not
have got his copy. However, the Bill is
a very unimportant one, and is simply for
the purpose of bringing the fine that is
imposed under the present Act into line
with certain provincial legislation in British Columbia. Under the Migratory Birds
Convention Act there is a convention between Canada and the United States by
which provincial legislation, so far as that
legislation affects migratory birds, shall be
carried out by the two Federal Governments, thus depriving the provinces, who
are parties to the Treaty, of their authority
to enforce their -legislation in regard to
this class of birds. But in British Columbia, under the Game Conservation Act of
that province, a maximum fine of $3,0 can
be imposed. This legislation is in force
and effective except in the case of migratory birds. But under the Dominion legislation, which is confirmed by treaty, the
maximum fine is $100. It is therefore desirable to increase this amount to conform
with the fine imposed by the province of
British Columbia for the violation of their
Game Preservation Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

That he will call the -attention of the Senate ta
the railway problemn in Canada, and especially
to the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and Inquire If It là the intention of the Governmnent ta

Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, yesterday afternoon we had a
very interesting statement £rom the honourable Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson), in regard to certain phases of
the railway question. I must congratulate
the Minister upon the clear stateiNent hie
made on that occasion, although ta some
extent I take exception ta some of the
things hie said, because, in discussing the
question as it presents itself to this House
and ta the country at thepresent time, 1
would have. expected him ta give us some
particulars as to what hie, at any rate,
thought to be the reason of the country's
being called upon at the present time ta

pay for a deficit in operating and fixed
charges amounting ta $70,000,000. 1 noticed
that the honourable gentleman rather left
that question aside, and gave us other.
phases of it which are not so important ta
the country at the pre-sent time. The honourable Minister is, of course, so thoroughly acquainted with the subject that I
feel somewhat diffident in saying anything
in regard ta a question with which hie has
been faniiliar from his early years, a sub-

ject in which, I might suggest, he has specialized, at least along certain lin'es. He
deait very f uIly with the question of the
wages of the men and went into certain
details in regard to that. I do not think it
is advisable in a House such as the Senate
ta discuss the question in that way, because, in discussing those details\ backwards and forwards, we are liable ta get
into some difficulty. In reading the honourable -Minister's speech I was rather disapp*ointed at the fact that he as a Minister
of 'the Crown deait with this question
of wages very much as though he were
the special advocate of the labour people
in the Government. I think that an honourable Minister of the Crown should take
a wider view of his position than thatthat hie should be able ta view the conditions, confronting the country from the
point of view of the country as a whole.
Our difficulty in discussing this question
is ta a verygreat extent thet of getting
information. I therefore regret very much
that the Minister did not; see his way clear
ta give us more information with regard
to the whole situation than he gave us yestèrday.
In 'one part of his speech he deait with
w1hat is known as the McAdoo awgrd. He

288

left the impression in my mind that the

McAdoo

award was putV into efFect in

Canada almost voluntarily 6n the part af
the railways in order ta help the men. I
find, upon inquiry, that this questlon came
before the Government, and that an Order
in Council was passed which, for the, information of the House, 1 think it would be
a good thing ta read at length. That Order
in Council is Na. 1768, and is dated the
15th of July, 1918. It says:
The Commnittee of the Privy Couneil have had
before themn a Memorandum, dated July 15,
1918, f ront the Minieter of Railways and Canais,
statlng that representations have been made by
the Organi2ation of Railway Employées for an
increase -in the scale' of ratiway wages of the
employees engaged an the Intercolonial railway, Transcontinental raflway and Prince Edward Island railway, and that similar demands
have been made on other Railway Companies
in Canada. That the attachedi letter from the
Chairman of the Railway Commission has been
recei-ved by the Acting Premier, and referred
by hlm to the Minister of Railways and Canais,
from which letter it appears that the extra
amount of wages which the three larger systeins, that le to say, Canadlan Pacifie, Grand
Trunk and the Canadian Northern, *vould be
called upon ta pay, should the same rate of
wages be adopted In Canada as le now In force
in the United States, amaunts to the sum of
$36.865,494.00I, while on Govemnment lunes the
increase would amount to $5,600,000.00, and It
further appears that the Railway Companies
are of the view that the wages paid railway
employees In Canada aught ta be the same as
that adopted In corresponding territories in the
Uni.ted Stautes, as the clans of work le the same
in bath countries. That there Is a large interchange of traffic, and that as a result, manY
employees work in bath countries; and on. the
further grounds that dîfferent Organisations are
international In their scope, and that heretofore
the wage scale In both counîtries have been
relatlvely the sanie'
That In view 0f the Increased cent of living
wages in Canadian territory should be Increased
as less increased in American territory, by the
award commonlY known a e
the
M£cAdoo
award, as the samêý may be from tîme ta time
amendefi or extended, In so far as the Government Railways Systems are concerned, and that
it is advisable In the public i.nterest.that Companies, privately owned, should malte elmîlar
increases ta their employees.
That the net earnings of the railway systems
as a result of Increased cents of transportation,
which han already accruefi, have greatly decreased. That the net earnings of the Grand
Trunk In 1917 decreased to f£26;279, as against
£1,202 281 in 1916, and'the deficit af the Canadian Northemn largely Increased, while the Canadian Pacifie net earnlngs In the first six menthe
of the present year decreised some $7,000,000,
while the increased ecale of wages as conteiplated will cent that Company alane $15,000,000 over and above its present cans.
That in order ta eneible the rallways of
Canada ta meet, the increasefi wage charges

taken under similar cirdumstances in the United
States, and freight rates lie raised in Canada
as sueh rates have been raised In adjacent

The Minister recommends, under the authority of thé War Measures Act:
(1) That the scale of wages of railway employees as flxed by the "McAdoo" award in
United States territory, i.ncluding any amendments or exteneions thereof, lie applied in Canadian territory, in so far as ail limes of railway
owned, operated or controlled by the Government are concerned.

(3) That increases be made la -the freight
rates of ail Canadian Railway carriers, subject
ta the jurisdiction of 1'arllament, as have been
made in the rates of Anieriýcan carriers by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, and under
orders af the Director General of Railway
Administration af the United States.
(4) That on the acceptance by the Canadian
Pacifie, Grand Trunk. Canadian Northern and
other rat-lway Companies of the said "McAdoo"
scheduie, the Board of llailway Commissioners
lie required to forthwith prepare a schedule of

already granted in American territory, effective
as of August 1, 1918.
The Committee concur in the foregoing recomnmendation,_ and sulimit the samne for approvai.
Rodolphe Bou'dreau,
(9gd.)
Cterk of the Privy Councti1.

Honourabie gentlemen wiIl see from that
Order in Council that the Government were
pretty nearly compeIled to adopt the McAs they state here: "The
Adua award.
wages paid railway emp]oyees in Canada
ought to be the same as that adapted in
United
corresponding territories in 'the
States, as the class of work is the sanie in
both countries," and representations were
made to the Government by the arganization of .railway employees for an increase
of rates of employees. I understand that
as between the two countries the proportion is about one to nine, and that although
no representative may have corne from the
United States especially to press the
adoption of the McAdoo award on the Government of Canada at that time, there is at
&.ny rate one gentleman who is a member
of the International Labour Unions, Who
has headquarters in Toronto and also at
Cleveland, Ohio. This gentleman was certainly on the ground and in a position to
furnish necessary information, and alsa to
bring pressure to bear to have that award
accepted here. The situation of this country at the date named, July 16, 1918, was
so serious-the war being stili on and th,
condition of things in Europe being perilous
the Canadian Government, in the
-tiat
face of such a situation, would neyer think
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

of adding to the difficulties of the country
by refusing to grant what those men asked
for. I think, in view of what 1 have stated,
that the honourable Minister of Labour
was hardly correct when he said that the
action taken by the Government at that
time was voluntary.
The resuit of the acceptance of the
McAdoo award was, of course, that
in
made
recommendation
second
the
adopted
was
Order in Council
that
later on. The Government referred this
Order in Council ta the Board of Railway
Commissioners, and in the report of that
Board, No. 10, Volume 8, 1 find the following:
Under Order in Council No. 1768-

-that is, the one I have just read-the opinion is expressed that, in view of the
increased cost of living, the wages in Canadian
territory should lie increased as increased in
American territory by the award commoniy
known as the McAdao Award, as the sanie enay
froni tume ta tume ble amended or extended, in
so far as the -Government Raiqway Systenis are

concerned; and that It is advisable, in the
public interests, that the companies privately
owned shouid make sirnilar increases ta their
employees.
The Order definitely advances the scale of
wages of raiiway employees as lixed by the
McAdoo Award for lines of rai!lway owned,
operated, or controiled by the Government, and
recommends that the wage scale af priývately
owned railway companies in Canada should be
slmilarly advanced.
The Order further provides that should the
privateiy owned rallway companies adopt the
MeAdoo schedule, the Board of Railway Comnmissioners shall forthwi-th prepare a schedule
af rates which will grant similar increases in
raiiway freight rates in Canada ta the increases
already granted in American territory, effective
as of August 1, 1918.

Honourable gentlemen will see that it
was only when the privately-owned railways adopted the McAdoo sehedule that
the increased freight rates were to be
granted.
The railway companies have notified their
empioyees af their acceptance of the McAdoa

scale. The effect of the Order is ta reimburse
the companies for the additional increased cost

ta whidh the railwfays wlll lie put by the adoption of the scale and la their railway operation. The advance is limited ta freight rates,
and is also iimited ta the advances aiready
made in United States territory for the saine
purpose.
The estimates of the lncreased. costs flled by
the Canadian Railway War Board show a total
increased cost of $50.616.226, in addition ta
which there are further dlaims to lie settled
by the McAdoa Award which, if settled adverseiy ta the companies. miglit cati for an
additional ýsuzn af $19,930,000, making a possible outiay of $70,546,260.

APRIL 14, 1921
The OMcAdoo Award la popularly supposed to
Increase rates 25 per cent. In some Instances
not amounting, however, to a great volume,
the McAdoo kward exceeds this percentage.
[n a larger number of Instances, owtng to
maximum advance limittations and to a fiat
rate increa% w1hlch, while advancing In a
hlgher percentage the rate for the shorter mileages, holds down ail longer movements, the
Increase of 25 per cent la nlot o'otalned.

' That le what the Ratlway Commissioners
stated at that time; and this order is
signed by "H. L. Drayton," the present
Minister of Finance. In section 43, on
page 289 of that report, the Chairman of
the Board stated:
lt should .be pointed out that In the preparatien cf the schedule of Increases in this report
the provisions of Order in Council No, 178
have been adhered to, and the directions to
establlsh similar Increases to those granted
In adjacent Ulnited States territory have beea
comPlied with to the exteat the tCanadian rate
sYstem and conditions permit. In the result
the previously exlsting parity of rates In Canadian Anà United States territory lias been as
near as may be preserved, and whenever under
the tormer rate sdhedulea Canadian ralbway
rates have been on a lower rate basîs lower

Ordýer the matter lias been fully discuesed with
the chief traffic otfâcers of the companies chlefly

And in the final paragraph Sir Henry
Drayton stated:

month by month, the monthly net results of
the operations of the three larger systems, Le..
the Grand Trunk, Canadlan Pacifie, and Canadian Northerra, to the end that any Increases
thait May lie found to be unnecessary lie
promptly curtailed.

Then follow the changes that the Board
of Cominissioners recommend at that time
should be made.
That was the situation ln July, 1918. 1
understand that since that date further
extensions have been made on account of
action taken'lu Chicago, and that possibly
further increases will have to be made;
but I do flot ýpropose to take up the time
of the House by going into that question.
The. honourable the Minister of Labour
yesterday deait with certain items in the
rates of pay granted to railway men at
present; and I want to draw the attention
of honourable gentlemen to an answer that
was given lu another place to a question
asked there, and printed as an appendix to
the Gommons Debates of April 7, 1921.
Honourable gentlemen will fin& there a very

complete liat of the rates of pay given to
different railway employees, and elaborate
notes are added, stating the changes nmade
in wageS as between 1916 and 1921. There
Is an immense amount of information in
those answers, but the matter is so technical
tat I do not think it is a question that
the Senate as a body should deal with.
1 think, however, it is a matter that might
very well be taken up by a Committee of
the Senate-either the Standing Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, or
a Special Committee, whichever honourable
,members of the house might prefer; and
such Committee should consider the whole
situation with regard to the questions of
wages and of rates, and how these affect
the business of the country to-day. If honourable gentlemen study the appendix referred to they will see that the changes
made la a large number of cases amount
to something very considerable. Without
going into the details it is impossible to
work out the amount that those various
changes mean, because there are certain
items, such as the- difference between the
hours of work and the renumeration givea
on account of overtime, that would involve
considerable calculation. Flurther than that,
aIl sorts of allowances are made to certain
railway officiais.
I would like to point out to the honourable leader of the Goverument, however,
that this statement refers only to the
eastern lines throughout the country. If
it were possible, I think it would be of
great interest to the country to have a
statement, of the same kind with regard
to the western hunes, because .the rates of
pay on the latter were at one time very much
higher than those on the eastern lines.
They were fixed because of what was understood ta be the greater cost of living lu the
West at that time. It would therefore be
interesting to honourable members to know,
if the changes have been made lu that way,
that the wages paid on the western lines
more nearly approach those given for the
easterrù lines ou account of the recognition
of the fact that the expenses of living lu
Eastern Canada to-day have increased to
a greater extent than they have lu Western
Canada. I think all those questions can be
better considered by a Committee than by
the House itself, and therefore I do not
propose to detain the House any longer by
discussing this question.
I should like to caîl attention, however.
te certain matters -relating to the position
of the railways, especially the Goverument
railways, as they stand to-day. The honourable Minister of Labor gave us yester-

SENATE
day a statement with regard to the Canadian Pacifie Railway, showing what they
had been able to do notwithstanding the
increased expenses-how they hîad been
able to live up to their agreements and
yet make sufficient profit to keep up the
dividend on the stock to the figure that
has been paid for a number of years.
In spite of that fact, we find that the
Government road has been falling behind,
and the country bas been called upon to
pay a larger sum every year to meet the
deficit in fixed charges and in operating
expenses; and I think that a certain phase
of this matter might very well be discussed
in the Senate at this time. On making a
comparison between the figures given by
the Canadian Pacifie Railway to their
shareholders for the years 1919 and 1920
I find that the earnings of that railway
from passenger traffic amounted in 1919
to $46,182,151, and in 1920 to $49,125,738.
The freight traffic amounted in 1919 to
$111,064,441, and in 1920 to $145,303,399.
Unfortunately the report of Railways
and Canals which was brought down the
other day only gives us figures for the
Government roads to March 31, 1920, and
therefore we bave not the benefit of knowing what those roads have been doing in
the year 1920. The only comparison we
can make is with the figures given in the
Government report. There we find that the
Canadian National Railways earned on
their passenger traffic in 1919 $22,460,088,
and on freight $64,722,420; that is up to
March 31, 1920. Honourable gentlemen
will see that the Canadian Pacifie railway had an increase in their passenger
revenue of $2,943,587, while the increase
of the Canadian National for passenger
traffic was $5,752,464. But when we come
to freight we find that the increase taken
in by the Canadian Pacifie railway was
$34,238,958, while the freight increase on
the Canadian National railways was only$663,009. The operating mileage of the
Canadian Pacifie is given as 13,402, and
that of the Canadian National railways as
13,945: so that the operating mileage is
practically the same. What I want to draw
particular attention to is the extraordinary
difference between the two railways in
their freight and passenger earnings. The
Canadian Pacifie, in spite of the difficulties
that they were up against in the change
from war times to a period of peace, were
able, by good management and by looking
after the expenses, to increase their freight
earnings by $34,000,000 odd; but we find
on page 10 of the Government report this
statement:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

During the year 1,749,221 more passengers
were carried than during 1918-19. The resultant
increase in revenue was $5,752,464.58. On the
other hand there was an increase in transportation expenses of $6,050,297.27.
There was a falling-off in freight movement
following the cessation of the shipment of munitions and war supplies and the return of traffic
to normal lines. This was particularly felt on
Canadi-an Government Unes leading to the seaboard, where the decrease was 2,728,733 tons.
In addition the Canadian Northern carried 850,327 tons less than in 1918. Had the tonnage of
the previous year been maintained it would
have made a difference of 9,735,054 in the
revenue, which practically would have taken
care of the operating deficit of $9,813,183.

This is the Government's statement of
the reason for the falling off in the freight
on the Government railways, and it is
pointed out here that had they been able
to maintain anything like the business that
they did in the previous year, 1918, we
would not have been faced with the same
operating deficit that we are faced with
now.
The question of operation is a very important one for every railway. As honourable gentlemen are no doubt aware, the
efficiency of a. properly managed railway
is shown in the amount of freight that is
hauled by one engine. The Government
roads, as we all know, have always been
said to have an excellent grade. It bas
been stated that they, had this great advantage over the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
that with one engine they could haul
greater loads of freight than could that
railway, with its adverse grades in a large
number of cases; therefore we might expect to find that the Government roads
would be hauling much larger trainloads
than' the Canadian Pacifie, and would be
specializing in the freight business rather
than-as the figures I have read to the
House seem to indicate-in the passenger
business. It is generally understood by
railway men that passenger business is not
a satisfactory class of business to handle;
that it is often a losing proposition; and
that if railways are to be made to pay they
must concentrate a great deal more on
freight business than on passenger traffic.
There is no doubt that in a country such
as Canada, with its enormous distances and
its large quantities of natural products
which have to be carried to the seaboard,
the freight traffic is a much more important
class of business than the passenger service. Now, I desire to submit to the House
a few figures with regard to the relative
positions of the two systems with respect
to the freight business.

APRIL '14, 1921
Taking the Government railway statistics as given for the year ended June 30,
1919-the latest date to which figures of
this kind are obtainable-I find that for
that year the comparison of tons hauled
was:
Canadian National Railways..
24,748,070
Canadian Pacifie Railway....
25,894,741
The ton miles, or number of tons hauled
one mile were:
Canadian National Railways 6,974,071,639
Canadian Pacifie Railway.. 11,307,517,134
This represents the best basis of coinparison for the calculation of operating resuits, because it ineludes the factor of distance, or length of haul, and eliminates the
matter of carload or trainload. Comparing
the cost of transportation per ton mile, we
find that on the Canadian National Railways the coat is .703 cent, and on the Canadian Pacifie Railway .565 cent. That is to
say, it coat the Canadian National 24.4 per
cent more to move a ton of freight one mile
than it did the Canadian Pacifie. In that
fact is to be found at once one of the outstanding causes of the loss which is annually occurring.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Fifty per cent
more.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Then we come to
the question of the trainload that is hauled
over these roads, and we find that the
Canadian National, in 1919, had an average
train]oad of bilt 360 tons as compared with
521.9 by the Canadïan Pacifie; and this
in spite of the favourable grades on the
National Transcontinental and the whole
Canadian National system.
This shows
that for some reason or another the management of the Canadian National railways are not taking full advantage of the
better location and better grades of their
ronds. Then. we find that, as compared
with 360 tons on the Canadian National
Rai]ways, the average trainload on the
Canadian Northern for the same period
was only 338 tons; so that smaller trainloads were being hauled on the Canadian
Northern than on the complete system of
Government roads. lere is, I think, a further evidence of bad management. These
are niatters that should bie very carefullY

affairs shows that somewhere in the management of the Canadian National railways there isHon. Mr. POWER: A big leak.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: -a qbig leak and
a big loss in operation. The honourable
Minister of Labour spoke yesterday about
the morale of the men. The whole question should be examined into for the purpose of seeing whether or net the men are
really doing their duty to the railway system, because it is almost incredible that
with the advantage possessed by the Government ronds, there should bie this difference which I have mentioned in the amount
of freight hauled by one engine, if the
railway management and staff were looking
after their business in the way they ought.
I have had brought to my attention, as
showing how in certain small matters a
similar condition prevails, a case that occurred here in Ottawa. It seems to me
that-this point is of sufficient importance,
especially as the' incident occurred here in
the Capital, to appeal to honourable gentlemen in this House and possibly to persons outside the House, as an evidence of
the way in which the business of the Government railways is being handled at the
present tinie.
During the month of March, 1921, the
J. R. Booth Conmpany, of Ottawa, had 71
cars of p'aper for shipnient to Chicago.
The paper was ahl packed and ready for
shipment, but shipping orders were to the
effect that the paper was not to leave Ottawa until April 15. To store this 71
cars of paper was no aniall problem for
the J. R. Booth Company. They went to
the Canadian National Railways and asked
permission to put it in their big freight
sheds for storage for approximately one
month, after which the railway would
transport the 71 cars to Chicago.
They
were refused permission to store it in these
sheds. The Booth Company then went to
the Canadian Pacifie Railway and asked
the samne privilege, which was cordially
granted them. The paper is now in storage in the C. P. R. freight sheds at Broad
street, Ottawa, and on April 15 the C. P. R.
will take this freight from Ottawa to
Chicago. 1 have since been informed that
some of this paper has already been
shipped.
An incident of this kind will
probably 'bring homie to the minds of h onourable gentlemen the'thought that there
must be something wrong in the handling
of the business of the Canadian National
Railways.
Honourable gentlemen will
probably remember that Mr. J. R. Booth
at one time owned the Canada Atlantic
Railway, which is to-day part of the Government system, and hie has always been,

Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
The honourable
gentleman perhaps misunderstands me. I
do not disagree with him at ail. I quite
understand how that couid occur, and to
my mind that is an argument against Government ownership.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: The honourable
gentleman can draw his own conclusion.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is my view,
and I wanted to know whether the honourable gentleman's (Hon. Mr. Bostock's) view
was the saine as mine in that regard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman is net illogical.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I want to say to
my honourable friend, as I have already
stated, that the question of Government
ownership is flot under discussion.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Incidentally it is.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No; because we
have taken over the railways and'there is
no proposal to do anything else with theim
We are to-day faced with the fact that we
have these railways on our handa and we
have to find the money to make good the
deficit; and therefore it is incumbent on
us, as representing the people of this country, to find ont what is the cause of that
deficit and where the trouble lies and te
see whether some improvement cannot be
made in the management of these roads.
It was for that purpose that I brought
this matter to the attention of the House.
Honourable gentlemen, I fear that I have
taken up considerable time.- When the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Fowler)
interrupted me, there was one very significant figure that I intended giving to the
House, although I am afraid I have wearied
the House with the number of figures I
have had te read. As honourable gentlemen will remember, the Minister of Railways stated that the deficit to be made
good this year amounted to some seventy
millions of dollars. If honourable members
have before them the report of the Canadian National Railways, they will, see on
page 9 that the total revenue of the Government roads is given as amounting to $6r782,749. That means that we have to make
up a deficit only $26,000,000 less in round
numbers than the total amount cf the
business that we are doing. It is almoat
a qpe9tion whether, if we have to meet no
large a deficit, it would not be better flot
to do the business at all.

My honourable friend's (Hon. Mr. Casgrain's) motion deals with the railway
problem and refers to the question of the
Grand Trunk Railway Company. I do not
purpose going into a discussion of that
matter at the present time; but I do think
that what has come to light within the last
few days justifies the position taken by
honourable gentlemen on this side of the
House wben the question of the Grand
Trunk railway agreement was before the
country. Honourable gentlemen on this
side of the House, and other honourable
gentlemen also, took the position that the
country would be very niuch better off in
dealing with that matter if the Government, instead of arranging to take over
the Grand Trunk Railway system, as they
at that time proposed to do, had entered
into an arrangement with the Grand Trunk
Railway Company to exchange trafflc at
certain points and te relieve the railway
to some extent of the financial difficulties
under which it was operating at that time.
Fromn the information which we have
recelved fromn the correspondence brought
down, it is very difflcult te, understand
exactly what the position is to-day; but I
think the attitude of the Government in
this matter has been a very severe blow
te the credit of Canada in the financial
markets in London, and I fear that a very
serlous loss will be sustained by the country in the future on acceunt of the feeling
in the minds of the financial people in
London by reason of the Government's refusal to mee& the payments that were due
on April 1.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Mai' I ask the
honourable gentleman what the Government could have done? Does he understand
the position? The Grand Trunk people
refused to give up the road, and yet they
expected the Government te pay the
liability. Surely the honourable gentleman
dues not condemn the Government for conducting itself in the only way that business
men could conduct themselves.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would point eut
te niy honourable friend that the correspondence shows-I do net know whether hie
has had time te read it-that in carrying
eut the arrangement that was made the
Government made certain interest payments in July and October of last year and
on January 1 of this year, apparently
admitting their liability te pay that money.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Those sums. were
interest payments made before the time
when the arbitration should be completed.

SENATE
Now the Grand Trunk people ask for an
extension of the time of the arbitration,
and ask that further payments should be
made by the Government; and if the
arbitration is concluded no doubt they will
appeal from the findings of the arbitrators, which they should not be permitted
to do,
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The option is
over.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Exactly.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: As I stated when
I began, we have not sufficient information
before- us to enable us intelligently to discuss this matter; but, as I see it at the
moment, that is the position, and I think
it is a very serious one for the country. I
have tried to show the House that there is
a tremendous amount of information in regard to this question of the railways which
would be of value to the country if it could
be obtained; and I think it would be a very
goad thing if either the Railway Committee
of this House, or, if honourable gentlemne
prefer it, some special Committee appointed
for the purpose, could examine further into
the matter, and go more closely into the
subject with which I have dealt to-day. I
would point out to the House that the information contained in the reports of the Railway Department which we have received in
this and in former Sessions is not brought
down to a date which would make it possible
to compare it with the information contained in the report issued, for instance,
by the Canadian Pacific Railwty. If we are
going to examine into this question intelligently, it is necessary that the information should be brought down to that date.
The only way that I see in which we can
obtain this information at the present time
is by referring the matter to a committee
having power to call the officers of the
railways in order to get the information
which is required.
I may point out that my honourable
friend from De Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) asked a question of the leader of
the Government the other day with regard
to a certain phase of the railway situation.
His reason for asking the question was that
he could not obtain the information from
the bluebooks which we have before us, or
without special reference to the Department
of Railways. In answer to four of the questions he asked, he was referred to the reply
te question 5, which says:
The operating results are not kept separately
for each province.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

I think the information asked for would
have been of value to the country in enabling us to find out where the freight
originates -and what parts of these roads
are really getting sufficient freight to make
them pay and what parts of them are not.
The question of the country finding the
money to pay these deficits, and the question
of whether we can afford to pay the rates
that the railway companies say are necessary in order to make the railways pay, are
so serious that I think it would be time
well spent by a Committee of the Senate to
look into the whole matter.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I do not intend to make a speech
on this subject; but I wish to refer to some
remarks made by the Hon. Frank Carvell,
at Vancouver. They were as follows:
He remarked that some statements he made
in Vancouver last Thursday has been chailenged. Hle had now names of stations and of
the agents to whom, in the first two months
of January last, the C.N.R. had paid sums
ranging as high as $314, on a wage basis of
$130 to $135 per month. The wage he thought
reasonable. He could not understand, however,
when the agents put in hours enough to make
the higher sums. But the figures showed that
they got them. He com-mented that the wage
scale for other classes of railway workers were
reasonable too. "But it is in the overtime,
gentlemen," he added, "where Mr. McAdoo gets
in his work."

We have a wage scale of $130 to $135

a month, which I think no one will say
is too much for a man at a small station
along a railway; but under the present
arrangement, which my honourable friend
the Minister of Labour endeavoured to justify yesterday, some of these station agents
are drawing over $300 every two weeks. No
country can stand a situation of that kind.
Give the men good wages, but do not fithe pay for overtime so that it will amount
to three or four times the ordinary pay.
While it may not be possible for the Government to do away with the McAdoo scale,
surely it ought to be within their power
to make it impossible for an agent at a
way station to draw as much as $314 for
two weeks work.
Honourabl3
Hon. G. W. FOWLER:
gentlemen, I quite agree with the remarks
made by the last speaker. This matter of
overtime is the most serious part of the
McAdoo award. One time, while travelling
on a train, I had an opportunity of discussing this matter with a leading official
of the Railway Labour Union. We grew
pretty warm during the discussion. I toid
him that in my opinion the overtime was
a serious matter, and that I had seen many

APRIL 14, 1921
instances in my travels in which intentional
delays were caused which made overtime
for the workrnen. He got pretty wrathy
at that; but a brakernan who was listening
spoke up and said that the overtime was
the curse of the whole business. This was
the evidence of one of the emnployees of the
road. In the railway station at Sussex,
New Brunswick, we used to get along with
a day agent and a night agent; but to-day
we are paying three men where formerly
we paid only two; and other less important
stations are in the same position. That is
the way the thing accumulates. The train
hands, particularly on the branch roads,
get the biggest pay. On some of what are
called "jerk-water lines" some brakernen
make $800 or $400 a month. That is
Like my honourable

friend from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turr4ff),
I amn ainxious that the men should have a
living wage; but it is absurd that a man
occupying the position of a brakeman
should receive a wage that formerly would
have been big pay for a man in a very
much higher and more responsible position;
or that a man Vho bas devoted years to

1 for ene am n ot a believer in Government ownersbip. I was trying to get the
leader of the Opposition to make a declaration in that regard, but be side-stepped
with great agility. I can well believe tbat
the story told by tbe leader of tbe Opposition with regard to the carload of cattie
was true, because under Government ownership there is flot the same check upon the
employees tbat there is in the case of a private corporation that must pay a dividend
-when the directors are looking to see
that it is paid, and the president is looking
after tbe managers, and so on, te see that
money is earned and saved te pay it. Under Government ownership the men would
say, "Oh, it is the Government; it deesn't
make any différence?" I can understand
that these gentlemen would go off, perhaps,
te a picni«c, and leave the office alene and
neglect a car cf cattie, as the honourable
gentleman bas told.us.. Just such things
as that militate against Government ownership, and Government management; and se
far as I amn concerned, I am opposed teit.
I think the only way in which, we can
get over this great difficulty is in soe
mariner te get rid cf direct Government
management. We are in a very perilous
S-16

position in tbis country witb regard te
railways. We recognize tbat in the past too
many railways were built; but it is net
necessary for us te fi the blame. There
was a demand on tbe part of the general
public, and tbe Government of the day was
weak enougb te yield te, tbat demand and
to *give the people wbat they asked. It
was mucb more than tbey needed. Tbe
people cf the West were crying eut for additional. reads; tbey said four transcontinental roada would net carry the produce
cf the western country. Well, we have
found that three are net very much everburdened-in fact, that tbey are net sufficiently burdened-in carrying the produce
of tbat ceuntry at tbe 'present time. But
instead of indulging in recrimination and
endeavouring te fix the blame on this Gevernment or that, let us grapple with the
situation before us in order te get eut of
the difficulty. I do net profess te be an
authority on railway matters, but I give
it as my humble opinion that some method
other than direct Government management.
will have te be adepted before we make a
succeas cf these railways.
Just a word in regard te something the
leader cf the Opposition said in reference
te the Grand Trunk people. I admit at the
outset that I have perbaps a prejudice
against tbemn. I look upon the Grand Trunk
peuple as being one cf the forces that have
worked te tbe injury cf Canada.
The
Grand Trunk Railway Company and the
Hudson Bay Company are two corporations
that have, in my opinion, been a cuise te
Canada.
In the first place, the Grand
Trunk Railway Company selected the very
best and mo$t valuable portion cf Canada
-net only cf industrial Canada, but of
agricultural Canada-for the scene cf their
Operations; but, througb tbe mismanagement cf that company from the very eutset in retaining the management 4,000
niles away, tbey were neyer able te make
a success cf the undertaking because men
wbe were unfitted were often put in positiens of importance. I de net think we
owe the Grand Trunýk railway people apything, and that is one reason why I opposed
the taking O-ver of the Grand Trunk Railway in the manner in whicb it was taken
over. I said that either we owed them
semetbing or we owed them notbing. If
we owed them anytbing, hew mucb
was it?
Let us look at the history cf the Grand
Trunk railway. At a time wben the fate,
almost, cf Canada ýhung in tbe balancç,
wben we were building the Canadian

SENATE
Pacific railway, when the financiers behind that railway had ,exhausted their
credit, when by reason of the fact that
they were directors and important officials
of the Bank of Montreal, they had borrowed from that bank away beyond their
limit, and when it was necessary to raise
capital to replace that which they had borrowed, they found themselves faced in the
financial markets of London by the lies
and calumnies of the Grand Trunk people
which prevented them getting the loan
The only way in
which was necessary.
which Canada had been advertised at that
time was by that malign influence, the
Hudson Bay Company, which had said that
Western Canada was fit only for raisiig
beaver and bear, and not for agricultural
purppses. These calumnies, because there
is nothing so sensitive as the money
market-the slightest rumour is sufficient
to make a man of money tie a string
around his money bags-had the effect
of preventing the Canadian Pacific Railway magnates from getting their loans
floated in London, and they had to come
to the Parliament of Canada. Fortunately
for this country there were at that time
in charge of the political affairs of 'Canada men of vision-men who could pierce
the mists of the future and see what a
wonderful country it was eventually going
to be. Those men stood by it, and the credit
of the country was pledged to the $30,000,000 loan which enabled the Canadian
Pacific Railway people to get out of their
difficulties. It mattered not to the people of
the Grand Trunk whether their opposition
would result in the financial ruin of Canada. It mattered not to them that it might
throw us back 25 or 30 years in our development. Their opposition might have had
that effect; but it mattered not to them at
all: they cared nothing for Canada; they
were looking for their own selfish interesc
in the Grand Trunk, and they regarded
the Canadian Pacific Railway simply as a
business rival and an injury to them.
Then, later, when they came to us for an
extension of their road to the Pacific coast,
they first asked for a charter to build a
railway from North Bay to the coast, but
those in charge of political affairs at that
time said: " No; if you want to build you
must build from Quebec to the coast." Then
the province of Nova Sceotia, that most enterprising province down by the sea, was
represented at that time by a solid body
of 18 members in both Houses, and naturally they had considerable influence with
the powers that be; and they said, "You
Hon. Mr. FOWiLER.

must build that railway so that it will be
of some benefit to Nova Scotia, and so you
must extend it to Moncton." The Grand
Trunk proprietors said: " No, we won't
build that; we only want to connect our
Ontario lines with the West; that is what
we are looking after." The Government
replied: " Well, we will make you this
offer: we will build from Moncton to Winnipeg; we will relieve you free from the
expense of that part of the line."
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I was in the House
of Commons at that time.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: So was I.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Nova Scotia askedl
for nothing but the line to Moncton, N.B.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is just what 1
said-the province of Nova Scotia asked
that the railway be extended from Quebec
to Moncton. My honourable friend from
Halifax desires his province to obtain a
reputation for more modesty than it is
entitled to. The Government said: " We
will build the line from Moncton to Winnipeg, and we will give you a lease of that
for 50 years, seven years of which shall be
without interest, and 43 years at interest
at four per cent on the capital cost."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Three per cent.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Three per cent, was
it? I thought it was four. So much the
better for the Grand Trunk. They entered

changed hands, and it was through; but
the Government of Canada never dies; it
may change hands, but it goes on forever,
and the same contract existed. But the
Grand Trunk refused to implement that
contract, refused to take over that road,
and the Government of Canada was obliged
to take it over.
Then the Government had the bonds of the
Grand Trunk Pacific, and the company refused to pay the interest on those bonds
that they had guaranteed, and so that indebtedness was thrown on our hands. Now,
that is the condition of affairs. In every
case where there was a contract between
us and them, they violated their contract.
In every case where they could have helped
this country they refused to help it-not
only refused to help it, but actively tried
to injure it. And yet we are called upon
to do what? To repay to those people, with
interest, all the money that they have invested in this road. They did ngt invest

APRIL 14, 1921
it for the sake of benefiting Canada-not
at ail, 'because whenever they had an opportunity ta injure Canada they neyer
failed to seize such opportunity and injure
this country ail that they could.
I was in England at the time the discussion took place when the sale of the
road was lirst mooted before the stockholders of the Grand Trunk. The London
Times published speeches miade by the. different stockholders, and I neyer read such
abuse of Canada in my life as came fromn
those men; and I then vowed ta myseif that
if I was in Parliament at the time this
matter would corne up I certainly would
oppose the taking over of the road and relieving those gentlemen of the obligations
they were under with regard ta it. I followed that out by voting against the purchase of the Grand Trunk by the Government, and I have neyer ceased ta be glad
of having given that vote. I say that we
should purchase the Grand Trunk, if ýwe
purchase it at ail, on the bargain caunter,
though there is no reason why we should
purchase it at ail. We are under no obligation ta those people who invested their
xnoney in it. It was nlot because they
wanted ta help Canada, but because they
wanted ta make maney out of Canada, that
they invested their money here. We are
under no obligation whateve;F ta them, and
we should buy the road at the proper price,
and that is the price that it would seil for
in the mnarket. Yet here we are, holding an
arbitration. ta decide the price, and they
have the cheek and the nerve to ask that
we should keep on paying these dlaims, paying interest an those bonds and an those
mortgages, and yet allow them ta contrai
and manage the road. For gail and cheek 1
cannat imagine anything ta go further;
and 1 cannot understand haw my honourable friend the leader of the Opposition,
who is a level-headed man, can take the line
hie has taken in attempting ta condemn the
Government be'nause at this eieventh hour,
as I may say, they have refused ta be
coerced any longer by this cry of those
British financiers. Those gentlemen have
found the Governments sa soft hitherta, in
dealing with theni that I can quite understand why they ask these favours. But
they have at last learned that the Government has stiffened its back and refused ta

they have at last adopted, and 1 wish ta
Heaven they had adopted that samp sort of
line earlier in the game; but better late
than neyer. I trust the Governrnent wili

wili make the Grand Trunk Company came

of Canada know what is the proper uine ta
take with regard to the business of Canada,
and wiii not be coerced or led away by any
false dry, such as they are trying ta get
up naw, that we are interfering with the
portion of the widow and the arphan in
regard ta these bonds and the stack that is
now held by the people Who own and contrai
the Grand Trunk Pacifie. I hope the Government wiil continue aiang the line they
have adopted, and will not waver or give
way one inch.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Hanaurabie gentlemen, the duty cast upan rny
shoulders is a very light one. Frorn the
length of time which this discussion has
occupied it would probably strike an onloaker, that the question was a very difficuit
one ta answer. I find that my honaurable
friend (Mr. Casgrain> has submitted the
following question:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the railway
problem
in Canada, and

Governmnent ta abandon the arbitration proceedings.

Now, I might say that under the agreement entered into between the Gavernment
of Canada and the Grand Trunk it was
provided that the arbitration shauld be
completed by the 9th of April; and there
was a further provision that the Government had authaity ta extend the time
for the hearing of the arbitration proceedings in the event of those proceedings
not having been concluded qn that date.
Anticipating that there wouid not be a conclusion of the proceedings an the date fixed
in the agreernent, the Government was
approached with a view ta extending the
time. The Gavernment submitted certain
proposàls which would ha regarded as conditions for the extension of the time provided the Grand Trunk acceded thereto.
There will not be a resumption of the arbitration proceedings uniess the Gr *and

and the Government of Canada, and that
agreement will probably have to be validated or confirmed by statute, otherwise
the arbitration proceedings will not be
continued.

have supplied those men with money
directly rather than to embark upon
the building of ships which cannot
be of any use to the country, at
any rate for a long time to come. The
present situation in regard to these shipa
is that for many of them, at any rate,
there is no business, and, unless the Government sets them aside and pays off the
crews, they will be a cause of considerable
expense to the country, without any return.
In making an appropriation of this kind,
we are asking the country generally to
provide money for an expenditure which
is
non-productive.
The
consequence
will probably be-although we have had no
statement from the Finance Minister, as
the budget has not yet been brought down
-that at least some of the money will
have to be borrowed and we shall be
obliged to pay interest on it. We are in
the position of having to borrow and provide money for expenditures on non-productive work, which will bring in no return,
and the countfy will have to pay the interest and the sinking fund at a later date.
I think that the Government cannot be too
strict at present in curtailling the expenses
of the country in every possible way, because my reading of the condition of affairs
in Canada is that any man, no matter in
what business he is engaged, may consider
himself fairly lucky if he comes through
this year without a loss; and if that is the
position throughout the country the Government are going to find it exceedingly
difficult to raise the amount of money required for carrying on the country's business. If the Government cannot raise the
money, they will have to borrow it, and we
are to-day in this position, that the United
States is the only country in the world
outside of Canada in which we can borrow
money. I for one do not want to see Canada applying continually to the United
States to borrow money in order to carry
on the country's affairs. It must be remembered that, unfortunately, the borrowing is being done not only by the Dominion
Government, but by the Governments of
the provinces as well, and both Dominion
and Provincial Governments must obtain
their revenues from the same people. It
is not as if the persons paying taxes to the
provinces were different individuals from
those paying taxes to the Dominion; and
if we could get a statement of the amount
of money for which the people of Canada
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

are liable, showing the taxation per capita,
we should be very much surprised and considerably frightened at the amount.
I do not wish to take up the time of the
House in discussing this question further,
but I do think that the Government should
endeavour in every possible way to reduce
the estimates and the expenditures of the
country at the present time.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I do not intend to delay the House
to any extent, because the Government
have made up their minds to pass these
estimates, and naturally they have the
power to do so and they must accept the
resiponsibility. But I wish to place myseif
on record as protesting against the exWhile many
tremely large expenditure.
of the items are, I know, fixed charges that
cannot be avoided, yet there are certain
appropriations that could be reduced materially if the Government would make up
their minds to ceut down expenditure as it
should be cut down, in view of present
financial conditions in Canada.
My honourable friend who has just taken
his seat (Hon. Mr. Bostock) spoke of our
borrowings in the United States. I saw the
other day a statement giving a list of
borrowings in the United States, by
municipalities and provinces, as well as
by the Dominion, showing that we had
borrowed in that country since the
commencement of the war considerably over
one billion of dollars. The interest on that
at six per cent would amount to about
$60,000,000 a year, adding to that extent
to the balance of trade against us. The
purchasing of goods in the United States
bas not so much effect as the borrowings
in that country, and I agree with my
honourable friend who has just taken his
seat that every effort should be made to
curtail expenditures. I do not believe the
Government have made as great an effort
as they might have made under the circumstances.
I wish to protest particularly against

the item of $8,000,000 for shipbuilding. We

have already invested, I understand,
$70,000,000 in that business. For some of
the mistakes made by Governments in the
past there was some excuse. I think there
was reason for starting the building of
ships under the circumstances that prevailed during the war, but when the armistice was signed, over two years ago, it was
time to curtail such expenditures instead
of continuing them and sinking millions
upon millions of money that was bound to

APRIL 15i 1921
be a loss. I arn not saying this in any vein
cf criticisrn against the Government, but
I elaim. that the Minister of Marine and
Fisheries has led the country into ail sorts
of extravagant expenditures for which
there is absoluteiy ne justification. My
honourable friend the leader-of the Senate
wiii find, and the Government will find,
that many cf their ewn supporters are just
as much opposed te the foolish expenditure
that has been made in connectien with the
shipbuilding pregrarn as are ether members
of the community. It is an expenditure
that we shall neyer get any interest on,
that will net do any good, and that wiil be
practically a dead ioss. It is net only the
interest that we shahl lese. Our lesses rnay
run up to $100,000,000, for I see it estirnated that this expenditure of $8,000,000
will net begin te cornplete the prograrn.
As my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Bostock) pointed eut, a contract has been
let within the last three and a haif rnonths
for the building cf two ships eut in
Vancouver..
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will my
honeurable friend permit me a question?
Can he give us the authority en which. he
bases the statement that contracts for ships
have been let within the hast three
months? I neyer heard cf it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: If my honourable
friend wihl look at the Ottawa Citizen of

Vancouver te the effect that the keels cf

January hast, when there were dozens of
ships aIready built, that were tied up in

were not the contracts cancelled before any
money was expended? Why should the
Government do as they have doue in regard
to the steel plate contracts-allow the contracts to be proceeded with until they becorne liable for a bill of damages amounting to millions and millions of dollars?
Honourable gentlemen, there is absolutely
no justification for what the Department
of Marine and Fisheries have done in connection with the building of the merchant
marine. The country is committed to an
expenditure of $100,000,000, which will bé
practically a dead lcss. We are now spending probably over $50,000 a day to keep
those ships in commission. Sorne time age
there were ten of thern tied up in Halifax
harbour, with the full complernent of
officers and men, and doing nothing. So I
say there was absolutely -no excuse for
laying the keels of those two ships on
January 6 last, whether the contract had
been let sorne time previously or not. My
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
rnight tell us when the contract was let:
I shouhd be very glad to get the information. But I do not see, honourable gentlemen, that the date of the contract makes
very much difference. The contract should
have been cancelled when there would have
been no heavy bill of damages.
In order to show that not only opponents
but aiso friends of the Government are
very much opposed to such expenditures,
let me read what the Halifax Herald says
upon the subject. I do not know the newspapér very well, but I understand that it
gives a pretty consistent support to the
Government., If I arn wrong in that I shal
be corrected, no doubt. Here is what the
Halifax Herahd says:
The announcement in parliament that the
deficit on the govearnment owned and operated
railways amounts te something like seventy
millions of dollars, ls not only startling. but
really alarming. in placing the figures at seventy millions it is stated the Minister of Railways was 'breaking the news gently," and by
that it would occasion no surprise if the actua,
deficit ran up to over a hundred millions.
But whlle public attention ls focussefi on

To-day it is costing a huge sum of money. H-ow

dollars are being spent annually by this saine
enterprise we do flot know.
We think it would be welI for the Parliament of Canada to tal<e this matter lIn hand.

248

SENATE

Are the millions of money being spent wisely?
That is the question the people would like to
have answered.
Are all those ships earning their keep? That
is another question the people would like to
have answered.
There are about ten of those fine ships ln
Halifax harbour at the present time, anchored
in the stream. Some of them have been there
for quite a length of ti.me, and there does not
appear to be any hope of their leaving their
anchorage at an early date.
The maintenance of a steamer of any size
costs money. The maintenance of the ten
steamers of the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine service cannot cost under one thousand
dollars a day for each ship, or, at the inside
calculation, ten thousand dollars a day. These
ships are fully manned. The officers and members of the crew are sustai.ned at the Government's expense and they are paid out of Government money.
Why are those ships lying idle in Halifax
harbour?
If there are ten of those ships lying Idle in
Halifax harbour how many are there lying idle
in other harbours?
Would it be a fai.r estimate to place the loss
occasioned by the maintenance of those Idle
ships of the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine service at $50,000 a day?
Why maintain all those ships if there is nothing for them to do?
Why use them to crowd out privately owned
shi.ps on routes of trade which private capital
and enterprise have taken years to build up?
Why should the Government enter into competition with its own people?
There are many millions of.dollars invested in
those steamers. But the first cost is only a
bagatelle in comparison to the cost of maintenance and if Canada is not careful, if Parliament does not put on the brakes, does not find
out the reasons why, there is a possibi.lity of
the country getting another shock of equal if
not greater proportions than that served up
by the Minister of Railways last week.
The taxpayer of Canada should keep both
eyes on the Canadian Merchant Marine.

Honourable gentlemen, to my mind that
sums up the situation fairly well. There
was absolutely no justification for the

greater part of .the expenditures in that
enterprise. Not only did the Government
fail to stop the expenditure a year ago,
when their ships were idle, but they have
kept on spending money. They have started
within the last three months and a half
the building of those two ships to which I
have referred, and I observe that it has
been stated in the other House that it
will cost in addition, not merely $8,000,000,
but $20,000,000, to complete the program;
and here is a newspaper, a supporter and
friend of the Government, calling upon
Parliament to do something to see that the
money is wisely expended, and to endeavor
to put a stop to such expenditures.
There are other expenditures that could
have been eut down, but have not been.
While I do not intend delaying the House
further, honourable gentlemen, I just wish
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

to place myself on record with regard to
this shipbuilding matter. I have done so
in the past two or three years, when I was
supporting the Government, because I could
foresee that the expenditure was an act
of great folly, and it should have been
stopped as soon as it was seen that we were
not going to need ships. For the continuance of the policy of shipbuilding there
is absolutely no excuse whatever.
Hon. CHARLES E. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I want to take up only two
or three minutes on this subject. Inasmuch
as my honourable friend from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) bas referred to some
comments made by a Halifax newspaper
regarding the shipbuilding policy of this
Government, I desire to read, for the information of that honourable gentleman
and others, what bas been said on this
subject by the Prime Minister of Nova
Scotia, Hon. George H. Murray, one of the
most prominent Liberals in Canada to-day
and, I believe, a gentleman who was one
of the chairmen of the Dominion Liberal
convention of 1919, held in this city. I will
read just two or three remarks of Hon.
Mr. Murray, as reported in the Morning
Chronicle, which is the leading Liberal
organ in the province of Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE:

No.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
My honourable
friend from Halifax is away behind the
times. The Morning Chronicle is away
ahead of him, and he bas not been able to
catch up. These remarks were spoken on
December 19, 1920, and were published in
the morning Chronicle of December 20,
1920. They were made on the occasion of
the launching of one of the Canadian ships:
Hon. George H. Murray said that he regarded
the event most important. The splendid organization of the company had been demonstrated
when the ship launched herself and nothing
happened (Hear! hear!). The Premier said that
Nova Scotia constituted perhaps the most
unique instance in the world at one time, wheo
her less than half a million population held such
a proud position in the shipping interests. The
Halifax Shipyards were not the pioneers in the
steel ship building tndustry of Nova Scotia. The
Nova Scotia Steel Company at New Glasgow
were, for they had built several steel ships
before the first was launched at Halifax, and
they had been built by private enterprises. He
said, "I always agreed with the shipbuilding
poliey of the Government, and no man bas a
stronger appreciation of the courage of the men
who had the faith to invest their millions in the
shipbuilding industry than I have, and I regard
the industry of Nova Scotia as national in its
character. The man with the hindsight," said
Mr. Murray, "was not. much good to the city
or country. When the Government policy was
inaugurated, it was a time when the salvation

of the country depended on the struggle between.
submnarines and shipyards. It was a question of
Mr. Ballantyne doing his duty when a distinct
fact stared hlm ln the face-and he dld it. That
was ail that could be expected of hlm."

The Hon. Mr. Murray, as you will observe, gives the Government and Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne unstinted and unqualified support. .When
my hon. friend read from
ànother Halifax paper I merely desired
té put this on record aiso, and ta say that

Commons by Sir Henry Drayton. It is as
follows
The Minister of Finance stated that Up to
March 3,1 thie year there had been coilected in
Income Tax a total of $8,8000,000, as against
$17.000.000 at the sanie date last year.

That is a startling staternent. What does
it mean? Does it mean that, due to additional energy put into the collection of the
tax, the receipts have been increased. fromn
$17,000,000 to $38,000,000? There must be

One thing is sure, that many people are not
paying these taxes at all. A return was
made here a year ago which showed, I
think, that about ten farmers in the province of New Brunswick paid income tax;
and the list from Ontario was so small that
it was ridiculous. The numbers in the
Western Provinces exceeded the number in
Ontario, and any man who knows anything
about the rural life of Ontario knows that
there are many farmers who have incomes
much in excess of $2,000 a year, who should
be taxed.
The honourable gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) has made a protest, which is all very well, but he has not
suggested any remedy. When the Finance
Committee of this House was appointed,
it was promised that they would have something to say to the Government, and would
formulate ideas that might result in benefit
to the country. The tariff is not going to
be so materially changed that the customs
returns will be greatly increased. In my
opinion there is only one way in which the
Government can increase its revenues, and
that is by means of the income tax. What
I have said does not refer to Dominion
taxes alone. In the province of Ontario
there will be a law, if it goes into effect,
prescribing that you cannot sell a parcel
of land without paying a very considerable
tax, and I understand the tax increases as
the value of the land increases.
I would not publish a list of all the
people in this country who have paid income
tax, but I would publish the statement that
in the city of Ottawa so many men have
paid on the basis of $5,000 income, so many

on the basis of $10,000, $15,000, and so on
up, and I would extend that principle to
every town and village in-the country. If
that were done the Government would get
a great many anonymous communications,
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

particularly in the small towns, stating that
certain people were shirking the payment
of their taxes. It is all very well for you
or me to say that So-and-so has not paid
his taxes. I am very strongly of that
opinion with regard to certain people in
my own locality-I am not saying where;
but that is of no use. The law should be
enforced. Mr. Breadner has proven to
be a marvel in his office, but he cannot do
everything; and until the Government publishes classified lists showing how many
persons have paid their taxes, it is not
going to get the money.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why not publish
the names of the men who have paid?
\Vhat argument is there against that?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: It might be considered very inquisitorial, or it might be
all right. But I would first give them a
chance in the way I have suggested. I do
not suppose one man in twenty who lives
outside of the province of Ontario can tell
me where the village of Huntsville is. It
is a little village up in Northern Muskoka.
There is a man there, a tanner, who maintains a band in connection with his organization, for his self-glorification, and he
pays the leader $12,000 a year. I do not
say that he has not made a return showing
that his income is over $200,000; I just
give that as an instance of the wealth that
is scattered throughout the province, more
particularly since the war.
I do not believe, and no man can convince me, that honest returns are being
made in every case. And let me show you
how this state of things works out and
causes ill feeling. You can go into a town
where a company employs a number of men
-single men earning over $1,000 and married men over $2,000-and you will find
that that company, in the most exact manner, lifting its hands aloft and thanking
God it is so honest about the law, makes
a return for every man in its employ, showing what he receives. In this way the
poorer men are pounced on for every dollar,
and these men, who are intelligent men,
read in the newspapers about the small
returns which have been made in many
instances.
Once again I say that this is no time
for vain regrets. Large expenditures have
been made, and we have to take conditions
as we find them. The point that I wish to
make is that we should increase our revenue by making those pay who should pay.
It is not only what you might term the

through all that discussion, I think we are
justified in having abiding faith in the
resources of Canada, in our people, and in
our country's future, and that we need have
no craven fear that the great undertaking
which this Government have launched will

to the wealth of Canada.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? He referi-ed
to the fact that the C.P.R. had ships tg
carry their grain across the water, and he
gave that as one of the reasons for their
success. I would ask him if he can tell us
why the Government, who are operating the
Canadian National railways and have idle
ships, are not doing the same thing.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR:
My honourable
friend has asked a question which involves
a great deal of inquiry and covers a multitude of subjects. He might just as well
ask me why certain Canadian ships are not
at this moment loaded with grain and carrying grain across the ocean. He says, in
effect, that I have asserted that the C.P.R.
have used their ships in connection' with
their railways to carry freight across the
ocean, and he asks, "Why are not the Government doing the same thing?" Well, if my
honourable friend will wait a little while,
until we get our organization complete, I
think we shall be doing the same thing.
The whole purpose of our building the
system is to enable us to carry on as the
C.P.R. has been doing.

On the notice of motion:
That the fees paid upon the petition of Mamie

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Since the petition was heard, an application has been
made to the Committee for a remission of
the fees. It appears that the counsel
acting for the petitioner overlooked making
the application when he should have made
it, and the only way the Committee can now
deal with it is by bringing the matter up
in the House. I therefore move that the
subject of this motion be referred to the
Committee to deal with; they will then

they think the fees should be remitted.

GOLD AND SILVER MARKING BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill C,
an Act to amend the Gold pnd Silver
Marking Act. Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
On section 1-addition to permissive
marks on gold-plated and silver-plated articles:
Hon. Mr LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I think it is well to
explain, shortly, the object of this Bill. In
the Gold and Silver Marking Act of 1913
it is provided that gold and silver articles
may be marked, but as for goldplated and silver-plated articles, there
is very peculiar legislation. Gold-plated
and silver-plated articles are referred to
in section 10:

255

* This section applies only to plated articles
wholly or partly composed of the materials
known to the trade as rolled gold plate, gold
filled, gold electro-plate, rolled silver-plate, silver filled, silver electro-plate, or of such materlals of like nature as are defined and designated
by regulations made by the Governor in
Council.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: How far does that
description of "gold filled" and "gold plate"
extend? Does it extend to teeth?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I will
explain to the honourable gentleman in a
moment. The section goes on to provide:
There shall not be applied to any such articles
any mark other than a mark authorized by this
section.

I think this legislation is unique.
section 3 says:

Sub-

If any such article has applied to it any mark
-t must have applied to it a trade-mark registered in accordance with the The Trade Mark
and Design Act.

Then subsection 4 provides:
In addition to such trade-mark there may be
applied ail or any of the following marks:
(a) a mark Indicating truly and correctly, in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 1
of this section, the designation, as known to the
trade or as established by regulation aforesaid,
of the material:
(b) numerals inteided to identify the article
or pattern and not calculated to mislead or deceive;
(c)
the name or initiais of a dealer.

One may apply to the article the term
"gold filled," "gold. electro-plate," "rolled
silver-plate," "silver filled," "silver electroplate," but he may not state on the article
what it is composed of.
For example, of rolled gold there are
many qualities.. There were produced to
me the other day three watch chains, ail
of which were to the eye exactly identical,
but one of them had in it ten per cent of
gold, another about two per cent,.and the
third five per cent. These were shown to
me by a Government inspector, and I have
no doubt that his statements were perfectly correct, but I.had no way of ascertaining whether they were correct or not.
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: Was there no stamp
on the chain?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It is
not allowable-I want the House to remember this-to stamp on the chain how
much gold is in it.
Anyone doing so is
subject to severe penalties. A gold-filled
article is an article which has not the
gold laid on, or painted on it-if one may
use that expression-but in which the
amount of gold is blended through the
entire material. The base may be lead or

256

SENATE

brass or some other metal. One of these
gold chains made 'with 10 per cent gold
will last a lifetime. A chain made with
5 per cent gold or 2 per cent gold, will
last perhaps six months or a year, when it
will disclose itself under its true colours.
A man going into a shop and buying a
chain may have the cheap one palmed off
on him as the good one, as the law says
that there shall be no mark to distinguish
the pinchbeck from the real thing.
I was asked to introduce this Bill on
behalf of a' firm who are starting business
It is a
-I
think, in Sherbrooke.
very well-known and reputable firm of
in New England, and
manufacturers
makes rolled gold goods with 10 per cent

of gold in them. It has established
a factory in Canada for the purpose of
continuing the manufacture of this class
of goods in this country, but find now
that there is no use in making a high-class
article, because it must be sold in competition with the cheaper stuff. All manufacturers must make the cheaper class in
order to compete in the market, as when
sold te the public there is no way of distinguishing the good from the bad. I
want to have the Bill amended by the insertion of three words, providing that any
of these goods made in Canada may be
marked by the manufacturer se that the
public will know w.hat they are.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Why not compel manufacturers to stamp the true quality
of the goods?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I do
not know why; I am not interested in
that. The people asking for this change
are not clients of mine and I am not
at all interested in them professionally,
I was asked by Sir John Gibson's firm in
Hamilton, who are their solicitors, to bring
in this measure.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend if he knows the reason
why, in the legislation now on the statute
book, manufacturers are not permitted to
do that?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I do
not know. I have inquired everywherein the department and of many jewellers
-and I cannot find anybody who can explain it or give any reason for it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable friend point to any reason?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I cannot point to any reason. It passes my
understanding. It may be that there is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

some profound reason why a man should
not be allowed to mark on his goods their
quality, but I am net aware of the reason.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Following up the
same question, may I ask, bas the honourable gentleman ascertained whether it
would be easy for the Department to ascertain the amount of gold that there is
in a given article?
No.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
You see, in England every gold or silver
article must be submitted to the Government and the Government stamps on the
article the quality and quantity of gold
or silver in it. No person is allowed to
sell any article unless it bas- the hall-mark.
It is for that reason that people are always
sure of what they buy.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Does that apply to
plated articles in England?
I am
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not aware.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I understand that there are no manufacturers of
this plated ware in England. 'I am not an
authority on it and do not know, but I have
been told that it is not manufactured in
England-that it is entirely of American
and Canadian manufacture; that is, what
is, called rolled gold. Now, I am not stating that on authority: I am told so, but
the person who told me may not know any
better than I do.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend spoke of the hall-marli in England.
Can the public, on looking at that hallmark, discern the quantity of gold or silver?
CerHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
tainly. There are 24 parts of gold in every
pure gold article, and when you see "14
karat," that means there are 14 twentyfourth portions of gold. You can always
tell the quantity of gold that is in any
article.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the number of karats indicated?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
It is
marked on the article. Anybody who has
an English watch can see it marked there.
It is marked on watch chains on every link.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does that
apply to silver?

from Queen Elizabeth down. There are innumerabie hall-marks, and the way people
tell the age of a goid or silver article is by
looking at the hall-mark and seeing in
what reign it was made. So English goid
and silver wares are absolutely to be reiied
upon.
You wiil notice, as I have said, that it is
forbidden to mark gold-plated and silverplated articles; and, so far as I can ascertain, nobody knows why. Now, Iwant to
have a Bill passed which. will provide, with
respect to Canadian-made goods anyway,
that when a person enters a shop to. buy a
plated article, he wili know whether he is
buying something that will last three
months or something that will last twenty
years. As 1 say, I hiave been told that
there are people who oppose this, and the
only reason I conceive for their doing so is
that a man may be able to buy cheap goods
and palm them off as better than they
are.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Goid brick.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

this, and have flot found one who could,
give any reason against it. I do not care
about it personally, because I do flot buy

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Would the law apply
to articles made in Switzerland, Belgium,
and Flenders?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
No.
While I think it ought to apply to them
ail, I only suggest that it should apply to
Canadian-made articles.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: That would be a
handicap.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
It
would be no handicap. My reason for
asking this is that it would igive the Canadian manufacturer an a-dvantaie over the
foreign manufacturer.
A Canadian-made
article having that mark 'on it wouid selI

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is that the
reason you are'not making it compulsory?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do
not care if you do make it cempulsory. AUl
that these gentlemen want is to have this
prohibition removed fromn them.

they are. That is the whole case, and I

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -Will the honoureble gentleman tell me if I understood
him aright as saying that clause 10 did flot
cover silver plate or gold plate which is
made by dipping?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Oh, no,
the honourable gentleman misunderstands
me. I said that articles that are calied
roiied gold do flot come within what he
defines as articles that are dipped. Rolled
gold is a compound. I may point out that
in ail other businesses in which people seli
compounds-if one may use the word comnpounds with relation to a metal-for instance, mustard, which is usuaily adulterated-no person is allowed to seli a coimpound in this country as pure mustard
unless it is marked on the container that
it is a compound.
You wiil see "pure
mustard" marked on a big tin and on the
side the words, "this is a compound." The
public need flot be deceived if they take
the trouble to look et the labei-although,
I nmust say, the words, "this is a compound"
are put in small type down et the corner
of the label. But a rolled gold article cen
be sold as pure gold, because no person,
no matter how astute he -is, cen tell
whether it is pure gold or flot unless he
is an expert.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wili the public be able to distinguish betwen an alloy
and a goid-dipped article?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
They
will only be able to distinguish by seeing
the mark on it. But when a man is selling
a good article, even though it is *rolled
gold, hie will say, "You see there 10 per
cent gold," or "14 karart" er "16 karat,"
as the case may be. The trade wili do
as they do now when asked if an article
is real silver. At present they say, "look
et the hall-mark 'on it;" and it is a penal
offence to misrepresent an article which is
merked, or to mark it incorrectiy. The
public wili have some protection; now they
have none et ail.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What protection has the public when it is offered
an article which has a very light gold
veneer on it, obtained by dipping?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
public hes no protection now. An article
containing one-tenth of one per cent gold
cen be sold for as much money as an
article containing ten per cent gold. You

the words 'this is a compound" as leave the
law as it stands. This would be at once
evident if a law were passed saying, "It
is prohibited to say that an article is a
compound."
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If I understand
my honourable friend correctly, what he
wants is simply to permit the manufacturers to state the real value of their goods.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the real composition of their goods.

Yes,

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Which means the
.
real value.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is that going
far enough to protect the public? A merchant who will sell as 10 per cent gold an
article containing only 2 per cent gold can
continue to do so in the future. The honest
manufacturer can state what his goods
contain, and will do so, but there is no
danger that the honest manufacturer will
attempt to rob the public. The precaution
bas to be taken against those who are not
honest. I think my honourable friend is
going in the right direction, but I take the
liberty of suggesting to him that he does
not go far enough, and that if he wants to
protect the public he could do it more effectively by making the legislation compulsory.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: As I
have said, this Bill is being promoted by
manufacturers. I have thought a great
deal a.bout the question of whether the law
should be compulsory or permissive. The
manufacturers are satisfied that it should
be permissive, because they know that if it
is passed, even though it is permissive, the
publie will not buy anything that is not
stamped. You cannot sell an unstamped
article in England, and you cannot sell it
to an educated person in this country. The
public will very soon come to know that
the only reliable article is the one that is
stamped, and then all the manufacturers
will stamp their articles.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is the law not
compulsory in England?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Oh, yes,
but not in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If it is compulsory in England, why should it not be compulsory here?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

-Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I am
not asking that we go that far; there might
be a hundred objections to that that I do
no know of. You must remember, too, that
the market is full of goods that are not
marked.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Fix a date.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You would
have to fix a date a long way off.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I am
not asking anything more than that we
should not continue prohibiting people
marking their goods correctly.
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: Honourable gentlemen, when the present Act was presented
to Parliament in 1913, I think it was, the
matter was gone into very carefully in both
Houses before the Act was placed upon the
statute book. Some time ago I took the
trouble to mail a copy of the proposed legislation to amend the Gold and Silver Marking Act to a number of the jewellers of
Canada, and I have in my hand answers to
almost every communication that I sent
out, and I may say that there is not one
dealer of any reputation who assents to the
,proposition of my honourable friend.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Why?
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: -I will read to my
honourable friend a letter which I received
from a very reputable firm, P. W. Ellis &
Co., Toronto. It refers to the time when
the present Act was put upon the statute
book, and says:
We were then and are now opposed to stamping the fineness of gold and of silver on any
article :hat is not all gold or all silver, as it
makes an opening for the unscrupulous dealer
to misrepresent the article when selling.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It does not say
how?
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: I have also an answer
from Ryrie Bros., of Toronto, which reads:
in reply to your inquiry of the 7th inst, permit me to say ýthat we have been closely associated with the terms of the Gold and Silver
Marking Act which was passed by the Senate
some few years ago, and the retailers as a whole
have profited much by its adoption. We have
discussed the amendment with the Executive of
the Canadian National Jewellers' Association
within the past few days, and without one
exception the Board is entirely opposed to the
adoption of this amendment. A great deal of
time and study, in both the interests of the trade
and the public at large, was spent upon the
drafting of the present Gold and Silver Marking
Act, and in our opinion it should not be upset.
This Act was drafted largely to prevent plated
goods being sold to the public as solid gold. If
this amendment should go through it would

goods would be stamped 10-karat and 14-karat,

I
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
would be very glad to have that done.
Se that we
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
might hear from a representative of the
Department and obtain some expert evidence. I would suggest,.not that we go very
far, but that we might hear two or three
experts or men of the trade. I think that
would be of advantage to members of this
body, who know very little about the trade.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I would
like very much to have that done, because
I do not want the Bill to pass if there is
really any proper objection to it; but, as I
say, although I have discussed the matter
with the trade, nobody bas ever gone any
further than the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Blain) who read from Ellis &
Co.'s letter to say that they objected to it.
I have never heard anybody give a real
ôbjection. If there were a real objection,
I would be ready to withdraw the Bill.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not know whether I am
competent to speak on this subject or not.
However, it seems to me that an obligation
resting upon us as members of this House
is to legislate in the interests of the people,
if we can ascertain what the legislation
should be. It may be our duty to legislate
for the manufacturer, but to me it seems
that we have a greater duty-to legislate
for the general public. The general public
are more suspicious of jewellery than of
any other commercial article. The honourable members of this House are, in my
opinion, men who have had experience and
perhaps a good deal of education; yet I do
not think that any honourable gentleman
who desired to purchase jewellery anywhere in this country, would go to the
ordinary jewellery store for the genuine
article. What would he do? He would
go to a firm upon whose reputation he

2611

could depend. Why must he depend upon
the firm's reputation? Because, in the
opinion of the general public, there is more
imposture in the sale of jewellery than of
any other article. I do mot see very much
in the letters received by the honourable
gentleman from Peel (Hon. Mr. Blain).
They come from the trade. My honourable
friend across the floor (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said he had an open 'mind. That is
the attitude we should all endeavor to
take. From the point of view of the
general public-and, so far as I am concerned, it is to their interest I wish to
devote my best efforts-I have heard no
good reason why a manufacturer of jewellery should have the slightest objection to
stamping on an article the quality and
quantity of gold or silver it contains.
There is another reason that appeals very
strongly to me. I did not know it before.
The honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) says that jewellery cannot be sold in England, as it can
be in this country, unless it does bear the
stamp. It seems to me that that argument
is worth considering. So far as I am concerned, without labouring the question
further, I may say I am strongly in favor
of this Bill, because I believe that if passed
it will protect the public, and the protection
of the public, I feel, is our principal duty.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Would the honourable gentleman allow me one question? Who
is to do the stamping?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The
manufacturer. It is the manufacturer whe
does it now. -He puts on all the stamps
that are required by the present Act. The
reason that the trade gives for. that is that
if the Government stamped the goods they
would have to be sent all the way from
Sydney and Vancouver, or the Government
would have to maintain offices in various
centres for that purpose. They say that
London is a much closer centre in England
than Ottawa is in Canada. As a matter
of fact, London.is 400 or 500 miles distant
from some places in England. However,
that was the reason given for 'hot having
the stamp put on by the Government, as
is done in England.
1
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Then what is to
prevent a dishonest dealer from buying
jewellery from a manufacturer, with no
mark on it, and taking that to his own
shop and stamping it as 14-karat, or 10karat, or 9-karat?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
only thing is the penalty under the Act.

SENATE
Whether that is of 'any use or flot is
anather question. Under the Act, any person who marks jewellery falsely may be
prosecuted, just the same as a person who
sells mustard that is adulterated.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: If we buy mustard,
we take it with a grain of salt; but jewellery is a different thing. I was taken in
once. I bought an "18-karat" gold chain
in London £rom a very respectable dealer.
Every second link was stamped "18-karat."
That was the first chain that I ever bought
in my life. I bouglit it as a boy, and wore
it for 25 years. Wheni I wanted to part.
with it I took it to a very respectable dealer
in Montreal, and to my astonishment he
told me that ail he could allow me was $A0.
1 told him I had paid 20 guineag for that
chain. "Well," he said, "that is where you
were taken in. Every second link is only
7-karat gold, and the other links are 18karat.
Yes,

Hon. Mr.'BOYER: No, but they should

rftoveHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Before
my honourable friend makes that motion, it
may not be out of place, and perhaps it is
my duty, to point out to the House that
there has been considerable communication
between the Canadian National Jewellers'
Association and myself as to the propriety
of this Bill passing. I would say to my
honourable friend that on the part of the
trade as represented by the Jewellers' Association of Canada there is a distinct opposition to this Bill. I am unaware, from
the communications which I have received,
that any of the trade are in favour of the
Bill, and many reasons are pointed out why
it should not be passed. Moreover, it was
represented to them that the Bill had been
withdrawn, and I have communications indicative of that; hence any organized movement to oppose the Bill ceased. Now that
the Bill bas been revived they have indicated a desire to make representations to
Ottawa as to wh'y it should not be passed.
1 would point out to my honourable
friend, without discussing fully the merits
of the proposai before us, that it would inH-oii.

Mr,

LYNCH-Sq' \1NTON.

volve a much wider change or amendment
in the Act than that embodied in the
present Bill. If my honourable friend will
peruse the Act as we have it to-day, that
is, chapter 19 and the amending Acts, he
will observe that throughout the statute
the policy is maintained of prohibiting the
marking of plated goods; consequently the
change proposed would require somethîng
more than simply the amendment of section
10. I would refer my honourable friend ta
the penalty clause, section 14 of the Act,
and particularly to paragraphs a and b:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable on conviction thereof to a fine not
exceeding one hundred dollars, wbo, being a
dealer withiýn the meaning of this Act,(a> applies to a plated article any mark
which guarantees or purports to guarantee, or
nduces or tends to induce a belief, that the gold
or silver with which the article is plated will
wear or last for any time whether specified or
flot;
(b) makes in Canada, sells In Canada, or imports or otherwise brings into Canada any
lated article to which any such mark is applied.

My honourable frîend (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) gave as his reason-and I have
no doubt that whoever is interested in the
passage of this legisiation bas pointed
out-that the superiority, say, of a
10 per cent plated gold chain lies in the
fact that it will last for a lifetime,
whereas a plated chain of 5 per cent,
or 2 per cent. may last but a short while;
hence the vîrtue or the menit of the legislation lies in its qualîty of wear: if the
article itself will wear longer, that is the
,eason why it should be stamped. The whole
policy of the Act is against that, as I have
Furthermore, subsection b says:
said.
Makes in Canada, sells in Canada, or import
or otherwise bring into Canada any plated
article to which any su.ch mark is applied.

If my honourable friend will look at
some of the preceding sections of the Act
he will find that probably this feature
of the Gold and Silver Marking Act is more
largely dealt with and elaborated upon than
any other feature in the legislation we have
upon the statute book. If that be the case,
honourable gentlemen will have to consider
the whole policy of the Bill. I am not now
discussing the question whether it is desirable to depart from that policy or not; but
there is the further consideration, which
I tbink it was pointed out at the time we
discussed this Bill in the Senate in 1913 and
the amending Acts-and I niight say, by
the way, that very few Bills caused more
discussion and controversy-that gold below
9-karat cannot be distributed on plated
ware with a degree of accuracy sufficient

APRIL 20, 1921
tu determine the amount or percentage of
the gold; that when the minimum point, so
to speak, of 9-karat is reached, scientifically or mechanically it cannot go below that;
point. I mina be wrong in that, but I think
there was somethig advanced along that
line, and that is the reason we stopped at 9karat. I would further point out for the
consideration of the House, and particularly of my honourable friend when he
brings the matter up again, the question of
the value of.stamping plated ware if it has
hot the sanction of law but is simply made
permissive. .If it is permissive there is nu
force of law to it; there is nu authority by
which the accuracy of the stamping may be
determined; there can be nu penalty attached to it.
Consequently an unscrupulous
manufacturer could put his stamp upon an
article, although it contained very little
gold, showing that it contained the maximum quantity. Who is going to determine
that?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
That
applies in the same way to section 8, which
is only permissive.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
applies to gold articles: of course, that is
a different matter. The difference lies in
this: that if you are buying a gold article
you want ta know exactly what gold is
in it; but if you are buying a plated
article, I doubt if you would think of there
being any machinery by which the quantity
of gold in it could be determined with exactitude. It might simply be a wash; it
mîght possess a greater or a less quantity;
but up to the present, from ail I can understand, there is nu way of determining.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Supposing a
manufacturer stamped guods 2 per cent
and sýold them for 10 per cent, would my
honourable colleague think.that he would
not be responsible to the trade?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
not think he would be any more responsible
than a man who sold a horse. I think
caveat emptor applies in that case as well
as in the case of a horse.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: There is a distinction there: the defect is a hidden une.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: How
is my honourable friend going tu determine
who the manufacturer is? How is he
going to determine who stamped the
article?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
How
can he do that under the section now?

5

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He has
an opportunity of determining at once
whether or flot it is gold. May I say to
my honourable friend that that is dune
under the Trade Mark and Design Act.
It must be registered, and it is subject
to inspection.

is where, to use a street expression, "they
put it ail over Parliament"; because they
know that in the United States and in other
countries they are bound to mark their
goods. They said, "If we can get that
section put in here, it will prevent anyone bringing toreign go-ods into Canada."
That section was flot to protect the public
at ail; they got that put in to prevent
importation from foreign countries; and
I do not object to that in the least; I
think it is a goo-d thing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: PIere
is the reasun urged in general terms by
the Canadian National Jewellers' Association:
The passage of the proposed amendment
wouid, however, open the door to abuses and
fraud of the wurst character, as unscrupulous
manufacturers and dealers would seize the opportunity to flood the market with gold-fliled
articles on which the quality mark would be
prominent and the quantity mark alniost Illegibie. Manufacturera of gold goods would be
pecuiiariy disadvantaged as the cheaper lunes
would be sold In many quarters as solid goid,
with the karat mark as the lever.

I simply point these matters out, not
that I have any strong feeling on the question une way or the ou'ther, but because I
have nu doubt, if the- discussion of the
matter is adjourned, that by the time we
resume it the Jewellers' Association will
have an opportunity of presenting their
views.

Government:

1. Are the rates of pay on ýthe Canadian
National Railways given in the answer brought
down to the House of Commons by the Minister
of Railways as the rates for the year 1921 the
same as the rates of pay that were fixed under
the McAdoo award?
2. What is -the amount actually paid or due
for wages for the' first 20 of the most highly
paid men on the Canadian National Railways in

Yard Helpers.
each case starting from July 1, 1920, up to
January 1, 1921, and the total for the six
months in each case?

-

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: I can give the
information to my honourable friend con-

cerning the first part of his inquiry, wherein he asks if the rates of pay given in the

answer brought down in the House of Commons by the Minister of Railways as the
rates for the year 1921 are the same rates
of pay that were fixed under the McAdoo
award. The answer to my honourable
friend's inquiry is no.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Are they an increase?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The rates of
1921 are higher than those made in the
so-called McAdoo award, the increase being
a result of the adoption of what is known
as the Chicago award of July, 1920.
As to the second part of my honourable
friend's question, might I respectfully draw
his attention to the fact that there are
probably between 60,000 and 70,000 employees on the Canadian National railway
system. He asks for information concerning the wages earned by 20 of the highestpaid men in six different branches of the
service. To obtain that information would
entail a very great deal of inquiry on th(
part of the railway executive. They would
have to inquire of every divisional superintendent over the entire system in order
to obtain the facts as to what rates were
paid to, or earned by, the employees in
all the several classes; the it would be
necessary to pick out the 20 highest in the

whole system; and, after the information
would be obtained, I submit to my honourable friend that it would not mean anything, because in any branch of railway
service or any other business activity there
are always circumstances arising from
time to time whereby one or more employees
may earn abnormal or unusual amounts in

APRIL 21, 1921
a particular month. May I also point out ta
hlm that a few days ago the honourable
leader of the Government in this House
brought down a return showing the average wages of each of the men in the different classes of service to. which niy honourable friend refers. The obtaining of the
information hie asks for in the second part
of his question would entail a, great deal
of difficulty -and considerable expense.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: May I be allowed
to say, in answer to the honiourable minister, that I do not want to ask for information that would cause a great deal of expense or trouble. I would, however, like
to point out that the answer that was
given the other day to the honourable Senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien )
referred only, as I understood it, to the men
employed in~the eastern part of Canada.
If I understand rightly, there is a difference between the rate of wages paid in
Eastern Canada and the rate pgid in
Western Canada. There is a division made
somewhere about Fort William or Port
Arthur, and the western scale applies west
of that point and the eastern scale east
of it. .Possibly my honourable friend could
give me an answer showing the different
classes of men and the higher rates of
wages paid under those two different scales.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.- I think information could be obtained readily showing
the difference in the rates of pay as between Eastern and Western lines. In the
service with which I am personally
familiar, the telegraph service, the minimum rate here is $13P, and I believe that
west of Fort William it is $160 per month
for the same class of service. In saime of
the other branches of the service -there is
a discrepancy of the samne kind, but it is
very much less than it was prior to 1918.
In days gone by, because of the xnuch
higher cost of living in. the West, there
was a very marked differential; but that
has bien decreased, and in some cases has
been entirely wiped out.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What I wanted ta
get was the actual amount paid ta individuals in the different classes-first, in the
western divisions, and, secondly, in the
eastern divisions.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable friend insists upon obtaining that information, which will require a perusal of
the entire pay-roll, and which would take
some time ta gather together, I 'suppose
we will have ta apply for it.

266

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If it were only
the case of one man in each class, surely
that would' make quite a difference in the
answer-the actual ainount, for instance,
paid an engineer on a train running into
Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Without a survey of the entire pay-roll for engineers
it would be quite impossible to locate the
engineer who drew the highest pay.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If I were to change
it to the average payHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That information has already been brought down.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is only for
the Eastern part.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think there
would be no difficulty in getting the information for the Western lines.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: How would it do if
the leader of the Opposition got this information for the six highest paid men in
one of the divisions instead of in ail? I
would like to see a statement of the maximum earnings of these six classes of men;
but if it is going to entail an enornious
amount of labour covering the whole system, I would suggest taking one division
only.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Could the
honourable gentleman inform the House if
any time has been *fixed for the maintenance of the rates that are at present
in force?
Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSON: I think I am
correct in stating that the present rates
of pay on our Canadian railways are subjeet to cancellation on 30 days' notice by
cither party at any time. Sa far as I
know, no steps have been taken by either
the comnpanies or the employees to abrogate the existing agreement. I do note in
the press, however, that in the United
States notice has been given that the
existing agreement will expire on July 1
next, and that steps are being taken tawards making a new agreement between
the railway companies and the employees.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So the Canadian National Railways or the Canadian
Pacific Railway could renounce the rateS
at a certain date without applying to the
Railway Board for a revision of the rates.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The agreemients that exist between the railway companies and practically 'ail of their employees are, I think, terniinable on 30 days'
notice by either party.

SENATE

COMMERCIAL AGENTS IN FOREIGN
COUNTRIES
DISCUSSION AND INQUIRY

Hon. L. O. DAVID rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the desi-rability of improving our commercial
relations with foreign countries, and of increasing the volume of our exports, and inquire
whether it is the intention of the Government to
appoint commercial agents l.n' the principal
centres of the United States and of those countries?

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I wish
to explain in a few words the object of my
inquiry. My object is not so much to
speak myself as to induce some of the other
members of this House to express their
views on the question, which is one of great
importance. It has been said, and I am
one of those who have been of this opinion, that the Senate ought not to wait for
legislation to come from the House of
Commons, but should, in the interest of
the country, and in its own interest, discuss questions of great importance in order
to demonstrate the usefulness of this House
and to maintain its prestige.
I have thought that the question raised
by the present inquiry deserved the consideration of this House.
The adverse
balance of trade, the depreciation of our
money in the markets of the United States,
and our commercial relations with that
country are necessarily causes of anxiety.
There is only one opinion as to the necessity of removing the evil done to Canada
by that state of things, and all kinds of
remedies are suggested to improve the
situation. One of the remedies suggested
by some eminent public men, such as presidents of banks, and even by the Minister
of Finance, is that we should induce our
people to discontinue buying in the United
States articles which can be bought in
Canada.
With that purpose they have
made eloquent appeals to patriotism and
public spirit; but, alas, in matters of trade
and commerce sentiment is frequently
missing, and self-interest induces people to
buy where they can buy cheapest. In the
discussion which took place on the motion
of the honourable member from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Tessier) as to the
carrying of wheat from the Northwestern
provinces by Canadian railways and the
export of it through Canadian ports, it
was stated by several members of this
House that that was a matter which was
governed not by sentiment but by rates.
The same thing can be said of our trade
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

relations; and, despite the patriotic. appeals which have been made, our people
continue to buy in the United States, and
as a result the balance of trade against
us continues to increase. What is going
on in the world to-day shows that patriotism has lost much of its authority-and I
might say the same thing of religion.
Both have been excluded more or less by
certain associations. We begin to see the
results of the exclusion of these two great
beneficial factors in human action, and we
have not yet seen the worst. We must,
then, seek elsewhere for some remedy for
the situation.
It has been said that higher duties on
articles manufactured in the United States
which can be manufactured in Canada
would have the effect of decreasing our
importations, and improving our commercial and industrial situation. I share that
opinion. Honourable gentlemen may remember that I have already expressed my
views on that question, and I do not wish
to repeat them. This is not the time to
discuss the question of the tariff. I intend to-day to limit my observations to the
principal object of my motion, and to say
briefly that, in my opinion, the appointment of commercial agents in some of the
principal centres of Europe and the United
States would be highly beneficial to our
commercial situation. All the great countries, and especially the United States,
have commercial agents; and they consider
that the money spent for that purpose is
wisely spent and in the best interests of
those countries.
It is said that the United States and
Canada are so closely connected that our
neighbours know exactly what we have
and what they can buy in Canada; but, on
the other hand, it is alleged, and quite
properly so, that a country which is in
the beginning of its development cannot
do too much to make its resources known
and appreciated. There are countries alert
to study the requirements of other countries, and to find customers for their products. That is the reason why, as I have
said, many countries have commercial
agents in other parts of the world.
We have one of the richest countries of
the world, and its immense resources are
only beginning to be known. A great number of our neighbours, when they visit our
country, admit that previously they had
not known the abundance and importance
of some of those resources, and they express themselves upon them in glowing
terms. But there are thousands who do

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Cement.
Hon.

MIr. BEAIBIEN.

APRIL 21, 1921
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: Therefore I do
not think that question is involved at all.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) speaks of ignorance in France with
regard to Canada. I am sorry to say that
as great ignorance prevails in Canada as
in France witlh regard to our own country,
and it is because of Canadians' ignorance
of their own country that Canada is in
her present financial difficulties and is
burdened with railways as she is to-day.
That is the whole cause, honourable gentlemen, and the sooner Canada begins to study
herself and know herself the better it will
be for Canada.
In manufactured goods this country cannot compete abroad except by selling at
a lower price than in Canada. There is
not a single article manufactured in
Canada that can be sold abroad unless it
is sold at a price lower than that at which
the article is sold in this country.
,Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is not that
the case in the United States as well?
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: My honourable
friend asks if the situation is not the same
in the United States. To a certain extent
it is, but not to such an extent as in
Canada.
I am in the unfortunate position of not
being able to make a speech. I am almost
exhausted now. I wish I could, because
these questions interest me exceedingly.
My honourable friend ireferred to the
question of exchange; I would invite hon.ourable gentlemen to study the exchange
situation between Canada and the United
States. From Cdnfederation up to the
time of the war, under natural conditions, without borrowing abroad, the
exchange was against Canada every
year.
Then
our 'borrowing abroad
adjusted that situation.
But it cannot adjust matters to-day.
The only
period in the history of Canada when the
exchange was balanced, and amore than
balanced, was during the war, because of
the high prices of munitions and of our
agricultural and other products. But we
have now reverted to natural conditions,
and, honourable gentlemen, I venture to
say that unless Canada economizes, as this
cold northern country must necessarily
economize, and unless our people work for
less pay and longer hours, the exchange
will be against us while Canada is Canada.
The situation cannot be otherwise.
I
invite a study of that question. I also
implore our Canadian people to study their

26

own country and know themselves. I meet
but few Canadians who know much about
Canada.
I would not presume to discuss this question as I do but for the fact that I am a'
lumberman who hungered after timber
limits, and I do not hesitate to claim
publicly that I have explored more of
Northern Canada than any other lumberman in this country, and I know what I
am talking .about. Climatically, conditions
are against us.
Geographical conditions
are against us. Canada is but a narrow
strip, and transportation for everything
produced is too costly. Honourable gentlemen, Canada is the most expensive
country in the world in which to produce,
and the only way you can make existence
of any importance at all is to work harder,
economize, and work longer hours.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I arn in favour of the appointment of
commercial agents in European countries.
I do not believe that in the past Canala
has done what should have been done in
that respect; but I cannot see eye to eye
with the honourable gentleman from Mille
Iles (Hon. Mr. David) on the present occasion. I do not believe that we need any
commercial agents in the United Statet,
and I think it would be money wasted to
appoint them. In all important branches of
commerce between the two nations, Canadian houses-and I know there are a number-have their own agents and their own
offices in New York or some other American city. In the same way American companies have their offices and their agents
in Canada when they are interested in doing business in this coun‡ry. I think at
this time especially it would be the wrong
policy for us to follow, for two reasons:
first, because of the exchange situation,
and, secondly, because, by reason of the
exchange situation, we are interested in
decreasing the amount of our purchases in
the United States. Of course, I quite understand that the object of the motion is
not to foster purchases, but to foster sales,
on the other side of the line. But if there
were any ne'cessity for such agents, the
agents of the business companies would
discharge the function. They would answer
inquiries made by one country or the other.
For my part, I think what we should be
concerned with now, and for a great many
years to come, is to diminish our expenditure instead of enlarging it b3r all kinds
of things. We should conserve our finances
"for essentials.

SENATE

Hon. A. BOYER: Honourable gentlemen, our old friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Edwards), as he gets younger day by
days, does not mend his ways at all. It was
just fifty years ago last summer that three
young men, full of courage and pluck, and
believing in the resources of this Canada of
ours, started down the Ottawa river, one
with a pickaxe, another with a shovel,
and I don't know what the third carried.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A.saw.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Yes, a saw. They
canoed or walked down the Ottawa river.
Among the three they founded a saw-mill
which turned out to be-well, you might
call it successful for such a poor country
as this; and, after a few years of struggling, one of them retired and, if we can
believe history, sold out for seven million
dollars. It must have been a mighty poor
country to settle in.
I am one who has always believed
that Canada is one of the richest countries on the face of the earth, and my
reasons for believing that are these. Take
our long winters which last for practically
seven months. Canada is purely an agricultural country; and a country that will
feed the population that it bas fed ever
since it was founded, an increasing population year by year, is not a poor country.
When you have to keep your cattle indoors
doing nothing for practicaly seven months,
you have to reap enough in three or four
months' time to keep your cattle and yourself alive during the winter. Have we
ever had a famine in Canada? Have we
ever been starved in this country? I remember one time dining with a foreign
gentleman who was astounded to find that
we had butter on our table three times a
day. I was not alone in having butter
three times a day; I believe each and every
one of us bas had as much as he wanted
from childhood up. We have never run
short of bread; we have never run short
of anything; and I say it is wrong to run
down this country. What we should do is
to boost our country. The more you cry
"Hurrah -for Canada" the more people will
believe in it. The more you boast of your
resources, whether they exist or not, the
better things will go. That is the way to
found a country and a nation. Let those
that come into it discover their error; let
them try to mend their ways, and say, "We
have started on the wrong tack," and then
the country will prosper as it has done in
the past. There is no other country in the
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

world that can boast of being so plentifully
provided for as Canada is, and no people
are as cheaply fed as Canadians are to-day.
We have gone through four or five years
of terrible war; we have had high prices;
but we could always get what we wanted
provided we had the money to pay for it.
How much did we retrench? I know from
personal experience that instead of having
two eggs for breakfast I had only one, and
that is the only economy I could practise;
and there were many like me. Let us cry
up our country. Let us advertise abroad
that we have plenty of good lands for those
who are willing to stand the climate. Let
us cite the example of those three'young
men who went down the« Ottawa river, and
see what kind of men will come into this
country. I do not believe in having agents
abroad. We had no agents in Runiania,
and God knows we made a bad enough bargain with Rumania. We sold goods to the
people of that country to the extent of
$22,000,000, and we can sell that quantity
of goods again to other countries at the
same rate and under the same conditions
without the help of any agents.
Hon. W. H. BENNETT: I think the honourable gentleman who bas introduced this
matter to the House is to be congratulated.
There is one thing that we can congratulate ourselves upon, and that is the way
in which we have come out of the war. We
have come out of it better than any other
country in the world. Conditions in this
country to-day are better than those in any
European country, and better even than
those of the United States.
The honourable gentleman from Rideau
(Hon. Mr. Edwards) bas recommended that
everyone should travel in this country. The
trouble is that everyone is not furnished
with a pass, as we are who are fortunate
enough to be members of this or the other
House.
This country is being advertised and
bas been advertised by our lefforts in
the war, and I think that advertising
will be productive of a great deal of
good. Perhaps one of our troubles is that
we do not all know what the Government
is doing in the way of advertising. I may
mention something for the benefit of any
gentlemen who have not visited that interesting exhibit of the Department of Trade and
Commerce on Wellington Street, where they
produce moving pictures. You may ask
what they do with these moving pictures?
They have sent men to take pictures in
the West on the prairies; they have sent

APRIL 21, 1921
then into the Niagara district and the fruit
districts of British Columbia, both when the
trees were in bloom and when the crop was
being harvested; and those pictures have
been shown not only in Canada and in the
United States, but in Australia and Europe.
If there ever was a time when every energy
of the people and of the Government of
Canada should be directed to increasing
our trade, it is the present time, because
other countries are putting their best.
foot forward and are doing all in their
power to recover from their present attenuated condition.
The honourable gentleman from Rideau
(Hon. Mr. Edwards) has referred to the
lumber business. I assume that there was
never a time when we had greater competition in that business in the Europeanmarkets. Let me give an instance mentioned to me by a gentleman, a Canadian,
engaged in the luinbering business in Russia. It may be all very well for people to
work longer and to eat less-I think my
honourable friend got that idea a great
many years ago from Sir Richard Cartwright-but there are other countries in
which the people have to work much harder
and eat much less than we in Canada.
The gentleman that I have referred to is
to-day engaged in lumbering on the Baltic.
There stumpage for lumber is cheap; employees are paid 60 cents a day and their
board. This gentleman and his associates
employ 1,500 men, and, as I was informed,
men never worked as hard or as w'ell.
It is difficult to get into the European
markets. After the war there was a cry
that every mill in this country would be
working overtime in preparing material
for the construction of bouses. This prediction looked all very well at the outset,
but it did not work out so well in the end.
I just mention this to show how keen conpetition is, and how much harder we must
work in order to secure trade with Europe
and with other countries. I do not think
that the United States is a very fertile field
for our products to-day, owing to the fact
that there is a heavy tariff against us and
that their productions are much akin to
ours. But there is one lesson that we can
learn from them. The United States bas
benefited· by time and experience, and
surely we can do the same.
Only the other day I read an address.of
the Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Mr.
Tolmie, and, as it was in the public press,
I have no doubt that other honourable gentlemen have read it as well. He said that
British Columbia, once a mass of moun-

271

tains, is to-day being cultivated as assiduously and keenly in the fertile spots that
lie between the mountains as any other
place in the world; and he referred to the
fact that not only was there to be a huge
production of apples, pears, and peaches,
but that the people there were looking forward to the production of figs and olives.
It has been my pleasure and good fortune
to have been in California; and in my
opinion if you review the whole United
States you will come to the conclusion that
no state in the Union is producing more
wealth than the state of California. What
were great sandy plains are to-day irrigated lands covered with sniiling orchards.
Some years ago California was undeveloped, and to-day it is the greatest producing
country in the world. The production of
figs, olives, and olive oil in that state is
enormous. May we not hope that British
Columbia, with good soil and similar conditions, can do as California has done. If
it were not for the drought that seems to
.be prevailing throughout the world, British
Columbia might even go in for grape
growing. As for the prairie provinces of
the West we have only to wait for - the
world to get settled down when we will
have an ever-increasing flow of immigration year by year from Europe and from
the United States.
'I am not posing as a know-it-all, but
I am going to remind honourable gentlemen of some of the things that we have in
this country. Little Switzerland does not
live on what it produces in thie way of
cereals or fruit: it lives on tourists; and
Canada can have an enormous trade in that
respect. If you go up to Fort McNic'oll,
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's
depot on the Great Lakes, you will see
tourists not only from Great Britain but
from France and other countries-and before the war they were to be seen in even
greater numbers than to-day-taking the
Great Lake' steamers on their way to the
West and the Orient, by way of Vancouver.
They stop at high-priced hotels throughout
the country and leave' a great deal of
money behind them.
In the province of Ontario, by reason of
the development of our water powers, we
have cheap production, wonderfully cheap
production; and the development that bas
taken place in the province of Quebec is
absolutely amazing. I remember some 25
cr 27 years ago the members of the two
Houses were invited to go on an excursion
down to Quebec city. We returned by way
of Shawinigan, where the development of

SENATE

72

water-power was just commencing at that
time. I had the great pleasure of going
back there again last summer, and I had
almost to ask myself before I could believe
it if it was the same place, with its huge
pulpwood factory and the other industries
that are located there to-day. There were
huge piles of paper addressed not only to
Toronto, Montreal, and other Canadian
cities, but to points in Australia and
Europe; and, if I am not mistaken, some
of them were addressed even to China and
Japan. That is an incentive to us to try
to secure export trade. The province of
Quebec has made wonderful advances along
the line of manufacturing owing to waterpower development, and we in Ontario
enjoy the same advantage in even greater

which is on the Order Paper. The only
answer I can give to my honourable friend
is this:
Commercial agencies are established in such
forei.gn countries as seem open to profitable
work under present conditions. These will be
added to as opportunities open and conditions
warrant. The appointment of agents in the
United States is under consideration.

purpose of overcoming this difficulty. Yet,
honourable gentlemen , the Department of
Trade and Commerce, or this Government,
with what littie machinery we may have in
operation, are being relied upon by the
enormous influences which I have pointed
out, to overcome those disadvantages fromn
which we are suifering every day. I say,
honourable gentlemen, it is the duty of the
trade interests of Canada to-day to overcome this difficulty. They are disloyal to
the best interests of Canada if they sit idly
by and permit these abuses to developi
which we have been watching patiently
for some years past, and I say without
hesitation that they should nlot rely upon
paternalism of the Government to overcome
the difficulty which I have indicated.
Now, let me point out to yen, honourable gentlemen, some items mentioned in
a short article which was intended, not to
make a deep impression on the public mind,
but to iIlustrate what we are suiffering
from. This article I noticed some days ago
while casually looking over a paper, which
is not a trade journal. I refer to Saturday
Night, of Toronto. The article stated that
we are importing at the present time
$24,000,000 worth annually of breadstuffs.
Why, we have been under the impression
that Canada has been, so to speak, the food
basket for this continent. Yet we are importing from the United States annually
$24,000,000 worth of foodstuffs. 0f eggs
we are importing $3,000,000 worth. 0f
flsh. we are importing $4,000,000 worth.
Why, honourable 'gentlemen, we have
enough fish in the waters of Canada to feed
the world. We aie importing $4,000,000
worth of ribbons. 0f silk we are importing $33,000,000 worth annually. 0f woods
we are importing nearly $32,000,000 worth
annually. Yet the woods of Canada, 1
might say, are full of wood. My honourable friend from Rideau (Hon. Mr. Edwards) could have given us some information as to that and might have impressed
upon the House that.we could successfully
compete in the markets of the world at
least in wood.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But those are
largely Woods that we do not grow, I
suppose.
Hon. *Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Precisely; but why should we import, may I
ask my honourable friend? Surely we could
get along without those expensive Woods
we are importing from the United States.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Well, these buildings are partly the answer te that question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; I

is perfectly right. We are importing

pretensions in Canada; whereas we grow.

for ail purposes.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Can the honourable gentleman tell us what this wood is
in the wall panels?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
oak, and I venture to say it is imported
from the United States.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And this floor,
covered with red carpet.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We were
always under the impression, honourable
gentlemen, that we could grow in Canada
enough vegetables for our needs, but we
import over $6,000,000 worth of vegetables
annually. Vehicles: go where you will in
Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacifie,
and you will flnd large industries engaged
in the manufacture of vehicles; but we are
importing over $30,000,000 worth annually.
0f furs we are importing $9,000,000 worth
annually, although Canada is the home cf
probably the greatest volume cf furs that
can be found in the world. We are doubtless exporting to the markets of EuropeI cannot say positively the amount, but it
is certainly far in excess of what we are
importing from the United States. This
category might be continued to show the
folly of the course that we are pursuing
and the fool's paradise in which we are
living. Yet we are protesting against the
Government for net doing more, and are
talking about the grievances by which we
are oppressed owing te the rate cf exehange
between ourselves and the United States.
Honourable gentlemen, until Canada embarks upon propaganda to impress its
people that we are a self-contained country,
that within our boundaries we can produce
what we need te live upon, those difficulties
will have te be faced.
I am net for one moment saying that
we must net trade with the United States.
We must trade with the United States. The
fact cf the matter is that our balance cf

but the balance of trade so far as the
United States is concerned is absolutely
against us, and until we overcome that
adverse balance of trade Canada will be
a hewer of wood and a drawer of water,
and it is for the loyal people of Canada
to protest against the continuance of this
kind of thing and to rise in their might
determined that they shall build up for
themselves, within their own boundaries,
a trade by which this adverse balance will
be overcome and there will be an equilibrium of trade, to say the least, between
Canada and the United States. Canada can
do this. I pointed out a few moments ago
the enormous influence represented in
Canada by its trade interests; and when
you take into consideration, honourable
gentlemen, that by our part in the war we
established in the eyes of the world a
reputation for enterprise and energy that
is not paralleled on the part of any of our
allies, to say that we should sit idly by and
permit this balance of trade between ourselves and the United States to overwhelm
us is not worthy of a Canadian.
Hon. GEORGE McHUGH: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? He gives
the amount of breadstuffs that we imported from the United States into Canada.
Could he give us the amount of breadstuffs
we exported from Canada into the United
States, also the amount of furs we
exported, and the amount of vegetables
exported, in order that we might see how
the balance of trade in those lines would
stand?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to my honourable friend that that
will not overcome the difficulty. If we
continue buying from the United States a
million dollars worth a day more than we
are selling them this difficulty will continue.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: But it is not in
those articles that the honourable gentleman has mentioned.
The discussion concluded.

CANADIAN

N4TIONALS BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading orf Bill 17, an Act to
define Canadian Nationals, and to provide
for the Renunciation of Canadian Nationality.
He said-: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
consists of two sections-one dealing with
the deflinition of Canada Nationals, and the
other making provision for the renunçiation
of Canadian nationality. We have entered
into the League of Nations, which, as
honourable gentlemen know, is constituted
of most of the natiôns of the world. Ternis
are used that must necessarily be made
common to ail the members of the League.
This terni "Nationals" has been used, and,
inasmuch as there are certain rights and
privileges growing out of meltnbership iWthe
League, it is very desirable that there
should be a clearly-defined interpretation
placed upon the terms that are used in the
League. Hence it is desirable that we should
legislate upon this subjeet.
8-18à

276

We have upon -our'statute book two
laws, the Immigration Act and the'
Naturalization Act, which deal with
citizenship, or practically the terni that
is before us; but there is no definition
given to this .partikular term in Vhose Acts.
This definition is peculiarly needful owing
to the many self-governing entities which
make up the British Empire and which
have the right to legislate upon these
questions. Without the definition there
might be confusion, and it has been thought
desirable to legislate as proposed in the
Bill.
I may explain to honourable gentlemen
that this in no way cuts down or invadeg
the citizenship rights of a British subjeet.
It simply defines what shail constitute a
Canadian National, in the event of the
question arising in connection with the
League.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Would it nlot be
more suitable if that definition were put
in as an amendment to the Immigration
Act or to the Naturalization Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No;
because it bas not necessarily te do with
the Immigration Act. That is to say, the
Immigration Act deals with the subject of
immigration, and the definition placed in
that Act upon citizenship has to do only
and entirely with the question of immigration.
This definition deals with an
entirely different subject, and to embody
it in another Act niight lead to confusion.
My honourable friend might suggest-and
it would be more pertinent-that the
Naturalization Act should be amended.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
that Act has to do with an entirely different
subject from this. This is practically a
new subject that has arisen from the
League of Nations; it is therefore desirable
that it shouid stand by itself.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Does
this ainendme-nt in any way affect the
question of the deportation of undesirables?
Non. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No;
it in no way affects the Immigration Act.
Hon.
Mr.
BOSTOCK:
Honourable
gentlemen, it is somewhat difficuit to understand exactly what is the meaning of a
Canadian National. I noticed in reading
the discussion that took place in another
chamber that apparently no very definite
conclusion was reached as te what was
really. meant by this terni. I do not thinlc
that the members of this House wish to

276

SENATE

oppose the principle of the Bill if the Government think it necessary to define the
ternm in this way for the purpose of dealing
with the question which apparently has
been raised by the Treaty; but I hope that
when we go into Committee my honourable friend will be able to give us a full
explanation of what really constitutes a
Canadian National and what are his rights.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
why.

And

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was a
time, honourable gentlemen, when there
were to be found in Canada men who
thought they possessed Canadian nationality, or citizenship, because they had
obtained naturalization papers under a
Canadian Federal Act. I recall the case of
prominent Americans who came here and
renounced their United States nationality
to adopt another nationality called the
Canadian. It was found that on leaving
Canada they were nationals, or citizens, of
no country at all. Our Naturalization Act
did not give to those gentlemen any status
in the outside world. When they travelled
outside of Canada they were disowned by
American consuls and ambassadors; yet
they were not recognized by British representatives abroad. They had an acquired
nationality only when they were within
Canada. Without mentioning names, I will
simply draw the attention of the Chamber
to very prominent men who came from the
United States to develop our railway systems. If in the past we have had Canadians who were nothing outside of Canada,
we shall henceforth have in Canada Canadians who will be known by many different
names: there is the Canadian citizen under the Immigration Act; there will be
under this Act the Canadian National;
there will be the British Canadian. Unier
the Census Act we are not Canadians;
we are British Canadians, or English Canadians, or Scotch Canadians, or French
Canadians. In the census that was taken
last there was no column for Canadians;
they were non-existent; we were anything but Canadians. Under, the Census
Act, if I remember rightly, we were obliged
to say where our parents came from, in
order that we might be described. But now,
as I say, we have Canadian citizens, we
have Canadian Nationals, and we have
Britishers pure and simple, who, roaming about the Dominions, feel at home and
call themselves British; and there are some
among us who think themselves Canadians. I wonder if we could not simplify
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

the situation considerably by defining a
Canadian.
My honourable friend may be
able now to explain to me the necessity of
defining a Canadian National. When I attend the League of Nations shall I be
obliged to say, if I am asked what I am, or
from what country I come, "I am a Canadian National?" I confess I would prefer
to say simply, "I am a Canadian." Will not
this Act preclude me from calling myself a
Canadian if by this Act the official definition of what I am is a "Canadian National?"

Hon. SIR JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
wonderful the dificulties against which
my honourable friend has been struggling
for years past.
I wonder that he has
flourished so prosperously as he has done.
He seems to have entirely overlooked the
fact that we have departed from the Naturalization Act which we had on the
statute book some years ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
And
the difficulties which he has so graphically
pointed out have been overcome by the
Naturalization Act which is in operation
throughout the Empire. Of course, it must
have been quite apparent to my honourable
friend that until that Act was passed we
would have had no authority to pass legislation which would give effect to naturalization outside of Canada. But, as my honourable friend very well knows, that difficulty, about which he has said nothing, has
been overdome long ago.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, I think the honourable Minister in
his explanation might have assured us
whether the purpose of this Bill was to
expand or to restrict the present regulations concerning naturalization in Canada,
and especially with regard to its effect upon
citizens of foreign nations who may wish
to make their domicile in Canada. I do
not know what this will' effect. Lately
Great Britain bas entered into relations
with foreign countries under the League of
Nations. If there is anything in this Act
that would restrict the privileges or rights
of citizens of foreign countries, partakers
in the League with Great Britain, they
would immediately call upon Great Britain
as being allies under the League of Nations
to control and restrain the Act of the
Dominion Patliament so that all those
would have access to the dependencies or
colonies of Great Britain, and, under the
League of Nations, they being allies, they

APRIL 21, 1921
would be entitled to the very best treatment. If there were any Acts of ours
to restrict 1fhose rights or privileges,
Great Britain would ýbe called upoin to
ç
restrict those Acts.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Before
this Bill passes, may I ask what is a
"Canadiap National?"
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It bas
grown out of the use in the treaity of the
termi "Nationals." My honourable friend's
attention must have been directed to that.
Consequently it becomes necessary for us
to define what a "National" la.
It is
necessary for Canada, it will be necessary
for Australia, and it may be necessary for
ail countries which. are niembers of the
League, to do this. It is simply owing
ta the use of a word which will be applied
in common by ail the members of the
League. It is apparent that it is very
desirable to do that. We have adhered
as strongly as possible to the substance
of what has always constituted British
citizenship. in Canada. There is no distinction; it does not create a new status
of citizenship.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is a
similar Act being passed by the other
Dominions?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I could
not say; but I should think it would be
desirable on account of the use of the
terni. Let mie illustrate. My honourable
friend bas been following the deliberatiQns
of the League of Nations. He will observe et the present time, for instance,
that there is being discussed.the organizatiori of a Court of International Justice,
and provision bas been miade in the constitution of that Court that any member
of the League may have one of its own
representatives a member of that Court.
The word "National" is used. The question
then might arise, in the election of a meniber who would be entitled to sit on that
Court, as to whether h.e would corne within
the termi "National." For instance, you
could not take the terni "Canadian citizen
under the Immigration Act" and say that
1-e would possess alI the qualifications of
British citizenship necessary for that office,
because a restricted meaning is given to
the terni in certain statutes which. have
in view a particular object. Possibly if
we shumber on it 'we may be able to make
it more illuminating.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would asIc
mny honourable fniend to be prepared to give

.277

us, when xve go into Committece, the distinction between a Canadian citizen and a
Canadian subject.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
depend upon the statute that uses the
terni.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I once suggested to a very proniinent American who
had niany dealings in Canada that hie
should take Canadian nationality, as hie
had -thrown in his lot with us. He struck
an attitude and said, "Abandon my American citizenship to become a subject?" and
hie said it with such an appearance of indignation that I began to pinch myseif to
see to what extent I feit my ensiavement,
and I had' to explain that it was but a
terni, a form of speech, and that I was as
proud of niy Canadian citizenship as hie
was of his Amenican citizenship. But I
find that we have moved away from subjection to become Canadian citizens according to the Act.
The motion was agreed io, and the Bill
was read the secondg time.
CORRUPT PRACTICES
ELECTIONS BILL

AT

SECOND RLEADING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 39, an Act to
amend the Statutes relating to Corrupt
Practices at Elections.
He said: Honouraible gentlemen, this is a
Bill we probably ail understand: it deals
with corrupt practices.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will the
people who offer for election?
Hon. Sir JAME~S LOUGHEED: We
have two statutes which practically. deal
with elections-the Dominion Elections Act
and the Dominion Controverted Elections
Act; and owing to a conflict of the ternis
used in these Acts it bas been thought
desirable to reconcile theni as far as possible so as to include in the Controverted
Elections Act the termi "illegal practices"
which has been used in the Dominion Elections Act. The terni'"corrupt practices'
bas been used in the Controverted Elections
Act, and the consequence is that confiiet
might arise in, legal minds in the event of
any question 'being raised which would permit of that.
The other sections of the Bill deal largely
with procedure, and it is unnecessary for
me to deal with them in detail. It may be
apriopniate for nie to say that this Bill,

!78

SENATE

having corne from the Gommons, and having passed through the hands of the members of that chamber who are very closely
in touch with the operations of these Acts,
1 think we can rely absolutely upon the
scrutiny which they have given to the
provisions of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is there the saine
penalty for a "corrup't practice" as for an
"illegal practice"?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cennlot say. I do not know whether the one
is as heinous as the other; 1 think they are
practically synonymous.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Perhaps my honouraible friend wîll be able to tell us when
we go into committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED rnoved
the second reading of Bill 60, an Act to
amend the Judges Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
is a Bill consisting of three clauses. The
first has to do with the exemption from
taxation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court up to the amount mentioned within
the clause. It will be rtecalled that at the
last Session of Parliament, I think it was,
we amended the Judges Act, making certain
of the judges' salaries liable to income tax.
But, in dealing with the salary of the Chief
Justice, apparently the sa'lary which he
was then receiving became hiable to income
tax, which it should not have done. Furthermore, the $5,000 which the Deputy
Governor has received in the past, and
which is now added to the salary of the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, would
have become hiable to the tax. The question
arose as to whether or niot it was susce-ptible to that tax. Apparently the House of
Commons bas drawn a distinction ýbetween
the salary of $10,000 which the Chief Justice formerly received, making that exempt
from the application of the tax, and the
$5,000, which apparently was made hiable
to the tax. When the Bihl was first brought
into the House of Commons it evidently
exempted the whole; but, owing to a discussion that took place in that Chamber,
the ýamount of $5,000 was separated frorn
the other amount.
Inasmuch as this is
peculiarly a money Bill, and therefore
within the authority of the bouse of Gommons, we find ourselves without any authorHon.

Sir JAMES- LOtXGHEED.

ity to amend it even though we may consider that an injustice is being done to
the Chief Justice by making the $5,000
susceptible to taxation.
Hon. Mr. SC HAFFNER: Why is there
an exception made in the case of the Chief
Justice?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
situation, I would say, is this: that the
only amount taxable in the case of the other
judges would be the increase over their
former salaries. I think 1 arn correct in
saying that the Act of last Session provided
that any judges appointed after the passage
of that Act wouhd be subject to income tax
on their salaries; but, inasmuch as the
former salaries were exempt, the judges
then appointed had sornething in the nature
of a vested right. But the ad;ditional
salary is hiable to the tax.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I thought the income tax was based upon the whole sahary;
that is, that if a judge accepted the increased salary, he accepted it subject to
the condition that he must pay a tax on the
whole salary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand the contrary to be the case.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
That is the way
the matter was explained: that is, if a
judge were to accept $2,000 or $3,000 extra
he must pay income tex on the whole
amount. I do not see why he should not.
Members of the highest court in the land
pay a tax on tlheir income.
We
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
need not discuss the question of what the
law is, because it will be apparent from
last Session's statute. My impression is
that it is only on the increase that a judge
pays, but that ail the judges appointed
after the passage of that Act accept
appoinment subject to the income tax.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I understend that
the tax upon thiis $5,000 is put upon this
judge as exercising functions entirely outside of his duties as a judge-acting as
the representative of the Governor General.
Is not that it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
explanation, s0 far as I can gather it, is
this, that the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court for many years past bas acted as
Deputy Governor and bas been entitled to
$5,000 by reason of that. The impression
did exist that that $5,000 was not subject
to income tax, but upon the matter being
br3ught before the House of Gommons and

279

APRIL 21, 1921
further inquiry being made, I understand
that an opinion was given, which was accepted by the House, that that $5,000 had
always been subject to the tax. Consequently the House of Commons said: "That
being the case, we will not-exempt it."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will you allow
me, honourable gentlemen, to give my explanation? I happened to open Hansard,
and I neyer.enjoyed niyself so much before as in reading the whole debate, masmuch as the Minister of Justice had to give
an explanation, somewhat elaborate, at
least twenty times. It was not a very easy
thinig to explain. As soon as he had given
an explanation, another meniber would
corne in and say: "I was nlot present: would
the honourable gentleman repeat it?" And
they kept hlm for two hours repeating the
explanation that he had originally given.
The explanation, if I may try my hand
at it, is this. The judges were appointed
with fixed salaries, which could not be
touched by law. The Minister of Justice
says that was a contract between the country and the judges that their salaries were
to be so much and no deductions could be
made by future legislation. Now, we increased their salaries and said to them: "If
you àccept thatincrease, you must stand
the tax on your whole salary."
Mon. Mr. FOWLER: That le it.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: I think that
ail of them, considering it to their advantage, accepted the large increase, and became subject to the income tax. The Chief
Justice was then in receipt of $10,000 as
Chief Justice and of a bonus, or caîl it
what, you will, of $5,000 fer acting as
Deputy Governor General. The Act increasing the salaries of the judiciary declared at thè same tume that the salary of
the Chief Justice should be $15,000, equalling the $10,000 and the $5,000 that he was
receiving. Instead of receiving $5,000 as
Deputy Governor, lie wae to have that
amount added to his salary and henceîorth
to receive a salary of $15,000. We do not
call it a salary in the case of a judgeHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It ie a
salary.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: A stipend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A stipend.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Emolument.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Emolument.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, cal
it a salary.

Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: And the Chief
Justice was made subject to the condition
imposed on the'other judges, that if they
wanted the increase in their salaries they
would have to stand the income tax. That
condition was imposed upon him aithougli
lie represented to the Minister of Justice,
the day alter the Act was paseed, that he
was receiving no increase. He had been
receiving $10,000 as Chief Justice and
$5,000 as Deputy Governor: the $5,000 was
withdrawn fromn him as Deputy Governor
and tacked on his salary as Chief Justice.
He said: "It is nlot £air to deduct anything
from my $15,000 by way of income tax,
since in reality you are giving me no increase."p
Hon. Mr. LYNCHI-STAUNTON: Yee, I
se e his point.
Hon. Mr.
Bill.

DANDURAND:

Hence

this

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: My understanding of this Bill le about what the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) lias said. I think the explanation
given to the other House as to why the
Chief Justice ehduld be exempt from incorne tax while the other judgee have to
pay the tax was that the salary, or whatever you niay caîl it, of the Chief Justice
wae not increased.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Was not increased in reality, because he had been
receiving $5,000 under that other head.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH--STAUNTON:
no more money.

He got

Hon. W. B. ROSS: PerIhaps the Chamber
would bear with me if I tried an explanation. As I understand it, the salary of
the Chief Justice was $12,000. That salary,
as lias been said, was not really increased.
The statuts said it should be increased to
$15,000, but that was done by taking away
what was formerly paid to him for acting
as Deputy Governor General. Now, the
complaint on the part of the Chief Justice
is that lie did not get any increase at ahl
in substance; the difference was merely in
the working of the statute. Now lie says:
"Put this payment back as it was and
ie4ve my salary at $12,00V." That $12,000
is exempt from income tax, because the
etatute provided that when we increased
the salaries of the judges they should elect
either to take the increa.se and pay income
tax on their whole sahary, or else within

280

SENATE

three months give notice that they would
not accept the increase, but would continue
under their old salary.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Without paying
income tax.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It was free from
income tax. The case for the Chief Justice, as stated by the honourable member
who has just sat down, is that his salary
was not increased. It was $12,000. Now,
the only other question is whether or not
it is fair that the Chief Justice should
have the allowance for his extra-judicial
duties; but that, as I understand, is to be
subject to the income tax. This measure
would leave the Chief Justice in the position of a judge who has not had his salary
increased.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: According to the
bonourable gentleman, the Chief Justice
would then receive $17,000 a year, would
he not?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: He was getting

only $10,000.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He was
getting $10,000, not $12,000.
May I say to the honourable member for
Kings and Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) that
he is perfectly right. I was wrong in the
contention I made as to the increased
salary alone being susceptible to the tax.
If the judge elects to accept the increased
salary, it becomes in its entirety liable to
the tax.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The matter is a
little mixed yet. I wish to give notice of
an amendment that I propose should be
added. It is an amendment to the main
Act and not to the Bill that is immediately
before you. The Act we are dealing with,
the Judges Act, is chapter 56 of the
Statutes of 1920. Section 12 of that Act
provides, in subsection 2, that every judge
who is nominated by the Governor General
in Council and assigned to try any matter
shall proceed to do so. I will read the
subsection:
Every judge who may be nominated for the
purpose by the Governor in Council shall execute
without additional remuneration any commission
or enquiry for which he may be appoi.nted as
commissione" under any authority in that
behalf . . . .

I propose to strike out the words "or the
Lieutenant Governor in Council.» The
judges are appointed by the Dominion.
They are used by the provincial government to investigate all kinds of subjects,
including road scandals and things of that
Hon.

W. B.

ROSS.

kind. You have timber limit scandals, I
think, in Ontario, and there is a very dirty
road scandal in the province of Nova
Scotia. , I know that so far as the Nova
Scotia judges are concerned, they complain
of this work which is assigned to then and
which is intensely political. They feel that
to compel then to try such matters is
simply doing two things: it is taking them
away from the regular duties of the Courts,
and, besides that, it is involving them in
political squabbles. They are Dominion
judges, and I think that the sooner the provincial governments arrange for commissians of their own to try those matters the
better for our courts, because I am perfectly satisfied myself that public confidence in the courts is daily being weakened on account of taking the judges to
deal with those matters that are not part
of the regular work of their courts at all.
It is quite possible for the provincial
authorities to get good commissioners
without using the judges. I do not want to
enter into any lengthy dissertation, becaus'e I think every member of this House
realizes quite as well as I do the great
importance of every one in the country
feeling that the judges are impartial and
not involved in any of the political
squabbles within the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Was not this
amendment which the honourable gentleman intends to move carried by this Chamber before?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No; I am going to
propose it now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But was not a
similar amendment moved last year?
Hon. Mr. POWER: There was a statute
passed last year.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Oh, we had last year
a Bill which was thrown out. Under the
Bill of last year all the judges were to be
prevented from being used on commissions
at all. The Bill of last ydar was wider
than this proposed amendment. My objection to judges acting on commissions,
whether they are appointed by the Governor in Council or by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, still remains; but this
amendment does not go so far as last year's
Bill went, because it still leaves the appointment of judges as commissioners in
the hands of the Governor General in Council.

APRIL 21, 1921
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is the honourable
gentleman trying to have the Act of last
year limited?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes; I arn proposing
that haif of the subsection should be cut
out. I would like to see it ail cut out, but
I know I cannot get that done, because
there are certain reasons given why the
Governor Geneital in Council should have
the right tio appoint judges on commissions.
Judges are appointed to act as arbitrators
in labour disputes, and we are told that
labour will not accept as a referee or umpire anyone but a judge.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If that amendment should pass, it would not prohibit
judges fromn being appointed commissioners
by provincial govertiments. It merely says,
as I understand it, that they are not compelled to accept the commissions; but they
could accept the work and be paid for it.
There is nothing in the Act to prevent the
judges being appointed commissioners by
provincial governments.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: As a matter of fact,
I know of judges who were asked to act
as commissioners when commissioners were
highly paid, and who refused to do so at
that tinie, and it is on record that they
refused. The statute which we passed last
year gives them no remuneration; but that
is not the coenplaint: they complain that
they are asked to leave their regular duties
and engage in what is really a political
squabble-that their influence in the country is lessened and the work of the courts
obstructed.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But will the honourable gentlemnan's amendment stop that?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: It will do it in this
way, that it will enable a judge to decline
to accept a commission from the Pro-'
vincial Governent. Take the Iast comnmission appointed in Nova Scotia: a judge
of the Supreme Court was told by the Provincial Gaverninent, "You have no choice;
the statute says that you shall do it."
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There is just one
thing that 1 do not quite understand in it-Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do flot want to
interrupt the honourable gentleman, but
this is ail very irregular. I think the honourable gentleman fromn Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross bas given this as a notice of
motion, and we had better discuss it when
it is moved.

281

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The honourable
gentleman's amendment, as I understand
it-if I may be permitted to say so-means
rnerely that the judge cannot be compelled
to sit on a provincial commission; but if
hie is appointed it is bis duty to say
whether hie will sit or not. If hie accepts
the appointment, I presumne hie will receive
extra pay, and that is where the trouble
always came in before, with regard to the
judges sitting on political commissions.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Just one rernark. I
want to put a question to the honourable
gentleman fromn Middleton. Under a statnte
of the province of Quebec 25 persons may
apply to a judge for an investigation in
municipal matters, and there have been
cases in which this statute was put into
operation with good effect. If the amendment proposed by the honourable member
is adopted, shall we in the province of
Quebec be able to put that statute in
operation?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: What can be donc
in the province of Quebec, and in the other
provinces, if desired, is to arrange that any
dispute between municipalities niay be taken
into the regular courts. A petition could be
filed, and it could be answered, and then
the matter could be deterrnined by the
judges, just as they happen to corne to the
case. It rnight be the Chief Justice, or it
might be a puisné judge. However, if this
proposed amendment passes, the provincial
governrnent of the day will not have the
right to, tell a judge on the Bench to go out
to some district in the country and investigate some politcal squabble ont there.
But there is no difficulty in arranging for
those disputes of which the hononrable gentleman speaks, because this aniendmnent
would not prevent the judge fromn acting;
it would leave him entirely free to carry
ont the regular duties of bis office.,
The honourable gentleman fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) asked a question. There is an older statute than this
which prohibits a judge £rom, going outside
of his regular work. If this arnendment
passes, it will be correct to say that, he
could not take the commission.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But judges have
been doing it, even in spite of the Act.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But the old Act allowed the Governor in Council to appoint
them.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman if he is quité

SENATE
sure that his amendment is in order. It
does not seem to be an amendment to the
Bill before us.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is an amendment
to the Act. I understand the objection of
my honourable friend; but the rule which
prevails in the English House has never
been acted upon in this House.
I have
raised the same objection several times and
have got sat upon.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say to honourable gentlemen that there are
two other sections of the Bill which I had
intended explaining to the House; but honourable gentlemen were so voracious to enter upon a discussion of the salary of the
Chief Justice that I did not get an opportunity. I can assure honourable gentlemen
that the other two sections are very good
legislation.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I agree with one
of these sections. Section 3 says in part:
In the province of Nova Scotia no judge of the
Supreme Court shall receive any travelling
allowance for courts or chambers held at the
city of Halifax.

That is all right. Then it goes on to say:
In the province of New Brunswick no judge
of the Supreme Court shall receive any travelling allowance for courts or chambers held
at either one of the cities of Fredericton or St.
John unless he resides at the other of the said.
cities or in the immediate vicinity thereof.

This interferes with the judge who resides in the city of Moncton. Moncton is,
as perhaps all honourable gentlemen know,
the second city in importance in the province of New Brunswick. It is a thriving
and growing city, and a great deal of
legal business is done there, and there is
a judge of the Supreme Court who, since
his appointment, has lived there. Under
the regulations, chambers must be held
in Moncton by a Supreme Court judge one
day in the week. It will add nothing to the
cost to the country to allow the judge to
remain in Moncton. If this is not done he
will be compelled to move to St. John, an:
then the St. John judge will have to go to
Moncton. There is another judge who resides in Sussex, aifd while it is a very
thriving town it is not of such proportions as to require the presence 'of a
Supreme Court judge.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:_ Is there
anyone here from Sussex?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am here from
Sussex. As I say, Sussex is not of such
proportions as to require the presence of
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

a Supreme Court judge, and I have a general idea that the cost of that privilege in
the past was altogether too much, and I
am very glad to see that it is being done
away with. But with regard to the Moncton matter, I would be glad to have the
Bill stand until I may have an opportunity of discussing it with the Minister
of Justice.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
be very glad to let it stand in Committee.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I will not be here
next week.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: To eliminate the
flavour of political patronage, I think that
the selection of the judges who will take
these commissions should be made by the
Chief Justice of the province or the judges
of the province. In the province of Ontario there are two divisions of the Supreme
Court-the Appellate division and the Surrogate division. It may be that through
illness there is a scarcity of judges in one
division, -and the Chief Justice could make
a selection of a judge for commissioner
which would be most convenient.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
the Bill comes up in Committee we can
consider that point.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Owing to the
sitting of a Committee, I have not been
present during the discussion on this Bill;
but I am interested in it and would lik3
to have an opportunity of discussing it
freely.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Why is this provision limited to the judges of the Court
of Appeal or of the Court of King's Bench?
Should not the County Court judges be included?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
will be a very pertinent question when the
Bill comes before Committee.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The County Court
judges are local judges.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

CANADIAN WHEAT B'OARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 75, an Act
concerning the Canadian Wheat Board.
He said: As honourable gentlemen are
aware, we by législation some time ago
instituted wbat is known as the Canadian
Wheat Board; and in November, 1919, by
legisiation, we extended the time for the
completion of the duties of that Board
some eigbteen months, I think. It is now
desirable. that the time should be further
extended to permit ot the Board completing its duties. As honourable gentlemen will probably recail, there are certain participation certificates outstanding
which would entitie those farmers, whose
wheat the Board took over, to the difference between the amount realized, less the
costs of the Board, and tbe amount which
they, the farmers, may have received.
Furthermore, there are certain financial
questions to be adjusted by the Board
before tbey can finally wind up their
labours. It is thought that the operations
of the Board can be brought to a conclusion during the present year. The purpose of the Bill is confined entirely te these
matters, and it does not permit of the
Board entening uzpon any new duties except those defined in tbe Bill, which I
have already nxentioned.
Hon. Mr. WAT SON: Ras the honourable gentleman any information as to the
amount that is stili outstanding on those
participating receipts?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I
understand that there is very littie. Some
participation receipts have not been presented; but it is tbought by the Board that
it would probably cost more than the fractional amounts which may be owing te
canvass the whole situation. Furtbermore,
what cash may be on hand will b. required

of the receipts which have come in to the
Board, and which, less the costs, have been
paid out to the different fàrmers interested
in the sales of wheat.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think at the date
at which the participating receipts were all
to be turned in, some months ago, there
were some millions of dollars outstanding.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Board has no way of ascertaining where
those receipts are. I understand that
many of them have been lost, and it may
be that they will not be forthcoming at any
time. But should the affairs of the Board
be wound up, that money will have been
paid into the Consolidated Revenue account,
and I have no doubt that upon satisfactory
evidence being submitted the Government
will be prepared to pay what the participation certificates may require.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I happen to
know that the Board has paid for lost certificates on the submission of what to them
was satisfactory evidence, and I presume
the Government will be equally equitable in
their dealings, because there will be a lot
of the certificates.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

only clause it contains:
The Montreal Central Terminal Company may,
within tive years after the passing of this Act,
complete the works mentioned in chapter one
hundred and nine of the statutes of 1909, and If,
witbin the said period, the said works are not
completed and put in operation, the powers of

I can really give no further explanation.
I suppose the Bill will have to be referred

WAGES 0F RAILWAY EMPLOYEES
INQUIRY
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. L. McME ANS: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to cali the attention of the
honôurable Minister of Labour to 'a published statement by the Chairman of the
Railway Commission in regard to wages
of railway employees. While the Minister
of Labour was discussing in this House
a few days ago the wages paid by the
railways, I asked if it was true that conductors and engineers were drawing over
$500 a month, and 1 think his answer was
that they earned about $300 a mointh. Mr.
Carveli says in a statemenit published in
the press this morning that some of them
are drawing over $600 a month. I would
ask the honourable Minister of Labour for
somne explanation of the very great difference between bis statement of the
amount and the statement of the gentleman
who has the honour of being Chairman
of the Railway Commission.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: I presume,
honourable gentlemen, that this is not an
opportune time to enter into any debate
on this subject. As I recall my remarks, I
stated that in my opinion the average
salary would not exeeed $300 per month.
My attention was 'almost, immediately
called to the figures fromn the Department
of Railways and Canals that were brought
down in another place in answer to an
inquiry, and which showed that the average

salary was considerably less than $300 a
month. Lt is true that the gentleman who
is Chairman of the Board of Railway Comnmissioners bas found*on a particular run
in Saskatchewan one train crew, an engineer and a conductor, who, because of
special service involving almost twentyfour hours' work in twpnty-four hours, did
in a particular month earn sometbing like
$500 or $600; but I submit that that is no
yardstick by wbich to measure the income
of the whole railway service througbout
Canada. I tbink it is quite ridiculous.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would draw tbe
attent;ion of tbe bonourable Minister to one
instance, taken from the Canadian National railways:
Rie said a conductor drew for the first 12 days
(f the xnonth of February this year $289.80, and
f or the second period $238.30; inaking a total
of $528.90 for the month's work.
And then be goes on:
In March the sarne mnan totalled $598.90 for
h!s nionth's work. Brakesmen on the saine construction Job were drawlng $403.15 and engineers $616.65 for a month's work.
There must be sometbing wrong somewhere.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would point
out to my honourable friend that tbe
article refers to construction work and not
to railway train service at ahl. Instances
can be found, I assume, where a particular
train crew is sent out on a construction job
-perbaps an emergency repair job---on
which tbey may work almost day and night,
for soine time, and certainly tbey will be
paid for the time tbey put in. But that is
no indication of tbe average earnings of
railway employees.
LAKE 0F THE WOODS CONTROL BILL
CONCURRENCE IN GOMMONS AMENDMENTS
H-on. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
concurrence in tbe amendments made by
the House of Commons to Bill D, an Act
respecting the Lake of the Woods Control
Board.
He said: Honourable gentlemen wil
doubtless recaîl tbe fact that we passed tbis
Bili, which originated in the Senate, and it
went fromn here to tbe House of Comnions.
The Commons bave added two amendinents
to the Bill, wbich are in a sense not
material. On page 21, line 29, they bave
inserted after tbe word "secure" tbe words
"9severally and." Tbese amendments bave
been put in at the suggestion of the Ontario Governinent.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
clause read now?

How does the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I
would have to look that up. On page 2,
line 25, add the following words after paragraph d of section 3:
Just save and excepting the operation and
control of all dame and regulating 'works
extending across the international boundary,
and the dam and regulating works across the
Canadian channel at Kettle Falls.

The object of this latter amendment is to
preclude the Commission from dealing with

strictly international waters, or at least
waters that cross the boundary. It was
never intended that they should interfere
with those particular streams. The main
object of the Bill, as honourable gentlemen will recall, was to regulate the flow
of the Lake of the Woods. My only objeet
in asking for concurrence in the amendments is to enable us to inform the Ontario
Government, who are rather hesitant about
asking the Legislature to pass the Bill
on account of our not having dealt with it
in this House, that it bas had its third
reading. If, therefore, the House agrees,
I move concurrence in the amendments the
effect of which I have considered, and which
in no way interfere with the principle of
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I have not had an opportunity of
seeing the amendments; but I would like
to draw the attention of the House to the
second amendment, which, as I understand it, takes the water at Fort Frances
out of the control of the Board that is
being appointed under the Bill.
The
boundary line between the United States
and Canada passes through the Lake of
the Woods, as I understand the situation;
so of course all the water of the lake is
boundary water. I think the question was
discussed when the Bill was before us
previously. The danger of the whole
situation as I see it is that this Board will
be allowed to deal with boundary waters,
and it is quite possible that difficulties may
arise on that account. I understand, from
what my honourable friend says, that this
is the result of an arrangement come to
with the Ontario Government.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
waters are specified in the second amendment, are they not?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:

Yes.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It only
affects the works?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes. The question that I think arose before was to the
extent of the control which the International Waterways Commission, which
bas been sitting for some time now, and
which has made a report, would have over
the work of this Board of Control; and
possibly in the working out of the arrangement the Board of Control will consult with
the International Waterways Commission.
But there is nothing in the Act that safeguards that situation. I think it is a rather
important point and one that should have
been considered. However, as this is a
matter of arrangement between the two
Governments, I do not think it would be
wise to take any strong objection.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The best
answer to that is that this has been done
on the recommendation of the Joint Commission. They in a report unanimously
agree that a commission should be appointed by the Canadian Government to
control the water of the Lake of the Woods;
and of course there is nothing to prevent
the American Government from appointing
a similar Board.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I understand that
there is no provision in this Act whereby
this Board of Control could join with a
Board appointed by the United States.
As I understood the report of the International Waterways Commission, it suggested that a joint Board should be appointed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: As I understand,
the Government is not taking any power
away from the International Joint Commission.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The object of this
Bill is to appoint a Board to regulate the
flow of water out of the Lake of the
Woods.
Honourable gentlemen should
understand
that the Lake
of the
Woods is the source of Winnipeg's power
-in fact, the power of the whole Province
of Manitoba-and we are greatly interested in having this legislation passed.
It is feared that if this is not done certain
powers which Backus has received from
the Ontario Government may interfere
with the water of the Winnipeg river,
which controls the whole power situation
of Manitoba. I submit that it would be
well to pass this Bill, as the Ontario
House may not sit very long, and if they

APRIL 22, 1921
have no intimation that this House bas
pagsed the Bill they may flot pass a
similar Bill in that Hanse.
The motion was agreed to, and the
amendments were concurred in.

CANADIAN NATIONALS BILL
CONSIDERED IN, C.QMMTTEE AND
REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee an Bill
17, an Act to, define Canadian Nationals
and to provide for the renunciation of
Canadian Nationality. Hon. Mr. Taylor
in the chair.
On section 1-Canadian Nationals defined:
Hon. Sir JAMES- LOUGHEED: I Éope
my honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has seen light
since we discussed this matter yesterday.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I thought mY
honourable friend was going ta give us
some further information as ta what a
iCanadian National really is.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I rather
fiattered myseif that I f ully explained this

287

yesterday on the second reading of the
Bill, notwitbstanding the doubt; expressed
by some honourable gentlemen on the
subject.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amrn ot going
into that question, because I arn afraid that
nobody can answer it satisfactorily, flot
even my honourabie friend with ail bis
sagacity and readiness. But -what is the
occasion of this Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The occasion of the Bill is this: that in the League
of Nations Treaties the word "National"
has been used, and it is a term that bas
been made common to those wbo wouid represent what I might cail the citizenship
of the different niembers of the League.
The term is what migbt be called a pecuiiarly European term. It is largely used
in France, and it is used in Germany; but
the interpretation from the French into
English of the word used in the Treaties
is somewhat difficuit.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it the translation of tbe French word "ressortissants"?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, and
the English word used is the word "National." As honourable gentlemen know,
we bave not used that word in any of our
statutes in defining citizenship; consequently it is necessary ta, define what constitutes a national. A national in Canada wouid he a British subject in Canada,
and it is desirable to so expres% it. On the
other hand, we have used the word "citizenship" in the etatutes in accordance witb
the particular object of the statute that
deals with the term. We bave used it in
the Immigration Act, and a certain meaning is placed upon it, in that Act, and may
be placed upon it in any other Act, because
we have in view the application af tbe law
to the citizensbip so mentioned. There is
nothing in this Bill to eut down tbe citizenship of a Britisb subject in Canada, or
the citizenship of anyone entitled to nàturahization in Canada, once he is naturalized.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I have
been told that the necessity for tbis, definition is that; before the League of Nations Canada stands on ber own feet-that
a persan from this country appears before
the League's tribunals, not as a British
subject, but as a resident of Canada, because if he appeared as a British subject
he would necessarily be represented by the

SENATE

!88

persons who represent the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland. But we have
an independent representative or representatives at the League of NationsHon. Mr. ROCHE: Who are they?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:-and
the people who are behind our representatives cannot appear under the name of
British subjects, because if they did they
would be at once told: " You are represented by the representation fron the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland." So an expression must be coined
for all the Dominions so that there may be
an Australian National, a South African
National, a Canadian National or a British National, for the purpose of placing
him behind his representation. I am told
that that is the meaning of this clause;
but, although I looked casually at the debates in another place, I did not see it laid
down in that way. But there must be
some real reason for this definition of a
subject. "Les ressortissants," as I think
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
called them-the people who are entitled
to the protection of the country-are those
who are covered by this definition, and I
cannot sec that it affects our Immigration Act, either to increase or decrease, or
extend or narrow, one's status. If that
is the meaning of it, I should be glad to
know. I am curious to understand what
the real meaning of this legislation is.

consti.tutes the Court. There is a provision
that any member of the League may be
appointed to this Court, but he must have
a majority of the Council and a majority
of the Assembly. But, Canada being an
entity and a member of the League as fully
as Great Britain itself, if a Canadian is
elected a member of that Court of International Justice, how would you define him?
What would you call him?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A Canadian
citizen.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
how would you determine that he is a CanaThere is no such word in the

statutes as a Canadian.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Or in
international law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, the Immigration Act defines " Canadian citizen."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Inmigration Act simply provides for those
who come within that Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no; it does
not provide only for them.
But
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
this is international, not domestic law.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Of
course, we are taking the meaning that is
in the Immigration Act, but we are passing
a Bill which will be limited to the definition to be applied to " Canadian National."

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can the honourable gentlernay cite a case in which, for
instance, anyone frorn Canada would appear before the League of Nations as a
Canadian National? Would Sir Herbert
Ames hold his position because he is a
Canadian National?

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why not say

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Because

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not care anything about the language of the treaty.
I object to being called a hyphenate. I am
a Canadian. My family have lived in this
country for 150 years-145 odd yearsand I consider that I am a Canadian. I
am no hyphenate of any sort.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: How
many hundred years did my honourable
friend say he lived in this country?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I said my family
have lived in this country nearly 150 years,
and I think I am entitled to be called a

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My

can better illustrate the position in this
way. It is proposed to establish an International Court of Justice, or a Court of
International Justice, and it is proposed that
that Court shall be made up of eleven

we are dealing with language which is
found in the treaty, and the question is
how we, can meet that language and corne
within it.

own volition. It seems to me that there is
involved a question which is far wider than
what is implicated in this Bill.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We have helped to
make that treaty as Canadians, and I
think that name is good enough.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
My honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr,.
Lynch-Staunton) said a moment ago that
this Bill neither added to nor subtracted
froni the persons who are citizens.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I draw
attention to the Immigration Act, in whlch
will be found the definition of "Canadian
citizen."
Canadian citizen means-(i> a person born in Canada wbo ban flot becorne an alten;
(11) a British subJeet wbo hau Canadian
domicile; or
(iii) a person naturaized under the laws 0f
Canada who bas flot subsequently becoine an
aipn or lost Canadian domicile.

It seems to me that is a coniplete definition, and I do flot see the need for this
definition unless it is for the purpose of
getting a term which is exactly the same
as what is used in the treaty. But "Canadian citizen" is well definèd in our statutes
now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh,
yes; but it is flot said there that a Canadian National, using the term in the treaty,
is the same as a Canadian citizen. We
have to pas some statute to couple up
those terms.,

whatever-

CORRUPT PRACTICES AT ELECTIONS
BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 39,
an Act to amend the Statutes relating to
Hon.
Corrupt Practices at Elections.
Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
On section 1-"Illegal Practices;" "Official Agent":
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The wording of
that seems to be rather peculiar. Perhaps my honourable friend can give us an
explanation. It says:
'Illegal practi.ces" means acts in relation to
elections which are declared to be illegal practices by the Dominion Elections Act.

I presume there is a definition of "illegal
practices" in the Dominion Elections Act.
Is it the intention to make that definition
apply to Dominion controverted elections?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The term "illegal practices" is used in the
Dominion Elections Act, but in the
Dominion Controverted Elections Act the
words used are "corrupt practices." They

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; it
brings the illegal practice within the Controverted Elections Act. The term "corrupt

This gives the court authority to deal with
illegal practices just the same as corrupt
practices.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
note which I have from the Chief Electoral
Officer is:
This section directs the avoidance of elections
for corrupt practices. The consequences of a
finding that there has been a corrupt practice
differ from the consequences of a flnding that
there has been an illegal practice, and section
51 of the Act requires amendment .accordingly.
It might be repealed and reenacted in the following form, the amendments to be indicated
by italices.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That seems to
be the object of nearly all the provisions
of this Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
very largely.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: To assimilate the
terms "corrupt" and "illegal."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-avoidance of election by
illegal employment:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
period of eight years mentioned in the
present Act requires correction, in view
of the provisions of section 87 of the
Dominion Elections Act.
Section 5 was agreed to.
On section 6-exoneration of candidates,

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
the same. It covers illegal practices.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 7 to 10, inclusive, were agreed
to.

APRIL 22, 1921
On section 11-Judge's report published:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is the
maeaning of this?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
22 of the Disfranchising Act contains
machinery for keeping the namne of a
disfranchised elector off the voters' list
used for Federal purposes. The machinery
is inapplicable to the Dominion Elections
Act in its present form, and should 'be
struck out of this Act. The amendment,
therefore, is in the formi submitted in the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: To what is the
section applicable?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Apparently it is made applicable to the law as
we are now amending it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amn speaking
now of section Il of the Bill. You are
allowing part of the old section to remain,
and inquiry is as to what that provides for.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It
strikes #out practically the whole of the
section.
Section 22 reads as follows:

29J1

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the change
in this?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
section provides a certain time within
which the liquidator shaîl make the retura
referred to. It is thought desirable to
limit him to 60 days.
Hon. Mr. BELCfOURT: There is not
very much sanction to this. When it is
prepared, what is he to do with it? Put
it in bis desk? I think that ought to be
carried further-that he should deliver it,
or publish it, or do something with it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
I
think the criticism is well directed, and
that some such provision should ho made if
it is not made now. 0f course, there may
be a provision in the Act penafizing the
liquidator for any remissness in carrying
out bis duties.
Section 1 stands.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill

Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 1-substitution of new forms:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend if he bas submitted the
provisions of this Bill to the Attorneys
General of the Provinces?
I
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
understand that they have been submitted
to him, but not by me. The Bill is purely
for the purpose of shortening the forms
and abolishing the necessity for sealing
warrants.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
you need consult anyone about the latter
portion of it. I think the Bill is quite a
good Bill; but I hardly think we should
take the responsibility of passing on the
forms without advising with the gentlemen who have charge of the law in the
Provinces; and therefore I think it would
be proper to have the opinions of the
Attorneys General before we pass it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Nothing
of any moment contained in the original
for.ms has been taken out; they have only
been shortened. The short forms have
been drawn by a magistrate of 30 years'
experience.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would ask
my honourable friend to let the Bill stand
for the purpose of submitting these forms
to the Attorneys General of the Provinces.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What
have the Provinces to do with it?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Provinces

law.

This
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
only eliminates a few unnecessary recitals
and words. Take this first form: "remand for prisoner." The prisoner comes
up for trial and is not ready to go on, or
else the Crown is not ready to proceed, and
then the magistrate has to write out a
document to be delivered to the jailer,
ordering the jailer to receive the prisoner
back into jail, and hold him until the remand is over. In the police courts of

Hamilton, there may be twenty or thirty

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not object
to that at all; I agree with my honourable
friend; but I want to see that these forms
are correct.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Well, if
this Parliament has to submit every amendment of the Criminal Code or any other
law in which a province is interested, to
the provincial authorities for their concurrence, I do not think there will be much
legislation enacted.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, yes, plenty
of it.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Suppose they disagree?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: My
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
might do that, but I certainly am not going
to take that trouble.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The schedule was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,
April 26, at 8 p.m.

What la the amount actually paid or due for
wages for the flrst 20 of the most highly paid
men on the Canadian National Railways in the
following classes: (1) Eigineers; (2) Firemen;
(3) Trainmen; (4) Local Firemen; (5) Yard
Foremen; (6) Yard Helpers. Give the amount
per month in each case starting from July 1,
1920, up to January 1, 1921, and the total for
the six months In each case?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As my
honourable friend will see, I hold in my
hand what is practically a pamphlet. The
answer to this question would fill a book,
literally. I would suggest to my honourable
friend that he should change this question
into a motion for a return, because it is
quite apparent that the thirty or forty
pages which I hold in my hand should not
appear in Hansard, as they would if this
were given as a reply to an inquiry.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I shall be very
pleased to accede to the request of the
honourable leader of the Government and
have the inquiry changed into a motion for
a return, to be laid on the table of the

entrance to the Fraser river has been the objective of the Government since work bas been
in progress under the modified Le Baron
scheme?
2. What depth is now available, so far as indicated by reports received at Ottawa by the
Publics Works Department?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
1. Such depth as is warranted by the
needs of commercial navigation.
2. 25 feet below the sloping surface of
the river on a 12-foot tidal rise.
3. The department is now considering
whether the existing depth should be increased, or whether it is sufficient for present needs.

Hon. ARTHUR BOYER: May I be
allowed to offer a few remarks about this
Bill? First, I wish to thank my honourable
friend' (Hon. Mr. White) for having consented last Tuesday to the postponement
of the third reading of this Bill until
to-night. This divorce-the only one, I am
glad to say, coming from amongst countrymen of mine in the province of Quebec-is
so very repugnant to my feelings that I
cannot allow the Bill to pass without first
criticizing the report of the Committee and
asking the members of this honourable
House not to consent to such a stain being
put upon the province of Quebec.
To begin with, in reading over the evidence we find that Mr. De Martigny was

time, fine months after they were married
a dauigbter was born. Four years after
the marriage they separated, and the reason given to the committee was incompatibility. Nobody asked the question on wbat
point they differed or what were their reasons for separating. It was just incompatibility; and, the gentleman added, "She
said she could no longer stand me." Well,
that strikes me as being a very poor reason
for coming before a committee of such importance as the Divorce Committee of the
Senate. Is there not; something that could.
be done to manoeuvre around that incompatibility and restore peace 'once more?
They divided: the wife went h er way,
taking the only child, and the huàbgnd went
bis way, and for about nine or ten months
aItogether lost sight of bis wife. Then, hie
said, bis health broke down. I suppose hie
feit so sorry at losing bis wife, about whom
hie apparently did hot care a button, that
bis healtb gave way; and be had to go to
California to rest and recuperate.
Wben
hie came back bis wife telephoned bim and
according to tbe evidence informed him
tbat she was living witb anotber man, and
hie said bie would not; stand it. How very
generous, bow very husband-like of a man
who bears a proud namne! Instead of taking
tbe proper means to put an end to tbe
scandai, if a scandal existed, hie said be
would not stand it. In the meantime, the
-child was left witb tbe wife, and, altbougb
it is not mentioned in tbe report of the
committee, a lawsuit was entered for alhmony a year after tbey separated, and the
judge granted Mrs. de Martigny an allowance of $75 a montb, wbicb, the following
year, was increased to $125 a montb. Suddenly this man feit some kind of regret that
his cbild sbould be left in sucb bad company as that of bis former wife and tbe
mnan wbom be accused of living witb bier,
and hie took an action in tbe Superior Court
in Montreal to bave tbe cbild restored to

Tbat was one éondition that was neyer

of living witb a paramour.
And wbo are tbe witnesses who are
brougbt to prove that this woman was living with this man? Wben you read it
over you are struck witb tbe kind of
testimony wbicb tbey gave. An old man,
eighty-four years of age, testified that
hie was tbe janitor of the building in wbich
these people lived, and that he knew Mrs
De Martigny quite well and thought that
the man living witb ber was ber hu»band.

it would be the duty of the judge to appoint a lawyer to defend her. It is the
duty of the judge to use all possible means
to get at the truth and to provide for the
defence which she is probably not in a
position to make for herself. At any rate,
so far as I am concerned, I will certainly
not take the responsibi.lity of voting in
favour of this divorce. I make these remarks simply because I am convinced that
there is not the slightest evidence to justify the granting of the divorce.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
gentlemen, as Chairman of the Committee
I suppose I should make a few remarks for
the purpose of pointing out the course
taken by the committee and the reason why
committee has recommended the
the
divorce. The mover and the seconder of
this motion are apparently very solicitous
that thie divorce should not be granted.
They knew, or should have known, that it
was being applied for. Apparently they
knew that there was some talk in the city
of Montreal in reference to these parties,
who evidently had been before the courts on
various occasions. That being so, I think
it was the duty of the honourable- gentlemen to appear before the committee and
mention some of the facts which they now
state. It is also quite evident that the
respondent did believe that the facts set
forth in the petition were true. She was
served with the
petition;
she - was
given
notice.
She
is
a
woman
of intelligence, as I understand; and,
not only that, but she bas apparently been
in court before. and knew that it would be
necessary for her to put forward a defence.
Yet we find that the respondent did not see
fit to appear before the committee; and,
not having appeared before the committee,
then, according to the usual rules of the
courts, she admits that the statements contained in the petition are true. And I
venture to say that either of the honourable gentlemen who have just spoken, on
reading that petition, will come to the conclusion that there 1s quite sufficient in it,
if the facts stated there are true, to grant
the divorce.
Now, what are the facts? The petitioner
swears to a certair statement of facts. He
says that this respondent admitted to him
that she had committed adultery. Then
we have the evidence of the man who was
in charge of the elevator. He says that
this respondent and Mr. Perry lived as man

29'

and wife in that apartment; they lived
there for a period of eleven months. We
have the evidence of a seamstress who was
there; she saw them living there, and the
place was conducted just as an ordinary
place would be by a husband and wife
living together. There is also the evidence,
of the servant-I have forgotten her name.
I have not the evidence bèfore me, and I
an just spèaking from recollection. But
she also swore that they were living there
together and that this Mr. Perry was supposed to be Mr. De Martigny, and that the
people about the place so understood.

exists, as it did here, these people living
together as they were living what more
do you require? They were living there
openly. The apartment was rented by
this man Perry and occupied by him for
about eleven months, and this woman was
living there with him. Everyone thought
she was his wife. That being so, I say that
the evidence on which the Committee acted
was quite sufficient on which to recommend
a divorce, and I further say if honourable
gentlemen outside of the mover and the
seconder who have just spoken and who
say that there is not sufficient evidence,
will read that petition without any bias
and consider the evidence in the same way
as the Committee considered it, they can
come to no other conclusion, as men who
have ordinary intelligence and who understand the mode of life, than that it was a
proper case-in which to grant a divorce.
Take, for instance, the statement made
by the honourable mover of the motion that

who are, according to the honourable
gentleman's statement, living in open
adultery. Is it not very much better
for the morals of the people in that section
of the country, and for the morals of the
two couples, that a divorce should be
granted? Instead of living an immoral
life, as they are now doing, is it not better
that they should be placed-in a position in
which they may live a moral life? That of
course is not the ground on which divorces
are granted, but I eay that whep you have,
as we thought we had, sufficient evidence
on which to grant a divorce, you eau take

these other facts into consideration and in
that way uphold, and, I think, uphold
fairly, the action of the Committee.
The Comrnittee, so far as I amn aware,
knew nothing of these parties, until the
evidence was placed before them, and tbey
dealt with the evidence, I think, fairly and
with due regard to what.they believed was
their duty as members ef the Committee
entrusted with the hearing of divorce
petitions, and with due regard to ail the
circurnstances with which they must deal
in such cases; and I would ask the hoel
ourable gentlemen in the House, who have
no doubt read over the evidence, to form
the samne opinion that the Comrnittee
forrned and to uphold the action of the
Committee in dealing as they have done
with this particular case.
Hon. Mr., TESSIER: Honourable gentlemen, I do not like to interrupt the honourable member, but I cannot allow to pass
without protest his rernark that I was prejudiced in this matter. Let me tell the
honourable gentleman that I do not know
these parties at ail. I neyer knew thern.
I neyer heard a word about this case before.
The parties do not belong to rny city. I
forrned rny opinion only upon reading the
evidence, aud upon nothîng else. I have no
right to speak again, but 1 cannot at ail
agree with the honourable gentleman's interpretation of the evidence, and 1 arn quite
sure that if honourable members will takc
the trouble to read it carefully, they will
not corne to the conclusion that hie bas
stated, but will come to the conclusion that
T have reacbed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, I have heard the Chairman of the
Cornrittee on Divorce, and if there is a
good reason for throwing out this Bill, it
is his speech. He has not brought before
us one tittle of evidence that adultery has
been committed. He could not swear hlmself, if hie were put in the witness box, that
adultery bas been comrnitted, and I understand that divorces are granted according
to the evidence. I may say that I read this
evidence and was surprised that the divorce
was granted. The only tirne that I went
to the Divorce Committee was when Mr.
W. C. Lighthall, K.C., appeared as counsel
in a case. I do not know who the parties
were. It seemed to me the clearest case
that could possibly be made out, and I said
to hirn, "The divorce will certainly be
granted," but the divorce was refusedwhy? Because hie could not produce witnesses to testify that adultery had been

And in this case the -House is
asked to approve of a divorce. It la an
ex parte case: the Chairman admits that.
The lady in the case was nlot representeddid nlot appear in person or by counsel.
Therefore the Committee should be ail the
more careful. Does the Committee not
think that there inay have been collusion
between the husband and wife to be separated? In the twenty years I have been a
member of this House, I have always understood that when there was collusion the

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There was no

The honourable gentleman who has
moved the motion against the third reading of this Bill said that the husband was
in the sarne predicament as the wife-that
hie was living with some'body else-that
they were alike. Well, if they were alike,
leave them together. "Birds of a feathér
flock together."
Hon. Mr. WATSON:

No, separate thern.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have read the
proceedings in this case with the greatest
of care, and I have flot seen one single
phrase to prove the adultery. Every witness said the respondents were living like
man and wife, but when the question was
asked whether they were ever caught even
in a compromising position, there was nothing of the sort. It is usual to accept the
report of the Comrnittee which has heard
the parties, but in this case the Committee
did not hear the parties; they heard only
one party. I really believe that this divorce
should not be granted on the grounds
stated. To grant it would be contrary to
the practice that has been followed for the
period of more than twenty years that I
have been in this House, and I for one,
if there is a vote, will certaînly vote against
granting this divorce.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Boyer was negatived, on division.
The Senate divided on the motion for
the third reading of the Bill, and the sarne
was carried on the following division:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED niva
the second reading cf Bill 59,,à Aâ,'reèàspecting a certain Agreement bet,'ýien '
ada and certain cf His Majesty's colonies
in the West Indies.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
bas te do with a treaty, known as the
Treaty of 1920, recently entered into between Canada and the West Indies. Long
previeus te Confederation Canada traded
with the West Indies. Our trade relations
with the West Indian Islands have always
been a feature cf Canadian trade, particularly that section of trade wihich relates te
the Maritime Provinces. Previous te 1897,
Canada at its own expense maintained
steamship transportation between our ports
and those cf the West Indies. In 1897
we extended te the West Indian Islands a
trade preference; and we not only did
that, but we continued te, maintain the
steamship transportation. In 1912 it was
thought desirable that if at ail possible a
treaty should be negotiated between the
West Indian Islands and our country, and
thiat we should have clearly defined «trade
relations with those islands. Consequently,
in that year the Government of Canada
entered into a trade agreement with 'them
under which we subsidized lines cf steamships te ply between our ports and theirs,
and by whieh we contipuied te extend to
them a trade preference; they extéllding
te us in return a preference cf 20 per
cent. Unfortunately this particular agiement did not; include ail the West Iiidies,

there should be a more definite treaty, of Bermuda have signified their willingness

upon a proposition of that character.
Canada already has improved its steamship service between Maritime Province
ports and- the ports in the West Indies
with which we are trading. We are contributing a substantial subsidy to the
maintenance of that steamship servite;
but the opinion is that, with the assistance
of the West Indian Islands and the« substantial contributions which they'purpose
making to an improved steamship service,
we may look forward to having at a very
early day a service that will far exceed
in volume and efflciency the service which
we have enjoyed in the past.
Upon page 5 of the Bill honourable
gentlemen will observe a statement as to
the contributions which will be made by
the different West Indian Islands to this
eteamship service.
For instance, Barhadoes will contribute not less than £5,000;
Bermuda, nlot less than £2,000; British
Guiana, not less than £7,500.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Bermuda is nlot
contributing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Bermuda is, not at present, but at some time
may contribute to the steainship service.
I see no good reason why Bermuda should
nlot do so, because there is nothing to -prevent our trading with Bermuda, notwithstanding the fact that that Island has not
entered into the treaty.
The Leeward.
Islands propose te contribute not less than
£2,500; Trinidad, £7,500; the Windward
Islands, £2,500. 1 inay say that consideration is at the present time being given to
improving our steamship service with
those islands.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Are any of the
mercantile marine ships being used in this
service?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes;
we have established a very satisfactory
trade between Canada and the Islands with
those. ships. They have been doing a very
satisfactory trade wlth ail the West Indian
Islands, and I hope will, continue to do so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Are they
competing 'with our own subsidized lines?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,
-they are not competing.
I suppose it
mi*ght be said in a 'way, they are conipeting; but, competition being the life of trade,
I fancy the volume of trade has been very
largely increased by reason of our activitY
in building up trade routes with a couple
of linès of steamstlps.

30

The features which I 'have pointed out
to honourable gentlemen are, I think,
the cardinal -features of the Bill, and the
House will agree with me, 1 have no doubt,
that it is very desirable that we shouid
pursue the policy whie«h 'has very largely
developed our trade from before Confederation down to the present time, and which
every year is very substantially increasing
it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the
honourable leader of the Governuient if
Canada has any trade agents in those
different Islands?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, 1
think so.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Well, I know we
have nct in Bermuda, because I happened
to be there when this treaty was rejected,
and I was informed by several very
prominent Canadians there that they
thought the Canadian -Government were
neglecting them; there was nobody then to
look after the txrade with the Island-nobody who could do anything in the way of
helping the trade relations between Bermuda and Canada. The position of Bermuda is probably a little different from
that of any of the other Islands, because
there is a tri-weekly service between New
York and Bermuda, and there are two very
large steamships in that service.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: A Mb-weekly service.
Hon Mr. MeMEANS: I think it is triweekly.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The steamer used
to leave every Wednesday and Saturday.
Maybe the sailings are changed.
Hoin. Mr. McMEANS:
The large
steamers are crowded with American people
going over to Bermuda, and they bring back
its produce, its early vegetables, to the city
of New York. I rwas toild that the reason
why the treaty was rejected in Bermuda
was that its people were afraid it might
prejudice their trade with the United
States, and they would like to seli ail the
goods they eau to the United States and
at the same time do business with Canada.
It does appear to me that the
Government are not f uliy alive to the situation; oVherwise they would aecede te the
request that a trade agent be appointed on
behaif of Canada, even if he receives no
salary. There are good Canadians thereHon. ýSir JAMES LOÛGHEED: Do you
kno-w 'where we can find any persons of
that kind?

SENATE

302

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes; I can give
the honourable gentleman the name of a
very staunch Canadian who is engaged in
business in Bermuda who told me of gentlemen who would accept a position without any salary if they could once get the
Canadian Government sufflciently interested in the Island and in -the trade that
might be done with Canada to appoint
somebody to look after that trade.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Will the hionourable gentleman wbo has just taken hîs
seat permit me to asýk him one question?
Hon. Mr. McMtANS: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How many white
people are there in Bermuda?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: About 8,000. 0f
course the traffic ibetween America and
Bermuda may be to a certain extent attributable to the fact that prohibition does
not prevail on the Island. StilI, the whole
Island is simply swarming with Americans,
who spend a great deal'of money.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Tbat was not
the cause of the lhonourable gentleman's
visit?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Well, not the recent one, but it may be in the future. I
have mentioned the point with regard to a
trade agent because I think it is really a
matter of importanice, and the people of
Bermuda would be very much pleased if
somne representative, even without salary,
were appointed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shal
be very glad to direct the attention of the
Minister of Trade and Commerce to wlhat my
honourable friend bas said.
For the 8,000
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
people.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, I would be very happy to support any
proposal or any movement to promote
profitable Canadian trade. My honourable
friend the leader of the House did not
go far enough back in the bistory of trade
between Canada and the West ladies. Prior
to the year 1834 preference was given by
the British Government to trade between
the provinces of Canada and the West
ladies. American goods could be imported
into the provinces of Canada, and sent fro~m
Canada to the West Iadies, enjoying there
a substantial preference; so that the trade
in our products and in those imporýted
from the United States could be carried
cn profitably with alI the West Indies.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGiHEED.

That preference was repealed in the year
1834 end the United States were then
allowed to export their productions to the
West Indian Islands and introduce them
there on exactly the saine ternis as goods
sent fTom the various provinces of Canada.
About ten years ago-1 think it was in
1912-the British preference was given. It
was thought, that the preference being
given to West Indian products in Canada
would resuit in a large benefit being
received by the people of Canada, particularly in the cheapening of sugar, which is
sent from the West Indian Islands. What
was the fact? Sugar produced in San
Domingo and somne other Islands-Cuba,
and Porto Rico, now belonging to the
United States--was at a much lower rate
than the sugar from a British Island. What
did the London syndicate do which handled
the products of Trinidad, Demerara and
somne o'ther West Indian Islands? They
immediately increased the enlarged price
of su-gar nearly to the value of the foreign
sugar and the duty; so that we were paying a very high price in this country and
were deprived of the benefit of the preference given by Canada. 1 believe that without preference a large portion of the sugar
imported into Canada could be bought in
Cuba, in Porto Rico and in San Domingo.
Now, with regard to the increase in the
gross amount of trade conducted between
the West Indian Islands and Canada,
please remember that the cost of sugar
'and other West Indian commodities is
more than doubled, a:nd the cost of our
productions sent out to the West Indian
Islands is more than doubled also; sa that
the vast increase wbich has been spoken
of by the Minister (Hon. Sir James Loug'heed), and on which hie congratulated himself, arose, not from the increase of the
volume of trade, but from the very much
higher prîces of the articles, both those
sent out and those received. In somne of
those islands-I tbink somne of them are
mentioned in the treaty-there are very few
white inhabitants and they do not look very
mnuch to Canada for foodstuffs; but the
large islands like Trinidad and Jamaica are
growing in population and in wants. Jamaica is restoring itself to its old prosperity
which it enjoyed in times long prior to our
recollection, when members of the nobility
of England lived there.
This brings me to the question of transportation. We have had a good deal of
money expended in Canada in building
ships and preparing them for this trade.

He said: We are minting for the people
of Canada some more money-a very much
needed article. It is proposed to substitute
for the present five-cent piece a nickel coin
which. I have no doubt will be more convenient, and from which the Government
of Canada will derive some profit. There
is also a clause in the Bill prohibiting the
melting down of gold or silver legal tender.
It goes without saying that, particularly at
this time, when exchange is very much
against us, this prohibition is desirable. It
is only recently that legislation bas been
passed in England prohibiting the melting
down of coin of the realm. During the
recent war legislation for that purpose was
passed in the United States, but that
legislation terminated shortly after the
war ceased. In Great Britain, however,
the legislation placed upon the statute
book continues to be enforced, and it is
proposed that we should enact similar
legislation in Canada, and enforce it as
best we know how. It may be of interest
to honourable gentlemen to point out that
the nickel five-cent piece that we propose
issuing is of pure nickel, and will differ
from the nickel coin issued in the United
States, which is composed partly of nickel
and partly of copper. The superiority of
the pure nickel piece is quite recognized.
Furthermore, it may be pointed out that
in an issue of say five million coins, as
between silver and nickel, there will be a
profit to the Government of $52,562.50,
accepting the price of nickel and the price
of silver as they are quoted to-day.
Further, the new coin will be more convenient than the present one. These are
the two features of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend has spoken of the profit on the proposed five-cent coin. I should have thought
that the present five-cent piece would be
the more profitable coin for the Government, because I think every honourable
gentleman who bas handled them bas had
the experience of losing many of them, and
I think they disappear from circulation
very easily.
' Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
can lose the nickel in the same way.

You

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think the Government has made considerable profit on its
coinage, but the remarks of my honourable
friend indicate that he thinks there is a
great deal more profit to be made from the
nickel five-cent piece than from the silver
coinage. I understood that last Session or
flon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

the Session before we degraded the currency so as to enable the Government to
make a profit on their coinage; so I presume they are making such profit to-day,
and therefore the question of profit would
not enter exactly into this matter. I think
it would be very interesting if, at the Committee stage, my honouratle friend would
let us see the dies of this new coin, or let
us know what it is going to be like when
it is struck. Three years ago we passed an
Act changing the one-cent piece, and the
coin that the Government is now issuing
is one that I do not think we can be very
proud of; it is very small, and personally
I do not like it nearly as well as the old
one-cent piece, though I understand some
people prefer it on account of its being
smaller than the old one. I understand
there has been great objection to the onecent piece from its being very often mistaken for the ten-cent piece. I suppose
that nickel has proved to be a thoroughly
good metal for the purpose of coinage, but
I presume the new coin will be a great deal
thicker than the present five-cent piece, and
I should have thought some objection might
be made to it by tramway companies and
various other organizations which use it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
be the same size as the United States
nickel.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But the tramway
companies in this country have certain receptacles for the present five-cent piece.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
will have to adjust the slot in the box to
take the new one.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The Government's
own machines for selling stamps will also
have to be adjusted in the same way, and
it might be interesting to know what that
is going to cost the country. For myself, I
would very much like to see this coin that
is going to be struck, because I am not in
favour of the American five-cent piece; it
is not a good coin, from what I have seen
of it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It will be just a
mere token; it will not represent five cents
in value; it will have a fictitious value.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
be legal tender fo, payments up to five
dollars, and there will be nothing fictitious
about it. If you can get enough of them
you will be very well off.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into committee on Bill 72,
an Act to amend the Winding-up Act.
Hon. Mr. Laird in the chair.
On section 1-liquidator to
statement of assets and debts:

prepare

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
this Bill came up for consideration in
Committee of the Whole on Friday last the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) pointed out that in section
33A there was no instruction to the liquidator as to what ,he should do with the
statement which he is obliged to prepare
within sixty days. Honourable gentlemen
will see that new section 33A, when read
by itself, would naturally suggest that
question; consequently we allowed the
mattei- to stand over in order to ascertain
what the liquidator would do with the
statement. We omitted to look lower down
in the Bill, if we had done so we would
have found that the statement referred to
in the new section which was then under
consideration had to be sent to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. The object of
this Bill is purely statistical. It is desirable that the Dominion Statistician should
have full information as to all the subjects
eriumerated in the Bill; consequently it is
unnecessary to further adjourn the consideration of this Bill because the question
is fully answered there. I therefore move
the adoption of section 1. .
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I presume that
does not prevent anybody else from getting
a copy of that statement if desired?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: What about the
creditors?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It has
nothing to do with the creditors; it is
merely for statistical purposes.

Britsh Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island?
2. Has the Dominion paid any interest or
coupons on any of the above mentioned -securities in lieu of the Provinces?
3. If so, what amount has been paid, namilg
the provinces and the amount in each case?
4. Have any of the Provinces paid any interest or coupons on securities guaranteed on
the railways within their boundarles?
5. If not, why not?
6. Is It the intention of the Dominion Government to saddle Canada with these provincial
obligations?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHElID:
1. See Page x et seq. of Railway Statistics for the year ended June 30, 1919.
(Sessional Paper No. 20B, 1920).

JUDGES BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
60, an Act to amend the Judges Act. Hon.
Mr. Mitchener in the Chair.
On section 1-section 11 of chapter 56 of
statutes of 1920 not to apply to present
Chief Justice:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Explain.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I explained to the House on the second reading
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We would like
to hear the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We want to
give you another chance.
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
application of it is this. As honourable
gentlemen will doubtless recall, when the
Judges Bill passed this House, I think
at the last Session of Parliament, the honorarium-I supose we had better call it
that-given to the Chief Justice in his
capacity as Deputy Governor was $5,000.
It was proposed that this should be included with his salary and that hereafter
there should not be a distinct honorarium
paid to the Chief Justice for the performance of those duties; that in his capacity as Chief Justice he should discharge
the duties of Deputy Governor.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That was last
year?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
He 'had been, previous to that, in receipt
of practically a $15,000 salary; that is to
say, $10,000 as Chief Justice and $5,000
as Deputy Governor. The impression preHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

vailed that it was not the intention to maks
the income tax applicable to the salaries
which the judges received previous to that
date; consequently this $15,000 was exempted from the income tax. During the
present Session, after the Bill had been
introduced to exempt the whole amount
from the income tax, the question was
raised in the House of Commons, and the
impression there was that the $5,000 had always ibeen liable to the income tax, and
therefore should not be- exempted as part
of the entire salary paid to the Chief
Justice. I need scarcely point out, honourable gentlemen, that no good purpose
is served by discussing this matter in its
different aspects, inasmuch as it is
peculiarly a money Bill, which we in this
House could not very well interfere with.
At least it comes under the class of money
Bills.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We could reject
it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We could
reject the whole Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we could
reduce the amount as well.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no; we could
reject it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: However, I do not think the Senate would
assume to amend a money Bill of this
class; and of course a reduction of it
would be an amendment of it. And I do
not think there is any disposition to reduce the salary of the Chief Justice of
Canada below the amount fixed, which is
not an over-generous salary for so important an office. That is the explanation
of this clause. It simply exempts his salary as it was always exempted-that is,
the $10,000-from taxation, and it makes
the $5,000 liable to it.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Why does it
apply to the gentleman who holds the position rather than to the office itself? Why
name Sir Louis H. Davies? Supposing he
died to-morrow and we had a rlew Chief
Justice, would it be necessary again to
amend the Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was just
going to put that same question. Is it the
intention to free from the income tax the
emolument accruing to the Chief Justice,
whatever his name?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
legislation of last Session may be suscep-

APRIL 27, 1921
tile to this interpretation, that, the $5,000
having constituted an increase in the salary of the Chief Justice, therefore, under
section 11, as it is at present framed, the
incoming Chief Justice, accepting the position under the provisions of that section,
would have hie whole salary liable to taxation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So this legislation simply applies to the present Chief
Justice?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: And a future
appointrnent would fail under the general
Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, it
would fail under the general provision of
the statute.
Hou. Mr. CAS GRAIN: The judges do
not pay any income tax?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Under the, legisiation hast year, if they aqcept the increased salary, then their whole
salary apparently becomes liable to the incorne tax.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But on the former saiary they dld not pay it?
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: No, not
before that.
Was the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
$5,000 which the Chief Justice received previously to the legisiation of last year as
Deputy Governor General hiable to the incorne tax?
Hon. gir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that it had not been taxed, but
it was liable to the tax, and therefore it
remains liable to the tax under the new
conditions.
But it has
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
been replaced by the increase.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It has been
cancelled. The present Chief Justice cannot receive $5,000 as Deputy Governor,
but it has been replaced by this increase
in his salary from $10,000 to $15,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
but lie performs the duties of Deputy Governor in connection with his office, and
therefore, with respect to the rnoneye received by hirn, made up of salary and of
the emolument paid to the Deputy Governor, 'the position of the Chief Justice is
to-day precisely what it was previous to
S-20à

that legisiation, the intention being that
it should not be disturbed-that he should
enjoy whatever emolument he received
farrnerly.
Hon. Mr,. CAS GRAIN: I supp6se the
honoura*6le leader of the Government could
not tell us how that $5,000 was initiated?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, but
perhaps rny honourable friend can. Can he?
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2«was agreed to.
On section 3-when judges not to be
paid travellhing expenses:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I desire
to move an amendment which I think will
cover the point raised by the honourable
gentleman frorn King's and Albert (Hon.
M1r. Fowler). In fact, this amendment is being made at the instance of the Minister of
Justice, who has given full consideqration
to its application: It is proposed on page
1, line 28, after the word "thereof," to insert the following words: "or unlees he be
the judge who linder the authority of the
laws of the province resides at Moncton."'
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Moncton?
Hon. Sur JAMES -LOUGHEED: Yes;
owing to some special legislation it is apparently necessary to make that particular condition.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What will be the
effect of that exactly?
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: He resides at MonctonHon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
And he gets
travelling expenses?
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: He docu
not reside at St. John; consequently if he
goes to St. John he will be entitled to hi&
travelling expenses; but he would not be
entitled to travelling expenses in performing hie judicial duties at Moncton.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I gave notice of an arnendment that
I would move to this Bill that is now before you. I think I can explain the amendment -in very few words. The Dominion
appoints the judges for the Superior and
County. Courts. The provinces themselves
constitute the courts.
Now, the greater
part of the work of the judges is of course
prescribed in the statutes of the different
Provinces conetituting the courts. If there
je in any one province any civil matter

SENATE
that involves a dispute, it can be transferred to any of the courts, either the
Supreme Court or the County Court, and
the judges of those courts would deal with
it. Outside of the work that is assigned to
the judges by the Acts constituting the
courts, there is a sort of floating liability
of the judges to do certain things. That
is to say, the Governor General in Council can call upon a judge of any one of the
courts to act as an arbitrator or as an umpire.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Or commissioner.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Or commissioner. That
is one liability. We are not concerned
with that to-day. But by the statute that
we passed in 1920 we also gave power t.
the Lieutenant Governors in Council to use
Dominion judges in the very same way. If
there is some dispute about a road commission or about expenditure upon a highway,
or any matter of that kind, the Lieutenant Governor in Council can refer it to
one of the judges. My own opinion, and,
so far as I can ascertain it, the opinion
of the Bar, of the judges themselves, and
of the general public, is that calling upon
the judges to leave the regular work of the
courts and to go out and become involved
in what are, after all, political squabbles,
is working irreparable damage to the standing of our courts and to the confidence of
the general public in them. There was in
Nova Scotia an investigation in connection with a highway-a very nasty scandal;
I should say, one of the worst that bas
ever occurred in Canada. One of the judges
of the Supreme Court Was called to act
as a commissioner in connection with an
investigation in that matter. It is impossible for a judge to get into a matter
of that kind and not become involved in
a political fight, no matter what way he
rules. If he rules for one side, the other
side accuse him of being partisan, and so
on, and the inquiry is made, " What Government appointed him?" and " Whom was
he seen walking with?" It is altogether a
degrading thing, and, more than that, it
is throwing the work of the courts into
Our judges have to go on a
confusion.
circuit. There is a Supreme Court that sits
at Halifax; we call it the court sitting
en banc. Then twice a year they go out
over the province. The circuits have to be
arranged weeks ahead. If the Lieutenant
Governor in Council can come in and demand the services of one of these judges
to investigate a petty political squabble, the
whole circuit is thrown out of gear.
Hon. W.

B.

ROSS.

I am simply asking now that this section 34, which gives that power to the
in Council, be
Lieutenant Governor
amended by striking that out. These are
the words of the section:
Every judge who may be nominated for the
purpose by the Governor in Council or the
Lieutenant Governor in Council shall execute
without additional remuneration any commission or enquiry for which he may be appointed
as commissioner under any authority in that behalf exercisable by the Governor in Council or
the Lieutenant Governor in Council, including
the discharge of the duty of arbi-trator in any
case in which he may be named to act by competent authority.

My amendment is to strike out the words
"Lieutenant Governor in Council." That
would leave the judges, -who are appointed
by the Dominion, still at the disposal of
the Governor in Council. If the Lieutenant
Governors in Council in the provinces have
squabbles that they want to have settled,
they can get leading counsel or laymengood police magistrates or stipendiary
magistrates-to sit as arbitrators and try
those matters. There is no reason on earth
why they should call upon the judges of the
Supreme Court. That is the whole amendment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman, is it mandatory?
Are the judges obliged to act?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: They have to act, as
the statute reads now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They have to act
without pay, and they cannot decline?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whether the honourable gentleman has ex.
plained why he would leave the power of
appointing to such commissions to the Governor General in Council and not to the
Lieutenant Governor.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If I could strike out
both, I would; but I think half a loaf is
better than no bread.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But is not the
principle the same?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The objection is
I regard

whether the Governor General in Council
shall continue to have this power to appoint judges under these conditions can ne
discussed in the future; but I think it would
,be helpful to go as far as this; and,
although I am prepared to vote to take this
power from the Govenor General in Council, I say let us take one thing at a time
and deal with the Lieutenant Goverrors in
Council first.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why does the
honourable gentleman feel that he could
go that far in the present Parliament
while if he attempted to go further he
would fall down?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Because I fell down
last year. I do not want to fall down
again.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A burnt
child dreads the fire.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I .should like to ask
my honourable friend whether, even if his
suggestion carries, it would not be open to
the Governor General in Council at the
instance of the Lieutenant Governor in
Council to make an appointment.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would ask
the leader of the Government to be kind
enough to look at the second page of the
Bill. It provides in the case of Saskatchewan:
No judge of the Court of Appeal or of the
Court of King's Bench shal receive any travel-ling allowance for courts or chambers held at
the city of Regina.
Then in the last two or three lines it
says:
Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall
affect a judge's right to receive travelling allowances if he reside at a place at which he la
by order of the Governor In Council required
to reside.
The specific thing that I want to bring

Supreme Court resident in Moosejaw. At
the time of his appointment it was in-

tended that he should reside in Moosejaw.
There is another judge who will be a
resident of the city of Saskatoon, I believe. I do nat know technically what
takes place in the appointment of a judge
if he resides in the place in which by the
order of the Governor in Council he is required to reside. I fancy his patent, or
whatever it is, names the place rather than
I

think this is only contemplating the case
in which subsequent to the appointment of

the judge the Governor in Council for
good reasons sees fit to direct a place of
residence other than the capital. If that
were the case of a judge who was resident
in Moosejaw, and who resided there at the
time of his appointment, he would be precluded from getting his fees and per diems.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask the honourable gentleman if the judges
to whom he has referred would not come
within the last four lines? I think they
would. I am assuming that if they are
residing respectively in Moosejaw and Saskatoon, they are doing so by virtue of an
Order in Council. They should be residing
there under some authority.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not know
whether that authority would be given by
the patent of appointment or by an Order
in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
suggest to my honourable friend that be
would have ample time to inquire of the
Department of Justice before the third
reading of the Bill? ,
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not know that
what bas been said is applicable to the
amendment. I thought that the honourable
(Hon. Mr.
gentleman from Moosejaw
Willoughby) was going to speak to the
amendment.
I do not think there is the slightest possibility of any public inconvenience, not to
say public wrong, being done by the amendment, because, as I pointed out, the provinces constitute the courts in the way they
want them, and if there is anything like
a recurrent dispute they can assign that
to the court, and it can be taken up by a
judge of the court who is discharging the
duties of that court in the regular ternm.
It is part of his work. As I mentioned,
the local Government of Nôva Seotia
appointed a judge on a road commission and
there bas been a commission of two judges
sitting in Ontario, and anyone who bas read
the papers can see quite well that what is
going on before those two judges is not for

their edification, and is not going either to
exalt or keep unimpaired the high standing of the judges.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is a Commission in Manitoba too.

Hon.

Mr.

PROUDFOOT: The

great

objection I see to the clause as it stands
is that permission is practically given to

SENATE
the judges to sit as arbitrators. In the
province of Ontario, where I understand the
situation pretty thoroughly, we have two
Commissions sitting at the present time.
Two judges of the Supreme Court are
engaged on one Commission which is dealing with a question more or less of a
political nature, or at least which is so
regarded by one of the political parties of
the Province. The result is that the judges
have been very severely criticized, and
criticized in such a way that in my opinion
the efficiency of those judges may be very
much impaired. We have another judge
sitting on a Commission for the purpose of
taking evidence in connection with the
Hydro. Thus three of the judges of the
Supreme Court of Ontario are tied up. The
Supreme Court of Ontario is composed, I
think, of nineteen judges. There are two
Courts of Appeal-one called the First
Divisional Court, the judges of which are
permanent, and the Second Divisional
Court, which is composed of five judges who
are picked out from the remaining fourteen
judges, and who sit for a year and are
then replaced by five other judges. You
will observe that three or four judges are
tied up on these Commissions; the vacancy
created by the death of the late Sir Glenholme Falconbridge has not yet been filled,
and another justice of the Supreme Court
has been ill for a matter of several months;
so that there are five judges of that Court
who are not actually carrying on their
judicial duties at the present time. What
is the result? The business of the Court
is very much congested. The only way, in
my opinion to overcome the present situation is to provide, not only in the interest
of the public so far as the business of the
courts is concerned, but in the interest of
the judges themselves, that judges shall not
be appointed to act on commissions. I
would therefore ask my honourable friend
to amend his motion in that way.
Dealing with the amendment as it stands,
I do not think it will cover all that my
honourable friend intends it to cover, because
by striking out the words in lines 2 and 3
you only accomplish half your object,
because in lines 6 and 7 the same words are
repeated, and I think they also should go.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The words " Lieutenant Governor in Council" ought to be
struck out, not only in the first line, but
wherever they occur in the section.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I thought that
was what you intended.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Strike
out the whole section.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: We ought to
go a little further even than that, because
if you strike out the whole of subsection
2 you leave it optional with the judges to
accept appointments as arbitrators or
commissioners, as the case may be, which
would leave the law as it was previous
to the time this section was inserted. I want
to go a step further and place the judges
in such a position that they will not be
bound to accept appointments as arbitrators or commissioners, even if they are
willing.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Does not the last
clause of the statute preclude the judges
from acting?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Oh, no, I do
not think so. They have always had the
right to act as commissioners if they saw
fit.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, no; that is
why this Act was passed.
It is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
to give them the right.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: This does not
do away with the right they had, but it
prevents them taking remuneration.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I
think they are forbidden to act in any
capacity other than a judicial capacity. I
think the honourable gentleman is mistaken.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I may be mistaken, but I would like to see the authority
for that.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: What the honourable
gentleman states to be so was the case;
then there was an Act which allowed them
to take pay and travelling expenses; then
that was cut down so that they could not
take anything except travelling expenses.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Then I would
ask the honourable gentleman to let this
matter stand over until I have an opportunity of looking into it. I do not agree
wirth my honourable friend, and the reason
I make my statement so emphatically is
that as far back as I can remember the
judges in the province of Ontario have
been in the habit of acting as arbitrators
and commissioners when they saw fit; and
not only that, but they were paid for so
acting. We all remember that a short
time ago Sir William Meredith acted as
an arbitrator in connection with a railway matter; and be was paid for his ser-

APRIL 27, 1921
vices. I am not particularly concerned with
the matter of the pay; I am considering the
position the judges are placed in and the
position of the public.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If this question is
going to stand until to-morrow, we need
not say very much about it to-day. But
the position was this. There was a time
when the Governor in Couneil could put
a judge on a commission and pay him.
Then, after the Laurier Government came
into power, the salaries of the judges were
increased, and there was a provision put
in the Act prohibiting them from acting in
other than a judicial capacity. That provision was in its turn cut down by another
statute which allowed them to act and to
take pay if they were appointed by the
Governor in Council or the îLieutenant
Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: My honourable friend will notice that subsection 2
does not give direct authority to the judges
to art. It says: "Every judge who may
.
be nominated."
' Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, then it says
he shall act.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It does not
say he shali act. It says: "He shall execute
without any additional remuneration."
Hon. W. B. ROSS (reading): "Every
judge who may be nominated for the purpose by the Governor in Council or the
Lieutenant Governor in Council shall
execute without additional remuneration.*'
He shall do it: he bas no choice. That is
the question that came up in Nova Scotia.
A judge refused to act, and the Governor
in Council said, "You have no choice," and
the matter was left to the court to decide,
and the full court decided that the judge
could not refuse.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What would be
the penalty?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Impeachment.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: When this fill
was up before, I intimated that I was going
to submit an amendment. In the first
place, I believe there may be many questions to be inquired into in which it is
particularly desirable that judges should
act. I am notone who believes that judges
should not act on commissions at all; but,
in view of the fact that the Dominion Government pays the judges and that such
matters may core up for discussion in
Parliament, I propose to move an amendment on this line:

311

That from and after the passing of this Act
a judge shall not act as a commissioner until
after permission shall have been granted by the
Minister of Justice; and further, that the Minister of Justice shall not grant such permission
until the Chief Justice of the Court of which
such judge is a member shail have certified in
writing that in his opinion the judicial business of such court wi.Il not be delayed or affected
by such judge accepting a commission to act
thereunder or continue to act on a commission
already issued.

In the first place, that puts it up to the
Minister of Justice of the day to say
whether or not a judge shall act on a commission. The Government of the day will
then be responsible to the public, and the
question of whether it was a commission
with which a judge should be entrusted
can be 'fairly discussed in either House.
I quite agree with what the honourable
gentleman from Goderich (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) has said as to the condition of affairs
in Ontario. I understand that some of the
judges are very elderly men, and the result
is that there is actually a shortage of
judges in the province, and I would gather
from the remarks of the honourable gentleman from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)
that a similar situation prevails in 'the
province of Nova Scotia. Not only for
political reasons, but also for the reason
that they are overworked, judges do not
wish to participate in these concerns. The
second clause of the amendment, if passed,

would have this result, that if a certain
judge were suggested, then the Chief
Justice of his court should say whether or
not that judge should go.
I quite agree with all that has been said
regarding the intervention of judges in certain commissions. There is no question that
in the province of Ontario the jûdges as a
whole have suffered from the participation
of certain judges in such inquiries, because
as a rule these inquiries have been political.
Take for instance what was known as the
timber scandal in Ontario, more popularly
known as the Gamey case. That case was
aired from one end.of the province to the
other. It i was discussed on every public
platform and in the public press, and, I
may say, there was not much regard paid
to the finding of the two judges who

what may be the opinion of the
public as to any findings that may be
brought down by the Commission. I do not
think it will be to the general benefit of
the judiciary of this province. I would
therefore move this amendment, seconded

SENATE
by the Honourable Mr. Bradbury, and the
two amendments might be taken into consideration to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman, before he sits down,
what happens if the Chief Justice himself
is called? I refer to the second part of his
amendment.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I would add to the
amendment, then, that in the event of the
Chief Justice being nominated, it should be
the senior judge in the province.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Better add it,
then.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to
the fact that by his amendment he places
the responsibility for the administration of
justice in a Province in the hands of the
Minister of Justice, who from his seat in
the other House will let the honourable
gentleman know that he is not charged with
the administration of justice in a province,
but that that duty devolves upon the Provincial Attorney General.
In asking for an adjournment the honourable gentleman has anticipated my own
suggestion. I intended suggesting that the
attorneys general of the provinces be asked
for their opinions regarding the proposed
amendment of my honourable friend from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross). We have
stayed our hand from curtailing the powers
of the Governor in Council because of the
representations of the Minister of Labour
that judges are welcomed as members of
boards of conciliation, and are insisted upon
by one of the parties. If that reason was
sufficient for refusing to amend the Act
so as to prevent the Governor in Council
from appointing a judge, it is possible that
we might hear from the provinces reasons
why we should stay our hand in their case
also. I recognize that there is considerable
to be said against the utilization of judges
on arbitration commissions, but we have
one case which bas been held to justify the
issuance of a commission by the Governor
in Council. Might not the provinces, which
are entrusted with the administration of
justice, claim that on the whole there was
considerable advantage in appointing men
from that serene sphere of the judicature
to preside over some cases? I have not many
in mind. However, it is possible that the
province might consider itself very much
handicapped by being prevented from calling upon judges to sit upon certain commissions, and I was wondering if in this
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

respect, when our action may have such a
far-reaching effect, it would not be well
to solicit from the attorneys general of the
Provinces an expression of their opinion as
to the advisability of curtailing the power
to call upon judges.
Everybody will recognize that in the
cases which have been mentioned the effect
will b to impair somewhat the prestige of
some of the judges; but the same argument
might apply to appointments made by the
Dominion Govetnment. The case has been
mentioned of a Chief Justice from Ontario
who took it upon himself to declare that a
block of Canadian Northern shares was
worth $16 a share. I think we should enact
a law requiring him to take those shares
at $1 each as an evidence of good.faith in
his valuation of them at $16.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, it seems to me that the
substitution of the Minister of Justice or
the Attorney General for the Governor in
Council is simply appealing from Coesar
drunk to Cæsar sober, or from Cæsar to
Cæsar, because the Minister of Justice will
not do anything that the Government does
not want done.
Mr. W. B. ROSS: Is it not rather from
Cæsar sober to Cæsar drunk?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
haps so.

Per-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Or vice versa.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
honourable member from Huron (Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot) voiced my feeling in the matter.
I have been asked by judges from Ontario,
in letters, to try to have a Bill passed to
prevent judges being called upon to act as
arbitrators, or to act in any other capacity
than that of judges.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Hear, hear.
Quite right.
We
Uon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
who practise in Ontario know that the
judges of the High Court, or the Supreme
Court, as it is now called, have sufficient
judicial business to keep them busy all
the time, and they have no time for commissions; and I am satisfied that they have
no inclination for them, as, the law. now
stands. Therefore, if my honourable friend
does not move it, I will to-morrow move
an amendment, that we strike out this
clause entirely and prohibit judges from
acting in any capacity except as judges,
or, as they do now, in performing duties

APRIL 27, 1921 '
under the provincial statutes as judges in
the surrogate court, as auditors of local
accounts, and such duties as are positively
outside of any controversial subject.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What would the
honourable gentleman say about judges
acting as professors in universities? It
was claimed-and a very strong case was
made out-that it was necessary to have
them.
b
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
that question.

This does not touch

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
So
far as I know, we have none in our province.
Having no experience, perhaps I can speak
without fear: I should not object to a
judge being a professor in a university.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I can understand that this is a matter with which
lawyers are most familiarHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

And surveyors.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: But the question has arisen in my mind: if, as my honourable friend has said, the judges in the
provinces were not permitted to act as commissioners, who would be appointed? Who
would do the work?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Other
persons.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That is not
very definite. I can understand how the
influence of the judges throug'hout the
Dominion might 'be impaired by their acting
as commissioners in some cases, and we
have certainly had instances in which this
has occurred. On the other hand, there is
no class of men in whom we have more
confidence that they will give an independent, unprejudiced opinion. It appears to
be right that the judges not only should
not be compelled to act, but should be compelled not to act; but it is a question in
my mind who in the provinces are to be
substituted for' the judges in these important cases?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: In reply to the last
speaker I might remind him that I pointed
out a little while ago that if a judical man
is wanted, there are men of very high
standing available in the stipendiary magistrates and men who are active at the Bar,
who are quite as good as, perhaps better
than, any judge. But, apart from that, it
may not be a purely judicial affair; and, as
a matter of fact, nearly ail these disputes
are questions not for a judge at all, but for

S1

an accountant, and the best arbitrator or
commissioner you could have would be a
good chartered accountant. And if you
want to assure the people that you have an
impartial man, you can go outside the province. For instance, Nova Scotia could
send over to St. John for a man who does
not know the local parties, or could send
up to Montreal. One of the things that
the judges complain of is that they are
put on these commissions and that they are
not fitted for them. Take, for instance, the
expenditure of hundreds of thousands of
dollars on a railway. It involves calculations with regard to cuts and fills, boulders,
bridgingHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Classification.
Hon. Mr. ROSS:-and things of that
sort. It is not fair to a judge to expect
him to deal. with them. A judge said to
me: "That is not my work and I am not
going to do it."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He calls in an
expert.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I want to say this to
the honourable gentleman who spoke of
striking out this clause altoget 1 er. It is
a clause that I have always objected to,
and I would be only too glad if we could
get it al taken out; but I would be very
much better pleased to get half of it out
this year than to have the whole of it left
in. If you pass an amendment here to
strike out the whole of that subsection 2,
you will find, what I found before, that
nothing will be done. I think there is a
fighting chance to get what I have asked
for. I have discussed this matter with
the honourable member for Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) and he has told me that he
looks forward to the time when the whole
of that clause will be taken out, and I
shall be only too glad if it iý.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, just a word with reference to
this matter. The attitude taken by this
House a year ago in endeavouring to amend
the Act in such a way that it would not
debar us from using the services of judges
on boards of conciliation under the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act was
deeply apprqciated. Notwithstanding that
the Act permits the Governor in Council
to appoint a judge, it does not permit the
Governor in Council to pay him for his
services. The result is that we have not
had judges serving on boards of conciliation for a year past. I have no hesitation
in saying that I think it was unfortunate.

14

SENATE

My honourable friend from Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross), I think, mentioned as
a reason for not making the change that
the labour men desired that judges should
be appointed to boards of conciliation. That
was not exactly the situation; but they
took the view that the recommendations of
judges as chairmen of boards did command respect and in many cases were
adopted by the workmen throughout the
country more readily than would be the
recommendations of laymen, who might be
charged with having more or less direct
interest in the subject under dispute. But,
inasmuch as we have not been able to use
judges in this capacity for the past year,
by reason of the difficulty in paying them,
and have had to resort to other gentlemen
as chairmen of boards, I desire to say that,
so far as the administration of the Industrial Disputes Act is concerned, I have
no objection now to the clause being wiped
out entirely, because we have had to get
along for a year without the judges and
I fancy we can continue to do so.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: One of the great
objections to the appointment of judges on
commissions is the fact that a great many
commissions are political or semi-political.
In the West we have had a great deal of
experience of judgds sitting on political
commissions, and I have no hesitation in
saying that it has taken away from the
bench to a very large extent the respect
to which they are entitled. I believe that
the amendment of the Judges Act arosq
chiefly from the fact that in Manitoba and, I
think, Saskatchewan, commissions were appointed by the local Government which
were political in their nature, and all the
commissioners were judges.
It needs no
argument to show that a commission that
has even the appearance of being political
is no place for a judge, and, if you do not
strike out that clause 'and prohibit the
judges from sitting on commissions, the
probabilities are that they will be appointed on every political commission that
is established.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would like
the mover of the amendment to be more
boldHon. W. B. ROSS: Well, I was going
to say that, after that statement from the
Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
I think we can go the whole way and ask
that all of subsection 2 be struck out. I
was trying to get as much as I could
without meeting with opposition from him,
because that is what blocked my former
Hon. Mfr. RIOBERTSON.

amendment. But now, if the honourable
member from Huron (Hon. Mr.' Proudfoot) will move to strike out the whole
of subsection 2, I shall be quite content
to withdraw my amendment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That would
entirely coincide with my view. I remember
the objections made to the proposed
amendment of the honourable member from
Middleton last year by some judges with
whom I had the honour of discussing the
measure. You are aware that in the former
Bill we went much farther in other respects than in the present one. One of
the clauses in the Bill of last year to which
judges took exception was that under
which theî were obligated to make a declaration as to their expenses. They thought
that was a reflection on the integrity of
the bench. But, in discussing the matter
with the judges, I found that they had
very little objection to the clause providing
that judges should not act on commissions.
There are undoubtedly certain matters in
which the judges will continue to act, under
the statutory powers of the various proThese will be necessarily nonvinces.
political. With the actual obligation imposed on them to act in such matters perhaps the present Bill would not interfere.
I know a little in practice too regarding judges acting on commissions. If you
could separate what might be called the
political inquiry from certain other independent inquiries that a judge could make,
it would be all right; but I do not know
where the line could be drawn by any
draftsman-how the political or semipolitical inquiry can be differentiated from
some inquiry in which a judge might engage, and I think the safe plan is to
abolish the whole thing.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, there is one thing I ought to mention, on account of something said by the
honourable Minister of Labour about not
being able to obtain the services of judges,
now that the judges are not paid. One of
the judges of a supreme court who spoke
to me about this statute showed me correspondence in which he was asked to act
as a commissioner for the Governor in
Council at a time when judges were paid
to act as commissioners, and in which it
was stated approximately what his pay

ernments of the Colonies being prepared on their
part to offer sudh facilities as may be practicable, both as regards sites and financial assistance.

Should it develop that instead of subsidized steamers the Government Mercantile Marine will do this steamship service,
as seemed rather probable from the remarks made by my honourable friend yesterday, I presume it means that the Government must go still further in the hotel
business than they have gone in connection
with the railways. I do not think that the
hotel business is an altogether profitable
or desirable one for the Government to be
engaged in. It is evident from article XII
that the Government had such an idea in
mind in the event of the Mercantile Marine instead of a subsidized line of steamships carrying on the business of transportation between Canada and those islands.
Another clause of the treaty deals with
the question of a cable. On page 9 we find:
Wlith a view to the further promotion of the
purposes of the Canada-West Indies Trade
Agreement of even date the representatives of
the Government of Canada and of the Colonies
named in the agreement will recommend for the
favourable consideration of their respective Governments that direct Bri.tish owned and British
cont'rolled cables should be laid as soon as
possible, without waiting for the termination of
the Agreement with the West Indian and
Panama Telegraph Company, to connect Bermuda with Bar'bados, Trinida)d, British Guiana,
the Windward Islands, the Leeward Islands,
and Turks Island or Jamaica.
The Government of Canada wi.ll institute inquiries as soon as practicable as to the possibility of arranging for the laying of such cables
and will communicate the results of these inquiries to the Governments of the Colonies.

That is in my opinion a very much more
reasonable thing for the Government to
undertake. I think that Canada and the
Empire generally have benefited very
greatly by the action that was taken years
ago by the Government with regard to the
Pacifie cable, keeping Canada in communication with Australia and New Zealand.
This provision is one that may be very
valuable, and I hope that the inquiries to
be made by the Government will result in
a cable being laid before many years have
passed.
May I draw the attention of the House
to another statement regarding trade with
the West Indies that is published in the
Weekly Bulletin of the Commercial Intelligence Service. Referring to the Islands
of St. -Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla, which
are part of the Leeward group, it is
pointed out:
Imports from Canada for the year 191.8 (1919
figures are not available) amounted to a littie
over $368,000, while those for the same period
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

from the United States amounted to over $569,000. A great deal of complaint ie made by many
of the prominent business men of these islands
that when inquiries concerning trade with the
islands have been made and replied to the Canadian firm making the inquiry tas replied,
courteously stati.ng that they are not ready for
export trade yet. This is unfortunate; for the
business men of the West Indian group have
never been in a more receptive state of mind
than they are at the present time for trade
with Canada. With the high rate of American
exchange and the somewhait uncertain service
from the United Kingdom, the Dominion never
had a better opportunity for getting control
of the trade in these islands if manufacturers
would only take the initiative and go after It.

I am very glad to see the Government
drawing attention to that condition of
things, because I have heard complaints
made in that way over and over again.
with referefence to trade with China, the
great complaint that has been made on
the Pacifie coast by people who realize
the large amount of business that could be
done between Canada and that èountry is
that manufacturers and others engaged in
trade do not seem to appreciate the necessity of their studying and ascertaining the
particular class of articles that is most
suitable, and that very often the articles
demanded have to be bought in the United
States, although they are shipped from
Canadian ports to China. If we are to have
the benefit of the present agreement it is
most necessary that manufacturers and
exporters in Canada should carefully
study the requirements of the trade and
attend properly to the orders they receive
and fdl1 them as promptly as possible.
There are other clauses about which we
might ask information of the Government
when we go into committee on this Bill. I
hope that in committee the honourable
leader of the Government will be able to
tell us exactly which of these islands have
really ratified the agreement and which of
them have so far not done so.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable gentlemen, a short visit to the West
Indian Islands by a non-trader is perhaps
no qualification to discuss a purely commercial problem with advantage to the
House. I am not going to discuss it at
length, but I made a short visit to those
Islands and was very much impressed with
the progress they were making during the
war: that was the time of my visit. We
all know that in the majority of the West
Indian Islands, those which are British
possessions and those which are not, the
staple production is sugar. When the war
broke out, the inability to get German beet
sugar furnished an immense stimulus to

APRIL 27, 1921
the development of the cane sugar industry.
Doubtless this industry is now beset with
certain difficulties, but I do not think that
in the proximate future the beet 'sugar of
Germany will again invade the European
markets as it did before. That was the
great competitor that put the West Indian
cane sugar grower out of business.
I have not a word of criticism to offer
with regard to the proposed treaty or
agreement between those Islands and Canada. I rose merely for the purpose of
saying a word in support of the honourable
leader of the Opposition that something
should be done towards the development of
trade via the Panama route. Our main
import, as I have said, from the West Indian' Islands, and from British Guiana is
sugar. We do bring in other commodities,
but that, I think, is the largest, not only
in value, but also in bulk. At present we
have a refinery, I think, in Vancouver. It
is using raw sugar from Hawaii and to
some extent from China and the Philippines. I do not know what is the distance
from Vancouver to Hawaii, but from San
Francisco it is nearly 2,100 miles, and it
must be several hundred miles farther from
Vancouver. My own opinion on it is not
worth anything; but one of the matters
of discussion when I was in the West Indian Islands was the possibility of bringing
their spgar via the Panama route to Vancouver and having it filter from there into
the Western Provinces. It was considered
quite feasible to do that. If you bring
sugar to Halifax or Montreal, the two great
refining centres in Eastern Canada, you
still have the long rail haul of 1,500 miles
from Montreal to the middle of the prairies,
and if the sugar is shipped as far as the
Rockies you must add 600, 700 or 800 miles
more. It would seem to a layman unposted, as I confess I certainly am, that it
would be cheaper to take the sea route
from those Islands to Vancouver and then
haul inward for 600, 700, 800 or 1,000
miles, which would reach away into the
province of Saskatchewan.
There are other products that could be
shipped in. Fruits are exorbitantly dear
on the prairies. I am not saying that for
the purpose of quarrelling with the prices
particularly, but they are exorbitantly
dear. Anybody who has lived there realizes
it.
Now, nearly all the West Indian
Islands, and all of those at which the boat
calls, export fruit to some extent, some
of them in very considerable quantities.
bring from those Islands fruit
We scould

and sugar and rice and many other commodities, and we could send back the products not only of British Columbia but
also of the prairies. They want to import
lumber, the class of lumber that is not
grown in those semi-tropical countries,
which grow hardwoods. They are great
importers of meat ahd of butter. They do
not make their own butter. The cream
they use down there is to a very large
extent condensed cream, a great deal of
it produced in Canada., From the prairies
and from British Columbia we could ship
a fair amount of return cargo, and I
believe a line of communication between the
Pacific Coast and British Guiana, in particular, and Trinidad, and perhaps Barbados, and connecting with the other Islands,
would prove quite as profitable as our line
to Australia. The line to Australia is not
owned by the Government, it is true. It
is owned, 'I think, in New Zealand as a
matter of fact, and is operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. I think
that the people of the prairies would be
very glad indeed to see the Government
make inquiries to determine if it is not
feasible to extend to the Pacific also the
agreement for transatlantic shipment.
Theie was a word said about trade agents
the other day, when we had this subject
up last. I do not think we have many
trade agents in the West Indian Islands.
I know there is one stationed in Bridgetown, Barbados, a very competent man. He
told me himself, for I had the pléasure of
calling upon him many times and talking
of the matter, that he had visited both the
Windward Islands and the Leeward Islands,
and, I think he said British Guiana, but I
am not sure as to that. The potentialities
of British Guiana were very great indeed.
The potentialities of Trinidad were very
important. With those of Jamaica, which
is nearer to Canada, we are more familiar.
I should be very pleased indeed, as I said
a moment ago, if the Government would
open negotiations-informal, it may beperhaps absolutely informal in the beginning-to see what could be done in the
way of developing a trade via the Panama
route.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable
gentlemen, it seems to me that this matter
of a treaty with the West Indian Islands
is a move in the right direction; but I
think it would be well for us to have a
little more information on the subject than
we have at the present time, and that information the honourable leader of the

what I said yesterday that I was in favour
of appointing trade agents without salary.
I suggested that trade agents should be appointed, even if they had to go without
salary.
Hon. ARTHUR BOYER: The leader of
the Government said yesterday that a subsidy was paid to a steamship company for
maintaining a service from Halifax to the
West Indian islands. Has not the Government seen fit to abolish paying subsidies
to foreign companies, and to keep that
money at home? Charity always begins at
home: we want it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is not
a matter of charity.
. Hon. Mr. BOYER: Then there is another
thing which has been quite forgotten in the
treaty: the exchange in climates. If we
could get some of their June weather in
January, and send some of our January
weather to them in return, I am sure we
should do a big business.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will
my honourable friend take that in hand?
Hon. Mr. BOYER: I will try to patent
it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
loan bas been made by the Dominion Government to the Harbour Commission. The
Harbour Commission issues the debentures and handa the securities, as I understand, to the Dominion Government. Of
course, it is not intended that those debentures should be retired at any time.
They are practically perpetual. The interest is kept up.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They have not
been issued to the publie.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
am unaware of that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Could my honourable friend say whether those debentures
are accepted by the Finance Department
as security against which the Government
advances notes?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, the
Government advances money upon them.

AND

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BOYER: The same value as
the American nickel?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The rate
of exchange will come into play. The
American nickel is cheaper in the material
of which it is manufactured; but the difference in cost is not very material. It bas
been pointed out, however, that pure nickel
is very much superior in wearing quality.
The copper in the American nickel becomes
apparent during the course of wear; but
the Canadian nickel, of course, being pure,
will always retain its colour. In addition
to that, it will be a very good evidence of
our resources in nickel. It is there to speak
for itself.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: But there is the
danger that all these nickels will go to the
United States. They will use ours, and not
mint any more of their own.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
we will bave the benefit of the exchange,
I fancy, if the American nickel comes over
here.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: That will make very
little difference. Take the currencies of
England and France and Germanyparticularly Germany. Instead of the oldfashioned pfennig and groschen, Germany
adopted the mark. They made the crown
the 20-mark piece, exactly one penny less
in value than the English sovereign,
because they wanted the 20-mark piece to
be kept in Germany. The same thing happened in France with the napoleon, which
was 20 francs. They wanted the money
to remain in the country.
Of
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
course, there is this to be pointed out, that
if our nickel should circulate in the United
States we would be making money 'by
reason of that. The nickel represents very
much less in cost than the denomination of
money for which it stands, and if they
choose to import this nickel coin into the
United States, so much the better for
Canada. As I pointed out last night, on
an issue of about 5,000,000 nickels we would
make about $50,000. So Canada might
do a very good trade.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable friend say what would be the actual
value of the metal in the coin?
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Three or four cents.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
much as that?

Will it be as

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honourable friend could figure it out in
this way: the difference in cost between
it and the silver which we would use in
the five-cent piece would represent $52,562
in an issue of five millions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I drew the
attention of the Senate yesterday to the
fact that the cent recently issued was too
near in size to the silver ten-cent piece.
Now we shall have a nickel 5-cent piece.
I wonder if the Department of Finance will
see to it that there is a difference in the
pattern of the 5-cent piece and the cent as
now issued and the ten cents?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
will be this distinction: in the first place,
the coin will be thicker than the 10-cent
piece, and in the second place the edge will
not be milled. As my honourable friend
knows, all our silver currency is miHed, but
the nickel will not be milled; consequently,
in taking hold of it you will know that it
is not a 10 cent piece.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Could you not put
in a sub-clause that it should be adopted
by the churches? They say: "A silver
collection." This coin will be debarred.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
be very handy; it will take the place of
the 10-cent piece.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. 'G. TURRIFF:
Honourable
gentlemen, with your permission, on behaif
of the Canadian Battlefields Memorial Coinmission, I would like to advise the members
of the House that the first stage of the
competition in designs for the eight battiefield memorials to be erected in France and
Belgium by the Canadian Governinent was
concluded on the l5th instant. By that
date 160 sets of designs had been received.
These were examined anonymously by the
following Board of Assessors: Professor C.
H. Riley, Liverpool, nominated by the Royal
Institute of British Architects; Pr of essor
Paul P. Crep, nominated by the Société des
Architecte, Paris; and Professor Frank
Darling, nominated by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. 0f these 160
competitors, seventeen designers were
selected Vo enter the final stage of the competition, and the second stage will now be
gone into. They will be asked to send in
models, out of which eight wiIl be selected
for the erection of the monument that the
Canadian Governinent is building in F;rance
and Belgium. The seventeen designs are
now on exhibition in the Railway Comnmittee room of the House of Commons, and
the Memorials Commission would like to

FRENCH TRADE AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 61, an Act respecting a certain trade agreement between
lis Majesty and the President of the
French Republie.
Hie said: Honourable gentlemen, in
moving the second reading of this Bill
I do not propose to occupy any very great
length of time in dealing with its provisions, as honourable gentlemen are more
or less famàliar with the particuqlars of
our trade agreement with France. It is
in a sense, a modus vivendi of the tre:aty
which was negotiated between 1907 and
1909, and which. we entered into in 1910.
That treaty extended preferential treatment to Canada by way of making certain
specified exporte of Canada, to the number
of 152, subject to the minimum tariff of
France. We in turn placed the exports of
France mainly under our intermediate
tariff. Then there was a third tariff which
specified a particular rate of duty provided
that the -articles did not come under the
minimum tariff.
Upon war breaking out, it became apparent to France that ber trade would have
to be readjusted to the new conditions whicn
would arise. In anticipation of a readjustment of her trade with other countries
France reserved to herseif the right to give
three months' notice at any, time of the
denuinciation of treaties. which then obtained between 'herself and other countries. It
became apparent to Canada that it would
be to our advantage, in the absence of
France denouncing the treaty, to denounce

SENATE

326

it ourselves inasmuch as we had extended
to France special treatment under the
treaty of 1910. Some twelve or more
nations who were enjoying favoured nation treatment at that time were entitled
to a continuance of the favoured nation
treatment by virtue of certain treaties,
and it became manifest that if we denounced our treaty with France at that
particular time those nations could not
claim better treatment than they would be
entitled to were that treaty not a subsisting
treaty.
For the information of honourable gentlemen I may enumerate some of the countries
with whom we have treaties, and who profited by our treaty with France: Argentina, Columbia, Denmark, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Venezuela, and Japan; three
other countries which were given special
advantages of a somewhat different character and whose favoured nation treatment was on a somewhat different basis,
were Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy.
Upon the denunciation of the treaty by
Canada, those nations were precluded from
claiming the special treatment that they
had received during the existence of the
French treaty. However, upon an intimation from France that there was a desire
to continue trade relations with Canada,
we again in 1920 resumed negotiations with
that country. Notwithstanding the denunciation of the treaty by Canada, we
had the advantage of having our goods
admitted into France under the minimum
tariff of that country, notwithstanding
that Canada imposed the maximum tariff
against France. As a result of the negotiations which took place, conducted' by the
proper representative of the Imperial Government together with our Minister of
Trade and CommerceHon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman is in error. There were no
negotiations carried on by the Imperial
representatives in Paris.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Where
were they carried on?
They were
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
carried on in Paris exclusively by the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), and the Ambassador was
only asked at the last moment by Sir
George Foster to kindly sign the treaty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend is premature. He is excited. If he will contain himself while I
make my explanation he may then burst
forth into all the indignation he chooses.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

If he looks at the treaty he will see that
it is signed by the British ambassador to
France and we will take it for granted
that responsible Imperial officers of state
representing Great Britain in France
would' not idly add their names to such
an important treaty as the one which we
are considering.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is what
was done.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I decline to take my honourable friend's explanation. I adhere to the opinion which
I entertained, that these gentlemen discharged whatever state duties appertained
to the very high and important offices
which they held.

patience it would have afforded me the
greatest possible pleasure to have expressed appreciation, not only on behalf of
the Minister of Trade and Commerce, but
on behalf of the Government of Canada, of
the valuable services rendered by the honourable gentleman from Montarville. But,
valuable as those services were, honourable gentlemen, I do not think my honourable friend from Montarville would claim
that he was the official negotiator of this
treaty.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If we are a
nation, why not?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say that the Minister of Trade and Commerce spoke to me of the very satisfactory
services rendered by the honourable gentleman, who was in France at the time.
He took the deepest interest in the discussion and in the negotiations which were
conducted on behalf of the Government of
Canada, and contributed very materially
to the treaty which was entered into, and
which we are now considering. But I will
acquit the honourable gentleman from
Montarville from taking the position taken
by the honourable gentleman from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that it was
he (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) who negotiated
the treaty and not the official representatives whose names are appended to the
treaty.
My honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was entirely pre-

A
SENATE

treaty. I fear that, like the general who
commands from headquarters, he has not
an exact idea of the ground gained through
negotiations which have lasted for some
three months-and I must confess they were
at certain times very arduous.
What I desire to lay before the House
can be explained very briefly 'by describing
what our position was under the old
treaty of 1907 and 1909 and what our
position is now.
Honourable gentlemen
must realize that France had to free herself from all the treaties with which she
was fettered after the treaty of Frankfort.
In 1918, as the honourable leader of this
House bas said, she denounced not only
this treaty, but all her treaties the world
over, agreeing to their continuance for an
indeterminate period, subject to cancellation by a three months' notice. That was
the only reason why France denounced the
treaty with Canada. The reason why the
notice was given by Canada was one of absolute necessity: we needed more revenue.
Our debt had largely increased, and it
was just and fair that the iburden of taxation should in part be borne by the luxuries imported into our country.
True it was, honourable gentlemen, that
France was not the only country aimed at
by the cancellation of the old treaty.
Strange to say, as I had the honour to
point out to this House last year, there
are now no less than nine countries that
follow us wherever we go in making
treaties.
They stand at the door, and
whenever Canada goes in to negotiate and
trade one advantage against another, these
nine countries have but to await to reap
their benefit. In other words, when a negotiator, in discussing a treaty, offers certain
advantages in the Canadian market, he is
in fairness obliged to say: "the advantage which we are now offering to you
will 'be shared by nine other nations."
And if perchance the question is then
asked, "Will you please state what these
nine nations have given to Canada for such
sweeping advantages?" you have to answer,
"None at all."
Do you understand then, honourable
gentlemen, how difficult it is to negotiate
for Canada with a population of nine million people, arid, after all, a limited commerce as compared with that of larger
nations, when you have at the outset
in fairness to say,
"Whatever we
offer to you is a share, a portion, and that
portion is one-ninth of the advantages we
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

are offering; but what we want to get from
you is a special and exclusive concession."
Having mentioned these few preliminaries to illustrate the position at the beginning of the negotiations of this treaty, may
I state this? There were other obstacles
also in the way, which could not be overlooked.
France was rebuilding
her
destroyed industries. Moreover, she had
to protect hersellf against the countries
with
depreciated
currencies-countries
which could export to France and whose
currencies were as much depreciated in
relation to the franc as the franc is in
relation to the dollar. And France was
also bound by the treaty with Jugo-Slavia
to extend to that country, with such depreciated currency, whatever advantages she
would grant to Canada.
How did we stand under the old treaty?
I speak subject to correction, but I think I
am right in saying that under the old
treaty there were 180 items in which Canada was granted the minimum tariff on
the French market. Those 180 items carried with them about 80 sub-items. As is
very easily explained, sub-items may be just
as important as items. For instance, wheat
is a main item, but a sub-item is flour.
Honourable members of this House will
understand that in that case the sub-item
is of more importance to us than the principal item itself, because foreign countries
want our wheat but do not always want
the manufactured product, which is the
flour. As I have said, we had certain
advantages on the French market for 180
items and some 80 more sub-items.
What did France have? France had two
schedules in force in Canada: one which
gave her on a large number of items the
intermediate tariff-that I do not need to
explain-and a second schedule giving ber
very appreciable advantages on certain
articles, limited in number, which covered,
I should say, more than fifty per cent of her
export trade. On all her objects of luxury
-for instance, ber silk and ber velvet and
her lace-and on ber pharmaceutical or
medicinal preparations, olive oil, etc., she
had very material reductions in our tariff.
That was the position that the negotiators
of Canada had to face when they met the
representatives of France.
What is the position at present? What
does Canada give? What does Canada
receive? Canada, first of al], retains all, or
nearly all, that the French treaty gave
ber at the beginning. There are a few
exceptions. Perhaps I should show what

APRIL 28, 1921
they are. Out of the 180 items and 80
sub-items Canada gets the minimum tariff
on all except 14 items. Out of these 14
items, for 11 we get 50 per cent of the
advantages which we had before. In other
words, we come in between the high and
the low; we get 50 per cent of the spread
between thé high and low tariffs of France.
For one we get 20 per cent, for two we
get 15 per cent. Net one item is left aside.
Let us see now if we have lost anything
by conceding a portion of the advantage on
those 14 items. Under those 14 items, honourable gentlemen, in 1914, prior to the
war, we exported $1,974 worth, that was all.
In other words, these items were absolutely
useless to Canada. Furthermore, they are
of still less use now; it is self-evident.
Since France has Alsace-Lorraine, she will
export more steel and iron perhaps than
any other European country. Her production will attain to 40,000,000 tons. Well,
honourable gentlemen, in the 14 items no
less than 7 are for iron and steel, in which
we have no possible chance to compete with
France.
Canada was not quite satisfied with the
old French treaty-why?
Because the
Americans had made a treaty with France
by which they handicapped the Canadian
trade. For instance, we enjoyed the minimum tariff when we exported our agri.
cultural implements provided they were
not driven by motor. The Americans had
in their treaty that advantage for any agricultural implements. You know very well
the transformation that is, taking place
from day to day, a great many agricultural
implements being now motor-driven. Consequently we were practically unable to
compete with the Americans. There were
in the American treaty 57 items not comprised in the Canadian treaty, and therefore in these we were handicapped. When
these, 57 items were discovered by a comparison of the old Canadian treaty with
the present American treaty, the twenty-one items in which it was impossible for Canada to compete, such as
spices or tea or other products absolutely foreign to our production, were
excluded, and there remained 36 items
Out of that
of some consequence.
number there was granted to Canada the minimum •tariff on 23, 50 per
cent of the minimum on 3, 30 per cent on
2, and 20 per cent on 1. So practically
every advantage which the American
treaty gave to the Americans over our
own exporters has been conceded to Canada

321

through the treaty which you have now
before you. Just as soon as this treaty
comes into force our exporters will be il
as favourable a position as the Americans, if not better, in exporting to the
French market. That is the present situation of Canada, one we did not occupy
before. We have retained all or practically
all the advantages of the old French treaty
and we have won practically all the advantages which had previously been granted,
not to Canada, but exclusively to the Americans.
It may ibe asked why France has made
a treaty which, on paper at any rate, seems
to be to her disadvantage. What does
France get? She gets nothing but the
extension of our intermediate tarif. And
what is our intermediate tarif? In many
cases, honourable gentlemen, it is nothing
but the maximum. Both tarifs on a great
many items are the same, and the average
spread between our intermediate and maximum tarifs is only 12à per cent. So
France really gets very little in return
for what she concedes.
But I want to point out that, outside of
the arrangement between the two nations,
as put on paper and signed, there were
conditions in which France found her advantage, and these conditions were due to
the depreciation of French money. You
can readily understand that when we sell
to France now the French people have
to pay in francs 300 per cent for
what we sell to them. That is, honourable gentlemen, a very large protection.
If you take that into account no additional
protection is required for the French
market. This, of course, is only a temporary treaty, and when the franc' has recovered part or all of its value, either
party can give notice that four months
afterwards this treaty will be repealed.
But so long as the franc remains as it is,
so long as it is materially depreciated,
altogether outside of this treaty France
has plenty of protection. In her money
she has to pay 200 or 300 per cent for
whatever we sell to her. On the other
hand, as you will readily understand,
France has on our market a corresponding
advantage. In other words, when we buy
from France we buy three dollars worth
for one dollar, which is a great inducement
to us tu buy in that market. As a matter
'of fact, these conditions of exchange, which
operate altogether outside cf any treaty
requirements, have favoured French exportation to Canada and will continue to do

330

SENATE

so, I hope, in the future. As far as we
are concerned, whenever France needs to
buy outside, I am sure Canada, being on
the same footing as the United States, will
not be overlooked in the future.
There is an additional reason why France
should agree to this treaty, and that reason
is contained in the first article of the treaty
itself, which reads as follows:
Pending the conclusion of a new commercial
conventi-on, with a view to which negotiations
will 'begin immediately, the French and Canadian Governments have agreed to the following
provisions:

The French Government has attached a
great deal of importance to the promise
which was made that new negotiations
would begin immediately. Conditions are
gradually approaching to normal. France
has re-established a great many of her
industries; she bas within the last two
months, for the first time since the war,
and, I should add for many years prior to
the war, exported more than she imported,
so that now she will be in the field to
expand her commerce. She requires to do
so, but she expects before long that a new
treaty and a permanent.one will be made
between the two countries.
But there is an additional reason, and
that reason will never fail in the case of
France. I must say that during my tour
of a great many large centres in France I
have witnessed the deepest gratitude of the
French people for Canada. There is one
thing upon which you can always count with
the French people, and that is their memory of the heart. Never have I been
in any city of France but the first speaker
on rising bas said: "Please be the bearer,
when you go back to your country, of the
expression of the deepest gratitude of the
French people for what Canadians have
done for us during the war." At times,
gentlemen, it was most impressive.

and saying, "When you return to your
country, tell your countrymen that there
is not one tomb of a Canadian soldier who
fell during the war that will be neglected

own Government bas been looking after the
graves of our soldiers; but I must say that
in places near little villages you will often
see flowers brought by the women of the
villages and placed upon the graves
of the soldiers, and that pious offering they do day after day and month

deep sympathy bas helped greatly towards
the agreement which is now before you,
and I venture to say, notwithstanding the
expressions of unappreciation in another
place, that this treaty is very much to the
advantage of Canada.
I cannot close without expressing my
deep gratitude to the Honourable Mr. Roy,
who at one time was a member of this
House and is now the Chief Commissioner
of Canada in France, for the very valuable
services he bas rendered in the negotiation
of this treaty. Mr. Roy has acquired a
very remarkable position in France through
his ability, his sound judgment, and his
very remarkable tact. Through his many
precious relations he bas become an asset
to Canada, which I feel sure is highly
appreciated by all those who come into
contact with him. I desire also, as is my
bounden duty, to express the deep appreciation of Canada of the manner in which this
whole matter bas been considered by the
French people, and more particularly by
Mr. Isaac, the high-minded and most remarkable statesman who then occupied the
position of Minister of Trade and Commerce for France. Mr. Isaac time and
time again said to me-as indeed at a
public banquet he stated to Sir George
Foster-that the reason why the French
Republic had not only entered into this
agreement, but for practically one whole
year allowed our goods to enter France
with the full advantages of a treaty repealed by Canada, whilst French exports
were mulcted by our maximum tariff, was
that two nations so close during the war
and on such terms prior to the war must
see to it that the road of trade between
the two countries be kept open and developed and enlarged in the future.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I desire to congratulate the
Government on the achievement which is
represented by the treaty which is now
before us for consideration. I am quite
sure that the Government has obtained as
much as it could hope to have, and I am
quite sure also that no voice will be raised
in this Chamber to criticize the results
attained.
I interrupted the honourable the leader of
the Government when he moved the second
reading of this Bill, because he stated that
negotiations had been carried on in Paris
by the Imperial authorities in conjunction
with Canadian representatives. I did so
because I felt that this was a retrogression
in the powers of Canada, aà gradully acquired, in the negotiation of commercial

APRIL 28, 1921
treaties. My honourable friend has probably, flot had time to -read the most intereeting statement on the development of
Canadian constitutional powers made in
the other House by the Right Honourable
Sir Robert Borden. I invite him to, do so.
As students of constitutional. law, we shahl
ail be interested 'in re-ading n'ot only the
speech delivered by the Right Honouriable
Sir Robert Borden on April 2lst, but the
one which he delivered yesterday in which
he conipleted the history lesson which he
gave to Parliament. My honourable friend
will find that the statement he made could
well have been made in 1879, but that lt
cannot be accepted in 1921. H1e will find
that in 1879 the Canadian Government
claimed the privilege of appointing a representative to, discuss treaties which interested Canada, and~ that iSir Michael
Hicks-Beach said in reply:

Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addressed a letter to, His Majesty's Chargé
des Affaires at Paris, in which he said:

I have to inform you that it ls nlot thought
desirable to appoint a Canadian Commissioner
to take part ijo the negotiations of any treaty;
but If your Government desire to send a person
enjoying their confidence to advise with Her
MaJesty's Government, or wlth the British
Ambassador on any questions that may arise
during the negotiations, Mer Majesty's Goveroment will be happy to give attention to kils
representations.

When Mr. Fielding and KT. Brodeur welIt
to' the Foreign Office in Paris, they were

That is to say, if we will send a representative to London to, confer with the
Foreign Office, we will get due consideratien, but he shal nlot accompany their
representatives to the foreign court te discuss and defend the interests of Canada.
In 1894 at the Colonial Conference th3
following resolutions were passed:
That provision should be made by Imperial
legisiation enabllng the dependencles of the
Empire to enter Into agreements of commercial
reciprocity, including power of making differential tariffs, wlth Great Britain or with one another.
That any provision In existing treaties between Great Britain and any forelgn Power
which prevent the self-governing dependencies
of the Empire from entering Into agreements of
commercial reclprocity with each other or with
Great Britaîn should be removed.

Lord Ripon, the Colonial Secretary of
the time, answered that this would be a
very dangerous move-that; the negotiàtion
of treaties by colonies, without reference
to the British Government, would give
themn an international status as separate
and sovereign states, and would result in
the breaking up of the Empire. In 1907
Sir Wilfrid crossed over to London, with
Mr. Fielding -and Mr. Brodeur, and from
there the two, last-named gentlemen went to
France to negotiate a treaty, which was
done effectively, and we find that the

Yeu are doiibtless cognizant of the Marquis
of Rtpon's despatch of June 28, 1895, to the
Governors of the principal British colonies, in
which It was laid down that commercial negoMis
tiations of this nature being between
Majesty andi the Sovereign of the forelgn State
shoulfi be conducted by Mis Majesty's Representative at the Court of the forelgn Power. A
copy of this despatch 15 enclosed herewlth.
1 do not, however, think It necessary to adhere
in the present case to the strict letter of this
regulation, the object of which was to secure
that negotiations should nlot be entered into and
carried through by a Colony unknown to and
independentiy of His Ma3esty's Government.
The selection of the negotiator is prlncipally
a matter of convenlence, and, In the present circumstances, it will obviously be more practical
that the negotiations should be left to Sir Wilfrid Laurier and te the Canadian Minister of
Finance, whe will doubtless keep you informed
of their progress.

accompanied by the then British Ambassador to the French republie, who introduced them to the Foreign Minister, and
told them that at that point his mission
ended. He had put the representative of
Canada in contact with the French republic,
and he withdrew. The negotiations went
on, and when the treaty was agreed upon
by both parties, Mr. Fielding and Mr. Brodeur and the Ambassador were jointly app9inted to sign the treaty; so the representative of Great Britain appeared in
Paris for the second time simply to append
bis signature to the document.
Well, time bas progressed, and the status
of Canada bas developed as well. You will«
nôtice how far we are now from the point
at which we were when Sir Michael HicksBeach in 1879 said that he could not entertain the idea of a colonial appearing in any
such negotiation. Here are sessional p-apers
No. 89A, which bear upon the present negotiations. They begin with' a letter from.
Sir George Foster to Lord Milner, dated
December 30, 1920:
Dear Lord Milner:1 am enclosing herewith an agreement which,
had been arrioved. at by myseif and the Ministers of Commerce and Foreign AMairs of France
with reference to a modus vivendi carryiflg on
for a period the main features o! the Convention o! 1907-9, of whlch I spoke te you yesterday, and I 'would be much obliged if you would
forward it to the Secretary of state for Foreign
Affairs for transmission to the Brltsh Ambassador at Paris. Those French Ministers have
the duplicate of the agreement and wlll sigo
it and forward to me at Ottawa for my signature and they wlll slgn this attached copy and
retaîn for themnselves.

I would be much obliged if this could be
facilitated so as to occasion no delay in signatures and consequent completion of the arrangement which has been arrived at by numerous
pourparliers and concluded by me in Paris with
the French Ministers on the 19th December.
Yours, etc.,
George E. Foster.

This was the first official intimation that
the British Government had that negotiations had 'been carried on by Canada with
These negotiations,
the French republic.
up to the moment that the signature had
to be appended to the treaty, were conducted entirely through Franco-Canadian
channels, and when I interrupted my honourable friend it was not to claim any
credit for one representative of Canada
over another, 'but simply to challenge the
statement that the negotiations had been
carried on by the British representative.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED : Will
my honourable friend pardon me? Do I
understand my honourable friend to interpret seriously or literally the statement that the British Ambassador at Paris
negotiated this treaty? I referred to it as
a treaty entered into between the parties
whose names are appended thereto. My
honourable friend need not labour that
question. I know as well as he that the
British Ambassador at Paris had nothing
to do literally with negotiating the treaty,
but still he is a party to it, and Great
Britain is a party by reason of his name
being attached to it, and I refer to those
whose names are appended to the treaty
as those who negotiated the treaty, just
as we would speak of an agreement having been entered into by those whose names
are attached to it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Surely the Government does not contend that people from
the colonies can go and deal with a foreign
nation without consulting the Ambassador?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend can discuss that with
my honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend has not sat at the feet of the learned
professor, the Right Honourable Sir Robert
Borden, during the last two weeks. All
those who have studied the evolution in
the constitutional powers of the DominionHon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is no
evolution at all.
I speak of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the evolution because the power which was
denied by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach in
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

1879 to the Dominions is now recogCommercial treaties are now
nized.
negotiated by Canada directly with any
foreign Power and the negotiators obtain their powers from His Majesty the
King. My only complaint is that Sir
George Foster, after having carried on
those negotiations, mainly through our honourable colleague the Senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), on returning to London wrote to the Colonial Secretary to ask him to transfer to the Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs his request to
have the Ambassador sign that arrangement in France with him. If the honourable gentlemen who are within the sound
of my voice read the statements made by
Sir Robert Borden in explaining how Canada is gradually working to the level of a
sister nation of Great Britain, they will
quite realize that Sir George Foster could
have obtained power to sign that treaty
through a Canadian Order in Council, or a
request from the Federal Cabinet to His
Majesty the King to appoint him as representative in France to sign that treaty.
According to the discussion regarding the
appointment of a Minister plenipotentiary
to Washington, which took place in the
House of Commons last week, and which
was participated in not only by Sir Robert
Borden, but also by the Right Hon. Arthur
Meighen and other members of the Cabinet
and by prominent members on both sides
of the House, the Minister plenipotentiary
representing Canada at Washington will be
appointed by a Canadian Order in Council,
which will be sent direct to "His Majesty
the King for Canada." These are the expressions of the. Right Hon. Sir Robert
Borden, and I think they are repeated word
for word by the present Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me to ask him a
question?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I will.

Hopn. Mr. BELCOURT: Could not the
King veto that Order in Council and throw
it into the basket, and would not that be
the end of it?
But there is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
no Order in Council that cannot be vetoed
by His Majesty's representative in Canada,
the Governor General.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: For the King.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For the King.
But the distinction which I make is that

APRIL 28, 1921
the present Government dlaims that it will
appoint its minister plenipotentiary te
Washington by an Order in Council of the
present cabinet, which will be sent direct
te His Majesty the King for the Dominion
of Canada and 'be signed by him; and I
say that when that is done we shall be
entitled te dlaim that we have become a
sister nation of Great Britain.
I had occasion about three years ago. te
read a portion of a speech made by the
late Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the presence
of the Governor General et the time, His
Excellency Lord Grey, and the then Prince
of Wales, now George V. I will read only
the concluding portion of the quotation
which I then made. The speech was made
at a dinner given at the Garrison in
Quebec- on the occasion of the célebration
cf the Te*entenary cf the arrival of
Champlain and the founding of Quebec.
My honourable friends will Qnd the text
of that part of my quetatien in the speech
I made et the time of the demise cf Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. Here are his words:The inferiortty which may be Implied in the
word "colony"' no longer exiots. We acknowledge
the authorlty of the Britigh crown but no other
authority. We are reaohlng the day when our
Canadian Parliament wl ldaim co-equal rights
with the British Parliament and when the only
ties binding us together wiII be a saine ifiag and
a same crown.

Th-at was said in 1908, and I am happy
te find that on the floor of Parliament, in
1921, the Right Hon. Scr Robert Borden
stated practically the same thing-that we
dlaim co-equal rights wiith the BritishParliament, and that after negotiation and
discussion with Great Britain we are empowered te appoint a minister plenipotentiary at Washington by a Canadian Order
in Council duly signed by His Majesty the
King fer the Dominion of Canada.
It may be said by my honourable friend
et my right that we have a written constitution, whereas the British constitution
is unwritten and therefore very elastic. I
remind him that our evolution takes place
with the sanction cf the British cabinet,that precedents are created which alter our
constitutional status. There is one fact
that has net escaped our attention: it is the
appearance in the Treaty cf Peace of the
Can4dian delegates representing an entity,
the Dominion of Canada, with the concurrence cf representatives
cf Great
Britain, who sign side by side with them
the sanie document.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And the Boers.

333

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, and al
the other representatives. We have there
an acknowledgment of the change in status,
which must naturally react upon the
general conditions which have prevailed
up to the present time between the Dominions generally and the mother country.
My only complaint is that Sir George
Foster and the Minister of Justice, who
had just corne from the conference at
Geneva, where they had represented the
Dominion of Canada as a separate entityin the British Empire, if you will, but a
separate entity-did not realize on their
arrivai in London that they could create
another precedent simply by cabling to
Ottawa for an Order in Council appointing
Sir George Foster as representative and
having that Order in Couneil sent through
the Governor General direct te His Majesty
the King for his signature.
Sir George Foster took another course.
As he explained in another place, he followed the tradition and sent his request te
the Colonial Office.
From the Colonial
Office it went te the Foreign Office, and
from the Foreign Office it was forwarded
te the British Ambassador in Paris. Does
it net strike you, honourable gentlemen,
that the time has passed when Canada
should deal with the Colonial Office in
London in >order te reach His Majesty the
King? If we do continue te send our
Orders in Council te the Colonial Secretary,
what does it mean? It means that we
remain subjects of the King's subjects. If
we send our Orders in Council te the
Colonial Secretary, requesting that he will
send them te the Foreign Office or te His
Majesty for approval and signature, it
ineans that any Order in Council may stop
there; that the discretion of the Colonial
Secretary, or of the Cabinet of which he
is a member, may be exercised te destroy
or paralyze or stay the action of the Gevernment of Canada or of any of the other
Dominions; and if that is done-and it is
implied that the British Cabinet have
power te do it, since we ask their services
and beg that they will kindly forward those
documents te the King-then are we net
admitting that we are stili subjects of the
King's subjects and net the equals of the
British citizens in the British Isles? The
humblest elector in Great Britain would in
that case have a status superior net only
te that of a Canadiagi elector, but even te
that of a Canadian Minister or the whole
Canadian Cabinet; because the humblest
elector ini the British Isles has a voice in

33j4

SENATE

rnaking or unrnaking the Colonial Secretary,
or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the
Prime Minîster, whereas we have no voice
at all. 1 feel prouder of my Canadian
citizenship to-day when I reahize that we
are gradualhy rising te the plane of being
British subjects with rights equal to those
of the electors in the British Isles.
We must also express our gratitude ta
France for its treatment of Canada and
Canadian goods during the interregnum.
The treaty by which we were admitting
French goods at the minimum rate was
denounced. From that moment we collected
the hîghest duties on French goods, as if
there had been no Franco-Canadian treaty,
whereas France continued te give us the
advantage of its minimum tariff on aIl the
goods to which that tariff applied under
the treaty.
I have looked at the returns of the
Customs Department for 1914 and 1920,
and find that during the year 1913-14
Canada exported to France $3,622,444
worth, and during 1920 the experts from
1
Canada to France were $61,108,693.
observe in those sales an item, quite a
large one, which, I am quite sure, will
not appear again, representing the sale
of ships to the amnount of $20,130,100. Sa
for the sake of future comparisons I shouhd
be inclined to say that, apart from that
$20,000,000, our sales to France in 1920)
were about $41,000,000. The question is,
shall we rnaintain that increase in Our
trade with France? I bave my doubtg,
but I hope so.
I find that in 1914 we exported to France
apples and preserved fruits ta the value
of $5,000, and in 192.0 to the value of
There is no reasan why we

shouhd not gradually increase our sales of
fruit to France.
In foeur of wheat we exported practically
noth.ing to France in 1914, but in 1920 we
sold 527,678 barrels, representingHon. Mr. ROCHE: Will the honourable

Yes.

I think my
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
honourable friend is quoting figures for
the period after the war, and therefore
after the French Government's control over
importation had ceased.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt very
rnuch that our sales to France in 1920 include sales to the French Governrnent,
unless it be part or the whole of that

$20,000,000.

We sold to France foeur and wheat to
the value of $5,646,065 in 1920. 0f sugar
of ail kinds, which does nlot appear in the
column for 1914, there was exported in
1920 $6,2614,835 worth. I doubt very rnuch
that we shall see any such figures in our
sales to France in the years to corne, because beet-root, which was grown mostly
in the regions that were devastated, will,
I arn sure, provide France with its ful:
complement of sugar in the future, as it
did in the past.
We sold no cattie in 1914; in 1920 we
sold $116,666 worth. We sold $703,469 of
canned lobsters in 1914, and, although
sold delobsters
of
quantity
the
creased to below 50 per cent, yet,
prices,
enhanced
the
of
because
we sold $605,238 worth during 1920.
There is no xeason why we should not
continue to da a good business in lobsters
with France.
0f canned saîrnon, in 1914 we sold
$213,543 worth, and in 1920 we sold
$1,994,408 worth. This is an article which
we could continue to seli in large quantities
to France.
I arn surprised at the srnall quantity of
undressed furs that we have been selling.
In 1914 we sold $57,976 worth of undressed furs, and hast year we sohd
$119,610 worth. I arn at a loss to understand how it is that with the large firrn of
Révihlon Frères carrying on activities in
the Hudson bay region we are selling such
a small quantity of undressed furs to
France.
In boots and shoes we did nothing in
1914, but in 1920 we sohd over $1,500,000
worth. I doubt very rnuch whether we shal
continue to seIl those articles when France
has recovered.
In cheese we did nothing in 1914; in 1920
we sold 2,023,231 lbs. at a value of
$836,711. There is 'no reason. WhY Wle
should not increase that arnounit provided

APRIL 28, 1921
it is registered as Canadian and net English.
We surely have sold two-thirds of
our cheese to France up to this year
through English channels, and those sales
were net credited ta us nor to our cheese
industry.
We did nlot trade with France in condensed milk in 1914; in 1920 we sold
1,694,000 lbs. at a value of $293,636.
Our sales cf wood and wood products te
France an 1914 totaled $60,455, cf whieh
mechanically-ground pulpwcod represented
nearly one-half, or $25,650. In 1920 we
sold $1,146,172 worth, of which mechanically-grounýd pulpwoed represented $808,257.
There is ne reasen why Canada sheuld net
show an increase on these figures if our
peeple become active in that regard.
Our sales cf agricultural implements in
1914 amounted te $1,421,903, of which
harvesters, binders, and mewing machines
alone represent $976,042.
In 1920 our
sales cf agricultural implements had advanced te $4,603,924, cf which ameunt harvesters, binders, and niewing machines,
îepresented $1,817,230. 1 de net knew
whether henourable gentlemen have heard
the statement that our agricultural implements could successfu!Ily compete in ail the
markets cf the world. Il we have acquired
such a held en the French market, there is
ne reason why this business sheuld net
forge ahead.
In cepper, bars, sheets, tubing, cepper
wire and cable, we made ne sales in 1L914;
last year our sales amounted te $801,3d2.
We seld no coal te speak, cf in 1914, but
last year we seld 75,000 tens at a price
cf $551,540. 1 doubt very niuch if this item
will bulk very large in oui future sales te
France, because cf the gradual recevery
cf their ewn mines in the nerth, and the
production which the Saar Valley will give
them. as well as what they will get fremn
the Ruhr district in virtue cf the Peace
Treaty.
0f asbestes and manufacture cf asbestes
we sold in 1914 $155,576 worth. In 1920,
that increased te $438,407. As we have
practically a monopoly cf that production
there is ne reasen why eur trade with
France in that cemmodity should 'net
thrive.
I arn surprised te find that in 1920 we
sold $171,194 worth cf glassware te Franice,
and $200,319 werth cf seap. Those articles
do net appear in the returns cf 1914, and
I think, the figures of 1920 are due te
present conditions in France.

Heneurable gentlemen will see that
Fraince effers a market which sheuld be
cultivated, a market in which our sales
should incicase considerably.
We are ail aware that threugh the activities of oui henoured celleague frin
Mentarville <Hen. Mi. Beaubien) the,
French people will be enabled this summer
te exhibit their geods througheut the length
and breadth cf Canada in an expesitiWs
tiain which will carry articles brcught
from France, and which will go froin city
te city and frenm tewn te tewn threugheut
the country. Our hencurable friend has
addressed the Beards cf Trade cf the 'principal towns cf France, and has created
censiderable enthusiasm in faveur cf the
mevement. be-tween France and Canada.
Eveîycne will have an cppertunity te see
the exhibit practically at his dcci. The
heneurable gentleman has had the idea cf
obt-aining the use cf a whole line cf theatres
in the varieus cities and tewns which will
show French films du-ring the days the
trains will be in these places. This will be
te the great advantage cf French trade
develepmnent in Canada, but the advantage
te Canada lies in the fact that whaktever
we do in the exhibition cf French gceds in
Canada will be reciprocated in France, and
when we send trains fraie either Havre ci
Bordeaux thrcugh France with an exhibit
cf Canadian geeds we will have the benefit
cf a market of 39,000,000 or 40,000,000
people, while ail we are able te cffeî tx>
them is a market cf semne 8,000,000 people.
Il is true that the French people will
have an advantage ever us because cf their
diveisified productions. Befere the war
France scld foui times as much in Canada
as we seld in France, and it is possible that
the saine condition will recur. But we are
hepeful cf being able ta expand censiderably in the French market. Te give yeu an
idea cf the diversiity of gcods which Fiance
can seli, I have made a list cf the various
classes cf her geeds sold in Canada, and 1
find that they cerne under 385 different
heads, while a similar addition in the
celumn cf gecds scld by Canada te France
repr esents 174 classes. Still, this is quite a
large figure. It shows that Ganadians are
extending and develeping their trade in
many lines. I think vie should net only be
satisfied with the work that Canadians have

length and breadth of France as ably and
eloqu'ently as the honourable gentleman
from Montarville.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Before the
honourable gentleman takes his seat, may
I ask him a question for my own information? I would refer to the fitst part of his
address in which he spoke of the present
status of Canada and the Canadian Parliament in the British Empire. If I understood the honourable gentleman correctly
he stated, by way of illustration, that if
the present Cabinet should see fit to pass an
Order in Council appointing an Ambassador for Canada at Washington, the Order
in Council tvould have to be sent directly to
the KingHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Governor General.

Through the

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Through the
Governor General to the King for his signature. If that is true, what is the necessity
for discussing any longer the question of
our status as a member of the British Empire and comparing our Parliament with
the British Parliament? It seems to me
that we have settled this question, if I understand what the honourable gentleman
has said, and I have great faith in my
honourable friend as a constitutional
lawyer.
I have to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
rely upon the statement made by the Right
Hon. Sir Robert Borden, and I think that
in very similar terms the same thing
repeated by the present Prime Minister.
My answer to my honourable friend is
that if that is done I believe that it will
be a precedent to be henceforth followed,
and the question of whether we are a
sister nation of Great Britain will be permanently solved.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, I am in a few words going to
congratulate the leader of the Government
in this House upon two matters: first of
all, upon having announced in the House
to-day that this treaty bas been concluded
with France. The work was rather slow:
I think the former Treaty might very well
have been continued or been re-made
months ago. The Armistice has been signed
for two years and a half. However, the
Treaty has been completed and is before
Parliament for ratification, and in that
regard I congratulate the Government.
I want to congratulate my honourable
friend also upon another matter, which is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

perhaps not of such great importanceupon having seduced an honourable gentleman on this side of the House to the
theory so assiduously propagated for some
time that Canada bas evolved from the old
state of colonialism into the situation of
being a sovereign or sister nation. I hope
my honourable friend will not be shocked
if I state that there are some on this
side of the House-and I see there are
some on the other side also-who are obdurate and not prone to succumb to
the sweet tune so often sung recently by
my honourable friend and his colleagues in the Cabinet. The negotiations
for this treaty were undertaken simply
because the British Government allowed
them to be undertaken. Even the Minister
of Trade and Commerce would not have
thought of beginning any sort of negotiations in this matter without the authority
of the Imperial authorities. The Imperial
authorities would communicate their wishes
to the British Ambassador at Paris, and
then the matter could go on. That is the
way the thing was done. What change is
there in our Constitution? In former instances of a similar character, the British
Government were willing that the matter
of negotiating a treaty for Canada 'should
be handled by a Canadian rather than a
Britisher. Where is the change in the
Constitution? There is absolutely none.
You talk about changing the Canadian
Constitution. There will be a change in the
Canadian Constitution when the proper
authorities take pen and ink and write it:
there is no change now. It is sheer nonsense
to tell the people of Canada that they have
become a sovereign nation.
I would like to know what this Treaty
would be worth if it did not bear the signature of the British Ambassador. It
would be absolutely worthless without
that-not worth the paper it is written on.
It is simply because the British Ambassador
at Paris bas attached his signature to the
document that it is of some value. I have
hoped as strongly as anyone for increased
autonomy; but I am not prepared to take
as increased autonomy such flimsy appearance's as are held out as evidences of
a change in the Constitution.
We have heard about the British Constitution. There is no such thing. The
British Constitution is made day by day at
Westminster. The British Parliament
could to-morrow by one swoop re-make
everything. It is the people of the British
islands meeting in Parliament who make
the Constitution and unmake it. It has

We have a written Constitution, and we

that if my honourable friend and his colleagues chose to appoint someone as ambassador at Washington-and I hope they will

and the King was told to sign. Lloyd

what -is poor Ring George going to do?

" I amn not going to stand behind: like Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, I will, say Canada is a

nothing in the book.
I do not 'want to make a speech, but the
honourable member for, Montarville (Hon.
Mr. fleaubien) said there were nine other
countries getting the same privileges, and
he did flot name those countries.
Hon. Mr. DANDiURAND: Under the

Hon. Mr. CAjSGRAIN: Not the most
favored nation clause, but the minimum
tariff. Oh, I see, that is where the most
favored nation clause comes in. What are
those nine countries?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I mentioned them.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Rumania?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN :-But I think the
honourable, leader of the House has named
them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
they are in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: They are: the
Argentine Repuhlic, Columbia, Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland,
Venezuela, and Japan.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: I do flot wish
to enter into a discussion, but the honourable mem-ber for Montarville says that
those nations are getting. ahl those advantages for nothing, whereas we are
giving something.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Quite true.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, they must'
give soniething, because the French Goverament would not give them the same
treatment if they were giving nothing.
If that is true, they are getting somnething
for nothing, while we are giving something. If that is so,* I do not think mucb
of this treaty.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable

has absolutely nothing to do with the
granting of any privilege by France. What
I said was that when we grant a privilege
to France, that privilege must be shared
by France with the fine other nations,
who give us nothing at all in exchange for
what we give them.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, honourable
gentlemen, there seems to beHon. Mr. ROCHE: May I ask the honourable member who has just taken bis
seat (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) if I understood
him correctly that Canada would be benefited by the depreciation of the franc,
which has fallen to one-third its value?
Would not the seller of goods in France
add to his invoice, in francs, the amount
that the franc had fallen, so that we
would pay a larger number of francs for
the same goods than we did before?
Again, the honourable gentleman alluded
to the number of articles that were gained;
he stated those we had lost in comparison
with those we had gained in the new treaty.
But would not the strength of that argument
depend entirely upon the amount of each
article that has been exported to France,
and not upon the number of articles as
compared with those in the former treaty?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In answer to
my honourable friend, if I understood
rightly his first question, I may say that
the value of the franc bas nothing to do
with the figures that I quoted, because
they all referred to Canadian money.
Therefore there would be no multiplication
by three of the exports to France referred
to.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: No, no: I beg the
honourable gentleman's pardon. I refer
to the imports from France. Suppose a
person invoiced a certain article at 100
francs and the franc had fallen to onethird its normal value, would he invoice
bis goods and sell them at 100 francs, or
at 300 francs?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: All my information comes from the Canadian statistics,
and they are all given in Canadian
currency.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There bas been
a great deal of discussion since these neHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

gotiations were commenced and as my
honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) was a party to the negotiations, perhaps he would not mind informing this House, once for all, how they
began. He did not go to the Minister in
France and say, "I am Mr. Beaubien, from
Canada, and I am going to do business with
you." He must have had somebody introduce him. Or even if Sir George Foster
went first, he would have been told: "Je ne
vous connais pas. Do you know the Ambassador? Well, get him to introduce you."
The question is constantly arising as to
how the negotiations started, and I think
it would be valuable information if my
honourable friend from Montarville would
tell us now who began the negotiations and
who concluded them?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am afraid my
answer will be rather a disappointment to
my honourable friend across the floor. The
negotiations began in a very simple way.
The Minister of Trade and Commerce asked
me whether it was possible to initiate with
my friends in France some negotiations with
a view to having a temporary agreement,
until such time as a permanent treaty could
be made. I gladly assented to his request,
andthe efforts gradually led to negotiations,
and the negotiations led to the treaty, and,
so far as I know, the British Ambassador in
France or even the Foreign Office in London had nothing whatever to do with the
matter until the treaty was presented for
signature.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

of that disintegration which must necessarily follow from financial default, posSsession must be given to the Government.
This was anticipated, honourable gentlemen, and the Company was officially and
solemnly warned by the Government of
Canada when it entered upon the arbitration proceedings-I think, as far back as
February-that the time would not be
extended, and that it was essential that
the arbitration should ýbe concluded by the
date fixed in the agreement; that good
faith must be kept with the Government
and the people of Canada by concluding the
agreement by that date. Notwithstanding
thàt fact, apparently no reasonable impetus
was given to the proceedings by the Company. The arbitrators were prepared to
go* on hearing the eviclpnce whieh was subxnitted, but an impression was left upon
the minds of the Government that there
was no intention to exercise diligence in
closing the arbitratioii proceedings. In the
meantime, as 1 have said, further obligations were maturing and further demands
were being made upon the Government of
Canada to meet those obligations. Consequently on the 9th of April the Government
unhesitatingly refused further to extend
the tîme. The time having expired, it
becomes necessary that legisîntion should be
placed upon the statute book to give authority to re-enter upon the arbitration proceedings in the event of both parties being
willing to do so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow me to ask him at this
stage, what were the dates at which those
advances were made? I forget the amount.
I think it is $47,000,000.

seek to, impose, as honourable gentlemen
doubtless kno;w, is that we obtain possession of the road. The necessity of that
possession lies not; only in our having control over the physical properties of the
road, but that we should have a control
by which we may advantageously administer the other systems which we are carrying to-day. As honourable gentlemen know,
we are endeavouring to establish a great
systemi of national transportation in Canada. We have already acquired. the Canadian Northern railway and other railroads,
and it is necessary that we should co>-ordinate with the system of railways which we
are to-day ôperating the Grand Trunk
system; and until that can be done, and
until the Government of Canada is in a
,position to carry out one scherne of reorganization for ail these systems, Canada
must face the very serious bass which we
have been carrying since we entered upon
the very important obligation which we
have had imposed upon us.
We are hopeful, honourable gentlemen,
that an agreement will go through without delay to permit of a resumption of
the arbitration proceedings, nnd of the
Government acquiring possession oif the
rond. It will be necessary to pass legisiation providing for the retirement of the
present directorate and to secure the ratification by the shareholders of nny agreement which may be entered into, and other
steps necessary to assure us of the valîdity
of whatever steps are taken. With this
object in view, I miove the second reading
of the Bill. At the samne time 1 would
point out to honourable gentlemen that,
since this Bill was introduced and passed
by the flouse of ýCommons, owing to negotiations which have been conducted between
the Government of Canada and the Grand
Trunk Railway company-I think 1 may
say they, or at leat those who represent
the company here are party to themadditional amendments have been drafted
which they are willing to recommend to
the Company in England. When the Bill
comes up in Committee I propose to move
the amendments, which I have in my
hands. Copies of those amendinents have
been distributed since the sitting opened
to-day.
Hlon. HEWITT BOSTOCK.: Honourable gentlemen, in listening>to the remarks

APRIL 28, 1921
of my honourable friend in moving the
second reading of this 'Bill, 'I ould flot
help thinking that the Government would
have been well advised had it listened to
the advice given to it by the members of
this Chamber when the Bill was first. introduced in the second Session of 1919.
Hlonourable gentlemen will remember that
when this question was first ibrought up at
that tinie, it was brought up at -the end
of the Session, when members of the Government in this House and in the other
House said there was no further important
legisiation to, be deait with. Honourable
gentlemen in this House took the view that
the Government sho.uld have given mucli
further and deeper consideration to the
matter before they asked the Parliament of Canada to, pass legisiation in connection with it. At that time, as honourable gentlemen no doubt remember, the
legisiation only provided for giving this
Government po'wer to make an agreement
with the Grand Trunk Railway Company.
It was afterwards found, in the Session
of 1920, that further legisiation had to
be brought in to deal with the agreement.
In that way, we were enabled to see the
agreement, and we considered that the only
thing ta do, the Government being sa far
committed to the matter, was to offer fia
fùrther opposition to the legisiation
which, the 'Government insisted on putting through.
So the country was coinmitted to taking over the 'Grand Trunk
Railway system.
The, arguments used in this Chaniber
at that time against the acquisition by Canada of the Grand Trunk Railway systemi
have, I think, ibeen f ully borne out, and
to-day they are stronýger than they were
then. The whole course of pitocedure in
regard 'to this matter should bring very
clearly to the niind of the Government the
mistake that was made in passing legislation of this kind through Parliament. As
xny honourable friend has said just now,
this Bill was introduced in the Houseof
Commons flot very long ago, and since it
was introduced in that House it has been
found necessary ta provide eor several
amendments which it is proposed to make
to the Bill in this House. It seems to me,
if that is the case, that even now this legislation has not received the consideration
that it should have received, and I doubt
if the Governament itself really understands
exactly what it is doing in regard ta thiq
matter.
This agreenment was nmade on the 8th of
March, 1920, and it was stated by the
Prime Minister the other day that since

341

the agreement went into effect the Government had found it xiecessary ta advance a
sum-I think it was mentioned as being
$47,000,000-for the purpose of helping the
Grand Trunk Raiiway Company ta carry on
operatiaxis while the other clauses of the
agreement were being dealt with.
The
agreement, of course, pravided that the
Grand Trunk Railway Company should do
its own financing; but it also provided that
the managing comflittee niight, with t4p
consentof the Governor in Council, borrow
from the Government on Grand Trunk
notes or other obligations or securities approvediby the Governor in ýCouncil in arder
ta carry on the operation of the railroad.
It said :
The cormlttee shall continue to aet until the
preference and commrron stocks are transferred
or vested in the Government. when it shall brâ
discharged.

I presume that when part of that clause
was placed in the agreement, the Governm~ent recognized that as soon as this agreement went into effect it would be almost
impossible for the Company ta go into the
markets of the world and arrange for its
finances as it had done iii the past. and
that therefore it was necessary ta place
that clause in the agreement in order ta
provide for the finances of the company
until the arbitration was concluded. I
understand that under that clause the
Government has been advancing money ta
the Grand Trunk Railway Company ta the
amount 1 mentioned a short tume ago. This
went an, apparently, until April 1, this
year, when certain securities which were
covered by that arrangement were falhing
due. But as it seemed quite evident that
the arbitration would be extended beyond
April 9, which was the date fixed for its
termination, the Government, in order ta
bring the matter ta a conclusion, ta bring
the Company ta tume if possible, feit justified in refusing ta do any mare financing
for the' Company. I presume, although we
have not been informed as ta that, that the
Grand Trunk Railway Company stili has
ta darry on its business 'without getting
any financial assistance from the GoveTnment.
If the Government had taken the time
and had fairly considered the whole situation and found out exactly how the matter
stood, I do not think the agreement would
have been drawn up, even after the Session of 1919, because, as I view the situation, ta-day, the country is bound ta go
an with this agreement and is bound legally

stock and the 4 per cent guaranteed
stock. The shareholders-the first, second
and third preference shareholders and the
ord'inary shareholders, who are still in
existence to-day-have a voting power in
the Company, and they could instruct the
Company to go on, and could refuse to
make any further arrangements unless the
Government brought in legislation providing for the expropriation of the railway
system.
Therefore I think the agreement was a
bad agreement in the interest of Canada
and of the Government. I think this is an
evidence that the Government did not give
proper consideration to the agreement they
were making or to the expense and the
financial liabilities which they were letting
the country in for.
The Bill that we are asked to deal with
now provides for giving the Government
power to re-create, so to speak, the Board
of Arbitration, and to continue the arbitration, but on the condition that the shareholders of the company agree to the Government taking possession of the road and
having full possession in their own hands.
It further provides that the shareholders
shall have the privilege of getting all the
information they require for the purpose of
carrying on the arbitration proceedings. As
far as I can see, there is nothing said in
the Bill about any limitation of the arbitration proceedings, but I presume that can
be done by the agreement which will be
made between the shareholders and the
Government. The agreement provides, of
course, that there may be an appeal from
the decision of the arbitrators.
The question, as far as the country is
concerned, is, I think, a very serious one.
My honourable friend said that it was
necessary for the Government to take over
the Grand Trunk railway system in order
to complete the Government railway system
in this country; but the opinion has been
expressed in this House before that it was
very questionable whether the taking over
of the Grand Trunk system would be a very
advantageous thing for the country and
for the operation of the Government railroads.
It has been pointed out before that the
Grand Trunk railway system is a very
complicated one. The organization is one
that has been built up during a long period
of time by men who have given their whole
time and attention to the development of
the system. It has had the advantage of
business connections not only in Canada,
but also in England, and probably to some
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

extent in the United States, which have
enabled it to get a large amount of business which I doubt very much can be retained under Government ownership. The
most important business of the Grand
Trunk railway system consists of the business that originates in the United States
and is carried through Canada and delivered on the American seaboard. That
business is done in the face of very keen
competition with other railroads in the
United States; and those roads being
situated entirely in the United States, it
is quite plain that the people operating
them will do everything they can to take
away the business from the Grand Trunk
railway as soon as it is known that it has
become a Canadian Government system.
Although it was pointed out the other
day, in a statement made by a representative of the Canadian National railways,
that according to Government statistics
the amount of business done by the Grand
Trunk system was very considerable, at
the saine time he assumed that when the
system was taken over by the Government

business. He gave the amount of business

system as 13,201,608 tons, and stated
that they received from other Canadian
railways 3,458,603 tons; that they obtained
from the United States railways 9,908,588
tons; making 26,569,799 tons as the total
business of the Grand Trunk system. If
honourable gentlemen were able to ex
amine into that business they would, I
think, agree that probably the greater
part, if not the whole, of the 9,908,588
tons which comes from the United States
railways will disappear when it becomes
a question of shipping goods over the
Canadian Government railway system, and
in all probability a considerable portion of
the 13,201,608 tons originating along the
line of the Grand Trunk railway systeni
will also disappear, because the Grand
Trunk railway system includes various
roads which operate in the United States,
and they will be in a position similar to
that of the United States railways turning
business over to the Grand Trunk. Therefore, instead of bringing to the Government
railway system an extra tonnage of 26,569,799 tons and bringing the total tonnage
of the entire system up to 51,317,869 tons, it
is quite probable that the total tonnage
which the Grand Trunk will be able to add
to the Government railways will not be
more than half of the figures here given.
Of course, I make this statement as an esti-

APRIL 28, 1921
mate of what may happen, because there
is no possible way of arriving at definite
figures as to the situation; but I do think
that it ahould appeal to honourable gentlemen in this flouse that the chances of the
Canadian Government systemn being able
to obtain the business- that the old Grand
Trunk systemi obtained in the past are
very slight indeed. Natnrally the Amerjeans will wish to help their own lines and
will feel that they are nhot called upon to
ships goods over the Canadian Governnient
line.
Then there ia the other question, which
has been threshed out in this flouse before,
of the Canadian Government system being
subject to the laws of several of the states
when the Grand Trunk lines are taken over,
and being subject also to the United States
commerce law.
The whole situation shows that it is an
exceedingly serions matter to the country
that we should have to 'continue with this
legisiation and to take over this system.
I wish some way could be devised of making
another arrangement and relîeving the
Go'ernment of the onus of taking over this
,Grand Trunk system. But from the remarkcs of my honourable friend it -seems
that the Government is so set in its views
on this matter that nothing that can be
said or done by honourable gentlemen in
this Chamber will bring the Government
to see the terrible dangers, especially the
financial danger, to which they are exposing this country by undertaking to mun the
Grand Trunk system, which begins in the
United States and ends in the United
States. I wish there were some way of
changing this whole situation and saving
the country fromn what I fear will add
largely to the financial troubles of Canada.
As hononrable gentlemen may rernember,
we have this year placed in the estimates
the sum of $89,000,000 for the purpose of
dealing with the finances of the Grand
Trunk systemn when we take it over. I
wish I could believe that that $89,000,000
was ail the money that the Govemnment
would have to find In order to finance the
system. I do not think that any honourable gentleman who has studied the condition of the Goverument railways can feel
any assurance or confidence that the management of the Catiadian Goverument railways and of the Grand Trunk system, when
it is brought in, wlll be lmproved 'In àny
shape or form. Unfortunately the way in

ernment ownership and operation of railways will be a-success. Since the Government took over the Canadiani Northern
system and assumed responsibility for
operating it in connection with the Intercolonial, the National Transcontinental and
the Grand Trunk Pacifie, the railway situation in this country has, it seems to me,
gone £rom bad to worse. We have been
called upon year after year to provide
larger and larger suma of money for the
purpose of financing the Government railways, and from one end of this country to
the other we find that the organization and
management of the Government systemn is
far from being ail that could be desired.
Only the other day I was reading in a
financial paper published in this country
an article dealing with the present situation, in which it pointed ont that another
paper had published the following items.
The first item tells of a split in the ranks
of labour in Great Britain, the admission
by a labour organ of the heaviest defeat in
history and a coming reduction in wages.
The second item tells of a new wage agreement in Cleveland, Ohilo, in which the street
car employees accept a cut of 20 per cent
in wages and other reductions. The third
item cornes fromn Toronto and tells of an
advance in wages of steam-shovel engineers,
firemen, and cranemen on the C.N.R.
In practically ail the newspapers that we
take up, whether pnblished in the United
States, in England, or in Canada, we are
told that on account of the present conditions it is necessary to reduce wages in
business and to cnt down expenses In every
possible direction. Yet, curiously, we find
that the Governmcnt railways, instead of
reducing wages, are now increasing them.
Questions have been asked in this flouse
with regard to the wages fixed by the
McAdoo award and also by the Chicago
award. There is no honourable gentleman
in this flouse but feels that the wages paid
to the railway men at the present time,
under those awards, are sncb that something wili have to be done if railway transportation in Canada is to be carried on in
the interest of the country and in a way
that will enable the people of Canada to do
business and ship their goods as they were,
accustomed to doing in the years gone by;
yet we find that the Government system of
railways, instead of trying to dedrease
wages and bring about more reasonable
transportation rates,,have raised the wages
of those men.
A gregt deal has been said Iately about
the management of government railways,

344

SENATE

and reasons have been given from the
management side to show why deficits occur
in the operation of Government roads.
From some of the statements made by the
managers one would be led to think that
the people of this country were not doing
their duty by the Government railwaysnot trying to ship goods by the Government
lines. It might almost be thought that the
Government railways were being boycotted
by the people of this country. But the evidence that I have been able to obtain points
in the other direction. From the West especially I have heard nothing but complaints
of the way in which the business of the
Government railways has been handled, and
the lack of consideration shown by the
management for the interest and requirements of the people of the country. The
difficulty in obtaining freight cars is se
great that it has militated very severely
against the business of Canada. With regard to the shipments of grain, I was told
not long ago that grain located on a line
of the Canadian Northern railway in the
West was soid at 8 cents a bushel less than
the same grain could be sold for on a line
of the Canadian Pacific railway. That is
a serious state of affairs for this country,
for it means a great loss to the farmers of
Canada, and it shows that there must be
something seriously wrong with the management of the Government railway system.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I do not quite
understand the honourable gentleman.
What would the railways have to do with
the selling of grain?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The service was
so bad.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I will explain to
the honourable gentleman. The position, as
I understand it, is this. The grain on the
Canadian Northern railway had to be sold
at 8 cents a bushel less because the shipper of the grain could not get cars to
deliver it, and therefore could not undertake
to have it delivered at a certain point within a certain time. If the owner of that
grain had it on the Canadian Pacific railway he could have got cars and could be
sure that the grain would be delivered at
a certain time.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Well, I have
grave doubts of the accuracy of that statement.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think I could
prove it te the honourable gentleman if he
wants to have it proved.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, prove it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Only the other day
I received a letter from the WestHon. Mr. BENNETT: May I ask the
honourable gentleman, would that refer to
the Government railways in the province
of Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No. I think it was
farther West than that.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Then perhaps it
was on the pioneer lines.
Hon. Sir· JAMES LOUGHEED: Might
not the same thing happen ,on a Canadian
Pacific line?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Quite so.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no. The
trouble is the bad service, that is all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is it
really? Does my honourable friend know?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is the bad
service.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I might refer lionourable gentlemen to another case that
occurred on the Canadian Northern Railway. On June 25, 1919, I brought to the
attention of the House a letter from a company in British Columbia. The Basque
Chemical Production Company, Limited,
was developing a very large deposit of sulphate of magnesia 12 miles west of Ashcroft, B.C., near the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian Northern main lines.
The letter continues:
Shipments of several hundred carloads per
annum will be made, partly for use as a
medicine but mostly for corpmercial purposes.
One of the essentiais in insuring the success
of this enterprise is prompt and efficient transportation service. This commodity will not
stand delay in transportation.
It is the desire of our company to erect a
reflnery, warehouses, etc., and ship from Epsom
Spur on the Canadian Northern railway, two
miles west of Basque. It is qui.te possible to
ship over the Canadian Pacific railway from
Basque Siding, but as the Canadian Northern Is
now a Government enterprise we would prefer,
if possible, to make our shipments over that
line.
We could not make a success of our business,
however, if we were handicapped by unreasonable delay to our shipments.
As an instance of the unnecessary and unreasonable delays to freight shipments occurring on the Canadian Northern line we mlght
say that we made a trial shipment of sulphate
of magnesia from Ashcroft to Pennsylvania,
billed over the Canadian Northern and Pennsylvania lines. This shipment was received by
the Canadian Northern on June 29 and turned
over by that line to the Grand Trunk at North
Bay on August 19, being 51 days in transit over
the Canadian Northern.

APRIL 28, 1921
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The shipper could
bave walked the distance in that time.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is an instance
of the way in which the business is done.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: How
large a shipment was it? Has my honohrable friend any information?
Hon; Mr. BOSTOCK: That was just a
sample carload.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Was it
a carload?
Hon. Mr.
BOSTOCK:
It was a
sample carload. They wlere to somne extent
doubtlul of the way in which the business
was being handled on the Canadian Northern, and they shipped this sample carload
for the purpose of making a test.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
very necessary that we should have the
thi'rd reading of this Bill to-morrow, for.
the purpose of concluding the agreement
with the Company which is referred to
therein, so that it may be submitted to the
shareholders. If we have an understanding that the Bi is to be, given third reading to-inorrow, we could dispense with
sitting to-night.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
From what I
know I do not think we could have an
understanding of that kind. There may
be a good deal of discussion about the
amnendments thht my honourable friend has
brought down to-day.
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: Then
we had better sit to-night. It is now six

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Before the
motion is put, may I point out that we
cen hardly hope to give the third reading
ta this Bill to-morrow, even if it is, read
the second time to-day, because to-morrow
the Bill will be at the committee stage.
How could my honourable frieiid take the
two stages in one sitting to-morrow?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
it invariably has been the practice if there

is no amendipent in committee.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the honourable gentleman has given notice of an
aniendment himself.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
If there is no departure from that, -I see
no reason why the House should not give
the Bill the third reading.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why, there are
pienty of objections to giving it the third
reading. We should not pass it at ail.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then I
will give notice of a motion for the suspension of the rules.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resunied at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK (continuing): Honourable gentlemen, when we rose at 6
o'clock I had reand to the House a statement
fromn a company in British Columbia showing the difficulty they had when they made
a trial shipment of a carload of stuif to
see what the resuit would be and whether
they could develop their business by using
the Canadian Government railroad, which
they naturally wanted to do if they could.
They were s0 situated that they could
use either the Canadian National railway
or the -Canadian Pacific railway, and although I have no information on the point,
I fancy alter their experience that their
' business has been done over the Canadian
Pacifie.
The other day I received another letter
from a gentleman who hives in British
Columbia. He had also been in California.
His letter is dated April'14, 1921. He first
of ail says that hie is very much interested
in the development of the fishing industry
at Prince Rupert, and then goes on:
It ls impossible to get fish cars for our trade,
but there is no dearth of special trains for
joy-ridinS purposes. 1 bave seen two epeeials
in one day coming here and each of them
crowded wlth old women who possibly neyer
bad a ride in a Pullman car before in their
lite, and some of these joy riders were s0 old
and decrepit that they had one car fitted up
with brass beds. This I saw myself and can
substantiate it.

Ris eomplaint is that they have not.been
able to develop the fishing industry of
Prince Rupert as they wish to do because
they cannot get the cars they require fromn
the Grand Trunk Pacific portion of the
Government road. The fishing industry is
a very important one-it is hargely halibut
fishing-and of course it is necessary to

If
continent.
the fish across the
accommodation can be had at Prince
Rupert, the whole of the halibut industry can be worked from there instead
of from Vancouver as it used to be, but
this gentleman's complaint is that when
they want cars they cannot get them from
the Government road. He goes on to say:
I spent the winter in Les Angeles and attended
the annual pienie at Ocean Park held each
year for the Canadian tourists. There were
fifteen thousand Canadians present, and among
the numerous speakers was an official of our
Canadian National Railways. He recounted the
mileage and the size and glory of the system,
and told us everything about the road except
the deficit. He proudly told us of the new
offices recently opened in Frisco and the proposed new offices to be opened in Los Angeles
and many other American cities. These I presume have been opened before this, as it was in
January that this meeting took place. Knowing
California as I do, I know that the cost of
renting and equipping and maintaining such
offlices as the speaker boasted of as "second to
none" would be a very expensive and criminally
useless matter, because every man from Canada
who heard him speak had a return ticket in his
pocket. The cost of upkeep of these American
offices must be enormous, and I will venture the
opinion that if the revenue derived from the
business that may come through them were
made public it would torpedo the whole business. I do not think that the people of Canada
have the slighest idea of what is going on in
the way of waste and incompetence. It is simply
inconceivable.

I think that very plainly shows the way

in which the management of this Government railway are carrying on the business

of the country. They are spending money
extravagantly on offices and advertising the
roads in directions where they are unlikely
to get very much business, and at the same
time they are not looking after the interests of the country and the development of
the business of the country where it is
necessary to do so. The people of this country are only too anxious to use the Government railroads, and if they are given
proper facilities and proper opportunities
of doing business with them they will do so.
I noticed the other day that the Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners made the statement in Vancouver that
it has cost the country $10,000,000 to establish the passenger train that runs between
Montreal and Vancouver. He estimated the
cost of running that train at between $7,000,000 and $8,000,000 a year, and he estimated the revenue that would be derived
from its operation at $2,000,000 a year. It
seems to me that the difference between the
cost of operation and the return is too
great, and that some change should be made.
Either the train is too expensive for the
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

service, or there is something wrong in the
method of running it, for the cost of operation is out of all proportion to the return.
Of course, every honourable gentleman realizes that there is a tremendous expense incurred by railways to-day when they are not
carrying the traffic, especially passenger
traffic, that they should be carrying. There
are, I think, many trains that could be dispensed with. It seems to me that this is a
matter which requires attention and would
bear Iooking into with a view to saving all
the money that can possibly be saved.
I have tried to point out to the House the
way in which the Government road is being managed. What I have said is not of
a nature to inspire confidence in its management, or to cause anyone to feel confident that when the Government takes over
the Grand Trunk system it will do anything
more than increase the expense and very
seriously injure the country, owing to the
enormous amount of money that we shall
be called upon to find to pay off the deficits
that will occur.
There is another point in regard to this
Bill which I think is a very serious one. I
refer to the lack of information not only in
regard to the Government railroads, but
also in regard to the Grand Trunk Railway
system. I would have supposed that when
the Government were bringing down this
Bill and asking Parliament to deal with this
matter again, they would at least have made
some statement to show what has been the
result of the operation of the Grand Trunk
system during the last year from the lst
of January to the 31st of December.
Under the provisions of the Railway Act
the company were required to make a
return to the Government showing their
operations and containing a general statement of their affairs. So far as I know, no
statement of that kind has been submitted
in the other House and no information has
been given to the country to enable the
people to know whether this railway is
doing better or worse than it did two or
three years ago. The only statement I
have seen is the statement of the Prime
Minister that the country had to find $47,000,000 to provide for the financial requirements of the Grand Trunk Railway Company. It does seem to me that the policy
of the Government with regard to the handling of railways has not proved to be a
success. I think the Government, as it is
bent on taking over the Grand Trunk Railway system, should go very seriously into
the matter and adopt some other policy;
and I personally do not see that they can

APRIL 28, 1921
do any thing better than bring the railways more directly under the control of
Parliament and make the management of
the system more directly responsible to Parliament, because the representatives of the
people are the men who have to bear the
responsibility of seeing that the road is
made to serve the country properly and
economically. As I understand the situation at the prement time, the management
are simply allowed to manage the road as
they think best. As far as I know, they
have flot shown any appreciation of the
necessity of watching the general condition of the country and trying to organize the road and run it for the benefit and
the development of the industries of the
country.
A question was raiged the other day in
another place with regard to the way in
which trains are being handled upon the
National Transcontinental at the present
time. It is quite evident from what was
said on that occasion that the management
do not give proper attention to developini
the business of the country. The only way
in which this whole railway systemi can
be made to pay is by doing everything
possible to develop the business of the
country and to see that that business is
handled ýby the railway. Proper 'business
methods should be used in the management
of the system, so that people may know
that when they want a car for the shipment of their goods they can get it, and
that their goods will be carried to their
destination within a reasonable time andz
with reasonable certainty.
I could mention a considerable number
of other items, that have come to my attention with regard to this question, but I
do not want to take up too much of the
time of the House.
With regard to the Bill before us, we
cannot really do anything: we are committed to tbis policy. The Governiment has
tied itself down to thie, agreement with
the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and
if it were possible for us to take any action
that would tend to intetfere with the
Government policy, we might biring about a
worse condition of things than exists at
the present 'lime. The -Senate hias already
expressed its opinion with. regard to taking
over the Grand Trunk Railway system. If
il could have done so, il would have prevented the Government getting itseif into
the position which il occupies to-day in connection with the agreement with the Grand
Trunk Railway Company. But inasmuch
as il is practically impossible for us to

deal with the question, ail we can do is
to leave to the Government the responsibility of working out this problemn and explaining to the country why it is that the
tremendous burden which I am satisfied
will be -the result of this Bill has been
placed upon our shoulders. I can only hope
that the Government will be able to find
a solution of this problem and that il will
do so with very little delay.
Hon. GEORGE G. FOSTER: Ho nourable
gentlemen, for purely personal reasons' I
had hoped that if the Government were
going to, take over the Grand Trunk railway the purchase might have been consummated without any further reference to
Parliament. I gather, however, from the
explanation of the leader of the House,
and from the speeches that have Ibeen
made in another place, that the Government has come to the conclusion that il is
necessary once more to come to, Parliament
to obtain power to extend the arbitration
which has been goink on, and also to obtain
power to assume the management and
directorship of the Grand Trunk system.
That is the only pmeasure which is before
this House to be discussed or considered
by us.
I cannot think, honourable gentlemen,
that the officials and those in charge of the
Grand Trunk 'railway 'arbitration havle
acted with what energy and zeal they should
have acted, in pressing the arbitration to a
conclusion, and il seems to me that there
-must have been some motive in what to an
outsider seems unpardonable and unnecessary delay. One hesitates before ascribing
motives to such a combination as the
Grand Trunk organization; but when we see
that arbitration delayed for days and weeks,
notwithstanding repeated warnings, until
vast sumns fail due, when notice is served
upoe the Government within a few hours,
or days, of the due date when they must
pay these sums, il looks very much to me as
though, the Grand Trunk authorities had
counted upon stampeding the -Goverument
into making these additional payments-and
making surer than they otherwise would be
of the ultimate consummation of this transaction. 1So far as I am concerned, I stand
to-day, as I have always stood, unutterably
opposed to Government ownership, and the
purchase of the Grand Trunk railway. But
r can see that no useful purpose could be
servedby me, or any other member of this
House, opposing uselessly, as the leader of
the Opposition has said, a, measure which

SENATE
the Government. bas taken the responsibility of saying is in the best interests of
this country.
For myself, I would have been glad if
the Government had said to the Grand
Trunk Railway Company, when they failed
to complete their arbitration: "You have
exaggerated your values; you have told
your shareholders that we are confiscating
their property; you have injured the good
name of Caiada by your newspaper propaganda; you have not carried out the agreement we made with regard to this arbitration, and you can keep your property." I
quite understand that serious consequences
would have followed in the adjustment of
the money due the Government, both in
connection with other obligations and in the
matter of securities which they have paid
for since this legislation passed; but all
of that might have been adjusted, and had
they come to Parliament with a generous
settlement embodying the balances due
them, they would have had the support of
Parliament, and I believe, the support of the
country.
However, after consideration, the Government bas decided to make this last offer
to the Grand Trunk, and while I hope that
the common stockholders in England will
refuse to accept the Government's offer, I
cannot but think that in carrying out the
policy which they have laid down they are
entitled to be congratulated upon the courage they have shown in refusing to be
sandbagged into the payment of vast sums
on account of a property which somebody
else owns and someone else manages.
I am sure that the members of this
Chamber, as the people of Canada, have
been deeply interested in what is known
as Lord Shaughnessy's letter to the Prime
Minister. The suggestion made by Lord
Shaughnessy is not before us, but I am one
of those who believe that the proposition
was put before the Government, so far as
Lord Shaughnessy himself is concerned,
with the patriotic hope that either directly
or indirectly it might lead to some solution
of the dangerous conditions we are in with
regard to railway problems.
I am not going to say to-day that if
this proposition were before us it would
not require grave study and consideration;
nor can one who is not a practical railway
man form a mature opinion within the few
hours which have elapsed since it was first
made public. I can, however, see grave
national objections to the plan as submitted.
I yield to no man here or elsewhere my
admiration for and my appreciation of the
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

great citizen who formulated that plan. I
realize that we who are true Canadians
owe him a great debt for the service he bas
rendered Canada in successfully managing
the great corporation over which he presides and which has done so much to advance our country. The sacrifices he bas
made and the services be bas rendered
in times of peace and war entitle him or
any plan that he may formulate to the
greatest consideration of our people.
Although that letter is not before this
House, it has been given to us at this time
in order that it may create discussion and
comment, and it is well that the people
should give it consideration; and while in
its entirety it may not be acceptable, there
are many principles in it which may now
or hereafter be adopted when people have
finally realized, as they will ere· long
where Government ownership will lead
them.
If Lord Shaughnessy had all the energy,
wonderful ability and patriotism which be
has shown since he. was fifty years of age,
or if be were fifty years of age to-day, I
might feel bound to accept his suggestion,
because I should feel sure that for at least
a quarter of a century hé would be at the
helm to guide the great corporation which
be has proposed to create-not only to
guide that corporation, but one might almost say to guide the destinies of Canada
-because the man who was head of a
proposition such as Lord Shaughnessy proposes would be far more influential and
important than any Premier that ever
ruled in Ottawa. He would have the trade
of the country, the transportation of the
country, the finances of the country, and
the whole future of the country in his
hands, notwithstanding everything that
could be said or done by governments, railway commissions, or any known power.
Lord Shaughnessy's proposition is to hand
over to one corporation the whole future
of Canada; a corporation to-day composed
of the ablest men as directors and the best
board of railways operators on this continent; a combination so strong that the
shrewdest financial men in the United
States were quite willing to pay $275 for
C.P.R. stock when the richest, best managed
and best patronized American railway
was selling for half that money. But my
principal objection to the proposal is that
Lord Shaughnessy is not fifty years of age.
He and the men I referred to are only too
fast approaching the time when their activities will flag; and who will then be the
autocrats of Canada? He bas around him

APRIL 28, 1921
some young men of great ability; but no
man's life is certain, and when somne day,
soon or remote, the C.P.R. has a new board,
new management and new vision, what
may be the influences which will guide them
in dictatîng the vast interests which would
then be in their hands?
I do flot wish to say at this time that
most careful consideration should not be
given to Lord Shaughnessy's proposition,
but I can see many good rea sons why it
must be approached with great caution.
It has been said that those of us 'who
criticize what has been done have nothing
to propose. It ,may seern courageous for
one to propose anything ini the face of ail
the difficulties and dangers which surround
this proposition, but the people of Canada
would not, ini my opinion, be satisfled to
accept the rule of a monoply such as has
been proposed.
Let the Government go to Lord Shaughnessy with somethung like the following
story: "You have reached that tixne in life
when every honour and every success that
can corne to a man have been yours; corne
and help the people of Canada to organize
their railway property, dis4ssociated from
every C.P.R. interest."
Some people would say, "Lord Shaughnessy could neyer disassociate hiinself from
the C.P.R." 1 say that he could do so, and
stand at the head and guide us as he does
in bis present position in the creation of a
-great organization which could fairly coinpete with the one he left. Some ill-disposed
person would say that this would only be a
camouflage, and the C.P.R. would then own
and control ail railway transportation in
Canada with Beatty at the head of one and
Shaughnessy at the head of the other. I
have too much faith ini the patriotism and
ability of Lord Shaughnessy not to know
that if he would undertake this task he
would do it with the single idea of serving
the country, and I would put in his hands
without reserve or hesitation the creation
of an organization that would be a healthy,
fair, honest competitor of the C.P.R.
What we should have, if we are going
to continue either to manage this property
ourýselves,' or to create a inew corporation,
separate and distinct from the C.P.R. and
the Governrmnent, owned and controlled by
meni who are venturesome enough to put
their inoney unto this proposition, is the
spirit which actuated the men who created
and worked out the C.P.R. problems In
their early stages.
I could not help thinking, on Tuesday
afternoon, as 1 came up on the train, that

there was a lesson for every Member of
Parliament and every Senator who was
on that C.P.R. 4 o'clock train. Pulling out
of Montreal at the saine tinie as the Grand
Trunk, was the -C.P.R. running neck-andneck as far as St. Anne's, and across the.
river. At this point the enguneer of the
Grand Trunk pulled his cap over one eye,
looked out of the wundow of his cab, and,
with a fireman working as though for his
lýfe, shovellung ini coal, he waved his hand
to the C.P.R., pulled open the throttle, and
gradually step by step pulled away with
a train of people and employees enthusiastically applaudung, evidently happy at the
very idea of their successful competition
with the great road on which we were
travelling. There was not a mian on that
train who did flot sympathize with that
engineer. 'There was not an, employee,
newsboy, brakeman, mail clerk, baggageman or passenger on it that did not look
and act as if he were at a horse race. That
is the spirit in which we must look forward and hope these two corporations wilI
compete in the developmnent of Canada.
There is no man living who could put
that 'spirit unto the Govennment roads like
Lord Shaughnessy; there is no -man living
who knows the conditions -of Canada ai he
does, or who could serve Canada as he
might, and, while I hesitate at niy presumiption, I say to the Govennment, you
have one chance ini a million, and that
chance is centered around the man who has
made you a proposition; who has thereby
shown his unterest ini your welfare, and
who xnight be unduced to make this final
sacrifice by which hie would place bis namne
far and away above the naine of any Canadian of this or any past generation.
I amn going to vote for this Bill because,
as I have said, I do not see any object or
useful purpose ini opposung it. I sincerely
hope, although I have been opposed to
Government operation from the beginnung,
that the prophesies and visions and views of
those who have supported it may be true,
and that you and I rnay live to see the time
when the great problem which faces us
to-day mnay be safely solved, ini order that.
this country may be saved froni that disaster which in the minds of many men le
only too apparent.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, I shahl apparently be alone in
the position I am going to take, but I
intend once more to enter my protest
against the Bill. I wou'ld be recreant to
my conscience and my convictions if 1
assented to the Bill beung read the second

SENATE
time, and would be sorry if my silence
should arouse suspicion of my having
approved of it. I cannot approve of it,
and I must briefly state my reasons for
protesting against its second reading.
I object because it is simply continuing
along the line of the greatest madness on
which this country has ever entered. I do
not delude myself with any idea that my
words will have any effect whatever. I
fully realize that I am speaking only as
one, for myself, and I am quite sure of the
utter futility, at this stage and under the
circumstances, of protesting against the
second reading. I am doing it, however,
in order to acquit my conscience in the
matter. To me it is a matter of profound regret that the people of this country
have taken the attitude they have assumed
ever since the question of our Government
going into the operating of railways has
arisen. There has been no public opinion
expressed anywhere except in this House;
and if I needed any examplè to convince
me of the utter futility of protesting, all
I would have to do would be to remember
that when the Government entered into
this project honourable members of this
House, ten or twelve of them, men of
character and great ability and sincerity,
were in open rebellion for three or four
weeks, going through the corridors of Parliament protesting vehemently against the
madness of the Government proposal. Not
until the last moment-for reasons which
I am not going to question, and which I
have no doubt were inspired by the best
motives- did they relent and agree to

gentlemen to whom I refer, constituting
probably as strong a group of members of
Parliament as could be found in either
House, found their protest to be unavailfing, it is not to wondered at that in the country there was little expression of opinion on
the subject. I mention the fact in order to
show that a solemn, continued protest of
that kind was wholly insufficient to rouse
public opnimin. The action of those gentlemen had the same effect as the dropping of
a small stone in a large body of'water: it
simply created a momentary ripple to
which nobody paid any attention, and
which was of no avail whatever.
To-day the situation is worse. The press
of the country bas been chloroformed. We
have no information whatever from the
Government: we have no statement furnished as to what has been done during
the years the Government bas operated the
rai'lway. No man in this country to-day
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

can put his finger on the reasons why we
have had those enormous deficits every
year; or on any reason why we are going
to have deficits, in the words of Lord
Shaughnessy for at least twelve years.
The first of those deficits he puts down at
$80,000,000.
We are not even told
what the deficit has really been in the
last year. Yet Parliament is asked to give
its support to this measure without the
elementary and most essential information
which might enable Parliament to form a
proper opinion as to whether this policy
should be kept up any longer.
When the Government entered into Government operation they must have known,
they must have 'been told by their railway
advisers, that Government ownership, or
rather Government operation, the world
over had been an utter failure. In every
country in this world which has attempted
Government operation it has utterly failed.
It is true that in one or two places, in Prussia for instance, the returns once showed
a surplus; but it did not take very long to
discover that the apparent surplus was
merely the result of cooking the books.
Take it anywhere you like, you will find
that Government operation has been a dismal failure, riot within a few years, but
for all the years past; and if it has been a
failure in countries like Prussia, Germany,
Belgium,
France and the British Isles,
where there are about 500 people to the
square mile, what can we expect in Canada, where we have not five people to the
square mile? There are a hundred times
more people within a given area in any
one of those countries than we have in Canada. The railways there are engaged in
carrying mostly, if not altogether, manufactured goods, and in carrying those goods
for short distances, while in Canada our
railways ýcarry almost exclusively raw
materials across a continent with tremendous distances. Yet some people in this
country will tell you that Government
operation was the proper thing for this
Government to have recourse to. The thing
is madness, utter madness. It is madness
to-day; it will be madness in ten years; it
will be madness in fifty years. You cannot possibly ever make Government operation in this country a success. And yet,
in the face of the results elsewhere and
the dismal failure the whole thing has
been, Parliament is asked to-day to continue this thing indefinitely.
Is there any gentleman, in Parliament
or outside of Parliament, who can give any
sort of an adequate idea of the assets that

APRIL 28, 1921
we have taken over? Can anyone, a niember of Parliarnent or anyone else, tell what
is the v~alue of those assets? We know
partly what the obligations iýre, but I arn
one of those who think that we know only
haif the truth. We have been told that
the obligations of those two great railwdy
systerns arnount to about $700,000,000 or
$800,000,000; but 1 venture to say that
thoee obligations are double that, and when
the truth is out I think we will have confirmation ofwhat; 1 am now saying. What
are the assets? We are told that the taking
over of those assets by the Governent was
their justification for incurring this terrifie
burden. I ask any business man in this
House, what would he do with an asset
which for years had netted him nothing but
deficits, and which for ail the years to
corne, sýo far as he can see, is going to, net
hirn nothing but deficits? Is not that the
kind of asset that you want to throw into
the sea as quickly as you can? Yet, I
repeat, in the light of ail this we are asked
to-day to proceed with this matter. The
debt of Canada is not what speakers in
this House and in another place constantly
say it is-$2,000,000,000 odd. The debt of
Canada to-day is four billions of dollars,
flot two billions, and it is mnisleading the
public, it is hypnotizing oneself, to go on
repeating that the debt of Canada is two
billions when it is four billions.
What is the pretext given? I look upon
it as nothing but a pretext. 1 cannot for
one momnent think that those who were
responsible for the Government of the
country at the tirne were blessed with so
little intelligence and so little knowledge
that they did not know the circurnstances
nor realize that this resuit was inevitable.
But a pretext was found, and what was it?
It was said that unless the Government
took over. these iailways Canada's credit
^would be very seriously injured. Is not
Canada's credit much more injured to-day
by. the fact that we have increased our
indebtedness by 100 per cent? Would our
credit have been half as much injured if
those railway corporations--the Canadian
Northern, for instance-had been allowed
to go *by the board or to nieet the fate
which every batlkrupt must xneet? Every
mian. who has been in -business in this
country and who finds biniseîf confronted
with bankruptey must go into liquidation.
That is the common fate of banlcrupts not
only in this country but everywhere in the
world. There is oily one alternative for
the business man: he must succeed or fail.
If he fails he takes the consequencer-the

351

fate which every business man who fails
must meet. There is only one way to deal
with that situation, and that is to allow
the bankrupt concern to go into bankruptcy
and be liquidated. That the Governrnent
did flot do so is the great mistake which
was nmade by the Government at that time,
and I say to them that it would be infinitely
preferable that the Grand Trunk and th*.
Canadian Northern should go under the
hanimer and be disposed ofas any bankrupt concern must be than that Canada
should go on year after year incurring
these huge deficits. I say, the C.P.R., or
anything you like, rather than what we
are doing to-day.
I have no railway experience and would
not venture the expression of any opinion
as to the value of Lord Shaughnessy's proposal. I take great care not to do that,
because I realize that I arn wholly incompatent to do so. One thing I will say:
though I may not be in favotir of the
projeet, I want to say, with regard
to, Lord Shaughneissy, that I believe
he is as rnuch intarested in Canada
as any of us. He is the head of
the greatest corporation in Canada. The
C.P.R. is as mach interested in the success
or reputation of Canada as anybody could
be. It is the greatest corporation in the
land-probably the greatest corporation in
the world. If Canada bacarne bankrupt
because of 'engaging in this business of
operating railways, the C.P.R. would suifer
probably to a greater extent than any other
corporation or any other individual in
Canada.
Let the Governinent stop and think. Let
thern try to realize the situation in which
they have placed this country and flot; go
haadlong withouý reflection and without
realizing what they have done.
While
there is yet tirne, before they rush this
Bill through, let them think. If we are
going to have deficits, and apparently we
are and for a very long tijue, let us
take tirne to consider the situation.
Let not this Governinent corne at the
last moment and insist upon Parliament;
adopting this nieasure within a faw hours.
Are the Governnient going to allow the
Senate only seven or eight hours to discuss
this rneasure? We are told that it rnust
go through at once and that no further
discussion will 'be allowed. 1 say it is rnadness-nadness of the worst kind.
I stand for Governrnent control. If this
system of railways were handed over to
the C.P.R. to administer it, the Govern-,
ment and the people of Canada would have

SENATE

52

in their hands a weapon by which they
could bring the C.P.R. or anybody else to
time, and that is the Railway Board. Government control, not Government operation. Private operation, but Government
control. You could bring the C.P.R. to
time to-morrow if they attempted to make
exactions upon the Canadian people. But
you cannot remedy the other situation:
you are going to be in the hands of almost
half the people of Canada which will be
in the employment of the Government.
It will be imperium in imperio. You are
going to have the railway employees of this
country absolutely controlling the Government. It is not going to be a system of Government-owned railways; it is going to be
a case of the people who manage the railways owning the Government. Why, if any
Government in this country are desirous of
doing it, they can so conduct themselves
as to remain in power and perpetuate
iniquities of this kind indefinitely.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Until final
bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Until final bankruptcy. There is no other solution, honourable gentlemen, but Government control. Government ownership, as I have
said, has been a failure everywhere else
in the world, and here it has been about
the greatest failure there ever was.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Do we not own
the railways now? Why advertise to the
world that they are no good? The C.P.R.,
to which the honourable gentleman refers,
will not give you anything for them if you
run them down.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is a difference between advertising to the world that
these railways are no good, and the duty
that is ours to realize, that they are no
good and to tell the people so, in order to
stop this deal now if we can.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: If we do own
them now, it may be an advantage to take
over even the Grand Trunk.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would go to
the extent of saying that if we own them
now, the sooner we get rid of them the
better.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: But there is no
use in advertising or giving it away that
we think they are no good.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I said a
moment ago, this country would be at the
mercy of the officials and railway employees of Canada. That is no exaggeraHon. Mr. BEIJCOURT.

tion; and what makes it worse is that it
would not be our own people who would
exercise that control. We would be, as
we are to-day, at the mercy of international labour. If it were so desired, Mr.
Gompers or any other of the international
labour leaders could come te Canada and
organize a strike on our railways. We are
the slaves of the labour leaders in the republic to the south of us. Is that an exaggeration?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, sir.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think it is not,
andHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:-I will give you
the proof of it. About ten years agoperhaps a little more than that, perhaps
fifteen years ago-one of those agitators
came over to this country and organized a
strike in the Printing Bureau, and for
three weeks this adventurer from the
United States theld the iGovernment of
Canada at bay. For three weeks! If that
man could do it with the Printing Bureau,
why could not the whole international
labour organization, if it chose, come and
do likewise with our railways? I say that
in this matter we are to-day the slaves,
nothing but the slaves, of international
labour, and if those gentlemen wished tomorrow to smash the whole Government
railway system, they could do it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend a question just there?
Does my honourable friend see any difference between the Government owning the
railways and private interests owning them,
so far as concerns the ability of labour to
press its demands?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, an'enormous
difference.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It would not
make any difference whatever if the
employees upon the railwayHon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend put a question: perhaps I had better
answer it. I say it makes an enormous
difference, because in the case of private
ownership the Government of Canada have
the power and the duty to see that justice
is done; but in the case of Government
ownership the Government would be within
the power of these very men and would be
tied hand and foot. That is the difference.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not at all.

APRIL 28, 1921
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, I wish to say ernphaticaily that
so far as I arn concerned I arn moved by
no party spirit at ail, not; the slightest.
To my mind this question is above and
beyond ail parti"l in Canada. If the
Liberal party were in power and were face
to face with this horrible situation, I do
not; know what they would do--I have flot
the slightest idea; b~ut I would tiy to
exercise any influence I might have to
induce them to abandon Government operation. I do not know whether they couid
find a solution any more readily than can
the present Government. It behooves ahl
Canadians, whether Liberal or Conservative, to adopt the proper measure to, end the
present situation'. It is bankruptcy, inevitable bankruptcy, thet stares us in the face.
Are Party considerations or any other to be
aliowed to weigh against that?
I feel very strongly on this question. I
have given myseif for many years past
the trouble 6f investigating the 'question
of ýGovernment ownersbip and Government operation throughout the world. It
is not so xnany years ago 'that; in
the Senate I deiivered quite a long
speech on the subject. I speak from deep
conviction based on the facts and the
proofs which are before us to-day, and I
cannot understand how an honourabie
gentleman, like the leader of this House
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed), can deny the
inevitable resuit of Government ownership
and operation. If my honourable friend
could tell us exactly what he thinks about
Government operation, I think we shouid

to the solution of the problem. Do not
rush this tbing through. Do not go on
paying millions and millions to this corporation without knowinig where you are
going to end. Perhaps you do know: as I
put it before, the end is bankruptcy. The
situation seemes to.be so plein, so palpable,
that I cannot understand wby the people do
rot see it; but I think the people throughout Canada wouid see it if tbey only had
an opportunity of knowing the facts. They
do not know the facts. Tbey have dispiayed
in this matter a degree of apathy that is

reaiiy aiarming. It is aiarming for the
future of Canada. If a matter of this
kind cannot arouse public opinion in
Canada, I do not; know just what wili
arouse it. It is a niatter that is vital to
our existence, to our very life, and yet
five or six bours are given to Parliament
to disc1i'ss this measure. I say, honourabie
gentlemien-and I say it with all the earnestuess of whieh I arn capable-it is utter
madness.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourabie gentlemen, frorn the moment that this question
of purchasing the Grand Trunik system was
mentioned I have been convinced it was a
great inistake, and my conviction has been
strengthened by the resuit. I agree with
most of the reasons that have been given
by the honourable member froni Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Beicourt) and I share his opinion in very many respects. I amn convinced, for reasons which I will give briefly,
that it is a great niistake, an exceedingly
bad bargain, into which this country should
neyer have entered. But I arn unable, convinced though I am of the soundness of the
reasons whicb the honourable member bas
stated to foliow bum to bis conclusion that
what we should do is to enter a protest. I
think that the time of protest is past. We
have to devise some constructive means;
we must try to find what are the ways, if
there are any, out of the rnuddle in which.
the country has been piaced. And wben
I use that expression I do not want to
use it offensiveiy with regard to any party.
I arn willing to admit that both oif the
great parties * in tbis country have their
share of responsibility. I do not approach
the question in any party spirit. I agree
with the honourabie member from Ottawa
that it is a question aitogether too important, aitogether too vital to tbe interests
of this great country, for us to indulge in
any politicai bias or feeling over it.
But what I bave to ask myseif, as did
the honourable member for Aima (Hon. Mr.
Foster), is this question: what is our position and what must we do in view of it?
I consider that it was, I repeat, a great
mistake on the part of the country.to enter
into this bargain; but the bargain has
been entered into and I amn afraid that the
good faith of the country is involved, and
I cannot see my way to enter a protest or
even to say that the Grovernment should
ask Parliament to repeal the Act which.was
passed at the lAst Session and. ancel of >its
own authority the agreement which the
Government thought proper te make with

SENATE

the Grand Trunk Railway Company. I am
afraid that the good faith of the country
is committed, and if there is some other
way out of the difficulty, it ought to be
found.
I have said that the agreement was, a
great mistake, and I am going to give in a
very few words the reason why I think
so. It was a mistake because there was a
great amount of capital invested in that
great system, the Grand Trunk railway.
It was European and American capital that
was invested in it; it amounted to several
hundred millions of dollars; and by the
Grand Trunk Acquisition Act of 1919 we
are obliging Canada to repay hundreds of
millions of dollars to European capitalists.
Not only are we doing that, but we are
assuming hundreds of millions of other obligations which this country will have to discharge. There is this important consideration also, that we are losing the benefit
of the association of these capitalists.
These capitalists, if they had remained
interested in this great property, would
have invested in the course of the next
forty or fifty years hundreds of millions of
dollars of new money in the development
of this system-and not only in this system
but in the creation of a large number of
other enterprises for the purpose of feed-ing
and helping the system, because they would
have felt an interest in the country. We
are cutting ourselves off from that valuable
association; we are destroying it-and for
what purpose? For the purpose, if I may
use the expression of the leader of the
Government this afternoon, of rounding
out the system. Well, I am afraid it will
prove to be for the purpose of rounding
out the bad bargain into which we have
entered.
Apart from the considerations which I
have mentioned, there is the further con%deration, and a very serious one, that this
is an international railway-a railway
situated partly in Canada and partly in
the United States. The best part of it is,
I believe, in the United States. The honourable gentleman from Kamloops (Hon.
Mr. Bostock) gave this afternoon very
important figures which go to prove that
a large proportion of the revenue of the
system is derived from the United States.
It is derived from American railways and
from American business such as the packing
houses in Chicago and in other places. That
is a business which it bas taken from fifty
to eighty years to bui-ld up. It has been
built up mainly through the energy, the
influence, the capital, of European people.
It is a business which is susceptible of
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

development in their hands; but can you
imagine for a moment, honourable gentlemen, that when this international systeni
becomes the property of the Canadian Government it will continue to enjoy the goodwill of those American houses, or that
influence will not be brought to bear upon
them to encourage other roads rather than
the property owned by the Canadian Government?
I may add another consideration which
is of importance. Is it not likely, owing
to the fact that the Canadian Government
will own this international property, a
large portion of which is subject to the
control and regulation of the American
authorities, either Federal or State, that
this Government will be involved in disputes
with those bodies which may be very disagreeable and may have very serious consequences?
These are facts which should of course
have been taken into consideration when
we entered into the bargain. Now it is
too late. The bargain bas been made, and
I am afraid it cannot be set aside except
by the consent of both parties. But, as
far as I am concerned, I believe that it is
not too late to offer another remedy;
and, although I am bound to support
the Bill as it is, when it is in
Committee I propose to offer an additional
clause, calculated to give to the Government the power to enter into an agreement
with the Grand Trunk Railway Company
whereby the Act of 1919 may be repealed,
on such terms and conditions as the Government may deem proper and fair. I
can see no other way out of the difficulty,
and I hope the Government will seriously
ponder over the situation, and, after reflection, will accept an addition of that
kind which is not intended to curtail their
powers in any shape or form, but rather
to broaden their powers, so that if they
come to the conclusion that there is a way
out of the difficulty they will be able to
take it.
It will be wise on the part of the Government and the country to pay a large
price to get out of the difficulty, to be relieved of the obligation which the Government bas assumed, and to conserve the
association of capitalists to which I have
referred. It would be money well spent. I
believe that the Grand trunk railway is a
good property if it were free of its obligations in connection with the Grand Trunk
Pacific railway. I believe that the Grand
Trunk, if it remained in the hands of a
private corporation, and were well adninistered, could be developed in this country

APRIL 28, 1921
and in the United States to such an extent that it would be a good paying property, anj I think that, in the interest of
the owners of the Grand Trunk railway and
in the interest of the Government and the
country, means should be found whereby
the bargain of 1919 could be dissolved and
a new bargain entered into.
I was at first tempted to suggest the
terms, and conditions upon which a new
bargain could be made, but I do flot think
that appertains to us. I think it wouid be
presuniption on my part, and I do flot believe that I have sufficient knowledge to do
it-that it is a matter which should be left
to the Government alter it has taken the
matter into full consideration and has consultéd the best authorities.
The amendmnent which I -willpropose, and
I. think the honourable gentleman froni
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) will second
it, ie simply that a fourth clause should
be added, in these words:

remarks whieh have fallen from the lips
of the honourable gentleman from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Foster) that there is not a
greater citizen than Lord Shaughnessy in
the Dominion of Canada, and I am sure
that the motive for his suggestion is true
patriotism and the interest of the country,
and not the interest of the Canadian Pacifie
railway.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, it is not my purpose to indulge
in extended remarks as to the advisability
or otherwise of acquiring the Grand Trunk
railway. That question was discussed and
decided two years ago.
The honourable member from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) observed that reflection is desirable before decisions are made.
I thoroughly agree with that observation,
but respectfully suggest that that reflection should have occurred back about 1903
instead of now. It might be inferred, from
some remarks that have been made to-night,
that the Government and Parliament deliberately launched upon a policy of public
ownership of railroads. We all know that
that is quite incorrect. We know that the
present railway system and the legislation
that is now before this House arose because
of necessity, and not of choice upon the
part either of the Government or of
Parliament; and the question now is, what
'is the proper and expedient thing to do
under the existing circumstances.
Briefly, the history of the situation is
something like this. In 1903 the Grand
Trunk Pacifie and Transcontinental programme was launched, and it was anticipated that the Grand Trunk Railway Company was going to operate the Transcontinental railway which was built by the
State, as well as the Grand Trunk Pacifie
Railway, the cost of which was largely
guaranteed by the Federal and Provincial
The Grand
Governments respectively.
Trunk Pacifie, for reasons of which probably all are aware, saw fit not to fulfil
its obligations under that agreement.
Subsequently the Grand Trunk Pacifie continued to make greater and greater demands
upon the country, until in March, 1919,
the Government was given five days' notice
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

that at the expiration of that time the
Grand Trunk Pacifie Company would cease
to operate. The people served by that
railway in the western provinces had
a right to expect that the road would continue to operate and serve their needs;
hence it was necessary, without very great
reflection, to act quickly and do something
to meet that situation. The upshot was
that the Minister of Railways became the
receiver of that Company, and the operation of the railway has been carried on at
a very substantial loss to the State. Then
the suggestion came from the parent Company, which had twice repudiated its obligations and agreements, that the Government and the people of Canada should
relieve it of all its obligations respecting
the Transcontinental and Grand Trunk
Pacifie railways, and that the Company
should be left in peaceable possession of
the Grand Trunk proper, which was the
piece of property it desired to retain. Time
went on, until it became apparent that even
the Grand Trunk Railway Company itself
as a separate entity was not likely to be
able to survive; and an agreement was
made two years ago and with the consent
of Parliament legislation was passed,
whereby the obligations for the debenture
stock and the guaranteed stock should be
assumed by the Government, and that the
value of the preference and common stock
should be submitted to arbitration. The
intention was that the Government, for the
people, should take over the Grand Trunk
railway, merge it with the various lines
of railway already owned by the State,
and operate all those lines as a single unit
in the interest of efficient and economical
operation. It was agreed, and provided in
the legislation passed, that the arbitration
should be concluded within a certain time.
The honourable member from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Foster) bas very properly pointed out
that without doubt the efforts that might
have ýbeen made to consummate that arbitration within the time specified were not
made.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow me to ask him whom
he blames for that?
I am not
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
attributing blame to any person, except
that I say the effort was not made; and
without imputing blame to any one I will
just state a fact or two, and my honourable friend may draw his own conclusions.
The Government and those representing
the Government in this matter were pre-

AVRIL 28, 1921
pared to proceed with the arbitration
months ago; 1 think as far back as October,
1920, they urged that the case should
proceed. It was alleged that the Grand
Trunk Railway Company was flot ready,
but would be ready at a certain date, and
the arbitration did flot begin even until
after that date; and it continued until
April 9, when the right to proceed autoxnatically ceased.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Might I go just
one bit further? The conclusion can easily
be drawn, after what niy honourable
friend bas said, that there is no doubt in
his mind that the Grand Trunk people were
dilatory. I would like to ask him what
is the result of this .delay on their
part? Would hie look upon that as a justification on the part of the Governnient
to cancel that agreement?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, sure.
Hon. Mr. ]ROBERTSON: I cannot agree
with my honourable friend's view in this
respect, because the Parliament and the
Government of Canada had assumed the
solemn obligation of meeting the interest
payments on the debentures and guaranteed
stock of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and the shareholders in Great
Britain and elsewhere had a right to expect
the Parlianient and Government of Canada
to fulfil that obligation, and thus prevent
the very thing which my honourable friend
frozn Ottawa suggested was bound to
occur, namely, the destruction of the
credit of Canada. But had this action not
been -taken, Canada's credit would have
been very seriously impaired, and it
wouid have taken generations to restore
confidence, so that capital in other
countries Would be directed to Canada.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend will agree 'with me that the gentle-.
men who were negotiating with the Government on the part of the Grand Trunk were
responsible to their shareholders, and their
action ma-de those shareholders responsible
for ail that they did in the matter. I do flot
finderstand my honourable friend's distinction between the gentlemen who were
negotiating for the Grand Trunk and their
sharçholders. It seenis to, me that the
negotiators were responsible for theniselves
and for the people whom they represented.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think my
honourable friend is probably under the
misapprehiension that the failure to, proceed
with the arbitration would relieve the
Government and the country from any

357

responsibility respecting- the guarantees I
have mentioned. If my information is
correct, that is not 80.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is a mere
matter of opinion.
_Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Now, coniing
down to the present, it was impossible for
the arbitration to proceed beyond April 9
except with the consent of the Government
to an extension of time. The particular
reason why the Grand Trunk president
and directors were so urgent in their expression of the view that they should not
give up possession of the property until the
arbitration was concluded was, to use their
own language, that otherwise they would
not be able to' have access to the records
and books necessary to properly prepare
their case. Their case is in, or was very
nearly ail in prior to April 9.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You mean the
Grand Trunk?
The Grand
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Trunk; so that the only logical reason advanced for the Grand Trunk retaining contxAl of and operating the property, of
which the Governnxent was paying the cost,
was renioved by the fact that they have
submittcd their evidence and presented
their case. There could therefore be no
further justification for continuing to leave
the property in the hands of that company
to be operated, while the state continued
to pay the deficits, without having any
voice in its operation, and had to meet the
additional cost entailed by the duplicate
organizations, the Grand Trunk Railway
Company and the Canadian National Railway Company which qught to be merged
in order to bring about efficiency and
econonxy in operatiofi.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is that the argument that infiuenced the Government?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will willingly
answer any question my honourable friend
may ask; but I do not think it is proper
for him to continue to interrupt, as I did
not do so with hlmn. Therefore, honourable
gentlemen, I think the only question before
the House at the present moment is as to
whether or not the Government's action
was justifiable, in deciding that it was flot
fltting, proper, or necessary for the state
to permit the Grand Trunk Railway Company to continue to, operate this line, collect
the revenues, disburse funds as they saw
fit, and' yet eall upon the state to hand out
the scores of millions of dollars that have

SENATE

358

been mentioned in another place as the
amount required. The Government said:
"We do not wish to deprive the shareholders of the Grand Trunk of the opportanity to have their case fairly investigated, and a value set upon their stock.
The arbitration may go on, but we will not
agree to that unless the control and operation of the property be handed over to
those who are to be its real owners, and
thus enable the operation of all the roads
under the state to be carried on in the
most economical manner, and reduce the
unfortunate deficits now existing."
The honourable member from Ottawa
referred to one question on which I will
not enter in any lengthened discussion, because I know that if he were possessed of
the facts concerning the influence of American labour leaders upon conditions in Canada he would not for a moment have made
his observations.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am aware of
it, well aware, to-day.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But I will say
to my honourable friend that the gentleman whom he mentioned, Mr. Gompers,
has absolutely no control over, no connection with, and no power to influence, any
railway organization in Canada in one
direction or another; and neither has any
cther individual; and that no st"ike can
beHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why did you
bring him over here then, to put an end
to a strike in Canada, if be has no influence of any kind?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

I

never

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, you brought
him into Canada to settle the strike.
I beg your
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
pardon; I never had anything to do with
any such thing. The honourable gentleman is entirely mistaken in his statement.
May I proceed to observe that under the
constitutions of all the railway organizations in Canada no strike can occur except
with the consent of two-thirds of the membership of those organizations, notwithstanding any influence that may be brought
to bear upon them by any individual.
Therefore the honourable member's observation, as I say, is entirely incorrect and
misleading, and had he known the facts I
am sure he never would have made the
statement.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

The honourable member from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique) observed that it
was regrettable that the Grand Trunk
property should pass out of the hands of
its present owners, because it would
probably prevent future investments of
British capital. So far as I know or can
recall, I do not think there is any very outstanding evidence of British capital having
been rushed into Canada and invested here
for the extension either of the Grand
Trunk railway or the building up of indusCertainly in the
tries adjacent to it.
building of the Grand Trunk Pacific and
the Transcontinental there was no great
evidence of a rush of British capital over
here for that purpose, and I am rather inclined to think that if the Grand Trunk
Pacific and the Grand Trunk Railway itself had been permitted to default, and the
investors had lost perhaps their all, the reflection upon Canada's credit and the effect
upon the future investments of British
capital in Canada would have been very
much worse than it will be under the conditions which are likely fo prevail.
As to the people of Canada owning lines
of railway in the United States, I see no
the

reason for apprehension.

has owned a variety of lines in the United
States for many years. The Canadian National railway partly traverses the United
States at the present time, and I am sure
that no disadvantageous effects are likely
to flow from the fact that a few miles
of the Grand Trunk system are located in
that country.
I hope that there may be no division of
opinion on the main point, which is, that
the railway situation is such that it must
be met, and we must do the most expedient
thing at this time, regardless of what may
have been the causes, running over a term
of years, that have brought about this
situation; that it would not be creditable
to Canada for the Government or Parliament to repudiate an agreement which the
Government solemnly entered into, and
which Parliament endorsed by legislation;
that we should now proceed to give the
common stockholders the right to have
their case fully considered by the Board
of Arbitration; also, that we should not
continue to penalize the taxpayers of Canada by permitting the Grand Trunk railway to be operated by that company, while
the state continues to pay the deficits without having any authority in the control or

APRIL e8, 1921
hope that this Bill will pass by no uncertain vote, in this House. I hope. that the
Senate will see that the obligations which
Canada bas assumed are most solemn and
serious ones, and that we should nlot lightly
consider their repudiation.
Hon. Mr,. MITCHELL: The honourable
member says hie thinks the shareholders
should have time to consider this bargain.
I agree to that, but does he not think that
the taxpayers of this country should have
something to say before the Government
enters into ail these obligations?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the
taxpayers of Canada generally are aware
of the facts, and believe that the acquisition of the Grand Trunk Railway property
and its attachment to the Canadian National
system, Will relieve them of a burden of
taxation which they otherwise would have
te bear.
Hon. Mr.'-DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, when we were confronted with
the proposition to buy the Grand Trunk
Railway Company of Canada it was for
the simple reason that bas been repeated
to us this afternoon by the leader of the
Government-that
the
Grand
Trunk
having failed to meet its obligations in
connection with the building of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie, and having notified the
Federal Government that it would not meet
the interest on debentures on account of
the Grand Trunk Pacifie, the Government
felt that it should not relieve the Grand
Trunk Railway Company from those obligations. The Government felt at the time
that the Grand Trunk should be *forced to
stand by its obligations and meet them, and
if it failed that it should be liquidated or
bought. In order that the country' should
not lose in the transaction, the Gavernment
felt that the Grand Trunk Company should
either be forced to pay, or should be liqiuidated, or purchased- under some kind of
agreement. It decided in favour of the
last proposition-the purchasing of the
Grand Trunk railway, under an arbitration to value the common shares. The Government did that in 1917 undoubtedly because of the fact that the country would
be benefited by this arrangement The
Governnient f elt that it was unjust ta be
obliged ta take the Grand Trunk Paciie,
the lean part of the system, and to free
the old Grand Trunk Company, which
apparently was a going concern in a fairly
healthy condition. The Government was
undoubtedly convinced that, on the whole,

.359

it was a better proposition than assuming
the obligations of the Grand Trunk Pacifie
and relieving the Grand Trunk RailwAy
Company. The question which was put -ta
this House was: "Will you accept the
obligations of the Grand Trunk Pacifie an~d
free the Grand Trunk Railway Company,
which was the negotiator of the whcde
transaction?"
Well, vQices arase in this
Chamber claiming that it would be a very
disadvantageous bargain-that there w,%s
a better solution of the difflculty; that the
taking aver of the Grand Trunk Railway
systemn would increase our load instead of
being an advantage; that the Grand Trunk
Railway Company could be continued as a
going concern and an interchange of trafic
arranged for. in order that the two systemes,
the Canadian Northern and the Grand
Trunk, should help each other.
I will net revert to the numerous aspects
of the case as it presented itself to us in
1919; but thinking people are asking themselves if the cabinet, or the Government,
des not now see the transaction from a
different angle. The country is wondering if
the expectations entertained by the Federal
Governiment, in 1919 have not been' shattered and if it is nlot now clear that, instead
of improving our financial situation, we are
burdening ourselves with the obligation to
pay millions and millions yearly to nieet
deficits. Parliament refused in 1919 ta assume the obligations of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, write off its debts, or liquidate the
situation. We thought that we could maintain the chance of avoiding this liability
by taking over the Grand Trun< railwýay,
which was the first endorse-r, and operating
it. I believe that very mgny members of
this Chamber who feit that there was a
chance of our salvation in piurebasing the
Grand Trunk are, ta say the least, in a
rather doubtful state ai niind at this
moment. There are many people who have
na daubt whatever that we have assumed
formidable obligations, and that on the
wlwle it would have been better for ýCanada te 'have assumed the Grand Trunk
Pacific's liability, with its assets, and allowed the Grand Trunk ta go its'own way.
Let me put this question te the honourAble members of this Chamber, and'if we

off hundreds of thousands of dollars? In
many concerns that I know of, that is being done in order that they may adjust
themselves to present conditions and resume business with a fair chance of meeting their competitors. Would not Canada
be better off if to-day in assuming the permanent annual liability of from seven to
ten millions of dollars, which we were facing when the Grand Trunk Pacific was
handed over to us by the Grand Trunk Railway, rather than embarking upon this
large venture of administering the Grand
Trunk as the property of the State? That
is the question I put. I do not know the
attitude of mind of the Cabinet, nor of the
members of either Chamber who support
the Cabinet; but I believe that the Grand
Trunk shareholders, who are mainly in
England and who have complained bitterly
of the proposition which was presented to
them, feel that the limit which we fixed in
the Act was a -very harsh restriction to impose upon them. They complained that we
were wanting in generosity; that we had
treated the other system, the Canadian
Northern, much more liberally. I wonder if
we could not now, when it appears from
the Bill before us that they are in default,
approach their leaders to see if they have
not sufficient faith in their property to do
as they have done for the last thirty or
forty years-go on adding millions upon
millions to improve and extend the railway.
We must not forget, notwithstanding
what the honourable the Minister of Labour bas said, that it bas been the money
coming regularly across the Atlantic from
the old shareholders of the Grand Trunk
that bas developed the system. The money
expended in developing the system was not
borrowed by the Grand Trunk from
the United States, nor from Canada
to any extent.
The millions and millions
which
the
system
represents
have come from London, and it is from
that group of men that we are now disassociating ourselves. I bad occasion to
say in the debate of 1919 that I was very
sorry we were losing contact with that
group in London. It is true that they were
not advancing their money with the idea
of rendering service to Canada; they were
thinking of themselves; but they felt that
Canada was a growing, developing country,
and, although their shares were merely
paper in their vaults, they represented
from generation to generation the hope that
the paper would increase in value with the
general development of Canada. Since the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

people in London, supported by many newspapers, have .complained that it is a harsh
bargain that is offered them, would it not
be appropriate for the Government to take
the opportunity of meeting the Grand
Trunk people and trying to arrange for the
rehabilitation of the road? Even if we
have to bear the loss of a few millions a
year, the total amount being known to us,
I think it would be better than saddling the
country with the responsibility for the administration of that system. As the bonourable member for De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) has said, the agreement of
1920 is before us, and, although the Grand
Trunk is in default in not closing the
arbitration by the specified date, I am not
quite sure that the whole agreement bas
gone by the board. If I were sure that it
had, I would hesitate not one moment to
endeavour to have it left there; but, not
being sure of that, I shall support the
view expressed by the honourable member
for De Salaberry, and shall hope that in
committee the amendment which he bas
read will be generally accepted by this
Chamber.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not intend to detain the
House, but, let me tell you, there was rejoicing on the 9th of April when we knew
that the Grand Trunk bad forfeited their
option, and the whole proceedings were
stopped, and we had confirmation from
Ottawa that the Government was done
with them. There was rejoicing throughout the land that we were to be spared that
bad bargain. But what do we find to-day?
What angel bas whispered into the Prime
Minister's ear and induced him to bring us
back into this nefarious and disastrous
deal? At the present time-and I defy
contradiction of this statement-according
to that Government deficit of last year, we
are losing $10,000 an hour, and when you
take over the Grand Trunk the deficit will
be $15,000 an hour, and at the very time
when this country needs all the money it
can get, in order to meet not only the
interest on the war debt, but also the huge
expenditures that we are making. For
my part, I cannot understand how the
Government of the country and the majority in this House can possibly entertain for
one moment this proposition. The Grand
Trunk shareholders have let the thing go
by default. Why not leave the matter
there?
What is the cause of all our trouble? It

is that we did not remain within the law in

to assume all the obligations to which the
Government is now committed and agree to
pay interest on them; secondly, to pay the
costs of the arbitration up to the present;
and, thirdly, to give a year's salary to
everybody connected with the arbitration,
provided that we do not take over the
Grand Trunk. The country would be
making a good bargain.
Yet the honourable leader of the Government in this House rose in his place
and told us-and, you know, he was smiling
when he said it-that we must take over
the Grand Trunk because it will unite the
railways in one system, and so on. Can
the honourable gentleman tell us one thing
that we shall get by owning the Grand
Trunk more than we could get through
the Railway Board? There is not one
single thing. The Montreal Gazette for the
last twelve months has been pointing out
that we could get from the Railway Board
everything that Government ownership
would give. So there is nothing in the
honourable gentleman's contention.
The
Government railways are running up the
deficit. We have heard it admitted by the
Minister of Railways that there is a deficit
of $70,000,000 this year; with the Grand
Trunk we shall have at least $35,000,000
more; so there will be a deficit of over
$100,000,000, and the taxpayers of this
country will have to stand pat for it.
I for one am glad of this opportunity of
saying that I have been against this thing
right from the drop of the hat. They say
the shareholders of the Grand Trunk railway have lost money. What right hava
we to take the people's money and give it
to the shareholders? This is not a charitable institution; it is not our money to

give. There are many people in the country who are losing money, and the Government is not going to indemnify everyone who loses money. Why should it indemnify the shareholders of the Grand
Trunk railway? They have mismanaged
their affairs; they foolishly guaranteed the
bonds of the Transcontinental railway and
the second mortgage bonds of the Grand
Trunk Pacific. They did it with their eyes
open. They made their bargain.
Their
stock is absolutely worthless, and still we
are going to pay them for it. We put a
limit upon what we are going to pay them;
we are going to give $5,000,000 a year for
something that is worth less than nothing.
It is a bad thing. It is just as bad as
the Canadian Northern bargain. It cannot be entertained for one minute.
Some people say that there is a great
objection to having only one system--that
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

there would be no competition. But with
the Railway Board you do not need coinpetition.
If there were only one, that
would be about the only good thing in
Government ownership.
There would be
no duplication of trains between here and
Montreal. To-day there are eight trains
running each way-sixteen trains a day.
Two or three trains would do all the work.
The same condition exists all over the country. I have got letters from a man in Cochrane who says: "For the last three months I
have been watching the train which comes
from Toronto to North Bay, and then goes
to Cochrane and west to Winnipeg;" and
he says that on that train there have been
practically no passengers. Yet it bas been
running for two years. That is Government
operation for you, and honourable gentlemen stand for that sort of thing. If
there were only one system there would
not be ail those trains. There are two
trains leaving Toronto on the same night
for Winnipeg, one on the Canadian National and one on the Canadian Pacific.
One good train could do all the business,
and if we had only one system we would be
better off. Go to the city of Quebecunfortunately I had to go there twice last
week-and what do you find? You will
find the Canadian Pacific train with five
or six Pullmans all filled up, and the Government train alongside of it, which leaves
at the same hour, and the lights are not
even lighted, and there is no one around
and no one aboard. Still, the train was
there. That is Government operation.
If we were to leave the Grand Trunk
railway people alone, they have so much
money in it now that they would find more
money to finance it, provided we did not

take them by the throat and say, " Pay
up." I know what I am talking about. If
we did not insist upon putting them into
bankruptcy-and they can only be put into bankruptcy by the action of this Government, because they do not owe money
to any one but the Government-they
would find means to carry on. What is
the sum the Grand Trunk railway people
want to-day? They want .$88,000,000 and
the Government does not feel like giving
it to them, and all this camouflage about
extending the time turns on that $88,000,000.
I intend to, vote against the second reading of the Bill.

Hon. A. BOYER: Honourable gentlemen, just one word. I was very sorry that
the honourable gentleman from De Salaberry Hon. Mr. Béique) did not touch upon

APRIL 28, 1921
one point when lie mentioned the valuable
financial, association that we would lose
through the taking of the Grand Trunk
railway. The point I want to make ie this.
Although money was borrowed in England
for the building of the Grand Trunk railway, as Well as for the building of the
Canadian Northern, those loans were made
before the war at a rate of interest varying from 2à per cent to 31 per cent. Those
loans will mature in the near future, and
we shall be called upon to repay that
money. Where are we going to get it? Are
we going to get it froxi those valuable
financial associations when we have insisted on driving a bargain against the
wishes of the shareholders of the Grand
Trunk railway? We cannot borrow in
England. England bas its own liabilities
to meet just now on account of the war.
Surely we are not going to the United
States to borrow the money after their
refusai to make loans to the French Government. When you take into consideration
the terrible sacrifices made by the. French
people, who spent hundreds of millions in
heiping the United States to retain their
liberty, and remember that the United
States wouid not iend them money at les
than 61 per cent at 92, are we going into
the American market to raise money to
refund these loans that wili become due
in the near future on the Canadian Northern or the Grand Trunk raiiway? Where is
the money to corne from? I would like an
answer to that question. Surely Canada
is not rich enough to pay ail these liabilities and to tell the shareholders and bondhoiders in Engiand: "Where is the money
you advanced for the building of these railways?"
Coming now to the question of Governmer#i ownership. If we had a cingle straw
to grasp as a bit of comfort as to why the
Government should estabiish Government
control of railways, I wouid admit that we
might join in the bargain. But take the
case of the European raiiways: take, Italy,
for instance. In 1906 the Government
notified ail the Italian raiiway companies
that on a certain date they would become
state property. They aliowed the companies three years to run the roads before
they were taken over. What was the consequence? The companies, knowing that in
three years they wouid cèase to possess the
roads, allowed themt to fail into sucli
wretched condition that when the time came
for taking them over there was hardly
anything Worth taking. I remember riding
in a train from Naples to Rome. I rode in

a first-ciass coach without any cushions
and with broken Windows and doors that
would oniy haif ehut. In talking with the
Finance Minister of Italy I spoke about
the condition of the road. and he said. "I
bope no other country wili ever f oilow Our
exampie." Take France. France had various pi'osperous railroads. There was one
company, La Compagnie de l'Ouest, which
had always been very prosperone, paying
between 6 and 7 per cent in dividende,
which was considered quite a large return
for a railroad in France. The Government
took bold of the road, and in bess than six
monthe after it became Government property I remember going to the wicket to
buy a ticket fromn Paria to Havre. and the
clerk told me the ticket would cost so much
money. I handed him a 100-franc note,
and I shouid have received 3 france change.
The cierk said, "I amn sorry, sir: we do not
give any change. Go to the next wicket
and get your money changed, and come
back, and when you have the right change
I will seli you a ticket." When I asked the
reason for this, he eaid: "Government control. We have so many empioyeee that we
do not know what to do with them. and we
have haif-a-dozen here who do not; do anything but change money." What bas been
the recuit, of the Government operation of
railroads in Engband during the war?
Disaster. Then, cross the ocean and go to
the United States. What bas been the
recuit there? Disaster. -lI anewer to the
argument of the Minister of Labour, I
would point to that great standard comWhen
pany, the Peunsylvania railroad.
the company got possession of the road
on the let of January bast, I think it was,
the first thing they did was to diemies
What was the reason?
5,000 employees.
"They were ail government nominees, and
we had no use for them; we intend to
manage our property on business principles,
not on government principies." Look at the
history of government owrnership al over
the world. It bas been disastrous in every
country. But we are not sharp enough to
benefit by the experience of others and to
say that we shall not have it. What je the
reason? Nobody knows; we are not told.
This Bill je hurried through; we are told
it bas got to pase whether we are willing
or not. When the Minieter of Labour eaid
the Grahd Trunk Company was not; ready
for the arbitration why did he not give
the reason? It le very simple. Last summer -the Government loaned or guaranteed
to the Grand Trunk Rallway Company
$25,000,000. The money was borrowed in

364

SENATE

the United States at a disastrous rate of
interest and with exchange rates against
that. And what was the result? Thousands of men were set to work all over the
line putting it in first-class order. They
even whitewashed the stones at each
station, and when that was done the Grand
Trunk people said: "We are ready for
arbitration; bring on your arbitrators."
And they were given a first-class train
which stopped at every station and they
looked at the station freshly painted and
washed up, and clean for a wonder, and
they said: "By Jove, this is a firsf-class
road; we had no idea the Grand Trunk
was such a first-class road." And it was
our money that did it, and to-day we have
to pay for it over again.
Then, coming to the question of having to
pay interest to English shareholders. Of
course, I have nothing official. The only
thing we have to guide us is the knowledge
that the Government has paid interest
on certain securities. There is one coming
due on the lst of May, which the Government has notified the Grand Trunk people
that it will not honour. What is the reason?
If it has paid the others, why not pay this
one? Carry on the bargain, or leave it
altogether. The Grand Trunk Company
had the pluck, when Canada had no credit,
to build a road fromi the Atlantic as far
inland as it possibly could. It opened an
enormous country from Rivere du Loup to
Point Levis, from Point Levis to Montreal,
and from Montreal to the Detroit river.
All that was done with English money.
The road never could make any money
because the people in England did not
realize the needs of a new country. They
insisted on managing a road in a country
which they knew nothing about from 3,000
miles away, and the officials they sent out
here were simply sent because of the pull
they had with the Board of Directors. The
Grand Trunk Railway never was given a
chance. It had to struggle as best it could.
It opened the country, and we ought to be
thankful and help it as much as we can to
get out of its muddle. Let it realize the
mistakes it made in the past, and say it is
time that the management of the Com-.
pany was in Canada and not in England.
Do you want proof of what I say? Well,
when the arbitration ended on the 9th of
April, what did we see? The nominal
President of the Grand Trunk railway in
Canada, with the legal adviser, had to go
to England once more to consult with the
Board as to the possibility of the future
and as to how they were going to act. It
Hon. Mr. BOYER.

is the same old policy of managing the railway from 3,000 miles away. That has been
the fault from the word go, and still they
will not open their eyes and establish a
Board in Canada.
Canada built the Canadian Pacific Railroad, which always had a Board of
Directors in Canada, and it was highly
successful-why? Because the people who
managed it understood the conditions in
the country; they understood the country
better than men who were 3,000 miles
away, and the result is that we have to-day
that great national highway which is a
credit to the country. As an instance of
the management of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, let me relate a short story. In
the smoking and writing roou of a big
hotel in Shanghai there were half-a-dozen
gentlemen smoking-one was writing at a
table-and discussing large companies
throughout the world. One of them made
the remark, "To my way of thinking and
from the knowledge I possess, there are
three concerns in the world which are
properIy managed." He was asked what
they were, and he said, "The Roman
Catholic Church, the C.1.R., and the
Standard Oil." The gentleman who had
been writing happened to be the agent of
the Canadian Pacific railway, and he got
up and thanked the man who had said
those comforting words, and immediately
wired Sir William Van Horne what he had
heard, "and," he said, "all through China
we never speak but the truth."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Before the motion
is put I want to hand in a notice of an
amendment that I will move when the Bill
goes into Committee.
The motion for the second reading of
the Bill was agreed to.
'CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEF

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the
Bih. Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 1-Governor in Council may
extend time for arbitrators' awards:
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved that ail
the words in paragraph a after the word
"appointed" in the last line of page 1 be
struck out, and the following substituted
in lieu thereof:
Directors ; provided that the substituted Board
of Directors of the company need not comprise
more than five members; but until otherwise
provided by'the Board a majority of the Directors shall constitute a quorum; and that it
shal not be necessary tiat any of the directors
shall reside in England or be qualified by ownership of stock.

APRIL 28, 1921
He said: The reasons for the amendment
are: firet, that while it may flot ho desirable to appoint more than five directore in
ail to direct the affaire of the Company,
the Government nevertheloss should flot ho
prohibited from doing so; secondly, that
it je desirable to provide that a majority
of the Board of Directors shall constitute
a quorum, even although the number of
diroctors be reducod to five; and, thirdly,
to, avoid certain requirements of the ex.isting legislation of the Company whereby some directors are required to roside in
England, and ail must (ho qualified as
shareholdere.
The aniendment was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Paragraph

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:- What je the nature

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As I
underetand it, thie brings the statuto into
conformity with the agreemont.
As my
honourable friend will doubtiese rememler,
each party will pay haif of the costs, and

36E

the costs payable by the Company are
aseeeed as againet the interest or dividende payable upon the debenture and
guarantoed stock.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They are deducted?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yee.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That means that
thée exnenees are deducted fromn the dividends paid to the debenture and guarantoed
stockholders for the purpose of carrying
on the arbitration for the benefit of the
firet and second preference and ordinary
etockholders.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is in
accordance with tho agreement, and that
agreement wae ratified by the shareholders.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Thon there
je added to paragraph e the following:
And moreover, after substitution of directors
of the Company as herein provided for, the Company, and the Government as guarantor of interest and dividende on th. debenture and
guaranteed stocks, shall be entitied to deduct
and retain from snch interest and dividende as

stocks any and ail costs or expenses connected
with the ai'bitration herotoforo or hereàfter advanced, paid or Incurred by either the Company
or the Government, other than such as under the
agreement of March e, 1920, are payable by
the Government.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can the leader
of the Government give us the amount of
the costs uf this arbitration up to the
present time?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

No.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I underetand
they have been extremely heavy.
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
not bo surprised at that.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 think we ought
to know something about them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That je
one of the objecte we have in view in expediting the conclusion of the arbitration
as quickly as possible. We are only too
conscioue of the fact that a very large
body of coste will ho run up unlese we
exorcise a precaution of this kind. It je
impossible to say what they are at the
Present time.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The Government
muet have been paying out a considerable

arbitration.

SENATE

366

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I thinx
they will render their bills in the near
future, but I do not think they have donc
so at present.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I suppose the
Government has paid all the expenses on
both sides?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: With the idea
of detracting from the shares of the company?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, because up to the 9th of April,, when the
period expired for the conclusion of the
arbitration, the Grand Trunk Company
had to look after their own refreshers, so
to speak.
But out of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Grand Trunk funds? They were in
possession.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
sumably out of their own funds.

Pre-

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Now they will
not have the funds available.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
are chargeable properly under the agreement in this particular way: that is to
say, they cannot take them out of the
general exchequer.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In other words,
the Grand Trunk has not advanced any
of those charges either to counsel or to
witnesses.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I really
could not say that. They may possibly
have done so, and they may have taken
the advances out of the wrong fund for
aught I know.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
friend ought to know that.

My learne.d

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, we
would not know that, because it would be
a matter of auditing to ascertain from
what fund they were paid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It looks very
much as if in the end the country would
pay both sides.

Paragraph

JAMES LOUGHEED: We
to prevent that wherever
e, as amended, was agreed to.
f was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

On paragraph g-Arbitration to proceed
speedily on substitution of directors:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That, in paragraph g of section 1, the word
"arbitrators" .n line 4, page 3, be struck out
ahd the word "arbitration" substituted in lieu
thereof.

Paragraph g, as amended, was agreed to.
Hon. W. B. ROS,S: At this point I
wish to suggest an amendment by adding,
as paragraph h, these words:
(h) That the arbitration proceedings commenced in this matter shall be revived, the delay enlarged, and the powers of the arbitrators
continued until the rendering of a final award
as contemplated in the original agreement of
March 8, 1920, including the time necessary
for the appeals provi.ded therein.

As the matter stands to-day, the Grand
Trunk is in nossession of the road, and we

know that the Government is under considerable disadvantage because of that
fact. This bill is primarily to obviate that
-to oust the Grand Trunk from possession
of the road, and give the possession to the
Government. Power to do that has practically been adonted; but having done
that, in order to be fair, we must see that
the Grand Trunk are not deprived of their
right to arbitrate any claim they may have.
The legislation on this matter is becoming
more complex every year. We had legislation in 1919 and in 1920, and again tonight we have this bill, and I suppose, if we
argue by analogy from other complicated
cases, we will have legislation again next
year. Now, here is the difficulty that we
must remove: we have a Board of Arbitrators; they make an award; there is provision for an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada, or alternately to the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. Suppose

the arbitrators hear the case and make an
award, and then cease to be arbitratorsbecome defunct, as the lawyers say; in
ether words, go out of office. We will say
that an appeal to the Supreme Court goes
on, and that Court decides that, the
arbitrators omhitted something that should
have been taken into consideration, or took
something into consideration when they
should not have done so, and the award is
sent back for reconsideration. Honourable
gentlemen can see that if there are no
arbitrators to whom the award could be
sent back, the Grand Trunk would be in a
rather awkward position. I take it that
the Government are perfectly satisfied that,
once they get possession, the Grand Trunk
may have the case tried and may have their
appeal, or alternately the Government may

APRIL 28, 1921
have their appeal, and if the case is sent
back the arbitrators would be there to consider it and make a final award in accordance with instructions fromn the appeal
court. Thjs amendment does flot in any
way impeach the bill, but it is supplying
and making clear what I feel must necessarily be the intention of the Government.
It is flot a hostile aniendment.
lion. Mr. BEIQUE: M*ay I ask if there
is any right of appeal in the agreement?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. there is. Look
at page 5 of chapter 13, statutes of 1920,
section 8.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It would have been
open to the Government, under that agreement, to stipulate, if there is an appeal,
for such further delay or any new arbitration as may be necessary.
Hlon. Mr. ROSS: Everyone who reads
the newspapers knows that in the hearing
of the arbitration at Montreal the Grand
Trunk tendered evidence as to what was
called replacement value, but that evidence
was ruled out altogether, and there was
notice of appeal given in relation to that'
Now, as a matter of fact, I suppose a great
deal wi]l turn in the Grand Trunk case
on whether that contention is well founded
or not. If these proceedings go on and the
Appeal Court says that thé Grand Trunk
are right, that the replacement value
would be a factor in determining what the
amount of 'the award should be-they
might flot decide that the replacement value
should be the sole value, but that it
might affect the value-in that case it
would be necessary fur the Supreme Court
of Canada or the Privy Council to sepd the
case back to the arbitrators, giving there
directions as to how far that class of evidence was to be taken into consideration.
Now, what the Grand Trunk are fearful
of, and I think they are entitled ta absolute security in this respect, is that in the
event of that happening there should be in
existence a board of arbitrators ta go on
and give the final award.
. I have been tr4ng to understand this
legislation thoroughly and I think I do, but
I do not know that it is worth while getting
into trouble or what might be called a legal
argument about it, because I cannot conceive that the Government want anYthing
but to have the final award made. Therefore I suggest that the Government accept
this amendmnent, because all it does !s in
simple, plain language to revive the arbi-

tration and keep the arbitrators in office
until there is a final judgment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the honourable
gentleman must bear this in mind that,
whereas the Bill as printed leaves it to the
Governmnent to consent or flot consent ta
the arbitration being continued, and on
such terme as the Government may dictate
toi the Company, the Government would be
obliged by the suggested amendment, if I
understand it correctly, to submit to the
arbitration. Therefore it is a serious
amendment ta the first -section of the Bll.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: It does not touch it.
Hoh. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot agree
with my honourable friend. What I think
is meant is this. The whole matter is to be
treated on the new reference ta arbitration.
My honourable friend's amnendment will be
one of the terms of the new reference.
Section 1, 1 think, provides for it.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: But what happens with
regard ta the arbitrators after the arbitrators make an award?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That can be provided for in the agreement.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Look at section 8, at
the end of the Bill, and tell me what that
means:
In the event of approval by the Governor
In Council of a fnrther time for the rnaking of
the award under the provisions of this Act,
or of any agreemnent conciuded in pursuance of
the powers hereby conferred, the powers and
duties of the arbitrators shall remain and continue, and be deemed ta have remained and continued, and the proceedlngii shall be resumed
and concluded-

Mark you-and the proceedings shall be resumed and
concluded in ail respects as if the Urne withIn
which the award is actually made had been the
time limited therefor by the said agreement of
eighth March, 1920.

If you want a complication, I should say
you have it there.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But that is provided. A new agreement is ta be made on
terms satisfactory ta the Government. As
I understand it, this. Act wîll have no
effeet at all if the Government does not
make a new agreement by virtue of
section I.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.
The position
avill be exactly the saine as it would have
been if the award had been completed on
the date mentioned. The same difficulty
would have then existed: the arbitrators
would have gone out of office. Sa the situa-

SENATE
tion would be no worse to-day than it would
have been then. Is not that correct?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No, I do not agree with
that at ail. I do not see why you do not
state in plain English just what the rights
of the Company are.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have no objection to that. This is bad legisiation
anyway.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: It is not clear as the
Bill is now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We
cannot consent to the amendmnent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Government does flot accept that amendment?
No.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG HEED:
The matter has been fully considered and
I regret to say I cannot view it in the
same way as my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Ross). This matter must be left in the
hands of the Government for the purpose
of terminating the arbitration as quickly
as possible. It cannot be left to the Company itself Vo advance reasons why those
proceedings should be continued. The fact
of the niatter is that the Company, upon
the conclusion of the arbitration, intimated
that they could have 1closed within two
weeks, and the arbitration is fairly well
advanced.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then why the
delay? Why do they not wind it up?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Because
the Government bas not got its case in
yet, and the Grand Trunk were reluctant
to close. They were so enamored of the
proceedings that they desired to continue
them.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They want more
advances, is that it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 think we expect
the Government, when it enters into the
new agreement, to niake a stipulation that
if the arbitration proceedings are not finished within a reasonabie time, or if the
Company does flot Carry out its obligation
under the old or the new agreement, the
Government niight then take the position
that the whole, business is cancelled.
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Grand Trunk have no reason t(, complain
of the generosity of the Government in al
our relations with them, and I think they
can fully rely upon justice being done
them.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr, BELCOURT: It is rather the
other way about.
Hon. Sir JAMES IOUGHEED: Possibly
they may take advantage of the Government.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Ross was
negatived.
On section 2-agreement to revive and
continue arbitration proceedings to be miade
on or before 16th May, 1921:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable friend tell us just what the sanction
wifl be? What would be the resuit of failure
to comply with this clause?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
clause is simply to revîse and continue the
arbitration proceedings.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. but suppose
they are not terminated, or rather that no
agreement is made within the time stated,
what then?
0f
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
course, power is given here for the Government to extend the time. That is the
object.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, 1 know. But
this clause states:
Provided the agreement be made on or before
the sixteenth day of May, 1921.

The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
reason that date is fixedHon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn asking, in
case of the new agreement not being made
by that date, what is the consequence,?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then, I
fancy, it fails to the ground.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The whole thing
falîs to the ground?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: For
this reason, that there appears in the Gazette-or at least it has been sent to the
Gazette-at the instance of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company, a notice cailing
a meeting of sharehoiders in England for
the lOth of May. I understand it bas been
cabled over.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I know that,
but what I want Vo know is, what wili happen if no agreement is made before that
date?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
difficuit to say. The Government will then
have to determine what will be its policy
if the Grand Trunk shareholders refuse to
accept this new proposai.

0

APRIL 28, 1921

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes? Well, in
the light of the provisions of the Act, and
of the f ormer agreement of the 8th of
March, 1920, wh.at will happen then? Will
the whole agreemient be cancelled? Will
the parties be in the position they were
in before they entered into an agreement?
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I understand the
matter would be in the very saine position
as it is in to-night.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will it flot; be
cancelled?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
then be for the Government to determine
whether it will go on with the purchase of
the Grand Trunk or alloW the Grand Trunk
to go into liquidation, orHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Or finance itself.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Or to
determine upon some other course.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Anyway, the
pYarties will be where they were before any
agreement was made.
Hon, Sir JAMES' LOUGHEED: Yes,
practically.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the 'question la very pertinent. I have not read
the Act since it was passed a year ago,
but arn under the impression that it does
not contain the necessary provision ta
determine exactly the question which has
been put by the honourable gentleman. It
seemns to me that the Government should
take occasion of the passing of this Bill
to embody in it a clear provisionHon. Mr. BELCOURT: A clear sanction.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: -a clear sanction
providing that if the Government cannot
come to an agreement with the Grand
Trunk for a new contract as contemplated
by section 1, then the agreement of 1919
shall lapse.

369

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED: As my
honourable friend knows, the legisiation of
1919 contemplated an agreement being
entered into, between the parties. In pursuance of that agreement this arbitrati-on was prooeeded with, and, the date
flxed having expired, the arbitration practically lapsed. We are now simply passing
enabling legisiation to extend under new
conditions, namely, the control. of the Company's properties, the time for the hearing
and the possible conclusion of the arbitration. Outside of making provision for the
confiscation of the property, I do not know
what we coiild otherwise provide.
Section 2 was agreed, to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
an amendment to add a substantive section
in place of section 4.
The Hon. the CHAIR MAN: It la moved
that the following be added as section 4:
4. For the purpose of carrying out the subatitution of directPre of the company herein provided for, any director of the Company may
vacate his office by resignation in writing submitted to the Board at any meeting of the
directors, and'if one or more of the directors
of! the Company, flot exceeding five at any one
tième, shall in the manner aforesaid vacate his
or their offices, the remaining directors o! the
Company present at the aforesaid meeting or at
any subsequent meeting, even although they do
flot constitute a quorum, may elect a director
or directors nominated by the Government to MlI
the place or places of the director or directors
so vacating hiÉ or their offices. Moreover the
Governor in Council may at any time appoint
adtional directors to the substituted board if
considered expedient.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Then the Government apparently contemplate more than

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, the question bas been put, in
two or three forms, of the legal situation
of the Grand Trunk Company resulting
from the fact that the arbitration was flot
concluded at the proper tixeHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or may not be
concluded at ail.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Or may not
be concluded or may not go on, because
they would not agree to the conditions
which might be imposed by the Government.
It is clear to my mind, in reading clause 8,
that the agreement is stili alive.
Oh,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That there is
no default on the part of the Grand Trunk
Company and no penalty încurred by the
fact that the arbitration is not over. Clause
8 says:
The award shall be made by the arbitrators,
,or a majority of them, within nine months fromn
the appointment of the arbitrators, or within
such further li-me as the Governor in Council
may approve.

Now we are just at this point, "such
further time as the Governor in Council
may approve." The Governor in Council
has decided to submit this Bill, containing
the conditions of which it approves for the
continuation

of the

arbitration.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the question arises, should there not be a sanction
in this Bill in case these conditions were
not fulfilled?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A
sanction of what?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Suppose that
at the meeting of the lOth or l2th of May
the shareholders refused the conditions
proposed, inter alia the delivery -of the
road, what will be the result of that
refusai?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend is wrong. There is nothîng in the
Act that settles the question. It merely
provides that the arbitrators shahl make
their award within nine months or such
further time as may be set by the Government. It does not say what wilh happen if
the time is allowed to lapse; there is
nothing in the old Act or thje present one
which ýdetermines the resuit of no arbitration taking place or no agreement being
made. It is an open question.
I{on. Sir JAMES LOUGHEFID.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 think the Government sbould add a clause stating that if
the new agreement is flot made or if the
terms of it are not carried out by the
Company the agreement may be ended at
the will of the Government.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
is a question of law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Welh, you are
making the haw.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 am merehy
suggesting that the Government now take
the power.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say to my honourable friend that that bas
hikewise been considered, and the view of
the Government is that the responsibility
rests upon the shareholders, and that if
the shareholders refuse to approve of this
agreement dealing with an extended period
for the continuance of the arbitration
proceedîngs they do it on their own responsibihity, and it is then for the Government to consider whether they shouhd drop
the whohe transaction or continue further
negotiations.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend suggests that it is now a matter for
consideration whether the Government
ought not to stipuhate that in the event of
these proceedings not going on the contract
would be ended. 1 agree with that stand.
It seems to me that there should be some
time set when the thing is going to be
finished.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend might anticipate this
possibility. Suppose some complex situation shouhd arise which wouhd necessitate or render desirable a reconsideration of the subject by the shareholders,
it is desirable that the status quo should
remain as it is; then both parties possibhy
might continue the negotiations. I think
it is more satisfactory as it is.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It may go on
indefinitehy. XVe may have an Act next
Session further to extend the time of the
arbitration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
the disposition of the Government to accelerate this matter is very apparent from
the course they have taken.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think, on readîng
again the first paragraph of section 1,
that it wouhd he in the power of the Government to have in the agreement a stipulation whereby it wouhd have the right.

Bon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That,

have a clearer idea of them then than we
have to-day. It is sufficient to say that
during the past year we have advanced the
amount of money mentioned.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is there any

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
not any clear idea of that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is there any
other?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes,
they have asked us to meet other obligations. They consist of refunding debt,
meeting interest on obligations, and so on.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How much has
been advanced?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
advanced $47,000,000 and have given a

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I

point of order. This is a Bill concerning
the purchase of the Grand Trunk Railway
Company of Canada. It refers to chapter
13 of the statutes of 1920, "an Act to confirm the Agreement dated the 8th day of
March, 1920, between His Majesty the
King and the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada for the aequisition by His
Majesty of the capital stock of the said
Grand Trunk Railway Company, except
the 4 per cent guaranteed stock." On the
face of it it is unquestionably a money
Bill. It involves a large expenditure of
money for the purchase of the Grand Trunk
railway. That being so, taking it for
granted that the Government speaks
authoritatively on such matters, we cannot
in this House amend the Bill, because we
had from the lips of the leader cf the
Government this week the statement that
this House could not amend a money Bil.
I rise to question the right of this Chamber
to amend the Bill as it has been amended
in many particulars. The question now
put by the Chair is that the amendments
be concurred in. I rise to a point of order
and upon the affirmation of the leader of
the Government challenge the right of this
Chamber to amend a money Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will
my honourable friend state wherein I have
taken objection to legislation of this kind?
We were then dealing with a money clause.
The amendments which this House has
made to-night are not money clauses but
have simply to do with the corporate procedure of the Company.
The prinHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ciple of this Bill, is to allow an arbitration
to go on and to permit a large sum to be
spent as a result of the findings of the
arbitration. I hold that this is a money
Bill, and that a large expenditure will
result from our action.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
are stultifying yourself badly.

right to amend. It will constitute a precedent, and I ask the ruling of the Chair.

If it were a money Bill the Senate could
not amend it. The amendments proposed

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,

SENATE
my honourable friend any information as
to the probable effect which the French
colonies not coming in will have on that
trade?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As was
stated yesterday, this was merely a modus
vivendi pending the negotiation of a more
permanent arrangement. It is anticipated
that negotiations will take place at an
early date. I cannot give the reasons that
led to the elimination of the French possessions. Possibly the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. BeauLien) knows more of that subject than I.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The inclusion of
the colonies would have considerably complicated the agreement. As it was, it was
necessary that we should keep the main
road open to France. That is what was
done. we are losing very little, if anything at all, by excluding the French
colonies; and I may add that there is no
possibility of competition between France
and Canada as to their respective productions, but I could not say the same thing
if the colonies were included.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would not
the sale of Canadian products in France
be the first step in reaching Algeria and
Tunisia and Morocco, for instance, inasmuch as the purchase of Canadian products for those colonies would be made in
France.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think there is
no doubt of that.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
The schedules were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 82, an Act to amend
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the ohject of this Bill is to modify the application. of the moiety of the fine, which in the
past has gone to the member of the Northwest Mounted Police who might set the law
in motion in cases where penalties are
Imposed. Honourable gentilemen will observe, from the new clause in the BiU,
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

that provision is made for the application
of this moiety: it is to be used for the benevolent purposes of the Police Fund-very
commendable purposes. It is felt that the
application of the moiety in this way shall
have a better influence upon i he Force than
to permit any member to p:ut the money
into his pocket.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I think the Government is to be congratulated upon bringing in this Bill. It is
very much better that the members of the
Police Force should not benefit personally
by these fines. I have a vcry high opinion
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and
I am sure that the members of the Force
themselves will very much appreciate this
change in the Act, because it will remove
all suspicion of a man doing his work
simply for what he may get out of a particular case.
I presume that, owing to
le'gislation enacted in late years with reference to the Drug Act and one or two other
matters, the amount of fines now collected
throughout the country bas somewhat increased.
Possibly my honourable friend
when we go into Committee, will be able
to give us some information as to just what
is the situation in that respect.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
make inquiries.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

I do not profess to

know whether or not there are judges who
desire that they should be relieved of this
duty, but I say it is unfair to many of the
judges in the country, irrespective of the
Province, who accepted their increase of
salary on the understanding that they
might discharge the duties of commissioners, to oblige them by the action of
Parliament not to undertake such work.
That is the position in which they are
placed, and the next thing will be that

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I still firmly
believe that the majority of the people
have a profound respect for the judiciary
of this country. That is particularly true
of the judiciary of the Province of Ontario.
There are cases, and cases will always arise,
in which it would be almost absurd to
have laymen appointed to ýpreside over
commissions. Honourable gentlemen will
remember the case of the Cassells inquiry
of a few years ago regarding the Marine
Department.
The inquiry was a most
thorough and searching one, and when it
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

was all ended both the party in power and
those who had asked for the investigation,
the Opposition of the day, I think, were fully
satisfied with the manner in which the
inquiry had been carried out.
I might go on to mention many other
cases in which judicial commissions have
acted. Take, for instance, that commission
in the so-called shell inquiry of a few years
ago. Had that investigation, which took
place during the war, been referred to
the Public Accounts Committee or to a
special committee of the House of Commons,
I honestly believe that the same satisfaction would not have been given to the
general public as was given by the judges.
who presided in that case. One might
multiply instances of questions which have
been adjudicated by judges. In matters
arising out of the administration of the
finances of the Dominion, I want to say,.

from the political point of view, that there
will always be cases in which it will be
advantageous to appoint commissions of
inquiry. Any person who has followed
the proceedings of the Publie Accounts
Committee of the House of Commons knows
that politics runs riot there. I have seen
cases adjudicated there in which the majority caused the suppression of evidence
that never should have been suppressed, the
result being that the truth which it was
in the public interest to expose was prevented from coming out.

prevails, then we are to have no judges
at all on commissions of inquiry for the
future.
Apart from the wishes of the
judges themselves, who may, as apparently
some of them do, desire to avoid the trouble
and annoyance of having to undertake
such investigations, there are cases in
which judges should act.
At the same
time I would try to correct what I believe is now wrong. Judges and members
of Government are human. It has been
complained that judges are sometimes appointed by one iolitical party or the other
because it is thought by their friends that
they should be on the commission of investigation.
The motion standing in my
name is a substantive amendment to tha
Act, providing first that no judge shall
act as a commissioner until after permission shall have been granted by the
Minister of Justice. My point is this.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would the honourable gentleman read that amendment again,
please?

APRIL 29, 1921
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: "No judge shall
be appointed until bis appointment shail
first have been approved by -the Minister of
Justice." That would apply in the case of
either a Provincial or a Dominion inquiry.
Let us assume for the sake of argument
that it is a provincial inquiry. If this
clause is on the statute book, a local Government, desiring to have an investigation
made, may submit to the Minister of Justice
a certain name for consideration.
The
Minister of Justice knows then that if he
puts bis mark of approval on the gentleman
who has been designated, and if it is
afterwards considered by reason of political
bias that that gentleman bas not given
satisfaction, wbat will be the resuit? The
Minister of Justice knows the political antecedents of every judge in the Dominion,
and will be primarily to blame.
It
cannot be urged at all that the appointment was a political one. The reason is
this. Governments change; one party or
the other will not be in power for ail time
to come. There will always be political
parties in opposition to each other in the
provinces and in the Dominion; but as a
resuit of passing this first clause in the
amendment I propose, tbe Minister of
Justice will bimself approve of the appointment. " But," it may be asked, "if
be approved of a bad appointment, what
then?" Well, the action of the Minister
of Justice will be a fair subject of discussion In this Parliament as'well as in tbe
local legislature. But at tbe present time
there is no repsonsibility at ail upon tbe
Minister of Justice regerding the selection
of commissioners, and consequently no
blame can -be attacbed to him. It bas been
said in tihe House 'from time to time, and
in the newspapers, that divorce cases sbould
ail be relegated to judges. Surely, if matters of that kind, in which there %is no
particular consequence except to.those concerned, can be entrusted to judges others
can be as well.
The second clause would meet the complaint mnade in thse House of the shortage
of judges. Even if the Minister of Justice
does designate a judge after a request bas
been made for bis appointment, that judge
cannot act until the Chief . Justice of the
court to which he belongs bas approved of
bis absence. There is a chance tben that
if the court is short of judges the appointment will not be made from among thse
judges of that court.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: 1 maY
confess that I am only inoving to amend
this Act at the instance of some of the

37j

judges of the Supreme Court of Ontario.
I have nothing but the highest respect for
the judiciary, and do not desire to reflect
in any way upon their conduct. So far as
1 am concerned, I should not bave miade
the motion had I not been a.sked to do so..
Hon.. Mr. FOWLER: Do you not favou-r
tbe motion?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes, I
do, but I would not have troubled myself
about it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You are neglecting
your public duties, then.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
seems to be a feeling that there are commissions upon which in the public interest
judges might be required to act. I would
suggest, then, that we amend the law so
that no judgé would be aliowed to act on
any commission or arbitration, or, in fact,
in any inquiries, in tise province in which
he is a judge. Then if tbe Dominion Government or a provincial Government desire
a judge to act, they would choose one in a
different province to tise one in whicb the
matter of inquiry arose. if tisat method
were followed, it would not be necessary,
as I see it, to, pass the amendment which
I have suggested.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: How would that
affect the judges of the Supreme Court
and the. Exchequer Court?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
It
would notaffect them at ahl unless provision was made for that. That end could
be attained by amending chapter 188 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, by
adding the followirig clause:
No judge nientioned in this Act shall aCt as
commissioner or arbitrator or on any commission of inquiry in a matter arising in the
province in whi.ch such judge exercises his juicial functions, provided that this section shall
flot interfere with. judges who are at present
acting as commissioners or arbitrators complet!ng the work on which. they are employed.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT:
If that were
done, and if the Federal Governnient were
going to appoint a commission-and it is
to be assumed tisat more will be appointed
by the Federal Government than by any
single provincial government-you 'would
exciude ail the judges of the province of
Ontario from participating in those commissions, and you would bring in judges
from say Britishs Columbia.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTOK:
That
is exactly the intention. It is to, prevent
judges from acting in their o'wn province.

78

that a case should be tried by a judge of
the Supreme Court or a judge of the county
court, without naming him, and having it
taken up as part of the business of that
court. That keeps you clear of all chance
of accusations being made against the Government. The repeal of this subsection
simply does away with the appointment of
judges by Order in Council, but it leaves
the Parliament of Canada and the local
legislatures absolutely free to throw into
the courts any matters in which they want
a judicial determination.

I am convinced that the judges should not

There is a t the present time- a growing

SENATE
tendency to look with Iess respect upon
those who hold offices which in the past
have been iegarded as positions of dignity.
I think tba'ý the practice of judges holding
inquiries or acting on commissions bas had
a very marked tendency to lessen the respect in wçhieh they have been held. I
'know that is the case in the province of
Ontario. M~e have judges called upon to
hold inquiries. They perhaps looked rather
harmless at the start, but gradually politics were brougbt in, and that has had the
eifect of lessening the respect of the people
for the judges.
A few days ago the honourable member
from Antigonish (Hon. Mr. Girroir) expressed a fear that if the .iudges were
barred from sitting on commissions the
public interest would suifer. I know that
gentlemen of the legal profession are
possessed of a, somewbat harmless conceit
that they have a monopoly of ail the experience and qualifications which are necessary to weigb evidence and arrive at
conclusions, but for ahl that, I arn disposed
to believe that many commissions could be
handled by business men of large aifairs
and long experience as weIl as by judges.
A business man would flot be hampered
by legal traditionn or legal precedents, and
he would approach the matter directly and
deal with it in a businesslike way.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Like the bull at
the gate.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: And he would
express bis findings in language wbich
would be quite as understandable as the
language which is often used by judges
holding inquiries.
0f course, there are
cases where it would be necessary to have
gentlemen of legal training.
Now, it is
pretty well known that there are in the
country many eminent counsel who have
not been appointed to the Bench-men
who, owing to the exterit of their practice,
have not 'been anxious to be appointed to
the bench, and they would still be available to hold such inquiries. For these reasons 1 amn disposed to support the amendment.
Honourable
Hon. G. W. FOWLER:
gentlemen, I arn heartily in accord with the
amendment that is under discussion. I
yield to no man my appreciation of the
character of the majority of the judges of
Canada. But there are black sheep in
every flock. There are some judges who
take advantage of their position to mille
the treasury. There are some judges who
are not worthy of the positions wbicb they

applies to onîy a very few, tbank Heaven,
of tbe judges of this country. In the main
they are bonourable gentlemen wbo do their
duty and wbo safeguard the interests of
the people and the interests of the country.
There have been, however, too many
chances for judges who are not over
scrupulous witb regard to the taking of
money wbich does not properly belong to
them, to help themnselves along that line.
This Bill, I hope, will remedy that to some
extent.
In my own province there is a judge
about wbom I asked a question and received an answer. I asked bow much be

a certain number of years, that is, ail the
years since his appointment. He has been
13 years on the Bencb, and during this time
bas drawn some $18,000 in addition to bis
statutory allowance. He lived in a town
wbicb was not large, in which there was
not mucb business done and it was not
necessary for chambers to be held, and
chambers were not beld; and this gentleman used to travel to St. John to bold
chambers. Under the statute if be had
lived in St. John he would bave received
no allowance for that; but he lived outside
St. John and made ail the way from $700
to $1,900 every year. Canada bad to pay
some $18,000 in 13 years because that
gentleman cbose to reside in a very beautiful town, but a town wbich bas not a very
large amount of business; whereas if he
had lived in the city of St. John, or in the
city of Frdeericton, or in the city of
Moncton, he yvould not have been able to
draw that large amount of money.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does that state
of aifairs still continue?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 'It will be ended by
this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But it bas continixed up to the present?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It bas continued
up to the present. Wbether remorse or
conscience has caused bis illness or not,
he is now on full pay with six montbs'
heave. Let us hope that remorse bas had
something to do with it.
Now, with regard to this other feature of
the case, that of judges sitting on commissions, 1 arn very stronghy opposed to it.
1 was very mucb struck witb wbat my

APRIL 29, 1921
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
B'elcourt) said on this point, that the very
fact of this discussion taking place in this
House was in itself a proof, and stronger
proof could not be required, of the evil
resuit of judges sitting on commissions. We
have at the present time an instance in this
province, which my honourable friend from
Simcoe (Hon. Mr. Bennett) has held up to
us as an example for ail the provinces of
Canada; and in many respects it is; but
even in Ontario people sometimes stumble.
I can point -to a case in Ontar io, one of the
nxost glaring cases perhaps of the imýpropriety of judges sitting on a commission
which, to say the least, is quasi-political. A
commission is now sitting-I do not think
it has concluded its labours-with regard
to timber questions in the province of Ontario, and upon that commission is sitting
a judge w-ho was a member of a former
Government of the province of Ontario, a
Government that was retired front power
because of its delinquencies. This gentleman is sitting in judgment upon the acts
of a succeeding Government, and, whatever
may have been their sins with regard to
timbe, limits, if there were offences, it is
shown by this very investigation that they
oniy followed in the footsteps of their predecessors, the Government of which this
gentleman was a member. And it was
stated in the legisiature that the commissioners deniandeéI, and received, a considerable sum of money-I think, some $2,000,
and that on account, before they would
proceed with the investigation. Now, that
is a state of affairs that does not reflect
very much credit upon the judiciary. The
comments, of these two gentlemen entrusted with that commission were most
disgraceful. If my honourable friend to my
left (Hon. Mr. Donnelly), in stating that
laymen could perform these duties with
quite as good effect as judges, had these
gentlemen in mi, hie might very well
make that statement, for I know of very
f ew laymen who would have made the
saine unfortunate exhibition of themselves
as these gentlemen did. TaIk about judges
speaking in a judicial way: I neyer read
anything that was so lacking in ahl the
elements that go to make up an honest
judge. Do you think that the people of
the country, laymen, reading in the newspapers the remarks of these nmen, would
be impressed with the fairness of judges?
I say itwould be sqflcient if there were
nothing before us but the object lesson in
the investigation which is being held by
that commission: in the first place, their

381

greed in demanding, as the highwayrnan
would demand, the $2,000, because they
knew this Act was coming. That was the
reason why: they wanted to escape it;
they wanted to get their money first and
have it in their pockets.
And these are
the two gentlemenHon. Mr. BENNETT: If the honourable
gentleman will allow me-Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, I will allow
you.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I read tliat report
through. I have the honour and pleasure
of being acquainted with both the judges
referred to, and I think it is only fair to
say that, as I understand, they did not
make a demand before the inquiry started,
but that during the course of the investigation the money was handed over, and
about the saine time the Act of last Session
was passed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I will accept what
my honourable friend says.
Perhaps it
was after. the inquiry commenced.
But
the point I arn making is that it was in
anticipation of this Act being passed. It
was before the Act was passed, but after
it had been introduoed and notice of it was
given, that this demand for $2,000 was
made. That was stated in the legislature
and not denied.
What my honourable
friend has said does not help the casenot in the slightest degree.
-Hon. Mr. BLAIN: And they got the
money.t
Ho'n. Mr. FOWLER:
They got the
money, and they have it yet, and, I suppose, they jntend to retain it too. I should
judge they would.
Both of those gentlemen were very much
amused at the dlaim of privilege that was
put forward by a member of this House
on behaîf of himself as a Senator, but I
notice that they were very ready with their
claim of privilege when an action was
brought against them by the Spanish River
Pulp and Paper Company.
They were
very ready then to avail themselves of the
dlaim of privilege, although they were
themselves very facetious with regard to
the dlaim of privilege that was made in the
case in which a member of this House
was involved. Fortunately the court that
heard the case decided that the dlaimi
which this member made of privilege was
well founded in law and their judgment
was set aside. Judges will make errors of
judgment with regard to the law, and that

SENATE
is not necessarily to their discredit; but it
is to their discredit to act as those two
gentlemen have acted with regard to that
inquiry.
Now, I do not care two cents about the
political aspect of that matter; it does not
make any difference to me; but I do say
that when judges are put on commissions
that are quasi-political in character, they at
once become, in the eyes of the public, partizan, and it injures them from the judicial
point of view. It seems to me very important that we should prevent that as far as
we can for the future. This Parliament,
which has the power to appoint and controls
the purse strings, should have, and bas, the
power to say what the judges shall and
what they shall not do. The Dominion
Parliament does not set apart and define
the judicial districts, but it certainly bas
full power with regard to the conduct of
the judges. I hope that this amendment
will pass.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: It seems to me
that in this discussion we are getting away
from the real question, which 'is whether
the principle of allowing judges to sit on
commissions should or should not be
adopted. I for one would not allow myself
for a moment to believe that because there
are criminals all the laymen in Canada are
at fault. The case referred to by my honourable friend who bas just taken his seat
proves nothing except that possibly the
wrong judges were chosen to sit upon that
commission. His only argument, or his
main argument, against the appointment
of one of those gentlemen to the timber
commission was that be had been a member of a Government which preceded another Government whose acts were invoived
in this inquiry. That means nothing more
than that the wrong judge may have been
chosen. If another judge had been chosen
in his place, that question could not possibly have arisen.
The argument bas been advanced that
when judges are engaged in trying a question wihch bas a poltical aspect, the cry is
raised throughout the country that in their
.decision they may have been actuated by
political motives. Honourable gentlemen, I
defy this Parliament, or any other Parliament, to appoint a commission or a court
to try any question, whose decision will not
be criticized by the public and especially
by those against whom the decision is given.
All sorts of motives, political, financial,
personal, will be urged against them. This
Senate bas given decisions from time to
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

time, and I have never heard any great
question decided here but that the parties
against whom the decision was rendered
urged the abolition of the Senate, declaring that the Senate was actuated by partisan and political motives. I am told, I do
not know whether it is true or not, that in
the case of eight or nine appeals which the
city of Toronto took to the Privy Council,
that body decided against them, and immediately the City Council of Toronto met
and very solemnly passes resolutions for
the abolition of the Privy Council. So it
does not matter whom you get to try a
case and give a decision, the party decided
against always says that the deciding party
had an axe to grind or had some improper
motive. We shall never get away entirely
from that effect, no matter whom we
appoint to commissions.
Another honourable gentleman said that
laymen could be appointed to commissions
as well as judges. That is quite true: there
is no question about that. But there are
sôme cases, and I think he admitted it,
in which the peculiar legal knowledge which
judges have will be of great benefit kecause
quasi-legal questions have to be decided.
Evidence bas to be weighted and sifted;
documents which often require -legal training in order to be properly understood have
to be examined. In cases such as these
it will no doubt be necessary to have
judges, or some judges at least, on commissions. But the argument that laymen
would do the work on commissions as well
as judges in some cases is absolutely no
argument in favour of this amendment,
because this amendment bas the effect of
taking away absolutely the right of judges
to sit upon commissions.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Did my honourable
friend say that it is necessary to have
judges? Could not lawyers, not on the
bench, be appointed?
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR:

Probably.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then what is the
argument on ibehalf of the judges? Are
they not well enough paid now? Is it the
purpose to give them more money?
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR:, I shall answer the
honouraible gentleman in a ilittle while. Perhaps I might as well answer my honourable
friend now, if I can. I do not say that it is
absolutely necessary, for the weighing of
evidence or for the understanding cf judicial matters that may be involved; but I
say that their ezaperience is of great value,

at issue.
I differ from the honourable
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
wtth great reluctance, [because he is a
man of great experience both as a lawyer
and a parliamentarian; but I suppose
that even those . of us who have nlot had
great experience in Parliament and otherwise have a duty to perform, and we must
flot hesitate to say what we have to say
when we think we are right. He says that
this discussion proves that judges should
not preside over commissions. I think the
discussion of itself proves nothing. Argumnents prove things, but discussions do
not. We are trying to avoid methods that
will cause: the dignity of the bench ta
suifer because certain judges appointed on
commissions will be criticized throughout
the country; but, as I have pointed out,
sucli criticism would be Ievelled at any
person who ever tries a case or gives a
decision in this or any other country. And
in trying to avoid that possible danger
we are depriving this country of the benefits that 'would corne fromi decisions of men
whom the public look upon as being as
much separated from political strife
as it is possible to find anybody.
How are we going to get away fXom

for life. They are not perfect; we have
had judges, perhaps in this and other countries, who should have been in the penitentiary rather than on the bench; but
taking them man for mnan, they certainly
stand as high morally as any other class
of men in this world.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is true.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: The argument is
used that the appointment of a judge ta
a position of that kind may be a rç'ward
for political support he bas given te o me

cause in past years. People say: 'IThie
Government bas appointed this judge te
the bench, and now a commission of enquiry is to be held, and there is an opportunity for further rewarding him for
work he bas done for the party in days
gone by." But that argument will apply
to anybody who is appointed, even to a
greater degree, because the very moment you
eliminate judges from commissions you
have every lawyer in the country who bas
supported the Government that is appointing
the commission Iobbying in Parliament to
get the appointment. He will say: " You
appointed Mr. Smith ta the bench; you
rewarded him for bis work, but I got
nothing; naw is your chance te appoint
me on this commission?"
Hon.* Mr. BARNARD: Let the Civil
Service Commission do it.
Hon. Mr~. GIRROIR: So that is seeking
to escape what I think is an inevitable
danger, fia matter what course you may
take in regard to commissions, you will
faîl into, dangers just as great. You would
be leaving decisions ta commissions which.
would be as open te criticism as they would
be if given by judges, and yet you are
depriving yourselves of the wieght of decisien which comes from- the fact that the
cammissioners are judges who are outside
of political warfare, who take no share
in party politics, who da nat even vote,
who arc independent -because they are secure
in their positions, and who remain independent in order that they may be able
ta give their judgments freely.
.Some speaker went even se far as te say
that the judges had made large sums of
money by sitting on those commissions.
I do nlot knaw whether the honourable gentleman who made that remark meant that
the judges had got that money illegally or
dishonestly; but let us suppose that that
is true. I am sure there are athers in the
country Who, if ooca>sion met them haîf
way, would go the ather haîf way' and hold
out bath *hands. Surely the idea does not
prevail in this country that aur judges are
aIl so carrupt that it is dangerous ta appoint
tbem ta try a case where inducements may
be held out. As a matter of fact, the
judges are net now paid ta sit upou commissions, sa that if they get anything at
all it will have ta be gotten wronglt.
Therefore I say that we should at least
look into this matter more careful-Ly than
we have done before we decide ta prevent
meinhers of our judiciary from. Sitting on
commissions. Whatever we may think, I
believe the country at large would consider

SENATE
that we were taking a retrograde step, and,
instead of strengthening the decisions of
commissions which may be given from time
to time, we should be weakening them very
much, because if one motive could be
assigned to a judge for deciding in a certain way on a commission, fifty could be
assigned to any other than a judicial member of a commission. A lawyer may be
put on a commission as a reward for
political services, and what is the motive
guiding him? If he gives- his decision in
such a way as to establish the Government
in power there is a mighty good chance of
bis getting on the beneh. So it does not
matter who is put on those commissions,
motives will be ascribed, and insinuations
will be sent out broadcast through the
country by those who are affected adversely
by the decisions given, that the judges
were actuated by improper motives, that
this thing and that thing induced them to
act wrongly. You will have that sort of
criticism in all cases; and yet if you forbid
judges from acting, you are going to lose
the authority which naturally accompanies
decisions of the bench.
We have succeeded, I believe, in placing
our judiciary in this country in such a
position that, speaking generally, they possess the confidence of the public, and their
decisions are looked upon as the very best
possible decisions that could be given
under the circumstances. Of course, those
who are hurt by such decisions will naturally ascribe all sorts of motives, but that
is quite natural, and I am sure that we
can do no better than leave matters as they
are. But if we do take a step at all it
should be this, that judges should be allowed
to sit upon commissions, and that the naming of them should be left to some independent tribunal, or, as suggested by the honourable member from Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross), that the matter should be
referred generally to the bench, allowing
the bench to decide, so that there will be no
selection of particular judges by interested
parties; but to cut away altogether the
right and the privilege of judges being appointed is a mistake, in my opinion.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The very high esteem in which I hold the judiciary of this
country compels me to say a few words

friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchThe position of the commisStaunton).

He very nearly

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: No.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then I take my
honourable friend's word. In the case referred to-the so-called timber probe in
Ontario-these esteemed judges have been
acting for somewhere between nine and ten
months, and the reason why it has dragged
so long is, I presume, because they are
otherwise engaged, in attending to their

point which has been brought before them
for consideration appears to be to ascertain if the lumbermen in the province of
Ontario have been getting for nothing from
the Province, as alleged, immense quantities of timber. They are seeking to decide
that point. Now, if that commission had
been composed of practical men, instead of
judges, the very first thing which they
would have done, in order to decide the
legal over-run to which a lumberman is
entitled, would be to go to a saw-mill, have
logs measured before they go into the mill,
and have the product of the logs measured
afterwards. That was not done by these
commissioners; but the Minister of Lands
and Forests of Ontario, who is not a judge,
but evidently a practical man, decided, in
a businesslike manner, to do this. He sent
men around to the different mills and ascertained within a few days what the legal
over-run should be. Now, my point is this
-that if this course had been taken at the
start, the Province would have been saved
a great deal of money, and the lumber
trade of thé Province would not have been
exposed so long to insidious attacks of the
press and character assassins. I took occasion not long ago to find out if judges in
the United States sat on commissions, and
I found that in the State of Michigan,
where judges are elected, not appointed as
they are here, although there is no law
forbidding them to act on commissions of
any description, they have decided of their
own volition and by consent, that they
will not act upon arbitrations or commissions of any description. I think that it is
very important that this amendment should
be carried, in the interest of the judges as

APRIL 29, 1921
well as the people, and 1 arn satisfied that
there is no person who will veleorne such
an Act as this more than the judges thernselves.
To-day, as a resuit of these judges acting
on this particular Commission, you will
find that at ieast one great political party
in the province of Ontario, nearly es a
whoie, is under the impression that those
judges are prejudiced and biassed; and, no
matter what their decision may be, Chey
wili stili dling*to that opinion. CQnsequently 1 have great pleasure in endorsing
the amendment of my honourable friend
from Hamilton.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is the law
now.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: How does it corne,
then, that we have judges stýll drawing
rnoney for acting as commissioners in such
cases* as my honourable friend from Antigonish (Hon. Mr. Girroir) has referred to?
Is that in contravention of the law?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: That was started
before the law was passed.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Do 1 understand
that from this time forth no judge can
draw any money for acting as a commis-

Hon. Mr. TURR'IFF: It seerns to me
that there is one point that has not been
rnentioned in this discussion. When judges
are appoînted in this country, they are*
appointed for life, and their salaries are
fixed, and they are nlot supposed to engage
in any business except to deai with the
cases that corne before the particular court
over which they preside. Not being a
lawyer, but a simple layrnan, it strikes me
that it would be better for the judges themselves that they should net be put in a
position to be criticised,,as judges are being
criticised at the present tirne for acting
on commissions. By permitting a judge to
make $2,000 or $3,000 or $5,000 extra a
year, you are aoing away with some part
of his independence. You must remember
that ak the time he is earning this Imoney
by sitting on a commission he is stili being
paid by the country to do the duty for
whichl he has been appeinted and whicli he
is not doing.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
as an allowance for expenses.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: The honourable
gentleman must remember that under the
Act of last year judges are not allowed
anything extra for these commissions.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: And therefore do
nlot want to serve on them.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I arn ceming to
that point. It seems to me that the matter
might very easiiy be remiedied if it were
made absolutely clear in the Act that while
a judge was sitting on a commission he
shouid get absolutely no remuneration
other than the remuneration he gets as a
judge. The Dominion Government appoints
ail the judges, and it ought surely to be
easy to make it clear that they cannot
draw any extras by way of bonuses or in
any other shape or formi outside of the
salary they receive under their appçintment.

Except

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend from Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr.
Watson) points out that within the last
couple of weeks a judge has been appointed
to the Grain Commission. My own opinion
îs that judges should net be appointed on
any commission. I do not agree with my
honourable friend from Antigonish (Hon.
Mr. Girreir), who thinks it is a great
advantage to have a judge on a commissien. In my opinion we have as good legal
talent arnong the lawyers as will be found
on the bench; we have men who would give
just as good decisions, decisions that would
be respected equally with thoâe of any
judge in the Dominion of Canada. As bas
been peinted out, we have had judges in
the past who solicited these commissions
and in that way increased their incomes.
I think.matters would be very much better
if they were prohibited from acting on
commissions, or, if they are net, from drawing any pay for that work. My 'honourable
friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) has said that under the present
iaw they can draw their exiDenses. I have
seen cases, net on the bench, in which men
were given nothing in the way of a salary,
but were given an allowance for expenses
that would make a mighty good salary
and one which most people would be glad
te get. Se you are net getting over the
difficulty in that way. I think the safe
thing te do is te prohibit the judges from
performing any duties outside cf the duties
for which they were appeinted.

sions, or commissions which !afterwards
develop into such. The appointment of the
judges arises in one of two ways: one is
because a Government, we will say, provincial or Dominion, desires an investigation of a certain thing. They name a
judge, and of course human nature is such
that they are not going to name one who
will throw them down. More frequently
charges are made against a department or
an official of the Government, and the judge
is again named by the Government-by the
v.ery people whose conduct is going to be
investigated-and every honourable member of this House knows that when a commission of judges is going to be appointed
for the investigation of anything the very
first question canvassed is, "Who are going
to be the judges?" I have no reflection to
make on the judges at all; I stand up for
the dignity of the bench; but I do know
as a matter of actual observation that
people are intensely interested in who is
going to be the judge, and recognize that
when he is engaged in a quasi-political
matter be is still very human.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The honourable
gentleman from Antigonish bas, it seems
to me, the wrong idea of what is actuating
those of us who are opposed to judges acting on commissions. For my part, I will
try to make it as clear as I can-so that
even the honourable gentleman from Antigonish can understand-what my idea is in
regard to this matter.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: My honourable
friend is under the impression that I do
not think be is actuated by the very highest
motives in everything he bas said. I want
to assure himHon. Mr. FOWLER: My honourable
friend would not insinuate anything else.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I want to assure
him that I ascribe nothing but the very
highest motives to everyone who has
spoken on this question, and I expect the
same treatment from him.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: One of the most
important things in any country is that the
people of the country shall have confidence
in the judiciary, because, if they have not,
that lack of confidence is something which
strikes at the very root of constitutional
government. Therefore we want the judges
removed from any suspicion of partisanship or injustice or lack of fair play, and,
in order to remove them from that, we
want to take them away from the position
Hon.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

of Commissioners to investigate quasi-political matters, so that the people shall not
be able to say: "Well, this man is a judge,
but he is still a partisan."
The statute
creating judges says that they shall have
a job for life or good conduct and that they
shall have a salary which will not render
it necessary for them to do outside business in order to live; and, as incomes go in
this country, no one can say that Canada
has not been generous with its judges. I
venture to say that 50 ber cent of the
judges sitting on the þench to-day are in
the enjoyment from their judicial salaries
of very much higher remuneration than
they ever received when at the bar, because, while they might have had a larger
income while practising at the bar, there
was a larger outgo. They had to keep up
offices and staffs of stenographers and
clerks; they had to undergo the expense of
travelling and that kind of thing, which
they do not have to undergo now. In addition to that, when judges become incapacitated for work, after twenty-five years,
they retire on full pay and it would take
a very considerable investment to create
an annuity as large as a judge's pension.
So, they are very handsomely remunerated,
and for that reason they ought not to desire and ought not to get anything more
in the way of remuneratiop from the Government. When they are performing duties
on commissions, as the honourable gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff)
has pointed out, they are not performing
the duties for which they were appointed;
and if they have time to attend to these
outside duties as well as their judicial
duties, then we have too many judges. The
complaint is made that the judges are overworked, and yet we are going to give them
more to do.
The timber probe, which bas been mentioned, bas been going on for about ten
months. It is in the interest of the general
public and in the interest of* the judges
themselves, in order that the fountain of
justice shall remain pure and unpolluted
in the eyes of the people, that they should
be confined to their proper judicial work.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
We
have passed the other sections of this Bill,
and, as I understand, are now considering
an amendment. My own impression is that
the sense of the House has been pretty
well obtained in reference to the amendment proposed and spoken to by so many

rising is to ask the Committee to rise and

Watson in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-agreement approved:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There are one or
two points in this agreement about which
I want to get some explanation from the
leader of the Government. I do not know
whether we had better discuss them. now or
wait until we get the schedule.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE4ED: We
cannot change the schedule.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No, but we might
have sonie information about it, I presume.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
know whether I shahl be able to, give it.
If I gave it, you might .want to change
the schedule.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No, I do flot say
I want to change it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
îs the point?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: One of the points
is in regard to the hotels and bungalows.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: AUl I
would say to, My honourable friend là that
lie must not take that too seriously. The
gond offices of the 'Government will lie exercised in endeayouVring to induce the making
S--25à

287

of improvements of this klnd. We are not
commit ted to that. The Government is
not going to do it. As my honourable
friend will observe, the language is: If a subsidlzed steamship, service la arranged
for the Government of Canada wiil endeavour
to secure the co-operation of the owners of such
steamship service towards the provision of
hotels and bungalows In the Colonies. the'Governments of the Colonies being prepared on their
part ta off er such facilities as may be praoticable, both as regards sites andi financial assistance.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What does that
mean?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It simp]y
means that if a steamship company is
subsidized, the Government will point out to
it the desirability of co-operating with thé
Colonies in build-ing hotels and bungalows.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Ta accommodate
tourists?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Yes,
but there is nothing binding.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think it is sýtili
more important that the Governinent
should insist that the plague of rats should
he abohished on board the ships that are
subsidized-because I think it is very serious-and should see that good accommodation is given so that the people can travel
in comfort.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
We
might have put in an article to that. effect,
had we known of it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I wish I had been
here. I would have moved an amendment,
because I have talked with people who
have visited the islands-I have not been
there myself-and they say that is the great
objection.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
My
honourable friend knows that when a rat
leaves the ship it usual-ly creates consternation, and it might discourage the steamship
traffic between the two ports.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is when the
rats have made the ship unseaworthy; but
the service would be improved if the rats
were not there at ail.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There is a point
to which J drew my honourable friend'a
attention on the second reading, namely,
that a group of the Leeward Islands have
not ratified this agreement. I asked the
honourable gentleman if lie could tell us
whether any of the other parties to this
treaty have refused to 'ratify it.

SENATE

388

In
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
the first place, Bermuda, as I understand,
has refused to confirn the action of its
representative at the conference, and that
is owing to the reason I pointed out the
other day, namely, its trade relations with
the United States. But Bermuda is, I
suppose, the best judge of its own trade
relations, and it has refused to join in the
treaty. The only other island of which we
had not heard a week or ten days ago was
Barbados. I am unaware whether any
word has come since. But the treaty is so
drawn that they can become parties to it
and participate in its advantages. In the
meantime, if they refuse to come in, of
course they have not the advantages of the
treaty; but Canada is not precluded from
trading with that Island upon the same
footing as with the other nations with
whom the treaty is in force.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I understand that
in Bermuda there is a feeling 'that they
have been badly treated by the Canadian
sugar refineries in their contracts for raw
sugar. I met the other day a gentleman
from Barbados who had just come up, and
I had a long conversation with him, in
which he told me that that was the reason
why the agreement would not be ratified.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Other
reasons ,were given in their legislature.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Another question
arises, with regard to the subsidizing. Certain of these islands agree to share in the
subsidizing of the steamships, but if they
do not ratify the treaty that agreement of
course falls to the ground. I presume that
the Canadian Government will if necessary
supply the subsidy which is not forthcoming from the islands that do not ratify the
agreement.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We do
not need to conduct our service to those
particular islands. If Barbados should not
corne in, we would be relieved of that obligation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes, but it might
be practically necessary or desirable for the
steamer to go that way.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If it is
to our advantage it can do so, bpt it would
not be done for the advantage of Barbados.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Article 15 deals
with the western group of Islands, that is,
the Bahamas, Jamaica and British Honduras. It says:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

The Government of Canada, subject to the
adoption by the Governments concerned of the
recommendations embodied in Article XVI, undertakes to provide as soon as possible, and in
any case not later than January 1, 1921, a
fortnightly freight, mail and passenger steamship service between Canada, the Bahamas,
Jamaica, and British Honduras.

Has that service been established?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
There is now a service operating between
those Islands and Canada, the subsidized
service, to which Canada contributes. I
cannot at the moment mention the amount;
I think it is between $300,000 and $400,000 annually. It is the Royal Mail Packet
Service. The Canadian Mercantile Marine
has been for some time past, and is, I fancy,
even now, plying between Halifax and different islands, giving a freight service.
That bas been in addition to the subsidized
service which is being carried on with those
ports by the Royal Mail Packet steamship
line.
Hon. Mr. TODD: Is the honourable
leader referring to the western islands?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not referring to any particular islands.
There are several ports of call.
Hon. Mr. TODD: I have had the pleasure
of spending a few winters there. I was
there part of last winter. The subsidized
steamships did not run to the western
islands. The Canadian Government Mercantile Marine run a passenger and

the Bahamas and at Kingston, Jamaica.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: May I explain to
the honourable gentleman that it was the
western group I was referring to. That
includes Jamaica, the Bahamas, and British
Honduras.
Hon. Mr. TODD: The western group
are the islands to which I am referring. A
subsidized steamship does not run there.
There bas been some talk about competition between the Canadian Mercantile
Marine and the subsidized ships, but so far
as the western group is concerned there is

packet never called at these islands. It
is an entirely new service.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed to.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: With regard to the
eastern group, as I understand, the Royal
Mail packets operate between Halifax, Bermuda, and this group, and receive a large
subsidy, and the Canadian Government

APRIL 29, 1921
have also a line of freight boats operating
there. It would seem to me that the time
ought soon to arrive when we should stop
the subsidizing of the Royal Mail packet
line. I know that is a passenger line, while
the Government boate are freight boats, but
niost of that passenger trafflc is for people
who are un pleasure trips, and they are
flot very particular whether their boat
goes 15 knots or 12 knots. I know that
some of the 'Government boats have been
fitted up for this western service that has
just been mentioned, to the Bahamas,
Kingston, and Belize. The service ie for
passengers; it is a most excellent service,
and has given the utmost satisfaction. It
is juet as good as that of the Royal Mail
packet, only that the boats do flot travel
quite su fast, It would seem to me that
it would be in the intereet of economy-and
no doubt it is the Government's intention
to do it ultimately-to abandon that subsidy to the Royal Mail packet boats,
amounting to $300,000 or #400,000 a year.
The cancellation of that subsidy would go
a long way towards making up any deficit
t'hat rnay occur fromn the operation of the
Government boats between Halifax and
that eaetern group.
As I understand, there is a gréat deal
of traffic with the eaetern group. The
Royal Mail packet boats accommodate fromn
one hundred to three hundred passengers;
in fact, the subsidy agreement provides
that they must have accommodation for one
hundred first-class passengers, as well as
for a number of second and third-class. So
it would apparently be necessary to have
some of those freight boats fitted up to
carry that many passengers. It seeme to
me very desirable that we should encourage
this traffic. I know there are bhundreds,
perhaps thousands, of Canadians living as
far west as Ontario, who would prefer to
go to the West Indian islands for their
winter trips if they could go by our own
boats and from our own.ports. At present
they have to go to New York and take a
Ward Line boat to the western group of
islands; at very high rates, too, and they
get no better service than je given by Government boats. Last winter the Ward
Line charged $125 Irom New Yor~k 'Lo
Nassau, and on the Government boats
running frors Halifax to Naseau, almoat
twice as f ar, the fare was $90, with just
as good service. I do not know whether
the Government makes the services pay or
ijot, but that will soon be ascertained. Su
far as the western group are concerned,
they are splendidly provided for. There

389

are no subeidies paid to any other line,
and the Government boats carry a certain
number of passengers. What I should like
to see is a service to the eastern group, on
which there je a much larger passenger
traffic, fitted up in the cames way. Some
of the boats that are now, as I understand,
on the stocks, only partially 1?uilt, miglit
be fitted up for that passenger service.« I
have heard that that was to, be done, and
1 would like to know from the honourable
leader of the House if that je true.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Some
freight chips have already been fitted up
for the purpose of ca'rrying between thirty
and forty paseengers, and attention is now
being given to the advisability of this
steamship service being carried out by
Government boate. The subeidy to, the
Royal Mail Packet is being temporarily
continued, but can be terminated at almost
any time. The contract has expired, but
pending oux making a better arrangement
we are simply continuing the subsidy.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: On this matter
of subsidies I would like to point ont to
my honourable friend the leader of the
House that the other day, at a meeting of
a comniittee, I heard a man who has been
in the'ocean shipping business for the last
40 yeare express emphatically the opinion
that the giving of a subsidy wae the ruination of the trade 'between those two points;
that it did more harmn than good. Not only
wae the money expended without any corresponding advantage, but it caused a leseening of trade. He said it happens in this
way. The granting of a large subsidy, such
as we give to many lines, to a particular
uine naturally draws trade to that line.
If there were no subsidy at all, other uines
would put shipc on the samne route and
there would be competition, lower rates of
freight and better attention to the business; but when a eubsidy ie paid, they will
flot touch it at ail. The opinion of thie
shipping man, having large and smaîl
steamers on the different oceans, was that
it would be far better for the country not
to give any siibsidy whatever. Goodness
knowc we have expenditures enough, and
if we can cave a few million dollars that
we are now paying out in subeidies, and

It would be well for the Guverniment tu
take up the question and see what eau be
done in this respect. That is altogether
apart frors the decirability of having the
West Indian trade carried on by the bas

SENATE
that the country owns. I just wished to
bring this matter to the attention of the
honourable leader, so that he might look
into it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like to
ask the honourable leader of the Government a question with regard to sehedule A,
dealing with the Canadian tariff. It says:
The Customs Tariff of Canada shall be
so as to provide that sugar above
amen'ded
number 16 Dutch Standard in colour when imported by a recognized sugar refiner, for refining
purposes only, upon evidence satisfactory to the
Minister of Customs, shall not be subject to
these duties.

Does that mean that the raw sugar from
these islands will come in altogether free
of duty?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot give any more information than is con-

tained in the agreement. That paragraph
would mean that whatever duty may be
placed upon the general tariff would obtain.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The general
tariff, item 134, says the duty is $1.93.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
tariff applies only to sugar coming within
that particular standard. Outside of that
the general tariff prevails.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Then there is another point. There is an item of "cocea
beans," in which, as I read it, we are to
give a preference to these islands of $1.50
on the hundred pounds, whereas in the next
item we are giving a preference of ten
cents. According to the general tariff in
the case of the first item the duty is only
75 cents on the hund-red pounds; so I cannot see how we are going to give a preference to these islands.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend must have read that
wrongly. That is a preference of $1.50 per
hundred pounds?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes. The general
tariff here says that the duty on that particular item is 75 cents per hundred pounds.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot tell the honourable gentleman anything
about that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I desire to draw
my honourable friend's attention to it because I did not understand it. The tariff
reads:
Cocoa beans not roasted, crushed or ground
(per hundred pounds): British Preferential
Tariff, free; Intermediate Tariff, 75 -cents;
General Tariff, 75 cents.
;Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

The question arises, how can we under
the circumstances give a preference of
$1.50, unless this means that we remit the
duty and give the importer a bonus of .75
cents on every hundred pounds he brings
into the country?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It does
not mean that. I will direct the attention
of the Minister of Trade and Commerce
to it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: And the same thing
occurs in the next item.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I hope
to explain that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would my honourable friend give the explanation on the third
reading?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. I
will make inquiries about that.

POSSESSION OF WEAPONS BILL
SECOND READING POSTPONED

Han. N. A. BELCOURT moved the second reading of Bill M3, an Act to amend
certain provisions of the Criminal Code
respecting the Possession of Weapons.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a Bill of very considerable importance, and,
if I may be permitted to say so, one to
which I have given a good deal of thought
and consideration. I realize that the Bill
will necessitate a very serious discussion
before it becomes law, and I crave the attention of the House not only to what I
am about to say in support of the principle of the Bill but also their attention
and consideration of the Bill itself.
I
think the time has arrived when a measure
of this sort is absolutely necessary to the
interests of Canada.
In order that I may serve a double purpose, may I be permitted to read certain
newspaper editorials on the subject which
have recently appeared.
Reading these
editorials will serve to explain the principle of the Bill and the reason for it, and
will also, I think, prove conclusively that
public opinion in Canada is not only ready
for a measure of this sort, but actually
demands it. I shall make my remarks
as brief as possible. The extracts are a
little lengthy, but I think they will be interesting to honourable gentlemen.
The first one is from the Quebec Telegraph, and is entitled: "The Deadly Revolver." It says:
The deadly revolver still bas its part in a
number of the most frightful tragedies. In the
saddest newspaper stories of the day it plays a
'leading role. It was the possession and use of
the illegal firearm that led to the unfortunate
defendant Letourneau betng now on his trial
for murder at Arthabaskaville. A similar
weapon in the hands of the Montreal prisoner,
Griffith, caused the death of the lamented Mr.
Holland. Only on Tuesday night last, Joseph
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

Leclerc, of St. Romuald, had a narrow escape
from death, because a bullet apparently intended for his heart only entered his arm.
Every year hundreds if not thousands of
similar tragedies are enacted because people are
allowed to go round armed with the deadly
revolver. There is actually upon the statute
book a law prohibiting the possession of a
revolver without a special permit for the purpose. Nobody in authority however seems to
care about its enforcement.

I think it was the Ottawa Evening
Journal which reproduced this article from
the Quebec Telegraph. Then it goes on
to comment as follows:
Enforcement of such a law is a difficult matter; and always must be if sale of revolvers be
permitted at ail. A prohibitive law is neededprohibition of manufacture, of importation, of
sale, of possession. Revolvers are of no good use
on earth. One excusable use is for police purposes; but no policeman would need a revolver
if no criminal had one. Revolvers should be
abolished. Half or more of the number of cri.mes
of violence committed in the civilized world are
committed by means of revolvers; a large number of these crimes would not be committed at
ail but for the deadly facility of the revolver.

I am not just sure from what paper the
next clipping comes. It is entitled: "The
Revolver Hbit." It says:
Despite stringent legislation directed against
it, the revolver habit, fruitful source of homicide, still flourishes in Ontario. The Federal and
Provincial Governments have done much by
legislation to discourage the carrying of revolvers, but the co-operation of the people is
needed to stamp out the practice.
The criminal code, section 118, provides that
no person shall carry a revolver except upon a
permit granted by a Poli.ce Magistrate after
hearing evidence on oath as to the reasons why
permission is sought. The Legislature has supplemented this by an act providing that no person shall buy a revolver unless when purchasing
he presents a permit to the dealer selling the
weapon from the Chief of Police of a city or
town, or the Superintendent of the Provincial
Police. The permit is retained by the vendor and
a return is made to the Attorney-General's
Department in Queen's Park, giving the name
and address of the purchaser.
The startling fact is made public that in a
little over six months no less than 514 permits
have been granted in Ontario for the purchase
of revolvers. Quite a few of these permits were
for banks and other financial institutions, but
far too many of them were not based on any
real need for the protection of either person of
property.
The matter is very largely in the hands of
the Chiefs of Police throughout the Province.
They have power to grant permits for the purchase of revolvers or to refuse them. It would
be well that they should regard each weapon
added to the total In use as the possible cause
of a tragedy, and to refuse permits unless
urgent need is proved. There can be 'no legitimate demand for the addition of over 500 to
Ontario's stock of revolvers in six months.
Public opinion favors the most rigid inquiry
into the reasons advanced for the purchase and
carrying of firearms. The man with a revolver
is a menace to the lives of his fellows, even
when he intends to use it only in self-defence.
The revolver habit must be discouraged.

MAY 3, 1921
The Ottawa Journal of November 3,
1920, had the following article:
Stop the Revolver!
Judge LatchMord of the Ontario HkIh Court
sentenced. to a year in prison Monday at St.
CatharInes a doldier named Grant, who had
shot another mari, wounding hlàm badly. Grant
had had a fine record sa a soldier, and Judge
Latchford eaid he was very sorry te have to
convict hlm, the crime having been cornmitted
in a fit of passion. Thre weapon was a revolver.
11 would make it a crime for anyone to carry
a revolver," remarkeçl the judge. Probably If a
revolver had not been handy Grant's offence
would not have been serious.
To make the carrying o! a revolver a crime
would be better than nothing. But would not .a

far better law be to prohibit revolvers altogether? Prohibit possession, prohibit sale, prohibit manufacture, prohdbit importation?
1 arn sure those four words well sumnmarize the object of the Bill-prohibit possession, sale, manufacture, importation.
The Journal goes on to say:
More thari half of ahl crimes o! violence are
committed witi4 revolvers. Many of these crimes
would net be commnitted at aîl if revolvers were

not a faciiity for people whose morals are bad
or whose tempers are hot.
Anid revolvers are useless in time off peace for
any purpose except viclous violence by onie
human being to ariother. Some people make a
plea thiat revolvers are a protection agaànst
criminals, or a deterrence te criminal operatioris.

We imagine that If a reader cudgels his memory

he wilýl not be able to reoall orie case where a

civiliari with a revolver stood off a criminal

against one thousand cases where crimes have
been comrmitted by the aid of a revolver. Se, to
allow 'the latter debauch o! crime to flourish lni
order to trouble some one criminal every few

years

needed

is childish enough.
by

either

Revolvers are not
or

unless

the manufacture, sale or possession of revolvers
would soon deprîve criminals of the deadly,
weaporis. F'ossibly for a thne the police might

be allowed to continue entitled to use them.

The Montreal Star quoted the following
from a Toronto Star editorial:
Q

iNow, then, cEverybody Answer!
The revolver is almost exclusively used as
a murder gun. Why, in these days and in a
country like ours, are they made and soitI?

The Montreal Telegraph and Herald
published the following strong article:
The Murder Wave
Last August when the city had been ehockefi

by a

succession o!

stabbings

and shootings

amorig our foreign borri felloyw citizens, we
urged that a check be ?plaoed upon the sale of
weapons i Montreal. We sugiested, for Instance, that no one should be allowed to buy or
to carry a revolver except he had a Govern-

ment license or permit, and that this permit

should cost enough and shoulfi be issuefi with
eriough discrimination te discourage the purchase andI use of th..t "awfully-handy" weapon
which s0 frequently is the cause of death ln
our midst. Our suggestions et the tizme were

well received by the authorities, but up to the
Vresent, apparentiy, neo attempt has been malde

to give them effeet. 6o the sale of revolvers has
gone merrily on, and as a consequence we have
had two men killed and one wounded by revolver shots already this week.
We suppose that, as usuai, there will be a
fus for a few days, and that foreigners wIll be
stopped on the streets by the police and obligedi
to hand over their weapons. These methode are
practtc-aliy useless, however, whiie the sale of
weapons goes on the same as ever. Certain of
the smnaUer stores between Victoria ISQuare
veritable
and the raiiway stations are
armories. The proprietors seem to take especiftl
pride ln dressing their windows with aIl sOrta
and sizes off revolvers. The display ls tasteful
and tempting, and it is flot a bit surprising that
they are patroaized iargely by the sons of
Centrai and Western Europe. If Io pleasant to
note that there are honorable exceptions among
the storekeepers. One Italien, at least, who
owns a somaîl cutlery store, and la oontinually
asked for weapons, steadily refuses to either
keep or seli them. This refusai to make money
out of the saguinary tendencies ,of his brethren
te most creditabie. But most of the weaponvendors seem like so many of the sellera o!
intoxicating liquor-as long as they get rid off
their wares they are oare-free as far as resuits
are concerned. It ls these andI their patrons who
should corne under strict regulation.

Revolvers are not a necessity ln our civilized
communities. Many persons, who have owned

them with no evilin-terit have become heartiay
sorry they ever touohed the things, when
acdidental death or Injury resulted from, them.
And it le probable that for urie level-headed
and peaceabie person. who owns or carnies a

revolver there are a dozen potentiai crdminals

who do the like. As we said three months ago,
many of these potential oriminals are essentlally
worthy fellows, hard workers, andI, in their
humble way. useful citizeris. So much the
more reasori, then, that they should be kept
from the temptation which so frequently bas
transformed two, neighbors-the one lnte a
corpse andI the other irito a fugitive from
justice.

A later article on this subject in the
Ottawa Journal was as follows:
Revolvers and Murder
The reader of newspapers must, of his own
accord, corne to the conclusion that the majorIty
off murders are committed with revolvers and
that a large percentage of fatal acoidents are
the result of tlie eareless handling o! those
weapons. At a meeting of the Canadien
Prisoners' Welfare Association In Montreal the
statemerit was made that fuliy severity-flve per
cent of the murders comontÉted ln Canada are
committed with sinaîl flrearms. Mr. Robert
Bickerdike, who made the statement, added that
'lany boy or Irresponsible person could go dowil
to Craig street anid get onie" (a revolver).
With seventy-flve per cent of the murders of
the country being cominitted with revolvers
and with the revolver being useless for any good
purpose, the thi.ng to be done, obvlouslY, 1s to
abolish the iTevolver. The only excuse that any
one offers for a revolver in the bands of thre
law-abildirig civiliari Is the pies, that it is a
measure of protection from the criminal. Make
it Impossible for the criminal to have a revolver
by doi.ng away with Its manufacture and the
eiyilian will not require that questIonabie protection.

394 .

SENATE

The Canadrian Prisoners' Welfare Association
did not go far enough when it placed itself on
record as desiring more strict enforcement of
the law against carryi.ng arms. It should go to
the root of the matter and advocate the total
abolition of the revolver.

The Canadian Police Bulletin, speaking
with authority based on actual experience,
makes these comments:
Carrying of Firearms
There seems to be need for more drastic steps
to prevent the promiscuous carrying and use of
firearms by criminals and would be imitators.
Bad men will always get possession of them in'
some way or the other, but if officers of the law
and citizens generally must run the risk of
assassination by this class of the community, It
should be made as difficult as possible for the
lawless one to get firearms. One of the papers
read at the convention of the Chief Constables'
Association, pointed out that at the rate they
were now being imported, some 6,000 revolvers
would come into this country this year. They
are chiefly from the United States. What are
they for? The records show that there were
very few brought in for police officers or for
bank officiais, and that the majority were not
such as are used for .military target practice.
It follows that 4f thousands of revolvers are
brought into this country it Is an indication
that there is a market for them here. It is
not possible to believe that there bas been
issued in all of Canada in one year permits for
the carrying of revolvers to the aggregate of
nearly 6,000.
Since November 1 important amendments to
the law relating to firearms and other weapons
as well as to ammunition, have been effecti.ve
in Britain. The keynote of the act is that "a
person shall net purchase, have in his possession, use or carry any flrearm or ammunition
unless he holds a certificate (in this Act called
a firearm Certificate) granted under this section
of the Act and i.n force at the time." Considerable powers and responsibilities, according to
British reports are conferred upon the police in
regard te the carrying out of the amended act.
It is to be noted that the new measure bas
been made necessary in Britain because during
and since the great war the practice of carryi.ng
and using flrearms bas become common and
dangerous. What about Canada?

Le Temps points out the duty of ParJiament:
(Translation)
The Coming Session
Parliament will return to its work at the
beginning of the year 1914
The opening of
the two Houses will probably be announced for
Thursday, the 8th of January. It may be expected that the return of the Borden propositien respecting the Navy will cause sittings
even more acrimonious than those of last
March.
In the number of measures for discussion in
the Commons, why should there net be included
an amendment to the law regarding firearms
with a view to regulating the manufacture,
importation, and sale of tiangerous weapons?
The press of Canada has long enough protested against the establishment of criminat
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT

Americanism in our cities to induce the Government to follow the principles of well ordered
charity.
The law of to-day gives merchants the right
to sali anything they please to their cuatomers
without distinction of age or social position.
The result is that children, loafers, even intoxicated persons, can obtain revolvers or daggers wi.thout any permit from the chief of
police. The seller is not at all di.sturbed if the
purchaser immediately commits a crime or
causes a fatal accident. He bas absolutely fo
responsability, as noting in the existing laws
prevents free trade in things which are useless
or injurious.
Benjamin Lindsay, the founder of the Juvenile Court, once saidt that the best way to fit
a. youngster for entrance into the class of
violent criminals in the penitentiary was to put
into his hands a revolver or a dagger after
having taken him to the movies and filled his
mi.nd with tales of robbery.
Robert Pinkerton declared at Chicago in 18'94
that the man who carried a revolver in a city
was a homicide in intention. The celebrated
detective recommended already, nineteen years
ago, that the legislatures of the United States
should regulate the sale of fireairms, and foresaw the expansion of the crimes of violence
which to-day paralyse the efforts of the police
of 'the large cities of that country.
The Parliament of Canada has not the right,
at a time when it se strongly encourages immigration, te leave at the disposai of foreigners
ignorant of our laws, murderous weapons which
they may draw on the least provocation.
The law, properly amended, ought also to
require the police to destroy completely all
weapons seized, instead of d'istributing then
to their friends, as is done everywhere.
That would be of greater public value than
the introduction of lawa respecting the increase
of armaments in England.

The Ottawa Journal continues its appeal
for legislation in .a more recent editorial,
thus:
The Dangerous Revolver
The unlawful carrying of lethal weapons is
responsilble for a large percentage of violent
crime. The Canadian laws governing the carrying of revolvers are either more strict or are
better enforced than those of the United Staites,
and crimes resulting from the practice are
proportionately more numerous across the border. The Cleveland Plain Dealer points out that
twenty-five per cent of the criminal cases now
awaiting trial in Cuyahoga county, Ohio, have
their origin in the carrying of concealed
weapons. In consequence, the authorities promise
special effort te reduce the unlawful carrying
of weapons. Obviously, however, it is difficult
to detect the offence. The only effective way of
dealing with the matter is to make it difficult
for those who have no good reason fer possessing a gun to procure one.
The Journal has, time and time again urged
that every civilized nation-and Canada might
well lead the way-should prohibit the sale,
manufacture and importation of revolvers and
pistols. The majority of crimes of violence are
committed by means of these weapons. Without them, a large number of crimes of violence
would net be committed at all. Fasily concealed,
qui.ek-acting and deadly, they facilitate the
passions of brutes and encourage the male-

391

volence of cowards. For ail good purposes they
are useless, except to arm guardians of the lajw
ageinst law-breakers; and If law-breakers could
nlot get them, police would flot need them.
Eardly an argument exista for pertnitting auch
weapons to be available by anybody; a dozen
reasons exist wh,3 they shouid not be available
to anybody.

safer and not a millionth part as useful or
desirable as most poisons, yet civilization safeguards the sale of poisons, while mostly giving
free license to the sale of pistols.
The manufacture of pistols should be prohibited by international agreement. They are
responsible for a large proportion of crimes of
violence, and they are the chief protection
of criminals against the law and the community. A repeating rifle is still more deadly;
but it can not |be concealed about a criminal's
person, nor can it even be as conveniently and
quickly used behind covers as a defence. The
pistol should go.
The Toc Handy Revolver
The police of London, England, do not carry
pistols. They do not need them. Nobody goes
armed in the British metropolis. The criminal
is innocent of revolver because he knows he
will not have to defend himself against arms.
That makes a differenee.
Over here, especially
in the United States, the man on crime intent
goes armed, ready to kill, because he expects
to meet a pointed pistol l the hands of whoever he aims to rob. He is usually the better
shot, and bas the element of surprise on his
side.
There is a great difference between having
arms in one's home and going about armed,
although there is no real need of arms anywhere.
The ready revolver is the cause of
more murders than ail the motives that could
possibly be behind crimes. It is a great danger.
It is so easy to whipit out and shoot. A moment of anger, the notion that it is a case of
getting home the first bullet, and the deed is
done.
The assumption is against the man who
carries arms. When we are entirely sane in
our treatment of this matter, the carrying of
deadly firearms will be made absolutely prohibitive under penalities which will be effectual.
It may seem like an obvious thing to say that if
nobody went armed there could not be any
shootings, yet the remedy is locked up in that
fact.
The importation, manufacture, sale, possession of revolvers should be prohibited.
The Revolver Again
A man called Griffith, said to be unsound in
mind, walked into a Montreal broker's office
and shot the manager dead. Why should a man
of unsound mind, or, for that matter, of any
kind of mind, be carrying a revolver?
Every year hundreds, yes thousands of terrible tragedies are enacted on this continent
because people are permitted to carry guns;
but nobody in authority appears to care. There
is a law on the statute books which says that
no person shall carry a revolver without a
permit, but it appears to be useless in safeguarding life.
The Journal would like to see the matter
taken up at the coming Session of Parliament,
and a law passed restricting revolvers to those
to whom their use is absolutely essential.

As I have said, my object in quoting
these newspaper articles is to show not
only the reasons which underlie this Bill,
but that public opinion is ready and anxious
for legislation of this sort.
Hon. Mr. BEDCOURT.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
is the law now?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

What

The law now is

that one cannot have or carry a revolver
without a permit.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
How
does this change the law?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am coming to
that. The present provisions of the law
with regard to firearms generally, and
revolvers in particular, are confusing, and
in practice always embarrassing. It is very
difficult for a magistrate to decide whether
or not there has been an infraction of the
law. As all the newspaper editorials show,
the present provisions are quite inadequate.
There is no need of my entering into any
argument or demonstration, because it is
common knowledge that revolvers are possessed by many people who have no need
and no right whatever to carry them; and
what reason is there for the carrying of
the number of weapons other than revolvers
that I have mentioned?
In section 118 of the Criminal Code it is
provided:
Every one is guilty of an offence and liable
on sunmary conviction thereof to a penalty of
dollars and costs, or to imprisonment
with or without hard labour, for
years,
or to both such penalty and imprisonment,
who,(a) not having a license therefor from the
Minister of Justice or his authorized agent,
after the thirty-first day of December, 1920,
imports, brings or transports into Canada, or
manufactures, makes, or deals in, or sells to,
barters with, gives or lends to any person, any
weapon of the following kinds or of any like
or similar kind:
(i) any cannon, trench-mortar, machine-gun,
rifle, gun, revolver, pistol, or other fire-arm, or
any air-gun;
(ii) any device or contrivance for muffling,
stopping, concealing or disguising the sound or
flash of the discharge of a flrearm or air-gun;
(iii) any explosive, poisonous, stupefying or
disabling bomb, or any similar device or contrivance;
(iv) any sword, sword-blade, bayonet, pike,
pike-head, spear, spear-heaI,
dirk, dagger,
stiletto, bowie-knife or sheath-knife, or any
similar device or contrivance;
(v) any metal knuckles, skull-cracker, slungshot, sand-bag, or any similar device or contrivance.

What justification is there for allowing
people to carry any of these things? We
know that in Central Europe people go
about with daggers and stilettos, and we
know that in Canada-in Montreal, for
instance-among Italians or other foreigners stilettos and bowie knives are constantly
in evidence.

prohibit the manufacture, importation, or
sale. If these articles are absolutely excluded from the country, what is the use of
empowering certain persons to grant permits?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They are not
absolutely excluded. My honourable friend
did not follow me. The object of the Bill
is to prevent the importation, manufacture,
and sale of revolvers.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I understand the
honourable gentleman. I am not dealing
with any of the other lethal weaponA; I am
just discussing revolvers. It seems to me
illogical to say in one clause that a certain
officer may grant ,permits, and in another
clause that the manufacture, importation,
and sale shall be prohibited.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend will have to read the Bill once more.
I would refer my honourable friend to subsection 2. With the permission of the
Minister of Justice, one can sell. This is
not at all inconsistent with theother provisions which require the individual to
procure a license. The two things fit in
absolutely. I hope I have satisfied my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: Yes. I did not
grasp what you were reading.
Hon.-Mr. BELCOURT: The provision
is that those who held those weapons on
31st July, 1920, are not offending if they
keep them. The date upon which this
Act is to come into force is to be six or
eight months hence. There must be some
time allowed during which persons who
now have revolvers for sale or for their
own use may comply with the law.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Dealing with
that particular point in clause a I find this
expression:
not having a license therefor from the Minister
of Justice or his authorized agent, after the
31st day of Decernber, 1920.

Why is 1920 the date fixed? That makes
the provision retroactive.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is a clerical error; it should be 1921.
How
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
would the honourable gentleman treat a
case of this kind? Two men are out shooting; one man's gun goes out of order and
the other man lends him his gun. Would
he not offend against the Act?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That seems to
me to be pretty far-fetched. I do not
think my honourable friend need be afraid
of that.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: No son of a gun
.should let his gun get out of order.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I hope my honourable friend is not going to vote against
the Bill because of that objection.
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: Is there any reprint
of this Bill? Is the Bill my honourable
friend has in his handHon. Mr. BELCOURT: The only Bill
I have got is the Bill as printed, with corrections in red ink.
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: The Bill that my
honourable friend is reading from is not
the same as the Bill we have on our files?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be.
There are some clerical errors in the Bill.
The honourable gentleman who has just
sat down (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) pointed
out one, in which the date is given as
December 31st, 1920, instead of December
31st, 1921. There are probably other
clerical errors.
Èefore I resume my seat I desire once
more to commend the Bill to the serious
consideration of the House. I think honourable gentlemen will agree that this is a
very important matter and'is deserving the
attention and earnest consideration of
every honourable member.
In preparing the Bill, I have given the
matter a great deal of thought. I should
also say that I have had the valuable
assistance of the Law Clerk, who has
devoted a great deal of time to it. So the
Bill comes before you, honourable gentlemen, with the approval not merely of one

SENATE
I am not very certain whether we followed
that course on the previous occasion or not
-whether we amended the Judges Act or
the Bill that came from the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It was an amendment to the Judges Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: However, honourable gentlemen will see that
the amendments suggested are amendments
to the general Act rather than amendments
to this Bill, and the Minister of Justice
would prefer to have them made separately
from the present Bill, inasmuch, as this
is very much needed, particularly in relation to the province of Saskatchewan. It
makes provision for the appointment of a
judge there. The court at present is very
much embarrassed by reason of the appointment not having yet been made.
Business is being held up, and, I fancy,
will continue to be held up for some time
if we exercise the diversity of thought
which has found expression in this Chamber in the discussion of the Bill before
us: it is going to be difficult to arrive at
a conclusion as to what we should do.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What does my
honourable friend suggest?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
I suggest is that the House should accept
this Bill. There is no question as to this.
We are all agreed upon the necessity of
its provisions. Then if it is desirable to
amend the Judges Act otherwise, as appears to be the sentiment of the Senate, the
amendment should be the subject-matter of
another Bill amending the Act, and not an
amendment to this Bill.
HonHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
ourable gentlemen, I may be perfectly
frank in stating my view, that to have a
separate Bill brought in by private members is tantamount to giving our amendments the six months' hoist. But if we
have our amendments inserted in a Bill
introduced by the Government they will
be considered in the House of Commons. I
find that most Bills that are introduced
by private members and pass out that
door never come back. If the honourable
leader of the Government insists, I will
not press my amendment, though, I must
say, I think it will never come up again
unless it is pressed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Or unless the
honourable gentleman has a similar opportunity.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
is no use in my introducing a Bill, so far
as I know. ,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I did
mention to the Minister of Justice this
morning that the Senate has been someWhat disappointed at his lack of enthusiasm in the past regarding amendments
which have been added from time to time
to the Judges Bill; but he gave me to
understand that he would be very glad to
direct the attention of the House to the
amendment and facilitate it in any way he
reasonably could. In fact, I believe personally that the opinion of the Minister of
Justice is not very different from that
entertained by my honourable friend from
Hamilton in regard to judges being appointed to commissions of inquiry, etc.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend see any real objection to
dealing with that particular subject in
the Bill now before the House? Why
cannot it be put there? I feel like my honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton): Government promises
of that sort have very little value, in my
estimation, and I can quite corroborate

the then Prime Minister that he would
take it up in the other House and put it

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It may
have been overlooked.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have had
the experience of the House of Commons
including items in a Supply Bill in order
to be sure that they would be voted.
We might perhaps take a leaf from their
book and try to devise a scheme to turn
the tables on them. When a Bill is sent
to this Chamber, we might add our own
legislation in order to ensure it receiving
consideration in the other House. I do not
refer, however, to the present instance,
because perhaps the suggested amendment
to the Act can wait another twelve months
without the country being very much
worse off.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Does the
honourable gentleman from Hamilton withdraw his amendment?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does
the honourable leader request me to do
so?

This is to be added as section 4 to the

Act, judges nominated by the Lieutenant
Governor or by the Governor General may

My proposal is that judges shail not be
appointed, but shahl be forbidden to act on

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
point out to my honourable friend what
in my judgment is the infirmity in bis
amendinent? Nothing is accomplished by
its passage. In the first place, the Governor General in Council, entirely irrespective
of the clause in the Act, would have aut-hority to appoint a judge to a commission.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

There

Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
go on?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I beg
your pardon.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Consequently nothing would ,be accomplished by
our allowing the amcudment to stand as
it is. In the next place, a prohibition to
the Lieutenant Governor of any of the provinces would not accomplish what xny èonourable friend has in view, because the
provinces to-day dlaim the right to assign
diities to a judge. Therefore, assuming
that the Governor Géneral in Couneil has
authority, and that the Ljeutenant; Governor in Council likewise lias authority,
entirely irrespective of the statute, it does
not mean anything to strike the clause out,
because the power yet remains. Then, in

Governor General in iCouflC1l or the Lieutenant Governor in Council in this respect.
Test it in the

courts. If the judges are paid salaries, a
ratepayer could take the matter up.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 would
point out to myr honourable friend a somewhat analogous provision which we placed
in the Judges Act some years ago and which
was nugatory in its resuits. We enacted
that a judge should not eit as a director of
a company. Many of the judges paid no
attention to that enactment: they simply
continued in office as directors. There was
no penalty attached to the Act.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is another
matter. There is a distinction between the
two, if the honourable gentleman .will pardon me. Here is a man who is paid from
the public moneys--from. the nioneys of
the taxpayer. Surely the taxpayer has a
right to say whether that money is to be
paid or not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
not the question: the question is whether
we have the right to prohibit, even if a
penalty is attached.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would not a
judge who infringed a l*aw of Parliamént
be liable to be impeached? My 'honourable
friend says the Act is nugatory because
lhere is no sanction to it. I should tbiink
impeachment would make it effective.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
legislating, of course, within the authority
conferred upon Parlianient by the British
"North America Act. The question consequently arises whether or not we have
any authority to rèstrain a judge, once he
is appointed as a provincial officer, in the
carrying out of any duties by virtue of
bis office.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He is a sort of
Frankenstein. We are creating something
we cannot control.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
The provincial authority asserts itself to
the extent of saying that it is for the province, and not for the Federal Government,
to determine what the duties of a judge
shaîl be.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
have not done so, but they can do it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, I don't think
they could.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, the honourable leader
seems to indicate that his opinion is that
the Dominion Parliament bas no power
over the judge; that the Dominion Parliament has power only to appoint the judge.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do
not want my honourable friend to put it
that way, as if I had said so. I do not lay
that down at all in a dogmatic way; I
simply say that some of the provinces have
taken that position. I do not say that I
agree with them. I simply commend to my
honourable friend a consideration of that
problem, which enters into the whole question. It might be desirable-I think it is
desirable-before we legislate along this
line that we should give full consideration
to the subject with which we intend to deal.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But my honourable friend says we cannot.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
simply advancing to honourable gentlemen
the many controversial points involved in
the legislation which we have in view. There
is a further consideration: while it might
be that this Parliament could pronounce
upon the subject of what shall constitute
judicial duties, yet in the absence of any
pronouncement, it seems to me, the Provinces could dictate to the judge as a provincial officer what he should do.
Hon. Mr.·BELCOURT:
My honourable
friend pointed out a moment ago that we
would not have the power to do that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do
not make that statement dogmatically. I
say it is a matter that bas entered into
the controversy.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is thought
we may not have the right to restrict the
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

judges, and we are told to wait until
another time. If we cannot, we might as
well try now and learn where we are at.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I am
delighted to hear the honourable leader
say he does not lay that down, because it
has been the opinion as expressed in the
statutes of Canada ever since Confederation that we had control over the judges;
and I think it is a very salutary provision
in our law. As I view the matter, the
provinces have the power to erect courts
and it is the duty of the Dominion Government to supply the judges for those courts.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We have the
power not only to organize the courts, but
also to determine their functions.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
To
erect courts; and the erection of courts includes the declaration of their jurisdiction,
or there would be no use in erecting the
courts. The Dominion bas to appoint the
judges who exercise the jurisdiction given
to those courts. The provinces have no
power given to them under the British
North America Act, so far as I can see,
to direct a judge to do anything outside
of his court; and if those inquiries are
made part of the judicial duties, then nobody can have any objection to them, just
as trials of election petitions are made
part of the judicial duties. The objection
is to the selecting of judges to do something outside of the courts for which they
are appointed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But what Parliament made the trial of election petitions
the duty of judges? It was not the local
Parliament; it was the Federal Parliament-showing that the Federal authorities had the right to interfere.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
That
is quite right, too; and if they have no
power, then all the election trials go for
nothing, as they had no right to delegate
them to the courts. Then we have this
short answer: that under the Criminal
Code it is an indictable offence for any
person to break any law passed by a province or by the Dominion. Now, if the
Dominion Parliament says that a judge
shall not do so and so, and he does that,
he is liable to be impeached under the
criminal law, and my motion to amend
section 33 is to be followed by a motion
making a practical prohibition against the
judges acting on those commissions. That
has to be accepted by all Governments, or
all this legislation is simply academic.

MAY 3, 1921
Hon. Mr. PRO UDFOOT: We discussed
this question the other day, and pointed
out why judges should not go on commissions, but should confine themselves strictly to their judicial work. Now, if this
Parliament has no power to deal with
the judges, then 1 cannot understand
how it had power to pass section 33 of
chapter 138, that is, the Judges Act, because there this Parliament says that the
judges are not to engage in business, or
act as directors, or engage in any other
occupation or business than their judicial
duties, and every such judge shall devote
If this
himself to such judicial duties.
*Parliament has no power beyond the mere
appointment of the judges, why did they
assume to pass that clause? Why also did
they pass section 12 of chapter 56 of 1920,
in which it is stated that no judge shall receive any remuneration in addition to his
judicial salary? Then it goes on to point
out what the Governor in Council may do
and what the Lieutenant Governor in
Council may do. So it seems to me that
this Parliament, if it has power to deal in
the way mentioned with the judges, also
bas power to pass legisiation to prevent
One
judges from acting on commissions.
would have supposed, had it flot been for
the action of the judges themselves, that
they had no right to aet on commissions,
because the very last words of section 33
are as follows:
But every such judge shall devote h!mnself
exclusively to such judicial duties.

One would have supposed that that was
sufficient-that judges would not be permitted to accept any duties outside of
their judicial duties; but, notwithstanding
this clause in the statute, we find the
judges saying that they have a right to
act, and acting on a great many commissions. It seems to me, therefore, that it
is necessary to make the law more emphatic
than appears in the statements already enacted, by using the express words of the
proposed amendment. If this wmnendment
carnies, then the judges will see that they
have no right to accept these commissions.
In view of section 34 passed last session, I
fancy that judges will not be at ail anxious
to take commissions-at any rate not; so
anxious as they were some time before;
but so long as they have the night to act,
and so long as the Giovernor in Council
and the Lieutenant Governor in Council
have power to say that they »hall act, we
will be plaýced in the unfortunate position
-that our judges will be open to criticismn
such as bhas been directed against the judges

acting on one of the comnmissions. now being
held in the province of Ontario. MY view
is that -we ought to reilieve them of liability
to such criticismn, and in view of the construction placed on section 33 the only way
to do so is to say positively that they shahl
not act. I th-ink that is a position that this
Panliament should take.
I quite agree with the honourable meniber for Hamilton, that unless we amend this Act we will not
get any relief, because if he or any other
member of this House should introduce
a bill on the Unes of the proposed amendment it certainly would not rpass duning
the present Session of Parliament. It is
ahl very well for the Minister of Justice
to say that it should be introduced in some
other Bill, and that hie bas views in sympathy 'with those exipressed in the amendment. If hie bas such views, -why did 'he
flot embody them in an Act and place the
whohe matter before Parliament, so that
we could deal ivith it? I think it is only
fair to the judges and to the people that
the amendment should be made. I repeat
what I said the other day when dealing
with subsection 2 of section 34 of the Act
of hast Session:
Bvery Judge who may be nominated for the
purpose by the Governor In Counci or Lieutenant Governor in Council shall execute wlfhout addltionai remuneration. etc.

You wilh observe the words are "who may
be nominated." I do not read those words
as compulsory on the judge to accept a
nomination, reading as I do the effect of
section 33; 'but once hie is nominated and
accepts, hie must undertake that particular
work without additional remuneration. I
disagree with the honourable member from
Middleton, referring to what took place
in Nova Scotia, I think, that the Lieutenant Governor had no power to insist on
a judge undertaking the work unless he
was willing to do so. As I have said, I
think it is in the interest not only of the
judges themselves but of the people that
we should pass the amendment. .
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: The whole argument here is that the judges are unfit for
this duty; why? Because a certain portion
of the community are dissatisified with their
findings on certain commissions. That is
the whohe thing.
Hon. Mr. POWER: That is not the argument at ail. That may be your view of
the argument.

404

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I have not heard
a gentleman on this side of the House who
bas not condemned the entrusting of commissions to judges.
My
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
reason was because the judges did not want
them.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: But you argued
strongly that in certain quarters, more particularly referring to Ontario, public
opinion had not supported the findings of
those judges, and the conducting of those
inquiries, but that public opinion, or quite
a large section of it, was against them.
Now my honourable friend from Hamilton
comes into the open, and says that he is
not expressing an opinion from that point
of view, but that it is the desire of some
judges that they should be relieved. I say
it is a shame if any judge has asked to be
relieved from his duty, because a judge
owes a duty to the public to do anything
he can for the betterment of the country
by virtue of his office.. If any judge is
asking to be relieved simply to suit his
own convenience, I say he is acting very
unfairly towards the country, because last
year one of the strong reasons stated why
they should have their salaries increased
was that they might act on public commissions.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No; never heard
of it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Where
was it brought up?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You dreamed it.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: It is incorporated
in the Act, and the judges had better read
it, because the Act passed last year provided that for the future no judges should
receive any fees for acting on commissions.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That may be true,
but that does not make your inference
correct.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Then why was it
incorporated in the Act, that they should
not be compensated for acting on commissions?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: They are, are they
net?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: No, they are not
compensated under the law at all now.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They got $2,000
in Toronto.
lon. Mr. POWER.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: They get it without the law do they not?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Not that I know
of. Regarding the talk about judges not
being trusted because they make mistakes:
in the first place, a man who is a high
court judge must be very careful of his
standing in the community, because he is
going to try civil actions and criminal actions afterwards, and if he acts very badly
on any commission, the result will be a
great deal of comment unfavourable to him.
A few weeks ago a man was authorized
by the Attorney General to inquire relative
to the conduct of a police magistrate at
Dunnville. I am sure that no high court
judge in Ontario would have stultified himself by bringing in such a finding as that
of the gentleman who conducted that inquiry, and he was a professional man, too.
A judge must have more regard to his
position; and, while the judges are all
human, and may make mistakes in their
findings on commissions, public opinion bas
been so strongly behind the findings of the
judges who have been entrusted with commissions in the province of Ontario that the
public prints have not attacked the judges.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: May I call my
honourable friend's attention to the manner in which the judges were attacked after
the Gamey investigation? There we bad
two of the most prominent judges on the
bench, whose words would be accepted on
any legal matters.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Politically I was
not in accord with the judges in the Gamey
case. They had their political affiliations.
Judge Falconbridge had been a Conservative and had received a Conservative appointment, and Sir John Boyd had been a
Liberal; but I do not remember that any
portion of the public press attacked personally either Sir John Boyd or Sir Glenholme Falconbridge.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: They attacked
Sir John Boyd most vindictively.
Hon. Mr. LYNýCH-STAUN'TON: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: They attacked Sir
John in this way, that he might have been
affected by the fact that he had some sons
in the employ of the Ontario Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is that desirable?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Perhaps it might
not be desirable that a judge should be
selected who had sons in the employ of
the Government; but I make this state-

MAY 3, 1921
ment, that in the province of Ontario public opinion has been behind the judges in
their findings- en- the , commissions entrusted to them.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Have
you ever seen a case in which, when a
politicai question was up in Ontario, the
judge was neot abused?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: It is a question
- of what abuse is. No man was ever convicted who did pot abuse the judge afterwards. No man got the worst of a bargain who did nlot feel that somebody was
to blame over it. I say this, that no honourable gentleman who contrasts with a
judicial finding the finding of the Commissioner in the Dunnviile case the other diay,
will say that -a county court judge or a
superior court jud-ge would have made such
a finding. If he did, I d4, not see how he
could arrive at such a conclusion. I say
that if yeu take away from judges the
power to act on commissions, and appoint
political partisans or outsiders who have
flot the responsibility of judges, the public
confidence will be very much shaken in
a great many of those inquiries.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I agree with
my honourable friend in saying that it
is unfair for a judge to ask to be relieved; but that is not the ground on which
they ask to be relieved. It is rather
because of the odium that attaches to
the work they are doing, and the unfair attacks that are be$ng made on
thern.
We find two highly respected
judges sitting at the present time on a
commission in the province of Ontario,
who are-being attacked.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And they cannot
defend themselves.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Because their conduct is indefé.nsible.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I ar nflt
arguing the question as to whether they
are right or wrong. The whole fquestion
is, should those men 'be placed in a position where they may be attacked? If so,
theni, se far as tJhe public is concerned, the
administration of justice is being injured
to that extent. My honourable friend refers to a commission in which the other
day, a very respected and eminent meimber of the 'bar gave a finding. I ar n flt
sufficiently versed in the facts to say
whether or not that finding was correct.
He said that no judge would make a finding of that kind; but I venture to say

405

that if a 'high court judge made exactly
the same finding as the commissioner, he
would be attacked as having acted ini a
partisan manner, ifhe had had one particular stripe of politics prier to his appointment. That is whaf the judges are up
against ail the time.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: May I ask the
honourable gentleman one question? Why
did not the judges in the Gamey case ask
to be relieved of their duties?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: They did.
That was the reason why section 33 of the
Act was passed; it only came into effect
about that time. It was then supposed
that the judges would not be called upon
to act; yet they were called upon, and they
acted as if they were nlot bound by that
section.
The amendment was agreed to, on division: yeas, 20; nays, 8.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I have
another amendinent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let it
go at that.
Progress was reported.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOOND READING

Hon. Mr. BOYER moved the second reading of Bill R3, an Act respecting certain
patents of the Autographic Register Systems, Limited.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS:
Does not the
honourable gentleman intend to make any
provision in the Bill to protect those who
may have gone ahead with the manufacture, believing the patent had already expired? I believe it has been the custom in
the past te give protection to those who
believed a patent invalid and commenced
manufacturing in the meantime.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: I dare say that when
the Bill goes before the Committee on Miscellaneous Private - Buis the necessary
arnendments will 'be made. This company
got an agent in the United States to take
out certain patents. The patents were supposed to have been taken out there at a
tremendous cost; and the samne thing was
supposed to have taken place in Ottawa.
The company was furnished with the numbers, but one day woke up to find that no
Patent had ever been granted in Canada.
It is to rectify their position that the Bill

t06

is brought in; and I have no doubt that
the interested parties will allow all necessary precautions to be taken.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: According to the
honourable gentleman's statement, the
patent was not issued; and any one who
started the manufacture prior to the issue
of the patent should be protected.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: The necessary precautions will be taken, and a clause will be
put in protecting those who started manufacturing.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow

would like to ask the honourable leader
of the House if there is likely to be any
work for the Senate to do during the extra
week's adjournment that is proposed by
the honourable gentleman from Kings and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler). I understand
from the press that the budget will be
brought down at the end of this week or
the commencement of next week. Nothing
will come forward from another place to
this House during the discussion of the
budget. I am quite willing to come back
here next Tuesday provided there is work
for this House to do; but if there is
absolutely nothing on the Order Paper,
it is certainly useless for us to do so. I
think the honourable leader of this House
should give us some information as to
whether or not there is likely to be sufficient
items on the Order Paper to keep the
Senate busy during the further week over
which it is proposed to adjourn. That
information is needed before any of us
can vote intelligently on the amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, this problem bas been
put to me so frequently that I have exhausted all my resourcefulness in endeavouring to answer the question. The nearest
approach I can make to an answer would
be to suggest that if honourable gentlemen
will accept the adjournment which I propose and come back next Tuesday evening
at 8 o'clock, we shall then be able to
answer the question very much more
definitely.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Are we to understand that the honourable leader is opposed
to this further adjournment? I do not
think any honourable member of this House
wants to insist on the longer adjournment

MAY 4, 1921
ii there is really business for the Senate
to do; but, as has been *said by my honourable friend frorna Toronto (Hon. Mr. NichORIS), if there is not it is useless for the
Senate to meet.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
honourable gentlemen will not find fault
with me in regard to my attitude on the
adjournment, for I have a sense of reluctance in meeting the House in the absence
of public business. At the same time the
presumption is that the Senate should be
in session during the Session of Parliament. While I cannot give any assurance
as to the pressure of public business
requiring us to attend say the half of next
week, yet 1 arn informed that certain Bil
will be brought down which shouid receive
the attention of the Senate. The Commons
have the habit, notwithstanding the volume
of legisiation that rnay be before thein and
that could be discussed by this House in
a very short time, of lingering over the
business;' so 1 really cannot predict when
the legisiation will corne before us. I can
say, however, that there is a long list of
public Bills before the Gommons which,' if
deait with diligently, should certainiy
occupy our attention next week. I feel that
at this period of the Session, when we are
approaching prorogation, which is confidently expected ta take place before the
end of the month, ta take a two weeks'
adjournment may possibly be .sômewhat
unsafe.

that it is realiy a two weeks' vacation,
because to-morrow we do not sit, it being

that we should have a vacation until alter

SENATE

408

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to honourable gentlemen that,
if the House of Commons finish before the
end of the month, we shall be outside the
provisions of the Indemnity Act in not
attending two weeks before the end of the
Session.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, there is one point that I think we
should bear in mind-that when the House
is not in session the Committees cannot
meet. We have had, I think, more special
committees appointed at this Session than
we have ever had in any previous Session at which I remember being present.
None of those special committees, as I understand, have nearly finished the business
for which they were appointed. How they
are going to finish if we adjourn for the
next fortnight I do not see. Further, I do
not see what object there is in appointing
these committees if the members do not
intend to carry out the business for which
they are appointed. There is another point
-that Parliament may adjourn by the
24th of May.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I will guarantee
they will not.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It is quite within
reason, and I expect that that is going to
take place. Any honourable member who
reads the Indemnity Act will find that it is
quite necessary for him to be here during
the last two weeks of the Session. So even
from that standpoint it would be a rather
dangerous experiment to have too long an
adjournment at the present time. But the
principal object I have in rising is to remind the honourable members that unless
the Senate sits the work of the committees,
which do such a large portion of the business of this House, cannot possibly be carried on and finished.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is another point with regard to the committees.
Even if the Senate adjourns until Wednesday night, the Divorce Committee will
meet on Tuesday and on Wednesday; and
those of us who are trying to do our duty
on it will have to be here. While we are
undoubtedly very anxious to earn our in-demnity, still our attendance as at a sitting
of the House would not be recognized.
Several times the Divorce Committee has
sat when the House was not in session.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Fowler was
negatived: yeas, 18; nays, 36.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable leader of the Government suggested
that the adjournment might be extended
from the 10th to Wednesday, the 1lth.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Better
let it go as it is now, I think.
The motion was agreed to.
CAUSES OF UNEMPLOYMENT
APPOINTMENT

OF

SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

Hon. JOHN A. McDONALD moved:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into the causes of unemployment in Canada and to report to the Senate
before the close of this session as to possible
remedy.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I am
speaking for a great many people who are
looking to this House for some solution
of our present difficulties. We know that
the situation in Canada to-day is very
serious, and before it becomes worse I
think this Committee should meet and see
if something cannot be done to improve
the situation. My opinion is that it is
caused by misunderstanding, mistrust, and
suspicion. I know that many manufacturers, builders, and contractors feel that
there are dangerous men going all over
this country seeking to destroy industry,
to break down and stop the wheels of
commer.ce, to bring on a revolution in
Canada. I do not believe that this is so.
On the other hand, labour leaders feel
that there is an unholy alliance amongst
the big interests to crush labour, to smash
the unions for all time, and to bring them
whimpering to their knees. I do not believe that is right. Consequently I believe
that the duty of this Committee will be
to sweep away the misunderstandings and
see if we can find a solution of our present
difficulties.
Experts tell me: "No, Mr. McDonald,
this is a world problem: do not touch it.
Wars come every hundred years, hard
times every ten years. The great nation
to the south of us, the richest nation in
the wvorld, has had greater difficulties than
we." My answer is that I think this country is expert-cursed. We are not citizens

of those employers who have in their
employ 25 or more men each, so that the
figures, while they do not fully represent
the facts, do represent them in regard to
about two-thirds of the total.
With reference to the motion which my
honourable friend from New Brunswick
(Hon. Mr. McDonald) has introduced, I
may say that I cannot see that any harm
could come from such an inquiry, and much
good might come from it. I think such an
inquiry would be very interesting and
instructive, and honourable gentlemen
would perhaps have a more intimate
knowledge of the facts if we were to take
a little time and trouble to inquire into
them.
So far as the Department is concerned,
I have no hesitation in saying that we
would be glad to place at the disposal of
the Committee any information which we
have, either by way of documents that may
be available, or by officiaIs of the Department appearing before the Committee to
give any information which they could.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What steps bas
your department taken towards ascertaining the causes of unemployment, which
is the question this Committee would be
supposed to look into? Have you done anything? Have you got any information regarding the causes leading to unemployment? Have you done anything to remedy
the situation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend's question leaves room for quite an
extended speech.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
Go on. We have
lots of time.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But I do not
think I will undertake that. The motion
of the honourable gentleman goes much
further than to inquire into the causes of
unemployment; it proposes that the Committee shall endeavour to find and to recommend some remedy.
The Department of
Labour has been constantly endeavouring
to anticipate periods of unemployment, to
place in employment as many men as possible, and to do what is possible by way
of advising the spending departments of
the Government so as to minimize unemployment and to create employment at
periods when it is most required. I am
satisfied that an inquiry of this sort would
bring out considerable information that
more had been done by the Government
and the Department in relieving the situation than perhaps the honourable gentleman from Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) thinks
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

bas been done. I therefore hope that the
Committee may not only be appointed, but
may actually prosecute the work submitted
to it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I should like to
ask the Minister of Labour if he can suggest any particular line on which the Committee should carry on this investigation,
because it would take a Committee of this
kind considerable time to find out what particular line it was best to follow in carrying on the investigation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I question the
advisability of my suggesting what line
of action the Committee should take. I
should prefer to leave that to the Committee
itself. By way of suggestion I might say
that a useful purpose might be served if
the Committee were to ascertain the cause
of the stagnation. Is it by reason of contracted credits? Is it by reason of any concerted action on the part of employers not
to carry on, and thereby render more difficult the situation of thousands of workmen in the hope that they will at last accept much smaller wages and offer their
services at reduced rates? As the honourable gentleman who moved this motion
(Hon. Mr. McDonald) pointed out, there
are men who think one or the other or both
of these things are true. I have my own
opinions, but I do not think it necessary or
desirable to voice them at this moment. I
would prefer that the Committee should
outline its own method of procedure, rather
than that I should suggest what it should
be.
Hon. JOHN MILNE: Honourable gentlemen, I should like to say a few words
in regard to this matter. I am a large employer of labour in Hamilton. Labour is
largely to blame for the present situation.
The wages we have been paying our men
are outrageous; so much so that our firm
has not been able to pay a dividend. The
labour and material that enter into construction take all the profit away, and there
is nothing left. In Hamilton there are
more Unions than in 'any other place in
Canada, and you cannot get them to come
down in their demands. I spent four days
in Toronto with the moulders trying to get
them to come down in their demands. They
said that they would give me an answer on
the 28th of January. Our company held a
meeting after that and decided that it
would not employ any more men until we
had an answer and knew what the moulders
were going to do. They came back with the
answer that they would not do anything.

1MAY 4, 1921
I said to my son, alter six weeks, that any
man who, took a ten per cent reduction in
wages could work in oui factory, and they
all came in. How many of them got
anything from the Unions? They would
not do a thing. The bricklayers and carpenters are in the sanie position. The cost of
labour has got to come down belote men
can be employed or before any money can
be made in manufacturing. We cannot get
bauds. If we filled the orders that we
have now we could sell more goods and
employ more hands, but the men stick to
the Unions right along, and say, "The
wages must be so-aud-so, and you have got
to take resuits as you find them."
Take the position of the brewers: they
did not know where they were at. They
said, "We will close up one brewery, but
,we will keep the other one running." They
said, "You will have to take a cut in wages,"
and the men agreed. First, they were
going to strike, but they tbought better
of it, and on the lst of June they accepted
a cut of $1., and after that a cut of $3.
The same situation exists in Torouto.
Drastic measures must be taken. Under
Union rule every man is paid the same
wage. The good man is not paid according to his ability, but according to the
Union scale of wages, and that means that
labour will not produce. Take the bricklayers, for instance: they do not lay 1,000
'bricks a day as they used to 4o; they lay
500 a day.
The workmen say that they cannot take
a cut in wages beeause everything they
use costs so much. That is not so. Whieat
is coming down, and other grain is coming
down; everything is coming down that goes
towards inaking up the cost of living except wages and rent. Who is going to build
houses? In the old days you couid build
three hoeuses for what it costs «to -build one
now. Labour is se high that a man witb
capital will not put his money into hoeuses,
and labour is to blame for this. Things
must find their own level. I remember the
time, after the Crimean War, when they
had soup kitchens in Hamilton to keep the
people from, starving. The saine condition
always prevails alter a war. There is no
doubt that the labour element is goiug to
suifer, but prices are based on the level of
supply and demand, and they must find
their level. When there is a demand you
can get labour, but they wiil1 not, do any
more work thazi they have to. The municipality of Hamilton has been feeding the
iabouring men, giving them so much a
week to keep them from starving. They

five years, and what have they doue with.
them? They and their wives have gone te
picture shows and have spent their money,
and now they want the city or the Goverment to keep them. Next winter will
be worse than last winter. The Minister
of Labour knows more about the labour
situation than I do, but hie knows what I amn
stating to be a fact. The manufacturers
want to do everything they can, but they
must have men to work with. The men
wiil not produce; they say it is better to do
less work and to get more pay for what
they do. That is what the Unions are
loading themn up with ail the time.
The Minister of Labour spoke the other
day of the railway men. Who has to pay
their wages? They are paid by the manufacturers and the people. Alter men have
been receiving high wages it is hard -to
get them down again to their proper ievél,
and the manufacturer bas to pay the shot.
Take the hotels, for instance, to-day. The

sides to every question, and the iabouring
men must realize that. I employ a lot
of labour, and 1 realize that in the end
everything depends upon the question of
supply and demand.
Hon. FREDERIO NICHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, I amn inclined to think
that the-Special Committee as proposed by
the honourable gentleman fromn Shediau
(Hon. Mr. McDonald) may possibly be able
to encompass some good, and to that extent I amn in syrnpathy with his motion.
I do not approve, however, of the wording
of the resolution, which reads as follows:
That a special Committee of the

Personaliy I amn of the opinion that if;
would be absurd for this or any other
body to undertake during the last two
or, at tlhe most, three weeks of the Session to inquire into a matter which has
been occupying the attention of the Federal,
provincial, and municipal Governments for
a long period of time, without any solution having been found. The wording of
the resolution would lead the public to
expect that this cornmittee would bring
forth a remedy; but, in my opinion, it
would be impossible to suggest a remedy
within the time at our disposai. As the
honourable gentleman from Kamloops (Hon.

412

SENATE

Mr. Bostpek) has said, we would have to
bring witnesses from everywhere between
the Atlantic and the Pacifie; and while
I think such a committee can be of a great
deal of service to the country in making
inquiries, for the reasons that i have
stated I would move in amendment, unless
the honourable gentleman from Shediac
agrees to amend his motion to that effect:
That the last four words "as to a possible
remedy," be struck out, and the words, "in re-

gard thereto," be substituted .

I would ask the honourable gentleman
if he approves of the suggested alteration.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: As the honourable gentleman bas just explained, the time
is very short for coming to a conclusion in
a matter of this kind. I am very glad
to have his assistance on that committee,
and I think his suggestion is a wise one,
because, perhaps, the people would be looking for a solution in two weeks. I am perfectly willing to accept the suggestion of
the honourable gentleman from Toronta
(Hon. Mr. Nicholls), as I do not think it
would affect the value of the committee.
The motion was agreed to, amended as
proposed.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There is just one
question I would like to ask my honourable
friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) with
reference to this. On page 233 of the
Minutes of the Proceedings I see that the
Committee recommend a new arrangement
with regard to the departmental reports.
They state:
Since Confederation it bas been the practice
of Parliament to pay for the printing of all
departmental reports. The Joint Committee believes the time bas arrived when this policy
should be abandoned, and that instead each
public department be required to annually prepare its printing estimates to cover all services,
including the annual report; that Parliament
pay only for copies of reports necessary to
meet the requirements of is mailing list, and
for the Sessional Papers.

This is quite a change in the method of
payment for the printing of reports. I do
not know whether the matter has been
drawn to the attention of the honourable
leaderHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: -whether
he
could give us any explanation about it.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: In view of the
honourable gentleman's motion of yesterday, why is he not consistent? Why does
he not stop those now acting?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Consistent? I prefer to be inconsistent.
The -amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, during last Session
chapter 56 of the statutes of 1920, to my
mind, made a mst radical and unwise
change in the Judges Act. Section 13 provides:
The increases of salary granted by this Act
shall not entitle any judge to any increase in
the annuity which may be granted to such judge
under the provisions of section 20 of the said
Act, and the provisions of the said section 20
shall not apply to any judge appointed atter the
passing of this Act.

By the revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 138, section 20, it is provided that judges
who were unable to continue in the performance of their duties, after they had
served for I think fifteen years, could retire on two-thirds of their salary, and it
was further provided by section 20 that
judges who had servèd for twenty years
and had attained to the age of 75 years
could retire on full salary. The wording
of that section is this:
If any judge of the Supreme Court of Canada,
or the Exchequer Court, or any Superior Court
in Canada, resigns his office, Bis Majesty may,
by letters patent undier the Great Seal of Canada, reciting such judge's age and the period
of service, grant to him an annutty equal to
the eaary of the office held by hlm at the
time of his resignation.

You will notice, honourable gentlemen,
that, as I have remarked, a judge who has
served twenty years and has attained to
the age of 75 years, has the option to retire under that Act on a salary equal to
the salary of the office held by him at the

413

tinme of his resignation. The new Act provided that existing judges, if 'they retired,
should not be entitled to the augmented
salary. That, to my mind, is a breach of
agreement with those judges, because the
Act distinctly says that they shall receive
on their re'tirement an annuity equal to the
salary of the office held by them at the time
of their resignation. If one made an agreement with an employee that when he retired he should receive an annuity equal
to the salary 'he was receiving at the time
of his retirement, surely it would be most
unfair to him, after-he had served for
perhaps twenty years, to say: "I will increase your salary, but I will not keep my
bargain to give you that increase when you
retire."

But what I think is the most impolitic
and unwise part of this section is that it
provides that the provisions of section 20
shall not apply to any judge appointed after
the coming into force of this Act. The result will be that we shall have old men
hanging onto their appointments until they
die, or long after their usefulness is gone.
It is the opinion of the Department of
Justice, I believe, that a judge cannot be
compelled to retire, without an amendment
We

have had in our province judges who
lingered after their usefulness was gone.
To keep men on the Bench when they are
up in the eighties and when everybody
knows that they are sitting there just to
draw the salary and are not giving any
advantage to the country, is to go back
upon all the policy that we have adopted
in Canada ever since Confederation, and I
desire to move:
That section 13 of chapter 56 of the statutes
of 1920 be repealed.

That will leave the law as it was before
the passing of the Statute last year.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do I understand
my honourable friend to say that under
this arrangement there is no provision for
any retiring allowance to a. judge?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: 'There
is a provision that, if a judge is ill, or if
he is unable to perform his functions, .he
may retire on a two-thirds allowance; but
there is no provision now for a judge appointed after the coming into force of
this Act to retire on full pay after he has
served twenty years and attained the age
of 75, as formerly was the law.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGeEED: Mr.
Chairman, it is not necessary fer us to dis-

I therefore submit to the Committee that
it is clearly out of order.

course, I will not question the statement

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND SUPREME
COURT
'VACANCY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. B. C. PROW SE:
Honourable
gentlemen, I would ]ike to draw the attention of the Government to a very serious
matter.. In the littie province which I have
the honour to represent there is now, and
has been for over a month past, a vacancy
on the Supreme Court Bench. I do not see
any reason why the Government should
take a month to fill a position of this. kind.
If they had to go to South Africa or Io
Australia or to some other country to find
a man to fill the vacancy, there might be
some excuse; but in the province of Prince
Edward Island we have some good men
Who are quite capable of filling the posi-

tion, and there is no reason at all for
holding open judicial positions for a month
pending the decision of the Government.
I may say that men who have cases in
court and who are waiting for appeals
have been put to considerable expense. A
week ago the Appeal Court had to be
adjourned on accoiint of the position not
being filled. As I have said, if the Government can give any reasonable excuse, I
shall be perfectly satisfied; I do not want
to score the Government, but it seems to
me that there is no reason in the world
why a position of this kind should be left
vacant, simply because Prince Edward
Island is a little provincé and nobody seems
to care. That is all I have to say.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend has given us the reason for
the delay. There are so many excellent
gentlemen practising law in Prince Edward
Island who are willing to accept this position, and whose friends are anxious that
they should be appointed, that it really
has created some difficulty in making a
selection.
Hon. Mr. PROWSE: Surely the Minister of Justice should be able to select
one of them.
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
difficulty is owing to the excellence of so
many. I can assure my honourable friend
that the matter is receiving every attention,
and it is hoped that at an early date-I
will not say when it will be-the appointment will be made.

POSSESSION OF WEAPONS BILL
SECOND READING-REFERRED
SPECIAL COMMITTEE

TO

The Senate resumed from May 3 the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Belcourt for the second reading of Bill M3,
an Act to amend certain provisions of the
Criminal Code respecting the possession of
Weapons.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I had
not intended making any observations upon
this Bill. I simply directed the attention
of the House to the desirability of permitting it to stand until further consideration couild be given to it. I understood that
the Minister of Justice was sending up to
this Chamber a Bill amending the Criminal
Code respecting firearms and weapons; but
my honourable friend from' Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt), who has charge of the Bill
before the House, has directed my attention
to the very immaterial amendments to the
Code in that regard in the Bill that is
caming from the House of Commons. May
I ask my honourable friend from Ottawa
what his intention is in regard to the Bill
which he bas before him?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I had hoped that
the Bill was of sufficient importance and
would command sufficient interest to cause
some discussion on the second reading, and
I had hoped my honourable friend would
give the lead in that regard. I am vain
enough to think that the Bill is one of considerable merit, and I think it is one which
is quite in line with public opinion. I
think the people of the country realize that
a measure of this sort must be adopted.
My honourable friend speaks of the Bill
which the Minister of Justice has sent to
this House. I have read it, and there are
only a few lines in it touching the fringe
of the subject dealt with in my Bill. The
fact is that it dea(ls only with weapons in
the hands of aliens, whereas my Bill deals
with the whole subject from A to Z. I am

MAY 10, 1921
sorry if no honourable gentlemen have
thought it of sufficient importance ta look
at the Bill and offer their views. I was
hoping that we might benefit by the
opinions of honourable gentlemen here,
especially that of the leader of the Government.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I hope
my honourable friend from Ottawa will not
take offence at my not having made myself
acquainted with the full details of this particular Bill. It just happens that I have
been somewhat absorbed in other measures
with which I have had ta do, and which
have occupied all my attention. If my
honourable friend sees his way te allow
the matter ta stand for a day or se, I shall
be very glad te look into the Bill, and ta
express ta the House my views upon it.
As I intimated the other day, there are
saine very important principles involved
in the Bill. There is the interference with
the industry of manufacturing firearms
and weapons, which since the war has
Then
assumed considerable magnitude.
there is of course the other feature of it,
which is net ta be overlooked, that the
importation of weapons and firearms is
very considerable. Then there is the feature of the stocks-in-trade throughout the
whole of Canada, which must represent the
investment of a very considerable amount.
Al these matters should receive every consideration in dealing with an amendment ta
the Crimuinal Code.
As it is desirable that the Bill should
receive a good deal more attention, I took
the liberty of suggesting ta the honourable
gentleman to-night that a good deal more
attention could be given te the Bil., as it
affects the various interests involved, -if it
were sent te a special committee, where
those interested in the trade or in the promotion of legislation of this character
might appear. In thdt way, if we had a
report from the Committee the House would
be seized of information that would permit
of an intelligent debate upon the subject.
To treat it as drastically as is proposed by
my honourable friend is, in a sense, unique.
It is something upon which it is somewhat
difficult ta express an opinion as ta the action
which should be taken. Hence it seems te
me that the course suggested would be
more advisable than ta discuss the matter
in a very general way without a knowledge
of the facts.

417

irregular, but I think the Bill brought forward by my honourable friend from Ottawa
is one that should receive the serious attention of this House; because, as the Criminal
Code stands to-day, no one is allowed to
have anything in the way of a revolver or a
rifle or any such article unless he be a
farmer, and then he may have only a shotgun in his house, unless he has a permit or
some other authority. That was the amendment which we made last session ta the
Code. I do net think that any great effort
has been made seriously ta enforce the
Act throughout the country, but I presume
it is open ta some use by the Government
if they wanted ta use it in any particular
case. The Bill as introduced purports ta go
into the matter very thoroughly, and deal
with all the different weapons of defence,
which are very often carried when it would
be very much better if they were not. We
should certainly try ta arrange ta give some
attention ta a matter of this kind.
The
honourable leader of the Government has
said that the Bill might affect the business
of the manufacturer of firearms and other
manufacturers in the country; but I presume that the Government has had representations made ta it on account of the
clause at present in the Criminal Code. We
are getting near a late period of the session,
and if this Bill goes ta a committee this
session, of course we shall net be able ta
deal with it in time ta get it passed into
law; but if the Bill is going ta be a very
important

serious
'businesses in the country, if adopted at the
present time, it might possibly be well te
adopt the suggestion of my honourable
friend and send it te a special committee
before which manufacturers and others interested in the question could appear and
give evidence. I feel very strongly with
my honourable friend the Senator from
Ottawa, that we should take some steps te
deal with this question in an intelligent
and comprehensive manner, because of the
danger of numbers of people going about
with those weapons in their pockets and of
such accidents as we read of from time te
time happening because of people who
should net have such weapons in their
bands using them indiscriminately. That
is a very serious danger, and an evil that
I think shpuld be stopped as soon as possible.

fact that the honourable gentleman is

best thing I could do would be to adopt
my honourable friend's suggestion and let
the Bill go to a special committee, in order
that persons who have objections to the
Bill or suggestions to offer may come
and give the committee the benefit of their
views. Of course, I apprehend that the
sending of a Bill of this sort to a select
committee at this stage will prevent it
from being passed during the present
Session; but I hope that it will have the
effect of bringing greater attention and
interest to the subject than has been shown
to it up to this time. Within the last year
or two newspapers in almost every Province in Canada were clamoring for a Bill
of this sort, by reason of the negligence
with which the law, ineffective as it is,
was being put into force; yet it does not
seem that the bringing up of the matter
at this stage has even revived the interest
of those who discussed it with great fervour not many months ago. The sending
of the Bill to the committee niay bring
the matter more directly under the notice
of those people, and also raise some opposition, and possibly the committee may
thus find that some very valuable and important information will be brought out.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Would it not be
vell to provide that the Bill, if it became
law, should not come into force until a
certain time, say a year. That would
afford those who might have objections an
opportunity of discussing the provisions of
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have that in
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: What date is
that?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The first of
January, 1922. In spite of the suggestion
of difficulty in framing such a Bill, I make
bold to say that when this Bill is examined
carefully it will be found that it deserves
a little more attention than it has received
so far. But I accept the suggestion of
my honourable friend the leader of the
Government that the Bill be sent to a
select comnittee. I have not the names at
this moment, but if I am given permission
I will get the names. I understand my
honourable friend will agree to a committee of nine, say?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then perhaps
he will allow me to consult with him as
to the nomination of the coxnmittee, and
then the motion can be put.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
quite agreeable.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
the honourable gentleman was not present
to hear the remarks I made on the
Bill on its second reading. I explained
it very fully, and if the honourable gentleman had heard my speech he would
know all about it. The Bill consists of this.
At present the maximum fine that the
Government can impose upon any one causing any damage in a harbour while cleaning ships, etc.,, is only $100. Now, with the
great use of oil for fuel, when oil tanks
are being cleaned the oil is allowed to be
spilled on the water, and only recently an
accident took place. Some one by mistake
threw a red-hot bolt into the water, and
the oil took fire and caused one of the

were made to the ship-owners, the Government said that they should clean and
empty those oil tanks when they were on
the ocean, and not inside a harbour. The
small amount of $100, however, was not
sufficient to cause them to take heed, and
the Government, I'understand, would like
to have the right to raise the penalty to
$1,000. I understand the Bill was accepted
by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries
because he considered it advisable.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I quite agree with
the honourable gentleman, and the statement he has made is one that should be
brought to the attention of all who have
anything to do with the harbours of Canada. I know that the same trouble has
arisen in the harbour of St. John, and also
the question of penalties to be put on ships
allowing oil waste to be discharged on the
water in the harbour, and so becoming a
menace from fire. This practice involves
another danger-that of killing fish where
the waters are inhabited by them. I would
be very glad indeed to support the honourable gentleman in forwarding and bringing to a finish any legislation that would
control that matter, and put-an end to the
trouble. It is a very. important subject.
Section 1 was agreed to.

but I regret to say that for a long time,
not only in this Session, but in other Sessions, I have not been able to get them.
I want to say clearly that I do not blame
the leader of the Government at all, because
he simply hands the question to some
official of the House, who sends it to some
Department, which simply telegraphs the
wording of the question, for instance, to
Toronto, and naturally the answer comes
back, "We don't know anything about it."
I have asked what is the total ascent in
feet on the Transcontinental railway between Winnipeg and Quebec. That is not
a difficult question, but the answer presented to this-House was ridiculous. It said
that the ascent was some 9,000 feet, which
is more than the adverse grade fron ocean
to ocean. Therefore I asked the leader of
the Government to withdraw the answer
so that it would not appear as though the
Government had no idea of the thing at all.
That is only one of the answers I have
received. I have asked many other questions, and in reply to some of them I
have been told to look at the books myself.
As I say, I do not blame the leader of the
Government at all, but it seems to me that
the system in the Government departments

SENATE

Under the old system a Deputy Minister
had charge of a Department and saw
that his officials did some good and
answered questions that were asked.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I am glad that my honourable friend from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) has acquitted me of any
want of courtesy with regard to answering the various questions he bas submitted to the House. While there may be
a reason for the delay which bas taken
place, yet it is quite possible, if the different Departments exerted themselves to
the fullL extent of their energies and their
numerical strength, that my honourable
friend's questions would be answered.
But there is this to be remembered, that
with the demands that are made during a
Session of Parliament upon the various Departments, and particularly those branches
which are largely statistical, it is difficult to meet all the requirements of both
Houses. In the other branch of Parliament members are even more inquisitive
than in this House. There seems to be
a thirst for information which is really
insatiable; and when one does bring down
the information, it does not satisfy those
who have demanded it.
Let me illustrate to my honourable
friend, so that he may exercise a little
charity towards the officials who are
charged with those responsibilities.
A
particular case occurred in this Chamber
a few Sessions ago, in which an honourable member, in his thirst for information,
placed upon the Order Paper a motion for
certain papers to be brought down. They
were brought down at an expense of
something like $1,000. It took nearly that
amount to prepare the return. When he
saw the magnitude of the papers placed
upon the table of the House, it gave him
considerable surprise. " Why," he said,
" I had no idea that my questions involved the preparation of so much documentary evidence. If I had known that,
I would have called at the Department and
have asked them the questions."
That perhaps is an exceptional case, but
if the honourable gentleman whom I have
in mind had been good enough to step
into the Department instead of placing
that particular question upon the Order
Paper, he could have had his question
answered and would have saved the
exchequer of the country at least
$1,000; because the furnishing of the
information involved telephoning all over
Hon. Mr. CASGRATN.

the Dominion and the preparation of voluminous documents, which, when they
were placed upon the Table, were not even
looked at. That occurs time and time again,
and I would respectfully suggest to honourable gentlemen that they could obtain
information very much more easily by attending at the Department and asking the
Minister of the Department to secure the
information they wish. I do not for a
moment question the right of honourable gentlemen to seek information
is a much
in Parliament, but there
more expeditious and easy way of
acquiring it, and I fancy that honourable
gentlemen who really want information
would be able to satisfy themselves by
acting upon the suggestion which I have
made, rather than by taking the circumlocutory way that is adopted in placing on
the Order Paper either an inquiry or a
notice, so that the attention of the Senate
may be directed to a particular subject.
I make this suggestion with all deference
-- not for a moment seeking to obtrude my
opinion upon the right of honourable gentlemen to make inquiries in the usual way.
I would merely suggest that we could expedite the business which we have in view
by adopting the other means.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Departments
were asked for information, but they simply
refused to give me any.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
should not do that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They do not even
say, "Go to the Minister." They say, "We
have no right to give information here: if
you want it, put a question."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend would be good enough to
give me the names of any officials who
treated him discourteously or refused him
information, I shall be glad to draw the
attention of the Government to the matter.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I was so often
told in the various Departments that they
could not give the information, and that if
I wanted it I must place an inquiry on the
Order Paper, that I gave up going to the
Departments. That is why I ask so many
questions-because every Department seems
to be hermetically sealed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would like to
draw the attention of this House to what
has been my own experience, though it bas
been not nearly as frequent as that of my
honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr.

MAY 11, 1921
Casgrain). I have been told in the Departments that information of this kind would
net be given even te a member of Parliament, that it would have te be asked for
in the House. I think the impression exists
in some of the Departments, if net in all
of them, that Senators or members of the
House of Commons are net entitled te go
te a Department and get any information
upon these public matters. I think my
honourable friend will find that that is the
impression throughout the Civil Service,
and that Deputy Ministers think they are
net justified in handirk information even
te members of Parlidment. but that we
are placed on exactly the same footing as
persons who are net members of Parliament.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
say to my honourable friend from Ottawa
that the Minister is almost invariably available, and would be only too glad te give instructions in his particular Department forthe information to be furnished.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be
se, but I understood my honourable friend
te say that the Deputy Ministers would
also give the information if they were
asked. I want te draw my honourable
friend's attention te the fact 'that the
Deputy Ministers do net think they are
authorized te give that information. I
would net have mentioned this but that the
matter bas come up. Personally I am net
very inquisitive. In all my years in Parliament, over a quarter of a century, I have
asked only one question, which my honourable friend answered the other day.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
THE FROPOSAL OF LORD SHAUGHNESSY

Hon. L. O. DAVID rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he widl call the attention of the Senate
te the letter of Lord Shaughnessy re solution of
the Cana;dian National Railway difficulties and
Inquire whether the Government intend to'take
action in regard thereto.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I was induced te màke the present motion by the
idea that it would be a proper subject for
a useful and interesting discussion. The
anxiety produced by our war obligations
has been increased considerably by the disastrous situation of our National Railways,
and in all parts of the country people are
asking: "What is te be done? How will the
Government meet se serious difficulties and
solve such a disturbing problem? What
remedy can be applied?"

42:

There is no doubt that both parties have
been imprudent in connection with the railway question, by authorizing a multiplication of lines exceeding the present needs of
the country and unable te pay before
twenty or thirty years. But before -the
war, in view of the extraordinary development of the country, discounting the needs
and the brilliant promises of the future was
general, and in all the spheres of our social
and our political world-everywhere in
Montreal as in all other towns-thousands
of people invested money in the purchasing
of land. They seemed to be under the impression that there was lots of gold in
each piece of land they bought. Even if
there had been no war, a reaction was inevitable; but naturally the financial crisis
would have been less disastrous. Anyhow,
whether the Laurier Government were
wrong or not in authorizing the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway and
of the Grand Trunk Pacific, and whether
the present Government were wrong in
assuming the responsibility of purchasing
these railways, is not a practical question
and will not solve the alarming problem.
But, in order to do his duty towards his
country, to do what is right, a public man
must, raising his mind above party considerations, seek a remedy for the situation and suggest what he thinks proper.
When one thinks of the eleinents of prosperity and grandeur which Canada possesses,
when a public man especially is convinced
that it is destined to be one of the richest
and most prosperous countries of the world,
he cannot but have a deep feeling of anxiety
about the actual state of things.
It was, no doubt, under the influence of
those patriotic feelings and motives that
Lord Shaughnessy judged proper te suggest
what he thought required by the deplorable
situation of the country. All those who are
convinced that government ownership and
administration of railways is disastrous, as
clearly demonstrated by experience in Canada as in almost all the countries of the
world, cannot but congratulate Lord
Shaughnessy on having laid before the
country a scheme se worthy of consideration. There are many members of the
House of Commons and members of the
Senate who voted with reluctance for
the Bill authorizing the Government
to buy the Grand Trunk, because they
thought it was the necessary consequence
of the buying of the Transcontinental and
of the Canadian Northern, and they saw
nothing else te do. How many in the
Parliament and in the country are convinced that the administration of the

SENATE

422

National Railways, including the Grand
Trunk, will make our financial situation
worse, and will constitute an intolerable
burden to our country.
Government ownership and administration applied without discrimination is one
of the great fallacies of our times, as is
clearly demonstrated by what is taking
place in Russia, and as shown by the results of the operation of that scheme in
the United States. Government ownership
and. administration of industries are the
curse %f our civilization, of rational and
private progress, of human activities and
energy, of the initiative efforts of talent
and genius. Unfortunately, we are living
in a time when people are easily convinced
that they will find happiness in the destruction of the laws of nature and of the
foundations of social, political, and religious order. But our country is not yet at
the mercy of the preachers or partizans of
radical theories and we may lay the foundations of our future before it is too late.
But let us come back to the consideration
of Lord Shaughnessy's letter. I repeat
that all those who are opposed to the administration of our railways by the Government must be happy to consider a scheme
which would avert what they consider so
dangerous. I don't contend that the scheme
is perfect and cannot be modified; but, being
the only way offered to our consideration
in order to avert the evil which threatens
the country, we must treat it with due
regard and sympathy. How often it has
been said that the National Railways, including the Grand Trunk, ought to be administered by a special company, organized and operated as much as possible in
the way and manner established by the
Canadian Pacific Railway! And even how
often it was said that the C.P.R. was the
sole company in a position to operate those
railways in the interest of the country!
Well, Lord' Shaughnessy's scheme must
give satisfaction to people so speaking.
It is true that the Government would become owner of the National Railways, including the C. P. R., but it would have nothing to do with the administration of the
same, which would be done by the C.P.R.,
one of the best organized and administered
corporations of the whole world. The
rolling stock, the terminals, and everything
used in the operations of the different
lines' of railway, would be common, and
there be only one administration, one direction. It cannot be denied that the result of
such unification and administration would
be a considerable reduction in the cost of
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

equipment, rolling stock, and management
of the system. How many millions would
be saved only by the doing away of the
duplication lines and by the transfer of
rolling stock where most needed. It cannot be denied that a company can do what
a Government cannot do in order to reduce
the expenses connected with the administration rof a railway. That has been
clearly established by figures lately published, and showing the difference of costs
and revenue in the administration of the
C.P.R. and of the Government railways.
There cannot be two opinions on the advantages to be derived from the unification
of our railways, and from their administration by the powerful Canadian Pacific
Railway Company. I do not think it is
necessary to cite the opinion of Lord
Shaughnessy on that point.
What are
But there are objections?
they? It is alleged that the Shaughnessy
scheme would create a monopoly-a dangerous monopoly. But, in view of the control which the Board of Railway Coinmissioners bas upon the rates and doings
of the Company, it is difficult to see how
that monopoly could be so dangerous. The
powers of the Railway Board are such that
the harm done by monopoly would be little
and would not last long.
It is alleged that the lack of competition would paralyze the spirit of emulation, which is a powerful element of success. I don't see how that lack of emulation will prevent the able officers of the
Company from continuing to do their
duty, and will affect a system of administration so well established on sound and
permanent foundations. At all events, the
harm done by that lack of emulation woul.I
be more than compensated for by the advantages which will be derived from the
administration of our whole system of
railways by one sole Company, with ore
sole Board. The operations of a system
of railways by the Government and of another system by a company must necessarily be detrimental to both. A time may
come, and it will come, when our Government will be composed or controlled in such
a way that they will undertake to give
satisfaction to the partizans of Government ownership by taking possession of
the C.P.R., and they may organize against
the company such a competition that it
would be forced to submit to the will of the
Government. We may have an idea of what
would happen then from what has happened elsewhere. It would be the ruin of
the C.P.R., and of the whole system. The
ruin of that Company would be a national

calarnity. Then it is proper, opportune,
and wise to do what is required to avert
such a calamity, and it is one of the reasons which would induce me to vote for
the scheme proposed by Lord .Shaughnessy
As I said a few days ago, the world is
drifting towards extreme democracy, and
the Parliaments everywhere will be controlled by partizans of radical opinions.
Let us do what is necessary to protect and
preserve our national and social institutions; let us secure their future As much
as possible. Lord Shaughnessy is too intelligent, his mind is too farseeing not to
foresee what Will happen before long, although Canada will be one of the last
countries where their radical theories will
prevail, and, I arn happy to add, because
in great part of the sound principles of
the Province of Quebec.
The most serious objection to the scheme
of Lord Shaughnessy consists in the fact
that the Government would assume the
obligation of paying the dividends to the
shareholders of the company and would
have to meet the deficits, if any occur, in
the operations of the xailways, while the
Company will keep as its assets everything it possess outside of the railway
systern, such as lands, hotels, steamships,
irrigation projects. etc. AIl the risks of
the enterprise would be on the Government
side, and it is alleged that it should acquire the assets of the Comnpany to provide
for the possible deficits. There is something in that objection, and it might be
possible to modify that part of the scheme.
if necessary, in the negotiations which may
take place. But, considering that the effeet
of the scheme would be to amalgamate
a rich and powerful company with bankrupt corporations, we cannot expect that
Lord Shaughnessy would nlot protect and
preserve the interests of the shareholders
of his Company, that he would betray
their confidence in his ability and honesty
and take such a responsibility withouttaking ail the just and reasonablé guarantees which they would require. No, but
hie thinks and hie has reason to think, andi
to say, that hie would reconcile the interests of his Company with the interest of
the country.
He is convinced, and we
must share his conviction, that the unification or amalgamation of ail our railways and their administration by his Company would save the country millions and
millions of dollars, reduce every year the
deficit, and probably succeed in restoring
completely the financial situation of the
railways.
It is said by the Montreal
Gazette:

423

If amnalgamnation of the roads would flot end
the day of deficits. it wouid make reduction
possilIe, and there is reason to believe that
under a single operatlng company both deficits
and rates can be aubstantially eut dowfl.
I do not'think it necessary to go into ail
the details of the scheme, and I do not
pretend that it cannot be niodified; but
even as it is, it offers to the Government
and to the country the only chance of success-"planche de salut," as we say iW
French. Placed as we are between the
continuation of a state of things which
threatens so seriously the financial situation of the country and *a schenie which
will certainly improve the situation, the
choice is easy. The country is in the situation of a sick man to whom. is offered the
only remedy that can save his life. He
would take the remedy even if hie did not
like it. Well, the country is sick, and its
sickness, instead of decreasing, will becorne more and more dangerous if the only
remedy that can save his liff is rejected.
The letter of Lord Shaughnessy has roused
everywhere a feeling of relief, it bas had
upon public opinion the effect of the rays
of the suin through a dark and cloudy
sky.
I know that much more may be said for
or against the Shaughnessy scheme. I have
contented myself with considering it in its
general lines and general results, leaving
to the honourable members of this House
the task of treating this inmportant question with more ability and effeciency, but
not with a, greater desire to do what the
interest of the country requires. Ahl who
love our country and wish to see it happy
and prosperous have reason to be anxious
about the railway question, and I am sure
that in the consideration of the Shaughnessy scheme they will consuit only the
interest and the needs of Canada. Partizanship, personal and selfish motives, have no
place in the consideration of such an important question, when the welfare and the
future of the country are at stake.
I hope honourable members of this House
wvill continue the discussion of this question. I have always contended that the
Senate is composed in such a way that it
is able to discuss any question, not only in
the interest of the country, but in the
interest of the Senate itself.

there ia to be an export trade built Up,
there must be low freight rates. Therefore we are faced with a tremendous difficulty, beeuse we cannot belp the situation by an increase of freight rates. The
railways are a most important element in
the building up of this country, and the
developmentcf the business of the country
will very largely depend on how the railway situation is eventually worked out.
The reilwey question to-day is much more
important than any question that may

I make these remarks, fer the purpose of

it seems to me, is facing the country et

We must therefore appreciate very highly

is an occasion on which help ia needed. In

mny opinion, the Government of this country
-and I amn speaking quite irrespective of
what party is in power- is not capable of
formulating a railway policy, for the reason
that no man is capable of outlining a
policy for a business in which he is not
thorougbly experienced. One may have
many theories, but in fine cases out of ten
theories feul when they are brought into
practice. In my judgment the Government
should look about and see what railways
have succeeded, and why.
We know that in Canada only one railway company has made -a success of ifs
enterprise. We know aiso that the railway
company which has had the best territory,
the finest terminais, and the greatest acces
to business in Canada, h" miserably failed,
although it was first on the ground, and
had every opportunity that a Canadian
railway could have to succeed as a buasinetss enterprise. Why has that railway
not been a success, and why does it find
itself in a 'position of bankruptcy? In
my humble opinion if is because it had
not at its head, in the country wbere it
was operating, a first-class executive of
experienced railway men. It was governed
from England by a Board of Directors who
knew nothing of Canadian affairs, Canadian life, or Canadian business; and, as fer
as I can hear, it has neyer had an era of
prosperity eince it began to lay its rails
in 1859 or 1860. Therefore it is flot te
that railway and its management that this
country should apply for advice.
In my judgment the Government should
first realize that it is incapable of formulating. a policy for the operation of an
enormous reilway systei such as we have
in this country; then it should look about
for the best, most experienced, most successfui railwey man in Americe, and ask bia
advice as to who should be made the
permanent bead of this great Canadian
systein. Any man who had risen to that
exelted position would feel that he had a
great ep.portunity of doing something for
bis country if be were to accede to the
Government's request, and give us his best
advice. If there la such a man, the Government should unhesitatingly adopt his
selection, and leave hlm free to surround
himself with a amali executive whose business it ahould be in association witb him,
to manage this road. Theý might then put
on ornamiental directors froin each of the
provinces, to setisfy what they call public
clamour-to wbich, if I were Czar in this
country, I would pay ne attention in the
management of that railwey. AIl Governinents efeel that tbey must listen to
public opinion; but public opinion on a

SENATE
question of this kind is about as ignorant
a guide as one can possibly follow. However, if I had ,such men put on as directors,
they would be purely ornamental. The
Canadian Pacifie has an executive in Montreal
such
as
I
have
suggested;
and its entire staff of employees,
from
the
President down to
the
most humble servant, exhibit an esprit de
corps which I have never seen equalled in
any band of men in my life. I have talked
to the men on the Canadian Pacifie, from
the high-ups to the very low-down, and I
never knew a man who did not speak with
enthusiasm of the organization and of all
the people in it. That is the greatest asset
that a railway could have. That great
soldier, Foch, said the other day that the
reason why the Allies succeeded was because they had a wonderful esprit behind
them, and that the reason why the Germans
failed was because, in the end, they had
no esprit behind them. Nothing can succeed without that, and the first and most
fundamental thing is to create and foster
in the staff that feeling of enthusiasm and
devotion to their cause. It will require a
great man and a great executive to achieve
such a success as that.
I attended a meeting of the Railway
Committee the other day, and I heard one
of the vice-presidents say that the executive of the Government railways was a
changing body; that any directors who
drifted into the meeting formed the executive. To my mind that was an appalling statement. I should have thought that
the executive would have been chosen of
men whose business it would be to be
present at that Board and keep themselves
posted as to what went on. I know of no
corporation in this country, which has an
executive, that would allow any members
who do not keep themselves informed in
the affairs of the corporation to remain on
the board. The executive is the governing body, yet in this National railway we
have directors who came from all parts:
one mnay drop in from Nova Scotia, another
from Winnipeg, and perhaps attend three
meetings in a year, and yet remain members of the executive. That is a fundamental mistake which, in my humble judgment, would not be tolerated if we had a
great man at the top of the organization.
Another thing which I think must be
avoided by the Government is to allow
either the Intercolonial or the Canadian
Northern or the Grand Trunk or the Transcontinental to be the dominant factor in
this system. In fact, it seemà to me an
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

absolute necessity that the head of this
railway should not be chosen from any one
of those organizations, because there are
bound to be-and nowhere more prominently than in the publie servicejealousies and heartburnings, so that if a
man from the Grand Trunk is put over
others in the system, it is looked upon as
favoritism against the Canadian Northern
and towards the Grand Trunk-favoritism
by the chief manager for his own friends
of one line as against the other. Thus
there would grow up a spirit of discontent
and rebellion which, above everything else,
should be absolutely avoided in a business
corporation. This National railway will
never succeed so long as the officials take
the view expressed by a man, whom I
admire very much in other respects, who
said in my hearing. "Oh, well, if you do
away with such a train the public will not
tolerate it." Why, the business of the
management of that road is to run it in the
interests of the country as they see them,
not as every Tom, Dick, and Harry on the
street, who know nothing about it, may
think. I saw in a speech made in another
place last night the statement that there
are twenty passenger trains running between Ottawa and Montreal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That is right.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
If I
recollect correctly, there were four on the
Grand Trunk, five or six on the Canadian
Northern, and ten on the C.P.R. They
cannot all pay. In any business with which
I am connected, what do we do when we
find that anything does not pay? We discontinue it. When a man is running a
great plant and is not making money, he
closes down; he does not ask, "Will there
be an outcry in the Montreal or Ottawa,
newspapers if we discontinue this train?"
No; he finds out whether or not it pays,
and. if it does not, that train is cut off.
The other day when I made this statement I was asked, "Would you hand the
business to the C.P.R.?" I would hand all
the unpaying business I could to the
C.P.R.
This is a business proposition,
not a political question. It is a problem
of profit and loss, and where losses can be
lessened it is the duty of the railway company to lessen them. If necessary, we
should eut down passenger trains to the
minimum, so as to give the right of way
to freight, because everybody knows that
the backbone of a railway is the freight.
Expedition, in carrying freight gains new
business for a road. So I would clear the

MAY 11, 1921
road of the unpaying passenger trains so
far as possible, and give more way to
freight; that is how to get money into ihe
chest.
So far as I can see, these things
are nlot being done. When a gentleman
who was before the committee the other
day was asked what was the cost of a train
fromn Ottawa to Toronto, hie could nlot tell.
I venture to say that any experienced
railway man, if asked to put on a train
.hetween Ottawa and Toronto, would be
able to tell what the additional cost' to
this country would be in doîng so; and, if
hie could tell that, hie couid surely tell what
it would cost to operate it, and hie could
with a shingie and pencil figure out whetber
it was or was not paying. It does not seem
to me that a man who says bie could not
tell is profoundly skilled in the art of running a railway.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He didn't want
to tell.

What I arose to say was that the first
and last duty of the Government is to seek,
as tbe honourable leader of the Opposition

mian in Canada or in America, and unhesitatingly follow it.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, there is no doubt that the question brougbt up by my bonourable friend
fromn Mille les (Hon. Mr. David) is one of
the most important that tbe people of
Canada have to deal witb at present, or
will bave for a great many years to corne.
Tbe question is, bow best this task can

be accomplisbed.
agree witb the conclusions of my honourýable friend, that the best way to save the
situation would be to bave the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company take over the
management of the Government railways.
There is no doubt wbatever that the Canadian Pacifie is an extreniely well-monaged company, and I agree very largeiy
witb what has been said by the previous
speaker. It seenis to me that if the Government roads were banded over to the
C.P.R. to operate, and the Canadian Pacific
road itself were taken over by the Governnent, as proposed by Lord Shaughnessy, the Government paying tbe dividends

427

on the C.P.R. stock for ail time to corne,
that very method would do away with the
good management that bas characterized
the C.P.R. Why? Because you would put
it on exactly the samne footing as the other
railways-that the Government would have
to pay the dividends on the C.P.R. stock
anyway-and. froin that time forward you
would lose a great deal of the esprit de
corps of which my honourable friend
spoke, and which is undoubtediy a tremendous asset. Then you would get the
lassitude and let-it-go spirit that prevails
and practically
on Government .railroads,
You would
(on ail Government works.
not get the snap and the up-to-date
niethods and the bard work of the men who
are now operating the C.P.R.
Honourable gentlemen will further notice
that Lord Shaughnessy does not suggest
handing over the whole Canadian Pacific
property. He only proposed to hand over
the railway itself. H1e intends to keep a
great many oif the assets, running up into
I suppose,
some hundreds of millions.
that would be very fine paying propositions
outside of the raîlway. For instance, the
C.P.R. company have a big fleet sailing on
ail the seas. If they had control of ail
the railways, don't you think it would be
a very easy matter, and a very natural
thing, in making through rates, we will
say, from the western parts of Canada to
the markets of Europe and Asia and other
parts of the world, to make such rates that
the railroad end would work practically
for nothing, and that their ships that
caried the freight wouid get the big end of
the profits? That would be almost absolutely certain to happen; you could
hardly expect anything else if you put them.
-in a position to control ail the rail-carrying
of Canada. To my mind that is not the
solution of the question.
My honourable friend stated a moment
ago that the Government was not in a
position to establisb a railway policy. 1
arn not sure whether my honourable friend
stated that the Government was not in a
position to operate the railways; but anyway he said tbey could not establisb a railway policy. If that is the case, the Government should neot have taken over the
roads, either the Canadian Northern or
the Grand Trunk. But that is done now,
'and I do not tbink that it is going to be
of much use to discuss at preàent whether
it should have been done or not. But take
the' roads of the United States. When a
road got into trouble there and was nlot
able to pay its way, the Government did
not take it over. There is not a big road

SENATE
in the United States that has not been
through the hands of a receiver. Some of
them have been through the hands of a
receiver two or three times. And those
roads never stopped operating. The men
who originally put their money into the
railways probably lost money, but eventually the lines were recognized and worked
by private enterprise, and in many cases
became very successful. The United States
railways are not in good condition now,
simply because the United States Government took them over during the war, and
they were allowed-at least, the railroad
owners so stated-to run down. Those
railroads have been taken back by the
owners. The fact that they are in bad
shape at the present time is largely due to
the conditions following the war.
But to my mind the way to deal with this
subject is this-and it is only the opinion
of a layman who knows not a great deal
about running railways. My honourable
friend who spoke before me pointed out
the number of trains running between here
and Montreal. Honourable gentlemen, that
same thing is going on all over the country.
In a report made by the Government Railways it has been shown that there were
trains running in the West that paid a
revenue of 35 cents a mile and cost $2 or
$2 and some cents, to operate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

More than that.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Now, that sort
of train service should be eliminated.
There is one of the troubles with Government-owned railways. We have observed
it all our lives in connection with the
Intercolonial. Whenever 'in the last twenty
years it has been suggested that a train
should be cut off there has been a howl
from people in the lower provinces that they
had to have that train whether it paid or
not; and in most instances' they were
allowed to keep it arid have two or three
trains running for every one that was
needed. The train service should be eut
down to just the number of trains that
can do the work, and let the people howl
just as much as they like. I quite agree
with my honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) that public
opinion is a poor guide in that respect. The
elimination of unnecessary train service
would be one way to relieve the situation
and eut down the tremendous deficit that
we have each year.
There is another thing. The Government
railroads to-day are overmanned.
It was
just the same when the Liberals were in
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

power. I am not criticizing the Government
in a party manner at all. It has been the
same under all administrations. In fact, the
best man there ever was at the head of
the Intercolonial railroad, to my mind,
was the late Frank Cochrane, who did his
best to cut down expenses. But the railway
system, like every ôther part of the Civil
Service, is absolutely overmanned.
If the whole management of the Government roads could be put under one good
man, I would not raise one word of objection. I would commend the Govern-

ment if they paid a man $100,000 a year

providing he was worthy of it. Why, a
salary of $1,000,000 to the manager of
20,000 miles of railroad would eut no figure
if he were the right man. It is only by
paying a good salary that you will get the
right man. That is the only way you will
get good service. I think the Government
railroads are now getting pretty well away
from Government patronage foisting anybody on the railway executive. As my honourable friend stated, you want a railway
executive composed of men who understand the railway business. The directors
that have been put on the board of Government railways have not been railroad
men. I absolutely agree with the statement
of my honourable friend that the chief
executive should not have been a man who
had'spent his life on any one of those railroads. I am myself quite convinced at
present that the management of the Government Railways have their knife out for
the Grand Trunk Pacifie all the time, and
are in favor of the Canadian Northern. It
looks like that. There is the best track in
Canada, and what is it given to do? Practically nothing. Practically nothing that
can be avoided. A good man in charge of
the whole railway system would put an
end to that situation, and would use the
system as it is to the best advantage, and
to my mind that is what should be done.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) spoke also of the lack of esprit
de corps on Government railways. I go
further than that: there is no doubt that
there is a lack and there will always be a
lack of that spirit, but there is a lack of
esprit de corps amongst the people of Canada. There are thousands and thousands of
persons who could just as well travel by
Government lines, but do not. On many
parts of the Government railways I find
just as good service as can be found anywhere on the continent of America. There
are thousands of persons who would not
step a foot aside to help the Government

MAY 11, 1921
railroads by patronizing them, although
it is the people who must pay the deficit. If the people of Canada would only
realize that, it would go quite a long way
towards bringing about more of an equilibrium between receipts and expenditures.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Government
sent troops over the C.P.R.
Hon. Mr. 'TURRIFF: I can understand
that a good many would have to be sent
that way. But even the Government, I
think, has been remiss in that respect.
Another point I want to mention is that
the labour question on the railroads is such
that, unless the Government takes steps
to bring about a better system-a better
rate of pay for the labourers we shall
never get out of the hole we are in at the
present time. It is all right for the Minister of Labour to make excuses and gloss
things over. That does not help the matter. The fact remains that conductors and
engineers are drawing $5,000 and $6,000
a year, and that station agents whose
wages were $135 a month have drawn $224
for two weeks' pay, under the McAdoo
award, getting double pay for overtime,
and all that sort of thing. The rate df
wages is not so exorbitant; it is the overtime that is piling up the cost. Imagine:
75 cents out of every dollar that is received for freight and passenger trafficHon. Mr. WATSON:

Eighty-five cents.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Eighty-five cents.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Eighty-five cents
of every dollar is paid out in wages. The
thing is absurd, and the Government may
as well make up their minds to bring about
a change in that system, and the sooner
it comes the better. The employees of the
railway system can afford to take less pay,
because the cost of living is coming down.
Just think of it, honourable gentlemen:
every dollar that this country is paying in
income tax, which is a pretty heavy tax,
is going out to pay the loss on the railwaysHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Twice that much.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:-largely caused by
the over-payment in wages.
Honourable gentlemen, I dû not wish to
take up any more time. This is a serious
question. It is one that must be déalt
with, and the sooner it is dealt with the
better. But to my mind it can only be
successfully dealt with by reducing the
cost of operation by fewer trains being

421

run and by the people of the country coming
to the rescue of their own railways. I do
not think we can get over the difficulty by
handing the railways over to the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company or by guaranteeing their stock.
I agree with my honourable friend the
leader of the Opposition that until we get
the report from the Committee that is now
dealing with the subject we are not in a
good position to deal with it here. But I
think it has been a good thing to start the
discussion on this matter, and do what we
can ·to bring about a better state of affairs
than exists at present or is likely, if the
same conditions prevail, to exist for many
years to come.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Boyer, the
débate was adjourned.
UNMARRIED WIVES OF SOLDIERS
INQUIRY

Hon. W. B. ROSS inquired of the Government:
1. How nany women were recognized as wives
of men enlisted in the C. E. Force in the late
war although not legally marrled to such men?
2. How many children were there of such
illegal unions?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
information is not available, and to obtain
the same would entail an expenditure of

approximately $100,000.
THE DIVORCE QUESTION
PENALTIES FOR THE OFFENDER

Hon. L. G. POWER moved:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, it is desirable that in the case of every divorce hereafter
granted, whether by Parliament or 'by decree of
a court or judge, the party whose misconduct
has led to the divorce shall not be free to marry
again and shall be subject to such penalties as
Parliament may provide.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I have
to ask the indulgence of the House for
the few remarks that I intend to make.
As a rule I have no objection at all to interruptions or questions, but at the present time my hearing is so defective that
I could not follow questions or interruptions by honourable gentlemen of the
other side of the House. I shall be as
brief as I reasonably can in dealing with
this subject.
Up to five or six years -ago the number
of divorce cases heard by the Committee
of the Senate did not amount to more
than seven or éight in a Session. We are
in the habit of taking things easily, not
undertaking to do work that is not absolutely necessary, and the Senate has not

SENATE
taken any steps about the matter. But
during the last two or three Sessions a
completely different condition of things
bas supervened. I do not remember just
how many cases we dealt with last Session, but this Session we have already
Honreached, I think, the 106th case.
ourable gentlemen, I feel that that is a
very unsatisfactory state of things. Any
stranger picking up the Minutes of the
Senate might imagine that he had got
hold of the minutes of a Criminal court.
Our minutes nowadays do not read like
the minutes of a parliamentary body at
all. I think that it is the duty of the Senate, and the duty of the Government, to
take some steps to remedy the existing
condition of things.
The increase which bas taken place during the last three or four years is not likely
to slow down.
Take, for instance, the
State of Ohio, which is a neighbour of
Western Ontario.
I find that there in
1879 the proportion of divorces to marriages was 1 to 199-practically 1 to 200.
Coming to 1913, we find that the proportion of divorces in Ohio had increased
to 1 in 66, and in the year 1919 the proportion was 1 to 29. The same condition
of things is likely to go on here. Honourable gentlemen are no doubt aware
that in the State of Ohio, and in other
States which look upon divorce much in
the same way as Ohio does, the number
of divorces as compared with the mar-riages is increasing very rapidly, and the
moral tone is falling. That, it seems to
me, is a very unsatisfactory condition of
things, and I think that some steps should
be taken to rectify it.
Let us consider our practice in any ordinary case. We will suppose that the
busband is the guilty party, the wife the
injured one. She decides to apply for a
divorce. She retains counsel; she has to
pay fees to the Senate; and in a great
many instances she bas to pay very liberally
to the counsel who acts for her. She bas
all the trouble, all the anxiety, and all the
expense. She gets\ her divorce. She is
the innocent party. The guilty party, the
husband, simply sits quietly, does nothing,
and when his wife gets the divorce he has
a divorce too; and I have been informed
by judges who have had to try divorce cases
that very often the offence is committed
with the view of getting a divorce, and I
have no doubt that that is perfectly correct.
The guilty party does not even have to
pay any costs. All the expense falls on
the innocent applicant. That is not what
Hon. Mr. POWER.

ought to be. The right thing would be that
the guilty party should be punished and the
innocent ,should not suffer; but our practice
brings about exactly the reverse condition
of things: the guilty party does not suffer
while the innocent party suffers a good
deal.
When the divorce is granted, as I say,
the husband is free and he is at liberty to
marry again, just as his ex-wife is; and
very often it happens that he marries the
woman, misconduct with whom has brought
about the divorce. I think, honourable
gentlemen, that that is a most unsatisfacIt is a case of
tory condition of things.
the good suffering and the wicked prospering, and I do not think the Senate, which
is supposed to be a House of high moral
tone, should do anything to encourage that
situation. Our practice is unjust. The
guilty escape all punishment whereas the
innocent suffer; and really the practice
encourages immorality.
There is a provision put in our Divorce
Bills that there bas been no collusion; but
honourable gentlemen will see that, while
there may have been no formal collusion,
there may have been practical collusion,
and I believe that there is in a great many
cases.
It is very important that this condition
of things should be remedied, and I think
that on the whole the most convenient
remedy, and the one which would be
immediately operative, is to provide that
the guilty party in a divorce case shall
not be allowed to marry again, and that
if be does marry hie shall be subject to
whatever penalty the law shall prescribe.
I do not undertake to say just what should
be done; but it seems to me, now that things
have got to that point, that it is the duty
of this House, and perhaps more particularly the duty of the Government, to
take steps to cut off a large number of
cases. I am satisfied that if the rule that
I venture to advocate were adopted, it
would almost immediately cut down the
number of divorces by one-half; and I
think that in the interest of public morality
and in the interest of the reputation of
the country, it is desirable that we shouid
take that step.
Honourable
Hon. J. H. FISHER:
gentlemen, I did not have the pleasure of
hearing the opening remarks of the bonour.able gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Power) ; but I should like to say just a
word or two in connection with the motion
that be bas brought before the House. I
came in just as he was referring to the
increased number of cases that have been

MAY 11, 1921
brought before the Committee. We are
all aware that the number of cases has
increased, particularly last Session and
this. I think, however, that that is due
very largely to the war, and I have no
doubt whatever that, perhaps from this
time forward, the number of cases will
decrease instead of increasing as predicted
by the honourable gentleman. I do not
think it is possible to pass any general
Act that would do justice to all parties.
I think in some individual cases a very
great injustice would be done if a resolution such as the honourable gentleman has
proposed were allowed to go through. I
am speaking, perhaps I should say, as a
member of the Divorce Committee; and we
have had considerable experience in the
last two or three Sessions. I am not aware
titat in any other country where divorce
is granted there is any such law as this.
There may be, but if so I am not aware
of it. I do not think any country prohibits either of the parties remarrying.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is it not the
case that in certain countries the guilty
party, after divorce, is prohibited from
marrying a co-respondent?
Hon. Mr. FISHER: I cannot answer
that question. I do not know whether or
not that is the case. There are cases,
I think, in which the respondent should
be prohibited from remarrying, and that
is in cases where it has been clearly shown
that the respondent bas venereal disease
of any kind. It is not right that any man
or any woman who is the victim of disease
of that kind should be allowed to remarry.
I am prepared to go as far as that; but I
do think it is far better that where it is
shown that people have been living in
open adultery they should be allowed to
remarry, rather than to continue to live
in adultery; and there are many cases
to-day where they would be living in open
adultery if they had not been allowed to
remarry.
I have made these remarks simply to give
a few of my reasons for voting against the
motion of the honourable gentleman from
Halifax.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable gentlemen, I want to make even a
shorter statement than that of the honourable gentleman who has just spoken. (Hon.
Mr. Fisher). I noticed upon the Order
Paper to-day the resolution of the honourable gentleman, and I sent out just now
for the report made by the English Commission in 1909. It was a most representative Commission, presided over by the

431

Right Hon. Lord Gorell. I am not going
to debate the subject generally; I am just
going to point out what was recommended
by this most competent Commission after
a most elaborate inquiry. I read from
section 456 of the report:
In England, during the period of, divorce by
private Acts of Patlament, it was required,
and in Irish bills of divorce it is stili requIrèdi
that the Bill should contain a clause prohibiting
the marriage of the two guilty parties This
clause was formerly struck out in committee
in the House of Commons, but latterly in committee in the House of Lords.
In Scotland, by a Statute passed in 1600 (Act
29, "anent the marriage of adulterous persons"),
the marriage of a person with one with whom
such person is found guilty of adultery la
forbidden.

That is a statement of the law in the
old land. Then comes the recommendation
of the commission:
462. The question then seems to be, what is
the true point of view having regard to the
best interests of the community as a whole?
The prohibition would probably be a strong
deterrent to yielding to temptation placed before
women of any social position or even in any
well-to-do circumstances, but it seems doubtful
whether it would have any real effect as a deterrent on those of poorer degree, and it might
thus result in the end, in the large majority
of cases, In continued immorality, which could
not be cured by re-marriage.
46 3. If such a restriction were to be imposed,
It would have to be expressed that such a marrage should be prohibited and not recognized as
valid in England, wherever celebrated, which
again, in the present state of foreign laws,
would give rise to trouble. Purther, it would
be necessary, if other grounds than adultery
are allowed, and a divorce took place on such
other ground or grounds, to provide that the
marriage of the divoràed person with any person with whom adultery bas in fact been committed during the dissolved marriage should not
be permitted. Unless a provision of this nature
be introduced, the law could be evaded, in
cases of adultery, by proof of another ground,
which would be the ground of divorce selected,
or even created, to avoid the operation of the
law.

Without tiring the House, I may say
that they recommend that no change be
made in the law. The law in the old land
at the present time does not prohibit the
re-marriage of one of the persons divorced
with the co-respondent, which is the
extreme case referred to. The resolution
introduced by the honourable gentleman
from Halifax
(Hon. Mr Power) goes
further than that, and would prohibit the
marriage of the guilty person, either with
the co-respondent or anyone else
As I said in opening, I am not going to
debate the question; I just refer to the
practice in the old land at the present time.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: My honourable friend from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power)

SENATE
Hon. Mr. POWER: And you think we
ought to catch up with England?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No. If I thought
my honourable friend's çmotion could stop
these divorces in any way, I would be in
favour of it; but I think the reasons given
by the honourable gentleman from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), in objecting to
any motion of this kind, are very sound.
The trouble, I think, is that our whole
system of education at the present time
bas not sufficiently brought home to the
people the seriousness of married life, and
I hope something may be done along that
line. I should like to see those who are
interested in and responsible for the education and training of the young of this country, and of every country, taking up this
question seriously, and placing before thew
the serious view of married life. I think
that is the only way we can really bring
about a reform in this regard.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I regret that the honourable member from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Power) has brought this motion up, for
the simple reason that I think it will not
be productive of any good results. The
discussion of subjects of this kind from
time to time, which manifestly cannot result in anything practical, is but a futile
way of spending our time in giving attention to public subjects. The motion is
meaningless in this respect.
In the first place, if carried, it could not
be productive of any practical results, because there would be nothing to prevent a
report of a committee being voted upon
when brought before the House, the same
as before. This is simply a motion for a
pronouncement of opinion by the Senate.
It bas no binding effect. As an old parliamentarian my honourable friend must realize that nothing short of a statute would

bas thought it well to bring this question
before the Senate I regret that I do not
see eye to eye with him in this matter, because, for one thing, I think the enforcement of any regulation of this kind would
be very difficult and very tiresome. What
bas just been said by the honourable gen(Hon. Mr.
Moosejaw
tleman from
Willoughby) gives the reasons why such
a motion should not be adopted by the
Senate. I know the honourable gentleman
from Halifax has brought forward his
motion with the very best intention, and no
doubt the discussion upon it will have a
good effect in drawing attention to the
serious condition of things which exists at
the present time.
The honourable gentleman bas called
attention to the tremendous increase in the
number of divorces, not only in Canada,
but, I may say, all over the civilized world.
I am sure every member of the Senate
realizes that the number of cases that come
before the Senate Committee on Divorce
at the present time are a very great burden
on the members of that Committee, and
that they would be the first to wish to take
any steps that possibly could be taken to
prevent these divorces being dealt with in
this way. We have tried to get rid of
divorce trials in the Senate, and to have
them placed before the courts; but unfortunately the action taken in that matter
bas not met with appreciation in another
place, and we have to face the situation
as we find it to-day, and as, I presume,
it will exist for some considerable time.
The question of divorce is a very wide
one, and I think it is the duty of the people
of every country to-day to study the whole
situation and sec what is really the basis
of the trouble. Only the other day I picked
up the Morning Post, an English paper, of
the 23rd of April, in which this appeared:

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

MAY 11, 1921
would prevefit the exercise of the pro,vincial authority in regard to marriage.
I think that)is manifest. For instance, we
accord to the provinces to-day the right
to pronounce upon disability of marriage;
we accord to the provinces, and they exercise the authority, rightly, under the British North America Act, of saying what
shall constitute a legal marriage. They
legislate as to age and other qualifications
as to marriage. Will we venture to say
to the provinces of Canada, "Notwithstanding your jurisdiction in matters of marriage, we are going to enforce a prohibition
against, it"? I think my honourable friend
will probably. admit that consideration has
not been given tq that very important point
in the subject which we are debating.
TIhen, there is the further fact that if
we adopted a prohibition against marriage,
there is nothing to prevent a respondent
from going across to the United States
and being married and then coming back
to Canada. I venture to say that there
would be nothing to prevent his being
married in any province of Canada, that
province claiming the jurisdiction to say
what are the qualifications for marriage.
But in any event it could not be gainsaid
that the respondent could go to the United
States and be married there and return
to Canada.
It has always been fundamental in
English jurisprudence that prohibition of
marriage is against public policy. Take
this case, for example: if. in a will the
testator provided that any of the 'beneficiaries or legatees shoula not marry, according to English jurisprudence the courts
would hold the prohibition nugatory, because it is against public policy to
restrain inarriage.
For the purpose
of impressing this on our minds, let
us take the data given by my honourable friend as to the growth of divorce
in the United States. I think he referred
to Ohio as having one divorce to 29 marriages. What would be the result if prohibition in this connection were enforced?
Why, honourable gentlemen, it would debar
a large proportion of the people in the
United States from being married. If we
are going to make the sane racial pro.gress in Canada, we would have a prohibition against a large proportion of the
Would that conpeople being married.
'tribute to morality? Not for a moment.
I refer to these things to point out the
futility of such a proceeding. We are living in a civilization made up of humanity,
and, so long as human beings constitute
S-28
É

this world's population, we shall have to
fàce all the infirmities of the human mind.
It cannot be otherwise: it is common to
our civilization. All the churches and great
educational institutions of the land are
engaged in combatting not only this evil
but all kinds of evil, but none of us are
sanguine enough to expect that humanity
shall reach that stage where it shall be
without spot or blemish. I know my honourable friend from Halifax is very considerably exercised over the possible ascendancy of evil in the community; but
he and all of us will have to reconcile ourselves to the fact that we are here in this
world for the, purpose of combatting the
forces of evil, and resisting them as far
as we can; but we can never hope to escape
them. Like the poor, they will always be
with us, and it is just as well that we
should nçt distress ourselves by thinking
that the adoption of motions or the placing
of statutes upon our statute books will bring
this world into such a state of purity .that
hereafter there will be no occasion for any
moral or religious efforts.
Furthermore, there is just this peculiarity
about the question, to which I might refer.
There is too great a disposition in the
present day on the part of some to build
ring fences around other parts of the
community. It seems to me that the coinmunity to-day is divided into two 'camps,
one of which is always saying, "Thou
-shalt not," and the other answering, "We
shall, notwithstanding your prohibition
against us." In fact, our statute book is
made up of prohibitions of all kinds, one
class of the community trying to obtrude
and force upon another class their will
and their opinions and the doctrines which
they entertain upon all subjects. Let us
freely admit that we live in a day of more
or less freedom, and that human nature
will assert itself until the end of time.
All we can do is to ameliorate, as far as
we. possibly can, by good, commonsense
legislation, the human impulses and the
activities of life.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I do not propose
to ask for a vote of the House on this
question; but in asking leave to withdraw
the resolution I wish to say that there
was one point that I overlooked-that
the religious papers throughout the whole
country, of all denominations, are regretting the great increase in the volume of
divorce, and feel that effective steps should
be taken to prevent that increase. I venture to say, notwithstanding the observations made by various honourable gentie-

THE PRINTING OF

PARLIAMENT

CONCURRENCE IN REPORT OF JOINT
COMMITTEE

Hon. R. S. WHITE moved concurrence
in the first report of the Joint Committee
of both Houses on the Printing of Parliament.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, this report appears on page
233 of our Minutes. I want to give great
credit to the Committee for the good work
that they have done, and the valuable
recommendations they have made; but there
are in the report one or two points which
I think should be discussed for further
elucidation. I think that credit is to be
given also to the Editorial Committee for
the work that they have done in reducing
the cost of the Printing of Parliament.
The report sets forth the whole matter. I
do not intend to take up time in reading
it all, but I am unable to understand the
first two paragraphs of the report and
perhaps I had, better read them to the
House. The report says:
Since Confederation it has been the practice
of Parliament to pay for the printing of a2l
departmental reports. The Joint Committee believes the time has arrived when this policy
should be abandoned. and tbat instead each
public department be required to annually prepare its printing estimates to cover ail services, including the annual report; that Pardiament pay only for copies of reports necessary
to meet the requirements of its mailing list, and
for the Sessional Papers.
This change in practice, it is believed, will
conduce te greater economy and be an incentive
to the departments to watch their printing appropriations more olosely. If this change be
accepted by Parliament it is recommended that
it be made operative for the fiscal year commencing April 1, 1921.

The report suggests a change in the
printing of the departmental reports. But
after that it goes on to say:
The foregoing recommendation having been
approved by Parliament, effect was given thereto
by Order in Council of August 18, 1920.

If the clause that I have read has already been approved by Parliament, I am

MAY 11, 1921
unable to understand why we should be
asked to adopt it now; and, further, if it
was approved by Parliament and put into
effect by Order in Council of the 18th of
August, 1920, I can hardly see why it
should be suggested that it be made operative for the fiscal year commencing the lst
of April, 1921. That is one point that occurred to 'me in reading over this report.
Then, in the last paragraph of the report, it is stated:
In one or two instances, the jurisdiction of the
Editorial Committee bas Ibeen cballenged and the
Joint Committee therefore recommends that the
rule as regards requisitions for all classes of
printing, binding, etc., be made applicable to all
officers appointed by Parliament equally as to
the public depaxtments.

.

As I understand, the arrangement at the
present time is that the Editorial Coinmittee have the power to say whether a
part of a report shall be printed or not. If
they consider that it is not in the public
interest that the whole report should be
printed, they have the power to delete certain portion's of it. But it has been brought
to my attention that in regard to certain
works as to which the Editorial Committee
exercise this power, the officers concerned
do not get notice in a proper form and do
not exactly understand from whom the
instructions come; they only get information from the Printing Bureau that such
and such a part of a report or document
is not to be printed, and it is not always
clear to them whether the action has been
taken by the Editorial Committee or by
somebody else. If such is the case, I think
that the Editorial Committee should be
asked to see that any of the decisions they
come to are properly noted and bear the
authority of their signature, because, as
you cap quite understand, anybody.sending
in a report might naturally feel aggrieved
if the report were cut down in any shape
or form.
Therefore, although departmental officers are quite willing to adhere
to what the Editorial Committee recommend, they ought to be informed that the
action taken is the work of the Editorial
Committee, and the door should not be left
open for possible action on the part of
somebody else, representing that he is
acting in the position of the Editorial
Committee.
I wanted to bring those points to the
attention of my honourable friend. Probably he can give us an explanation of them.
Hon. R. S. WHITE: Honourable gentlemen, I think the wording of the report,
saying that these matters have been
.
S-28à

approved by Parliament, is not quite right.
The report of the Editorial Committee was
evidently approved by Order in Council
P.C. 1940, which quotes the same recommendation as the report here, and the
object in putting it into this report is simply to have it confirmed by Parliament.
The idea, 'I think, is to get estimates from
the different departments as to how much
printing they will need, including the annual
report; but, for instance, all the translating
of the reports is still to remain under one
head. Departments will simply put in their
requisitions for their printing. I do not
kno'w that the change will do anything
further than simply check up the amount
of printing that the Department may re'quire during each term.
The question of the authority. of the
Editorial Committee is a matter with
which I am not altogether familiar. I do
not know what authority the Editorial
Committee has beyond a report to the
Joint Committee on Printing as to what
they recommend. They simply recommend
what is to be printed and how much is
to be printed, and it is, I think, the general
Committee on Printing who really have the
authority to say whether the printing shall
be done or not.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would not the
Editorial Committee have the power to say
that a certain part of a report should be
put in order or not put in, without referring the question to the Printing Coinmittee? Take, for instance, the question
of a department report. It is stated here
that in this respect the Printing Committee have been able to cut out photographs, and it says that the half-tone illustrations in annual reports in 1916 were
over 9,000,000 and last year there was
none. So I presume the Editorial Committee themselves cut those out without
reference to the Printing Committee.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: The Editorial Committee simply recommends.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: And that recoinmendation is adopted by-?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: By the Printing
Committee.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Did I understand
my honourable friend to say that there
was some slight error in that first part
of the report?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Simply that I presume that this Order in Council passed
in August last has not yet been confirmed
by Parliament.
The motion was agreed to.

SENATE
JUDGES BILL
CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE OF COMMONS
DISAGREEMENT

The Senate proceeded to consider the
message from the House of Commons disagreeing to the second and third amendments made by the Senate to Bill 60, an
Act to amend the Judges Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I do not know that anything is to be gained by further discussing
this subject. It was fully discussed in this
Chamber, both in session and before -the
Committee of the Whole. Apparently the
Commons will not assent to our amendment.
I therefore move:
That the Senate do not insist upon its second
and third amendments.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would ask the
honourable leader of the House to let this
matter stand until to-morrew. While it is
apparently the desire of the honourable
leader of the Government to concur in what
the House of Commons has done, I do not
think that those who were in favour of the
amendments made here the other day
adopt the same view. I therefore ask
that this matter be allowed to stand.
Otherwise I will proceed to discuss it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
not put it in the way that my honourable friend has, that if I do not consent he
will proceed to discuss it. I do not know
whether he intends to put that before the
House as a penalty that will ensue upon
my proceeding with the measure.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Oh, not at all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend is perfectly reasonable in
what he is asking, and I certainly will,
with very much pleasure, allow it to stand
until to-morrow.
The order stands.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow

FRASER RIVER IMPROVEMENT
INQUIRY WITHDRAWN

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR rose in accordance
with the Notice of Inquiry:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the und'ertakings of successive governments to maintain the Fraser river as a highway for ocean traffic; and to the failure to
make satisfactory progress with the permanent
improvements at the sand heads at the entrance to the river. And will inquire:
1. Who, if any person, assigned to three employees of the Public Works Department the
function of investigating prospective trade on
the Fraser river;
2. What are the names and places of residence of the persons so assigned, and what
were supposed to be their qualifications to report on prospective trade of the district naned;
3. Whether any opinion they may have offered
to the Minister of Public Works is accepted as
superior to the testimony, if any, offered to
him by Fraser Valley business men and others
representing that their interests and the interests of their community are suffering serious
loss because of the delay in making the Fraser
river accessible to the shipping presently available to British Columbia ports.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I understand that satisfactory arrangements
have been made for an inquiry on the
grounds into the matters covered by this
notice. Therefore I would ask permission
to withdraw the inquiry.
The inquiry was withdrawn.
RETIRED PILOTS
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DANIEL inquired of the Government:
1. What are the annual amounts of pay
granted to retired or superannuated pilots, in
the foilowing pilotage districts respectively:
Montreal, Quebec, Sydney, Miramichi, Pictou,
Halifax and St. John?
2. What, if any, changes have been made
in these rates during the last seven years,
giving amounts, dates, and districts?
3. Under what regulations are these annual
amounts arrived at in the different pilotage
dietricts?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
1. Montreal-No pensions paid by Government; Quebec-$300 per annum to those
entitled to it; Sydney-No pensions paid by
Government; Miramichi-No pensions paid
by Government; Pictou-No pensions paid
by Government; Halifax-No pensions paid
by Government; St. John-No pensions
paid by Government.
2. No change.
3. By Order in Council, dated December 5, 1906, in order to reduce the number
of pilots in the pilotage district of Quebec. A pilot must retire at the age of 65
years to obtain this pension.

ANSWERS TO INQUIRIES
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I wish to draw the
attention of the House to the same subject
to which attention was called yesterday by
my honourable friend from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain), namely, to the replies which are given to inquiries. I have
received a reply to an inquiry made yesterday. In order that honourable members
may see that the answer is not a fair
answer to the question apked, I will read
the first question. It is:
What are the annual amnounts of pay granted
to, retired or superannuated pilots, in the followlng pilotage districts.

I did not ask how much the Government
was paying to these men or how much was
paid by any other authority, but what
amounts they received. The answer to that
given by the Government is this:

~No

what the pilots receive.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend overlooks the fact that
he asks what is paid to retired or superannuated pilots.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Exactly. It is well
known that they all receive a certain

much they receive. In the case of Quebec the answer given is: " $300 per annum
to those entitled to it." But it does not
say who is entitled to it. I might as well
have gone to the library or somewhere
else and tried to find these things out myself. I must say that to my mind the replies are very unsatisfactory, and will
necessitate my putting in another inquiry
with more particulars, I suppose.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It

made this inquiry yesterday, and we are
pleased to find the answer is down today. It is not, perhaps, quite what was

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It is not an answer

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If
quick answers are to be discouraged in
this way, I am afraid the departments
will fall back into the old rut.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It is quick action
with blank cartridge.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I am glad to hear
the leader of the Government speak of
speed in the Departments. I have drawn
the attention of the Department of Marine
to the case of a pilotage commission in
which two men had died five years ago,
and where there is not yet any authority
to appoint pilots. There is only one of

may perhaps not be as important as the
port of Montreal or the port of Quebec,
where millions have been spent, nevertheless it is important that when a vessel
wants to get men it may be able to do so.
I have drawn the attention of the Department to the matter with two letters,
but nothing bas been done.
With reference to the Department being
able to answer as to what they give these
men as pensions, I may say that I have
never known the men to get any pensions,
and they only get very ;ittle for the services which they perform. I think my honourable friend from St. John (Hon. Mr.
Daniel) bas got as good an answer as
could be given.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I
direct my honourable friend's attention
to this fact: if they have been able to
get along without pilots for five years,
they may so continue.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: A vessel coming to
a strange harbour is supposed to be able
to raise her flag and to obtain a pilot.
That is the law as it stands to-day.

GAS INSPECTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 13, an Act to
amend 1and consolidate the Acts respecting
the Inspection of Gas and Gas Meters.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Gas
Inspection Act is to be found in the Revised
Statutes of 1906. I think there was legislation on the subject before that date, but
with the revision of the statutes it was
consolidated, and in 1910 very important
amendments were made. Since that time,
owing to the progressive changes that have
taken place in regard to the calorific or
heat values of gas used for domestic purposes and the improvements that have been
made in the manufacture and quality of
gas, it is desirable, on behalf of the consumer as well as the manufacturer, that
the Act should be further revised. This
Bill, therefore, is a consolidation of the
Act with all the legislation which we have
heretofore passed. It involves the repeal
of several sections, amendments to others,
and additional legislation. For instance,
it is proposed to take authority to measure
gas by heat units, as is .done in England,
instead of by the cubic foot. Apparently,
the more modern way is to measure it by
heat units.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: B.T.U's.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
not proposed at once to give force to this
particular method of measuring gas; the

43

MAY 12, 1921
Government is taking to itself the authority to put it into operation, if desired.
With these few observations, I move the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, my honourable friend bas referred to this Bill as a consolidation. There
are certain points with regard to it to
which I should like to draw his attention,
and perhaps he will be able to give us some
information on the subject when we ga
into committee. As far as I can see, there
is no provision in the Bill whereby the
Government is to look into the question of
the purity of the gas supplied. It may be
very important for the consumer to know
that he is getting gas of a good quality.
The only clause of that nature is clause
19, which says:

Any contractor who supplies any purchaser
with manufactured gaz containing any trace of
suplhuretted hydrogen shall be liable to a penalty not exoeeding $100 and not less than $25.

Apparently the Government does assume
some responsibility in the matter of seeing
that a consumer is not hurt by injurious
gas; but it does not take upon itself to
see that there is any test as to the purity
of the gas or its illuminating power.
Then my honourable friend did not say
anything as to why the Dominion should
be dealing with this question. It seems
te me that this is a matter for the proOf
vinces rather than the Dominion.
course, I can quite understand that it may
be an advantage to have the work of
inspection all centred in one office for the
Dominion, rather than scattered over the
different provinces; but, as the use of gas
is necessarily confined to the particular
province in which it is applied, I do not
quite understand why, in the first instance,
the Dominion dealt with the question of
the inspection and regulation of the supply
of gas in the provinces..
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It comes within
weights and measures.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Further, as to the
question of the use of natural gas, I do
not see that this is included in this
Bill at all, and possibly it might be.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is room te include all kinds of gas.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would natural gas
be included in this?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
s0.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The question of
quality would of course arise with regard

ta that gas, in the same way as with manufactured gas, and it is important for persons using natural gas to know that what
they are receiving is 'of good quality.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I might
say- to my honourable friend that that is
furnished by nature, and we shall find a
little difficulty in improving it, I am afraid.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I quite understand that there would be a difficulty in
dealing with it; at the same time, if the
Government carry out an inspection, they
should take these questions into consideration. I hope my honourable friend will
be able to give us some information when
we go into committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
PRISONS AND REFORMATORIES
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 35, an Act to
amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
is an amendment to the Prisons and Reformatories Act, advancing from 16 to 18
the age of those who may be sent to a
reformatory. Under the Act as it is at
present, the maximum age is 16. There
are many cases in which it is very undesirable that youths between 16 and 18
should be committed to a penitentiaxy or
a jail; consequently it is proposed to advance the maximum age of those committed
ta reformatories to 18.
Furthermore, it is provided that the
operation of the Act may be suspended
until it becomes apparent that the various
provincial institutions working under the
Act have made provision say for the separation of the older inmates from the younger
ones se that there may not be that degree
of demoralization that might occur by the
association of a youth of 18 with a youth
of more tender years.
- The second part of the Bill, beginning at
clause 2, bas to do entirely with the province 6f Nova Scotia, the object of the
measure being to make the Prisons and
Reformatories Act applicable to the legislation which obtains in that province.
The clauses from section 2 ta the end of
the Bill, I understand, have bçen prepared
by the province of Nova Scotia with the
object in view which I have mentioned.
Hon. L. G. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I have not hard the opportunity to

SENATE

440

read this Bill over carefully, but there is
one provision in it which strikes me as
being of very questionable wisdom, and
that provision is to be found in the very
first clause. The existing provision as to
the sentencing of young people to prisons
and reformatories is altered by substituting
the words "eighteen years" for "sixteen
years." There has been a long experience,
both in Canada and in other countries, with
respect to this question of age-the age
at which a youth should cease to be treated
as a boy or child and should be treated as
a man. I think that the House should
hesitate before it makes so sweeping a
change as is proposed here. This is to be
borne in mind: a lad comes before a magistrate and is sentenced perhaps to four
years for some comparatively trifling
offence, which means that if he is eighteen
years of age when sentenced, he is liable
to be detained until he is twenty-two. In
the first place, I think that is a highly
objectionable thing in itself; and, in the
next place, if you allow a number of grownup young men to be included in the same
reformatory institution with 'boys under
16, the effect on the boys is likely to be
very pernicious indeed. Up to the present
time the operation of the law as it stands,
with respect to age, has been satisfactory,
and I think that the Senate should hesitate
before they undertake to change•the law.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, the Government are to be congratulated on what they are trying to
do in regard to this matter; but, if I
understood aright the remarks of imy honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed),
the reformatories are all controlled by the
provincial governments and the penitentiaries by the Dominion Government.
If I understand this Bill aright, it means
that the provinces will be put to a certain
amount of expense in rearranging and
possibly increasing their reformatory
accommodation in order to make provision,
as stated by my honourable friend, for
keeping the older persons separate from
the younger persons who are sent to the
reformatories. I fear, therefore, that it
may be some time before this measure
can be brought into effect, because, if it
should entail a considerable expense on the
provinces, they may hesitate to incur that
expense, owing to the financial condition
in which they are now placed. The finances
of the provinces are not too sound, or
they have not a large enough surplus,
to enable them to spend money on anything
of this kind.
Hon. Mr. POWER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bec.

Except Que-

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend to the right says, "Except Quebec."
I think it is quite necessary that the older'
persons sent to a reformatory should be
kept separate from the younger ones,'and
for that reason I am rather afraid that
it will be some time before we see this
Act really go into effect.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 73, an Act to
authorize the ratification and carrying into
effect of the Protocol of the sixteenth day
of December, 1920, accepting the Statute
for the Permanent Court of International
Justice of the thirteenth day of December,
1920.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in the
month of December last, I think it was,
there was held at Geneva an assembly
called by the League of Nations at which,
under the covenant of the League, there
was prepared what is known as a statute
-in other words, the constitution of a
Court of International Justice; the intention being that it shall be a permanent
Court, and shall deal with such International subjects as are submitted to it from
time to time. This Bill consists of two
clauses: the first proposing to ratify the
protocol which was prepared and is
attached to the outline of the Court, which
is to be found in the Bill; and section 2,
proposing to pass the necessary regulations
'to permit of effect being given to the entire
scheme.
It is unnecessary for me to enter into
the details of the scheme, because honourable gentlemen, by referring to the statute
attached to the Bill, will be able to form a
much more intelligent idea iof what is
proposed to be done than could be conveyed by any explanations I might give.
Suffice it to say that this measure has
been prepared by some of the most eminent
jurists in the world. The Committee of
.the Council that was charged with the
of
constitution
the
of
preparation
the Court invited the most eminent
jurists known in the civilized world; it
was immaterial whether they were represented by members of the League or not.

MAY 12, 1921
The statute which was prepared represents the combined effort of the eminent
Comniittee which was summoned for that
purpose.
It is entirely unnecessary for me to say
anything as to the desirability of the
adoption of such a scheme as that which
is proposed, for the purpose of making
every possible legitimate effort for the
maintenance of the peacè of the world.
It is the outcome of the Covenant of the
different members that constitute the
League of Nations, and represents, I
think, the consensus of opinion of the
different members that constitute the
League. Although the United States is
not a member of the League, yet it had
its representatives on the Committee. One
of the most eminent jurists in the United
States contributed his services in the preparation of the constitution of the proposed Court of International Justice.
Canada was represented by three members
at the Assembly held at Geneva, and there
the scheme was adopted and the protocol
prepared, which is also to be found in the
Bill, on page 2. This protocol is submitted for ratification to the different
Parliaments represented by the members
of the League, and, so far as we know at
the present time, it wil be accepted without any dissent whatever.
With this short explanation, I move
the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I believe that very few persons
throughout the world will object ta the
creation of a Court of International Justice
to try differences between the nations;
but I believe also that persons who have
been giving some thought ta the matter
will regret that there is no compulsion
enacted by this statute. Under it no nation
will be able to bring another nation before
that tribunal for the settlement of a difficulty. It is a court to which parties will
have ta agree to submit their case, and
they will thus obtain a judicial answer.
I notice that by section 1 it is provided
that the Court of Arbitration which was
organized by the Convention of the Hague
of 1899 and 1907 is still to be maintained.
Under the organization of the •Court,
nations can agree to arbitrate their differences by collecting their judges from a
panel composed of representatives of all
the nations that were parties to the Conventions of 1899 and 1907. Under this
organization, instead of having a panel
of three arbitrators, the nations will be
able to appear before a regularly constituted court; but, as I have said, this Court

will be able to hear only the cases of the
parties who will agree to appear before it.
There are some cases which must go to
that tribunal under the Treaty of Peace,
but outside of the cases which arise in the
interpretation of the Treaty,. this is to be
a tribunal to which nations will resort
voluntarily.
I notice that this measure constitutes a
step forward towards Canadian autonomy,
notwithstanding what my honourable
friends from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
and from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) stated a few days ago. Clause 1 of
Bill 73 says:
The Governor in Council is Putlhorized to advise that His Majesty fbe humbly moved to
ratify on behalf of Canada the said Protocol
of the sirteenth day of December, 1920, in the
manner thereby stipulated.

Sa we are enacting legislation whereby
we shall request the signature of His
Majesty the King for Canada to ratify an
Act of the Canadian Parliament. I stated
the other day that from the lips of the
former Prime Minister of this country
(Sir Robert Borden) there fell the declaration that the, Canadian ambassador ta
Washington would be appointed by a Canadian Order in Council-that His Majesty
the King would be asked to endorse bis
appointment. It is true that the British
North America Act bas not been amended,
but remains as it is; yet there is in fact
a constant evolution in constitutions, even
the written constitution of the Dominions,
which evolution, going from precedent ta
precedent, enlarges the Dominions' autonomy.
May I be allowed ta revert ta a statement I made in a preceding debate-that
the Colonial Conference of 1894, which,
if I mistake not, was presided over by
Sir Charles Tupper, passed the following
resolutions:
That provision should be made by Iuperial
legi.slation enabling the dependencies of the
Empire to enter into agreements of commercial
reciprocity, including power of making differential 'tariffs with Great Btitain or with one
another;

and that the Colonial Secretary, who was
then Lord Ripon, answered the Dominions
officially:
by telling them that such power could not be
granted, inasmuch as it would be gi.ving then
and
as separate
status
international
an
sovereign states, and would result in breaking
up the ]Empire. Therefore such negotiations must
be conducted by Her Majesty's representatives
at the court of the toreign power. He agreed that
such representatives should have the assistance
of a colonial representative, even as a second
plenipotentiary, or i.n a subordinate capacity.

442

SENATE

I would emphasize these words-that the
negotiations for commercial arrangements
between the Dominions and foreign countries can only be conducted by Her Majesty's representatives at the Court of the
foreign power. That was in 1894. There
has been quite an evolution since then.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is not in the
book.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen will recall the fact that in 1903
the Canadian Government were desirous
of getting better treatment from the German Empire for the entry of Canadian
goods into Germany, and they had asked
the Imperial authorities to interest themselves in obtaining better terms for Canada. The British authorities had failed,
but the then Minister of Finance opened
negotiations with the German Consul General, Mr. Bopp, which were followed by a
super-tax imposed on German goods coming
into Canada. I see in the Parliamentary
Debates of the Imperial House a question
that was put on the 21st of July, 1903, by
Mr. Black to Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, who
was then the Colonial Secretary:
I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the
Coloni.es, whether, in view of the fact that it
has heretofore been the usage for the self-governing colonies to bargain as to commercial
treaties on equal terms with foreign nations and
with the mother country without regard in the
case of foreign nations to the fiscal policy of
the mother country, the Government proposes to
alter this usage.

Mr. Chamberlain answered:
The practice as to commercial arrangements
between
self-governing colonies and forei.gn
countries is described in the despatch of my
predecessor of 28th June, 1895, which was laid
before Parliament on the 6th of July in that
year.

That was the Lord Ripon message which
I have just mentioned, addressed to the
Dominions in answer to the resolution of
the Colonial Conference, and refusing to
the Dominions the right to negotiate their
own commercial treaties.
In the same month, on the 23rd of July,
Mr. Chamberlain, speaking in the House
of Commons regarding the negotiations
that had been carried on by the Dominion
of Canada with the Consul General for
Germany, said:
We communicated the failure of our representations to the Dominion of Canada, and then

the Dominion of Canada took the matter to a
certain extent into its own hands. Technically,
of course, no negotiations were going on between

ada and the Consul General of Germany. They
were not in a proper and technical sense negotiations. We have not received any record of
them, and as far as I know of no such record
exists. In any case they would have no final
authori-ty, because any treaty would be made

formally between -his country on behalf of Canada and the German Government.

That was in 1903. I draw the attention of
my honourable friends who thought that
there had been no evolution going on in
our relations with the outside world to the
correspondence which was exchanged in
London between Sir George Eulas Foster
and the present Minister of Justice, Right
Hon. Mr. Doherty, simply informing Lord
Milner what they had been carrying on.
Sir George Foster, in writing to Lord Milner, says:
I am enclosing herewith an agreement which
had been arrived at by myself and the Ministers
of Commerce and Foreign Affairs of France with
reference to a modus vivendi carrying on for
a period the main features of the Convention
of 1907-09, of which I spoke to you yesterday,
and I would be much obliged if you would forward it to the Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs for transmission to the British Ambassador at Paris. The French Ministers have the
duplicate of the agreement and will sign it and
forward to me at Ottawa for my signature and
they will sign this attached copy and retain for
themselves.

I could not find in the letter that a duplicate copy was being sent to the Colonial
Secretary to be forwarded to the Ambassador, to be signed before being delivered,
but I find that a letter which he was addressing to Lord Milner, Secretary of State
for the Colonies, had been handed over to
his colleague, Right Hon. Mr. Doherty, for
transmission. Here is the letter:
London, January 5, 1921.
Dear Lord Milner,I am transmitting to you, herewith, a letter
from Sir George Foster with the accompanying
Convention with the French Government signed
by him.
I understand from a telegram received from
Mr. Roy, our Commissioner at Paris, that in
addition to the articles mentioned in Schedule 2
of the Convention and those mentioned in the
memorandum annexed to the Convention there
should be provision made for our having a preference of 50 per cent of the difference between
the maximum and minimum Tariff on furniture
made of bent wood, and on caned furniture a
deduction of 50 per cent of the sur-tax on the
caning.
Will you kindly, when transmitting the Convention, ask the Ambassador to ascertain from
Mr. Roy if my understanding is correct and if
so to have these matters covered by an interchange of notes or otherwise.
If I should be mistaken in regard to these
items the Convention may be delivered without
thei.r being added.
Yours, etc.,
(Sgd)

Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I do not profess to understand
enough about the Bill before us to express
a very clear opinion on it. I do not know
how far it goes. To my mind it is a rather
complicated matter. I just wish to say a
few words on the general subject, not particularly on this Bill.
It appears to me that we are being
gradually drawn into European matters
more than we might wish to be. I feel this
way, that Canada in the past six or seven
years bas done ber duty not only to this
country but to Great Britain and to the
Empire. If we have done our duty when
we were not tied up in any sense whatever,
and not obliged to send a man over, why
should we be tangled up by that roundtable outfit in Great Britain in any way?
If we have done our duty without being
bound, why bind us at all? There is a
large party in Great Britain that wants
to involve every part of the British Empire
in the carrying on of wars and the defence
of the Empire. While I believe that Canada
should take part in the defence of the
Empire, I claim that the way to keep the
Empire intact and to get the best out of
the outlying Dominions is to do what
Great Britain has done for the last fifty
years-leave us alone. If we want to take
part in the defence of the Empire, we can
do it as Canada and as Canadians; if our
share in the defence of the Empire should
consist in having a navy of our own, let
us build a navy,and have it for the defence
of Canada and for the defence of the
Empire.
We have in Canada a certain number of
people who are ready to follow the desires
of Great Britain in anything that will tend
toward centralizing the power of the Empire. I for one am utterly and absolutely
opposed ,to centralizing the Empire in London. The past bas shown that the present
condition is satisfactory, and I am as absolutely convinced of it as that I am standing
here, that if that party in England and that
party in Canada should be able to tie us
up and entangle us, they would have planted
the seeds of the disintegration of the British
Empire. The reason I feel so strongly
on this question is that I take second place
to no man in my loyalty to Canada, Great
Britain, or the British Empire. I have
lived as a member of the British Empire,
and I want to die as a member of the
British Empire; and I want my children
to live and die as members of the British
Empire. If you want to maintain that
Hon.

Mr.

EDWARDS.

condition of affairs, you must steer clear of
everything in the shape of entangling
alliances with European affairs.
I was very glad to see, during the last
few years, that our ex-Premier, Sir Robert
Borden, took a very strong stand, a very
proper stand, on these matters, namely,
that nothing must interfere in the slightest
degree with the autonomy of Canada. I
have good reason to believe that our present Prime Minister, the Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen, holds views along those lines; but
my right honourable friend is going to
London next month to take part in negotiations there, and, judging by the past, honourable gentlemen, it will be a most difficult
matter for our Prime Minister to steer clear
or keep clear of something that will eventually tie us up and entangle us; and that is
what a great many people in the Old Country want to bring about. They do not seem
to realize that if they leave us alone to our
own good judgment we shall be -all right
and they will be all right. If we are left
alone I am sure the day will never come
when the men and the money of Canada
shall not be available for the defence not
only of Canada, but of Great Britain and
of the Empire. But we must be absolutely
free agents in the matter. You cannot
have two authorities. It is all very well to
talk about having an Imperial Parliament
and an Imperial War Council, or anything
of that kind, and I have heard it stated
that under those circumstances Canada's
voice would be the same proportionately as
that of Great Britain; but what good would
that do us? The English-speaking parts of
the outlying Dominions do not amount to
more than one-third of the people of the
British Empire. If it is going to be a per
capita control what about India with ber
millions? She could swamp all the rest of
the Dominions with ber tremendous population.
I just want to take this opportunity of
putting myself on record as being utterly
opposed to any change or any agreements
being made that will have the result of
entangling us in the future and drawing
us into quarrels that we have not any right
to be concerned in. I have not the slightest
fear that Britain will ever be aggressive
and make war unnecessarily. She bas all
the territory she wants, and more than she
wants; and if the time ever comes when she
is forced into war or when an unfair advantage is taken of ber, she will get twice
the help from Canada if it is absolutely
free. Five or six years ago, before war

MAY 12, 1921
was declared, our Prime Minister wired that
if Great Britain was forced into declaring
war, Canada would be right with ber; and,
if we are left alorie, there will be no change
in that position in the future. But any
attempt to bind the Empire's forces together will simply be sowing the seeds of
disintegration.
Hon. J. S. MeLENNAN:
Honourable
gentlemen, let me congratulate our bonourable colleague from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) upon what he bas said
in reference to this very important matter.
He could have gone further back than he
did; he could have gone back to the first
exercise of cohtrol by the British Government over what is now Canada, and he
could have carried on from 1763 the
gradual progression of liberty which the
people of Canada have enjoyed in governing themselves as each previous step in
administration was outgrown.
The system which existed became unwieldy and
confining; it came to cramp the development of the country; and when this pecurred a newer and a freer form of government was given.
That process has
gone on up to the present time. It will
go on, I believe, continuously, although it
seems to me it bas pretty nearly reached
the limit, and that we have pretty nearly
all that any people could have in the way
of self-government. I think the issue had
been obscured by too freely dealing in
names. "Define what is a nation." It is
very much like' saying, "Is So-and-So a
man?" In the legal meaning of the word
he is a man when he is twenty-one years
of age; but in the true intent he is a man
when he exercises the ability and assumes
the responsibility of manhood. I think it
is the same with nations. You can quibble
over the meaning of words; but the real
test of «nationhood is whether the people
are united and strong enough and intelligent enough to discharge all the duties
of the State to its members, and when
they can properly discharge their obligations to other people with whom they may
come in contact. And I think, tried by
that test of performance, that Canada is
a nation.
Through circuinstances over which I had
not complete control, I was in London this
winter much longer than I expected to be.
I came in contact not only with political
people there, but with citizens and parliamentarians of the other Dominions.
I
heard a good deal about the relations of
the Empire, and about what might bappen

44à

at the approaching Conference. I have
a 'distinct feeling that the eloquence of
the honourable gentleman from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) was directed at frightening away a bogey which does not exist;
I am confident that there is no desire on
the part of the English people to bind
us closer to them except through the ties
which have proved so strong during the
last four or five years, and that there is
a desire not only in Great Britain, but
also in Australia and in New Zealand, and,
I believe, in Canada, for absolute cooperation to make the ties which bind us
together stronger for the purpose of absolute co-ordination in making effective for
our benefit and for the peace of the world
the strength which we have and which
we showed on the -battlefields. The only
desire, I think, of any one with whom I
came in contact was to make that coordinative strength more powerful and
effective than it has been. The only official utterance that I heard on the subject
was made in an interview with Lord
Milner, who, I take it, would be held to be
the head of that terrible and secret body,
the Round Table, and who is a statesman
who accomplished something both during
the war and before it for the benefit of
the Empire. In January, or possibly in
February, about the time of his retirement, this interview appeared in the Observer.
He then stated, substantially,
speaking of the Dominions, that the next
step must come from them. I believe that
is the position of the people who have
given attention to the matter in England,
and that there is to-day a desirè, such as
I have never before known to exist, to
consult the Dominions rather than any
such absurd thing as to attempt to coerce
them.
Hon. GEO. LYNCH-STAUNTON. Honourable gentlemen, I do not approve of this
Bill. This is not because of any jealous
feeling that we may be allowing our right
of self-government to slip from us, or that
we may be concentrating the power of
the Empire in Great Britain, but rather
because I think it is absolutely outside
our Constitution. Our Constitution is a
written one, and is not susceptible to any
evolution. It is susceptible only to interpretation.
The British Constitution,
being an unwritten one, goes on broadening, as it is said, i' from precedent to precedent," adapting itself to the new conditions that arise with new generations,
and fitting itself as a machine for making

harmonious the relations not only of Great
Britain's people among themselves, but
her relations with the world.
The BritiTh North America Act has

right to legislate in respect of matters
which affect Canada alone-by that I mean

legislation which directly prejudices or interferes with the rights of the Empire
at large or of the other States which compose the Empire. I was much interested
in the speech which Sir Robert Borden
made in another place the other day, in
which ho traced what we sometimes call
the evolution of our constitutional powers
in regard to outside peoples. In my judgment he was really tracing the evolution
of the realization of our rights and powers
with regard to other nations. I cannot
see that we are one step farther advanced,
in so far as our relations with foreign
powers are concerned, than we were on
the day when the British North America
Act received the Royal Assent. We have
the right, as I have already tried to explain, to legislate with regard to matters
which affect us alone; and that does not
mean and cannot mean that we have only
the right to legislate with regard to matters occuring inside the Dominion. From
the beginning Canada has made contracts
with foreigners for loans; from the beginning Canada has made contracts with
people outside of this country, and has
carried them out. We did not think it
was a step forward when we sent our

abroad, and naturally we made agreements with foreign nations as to the landing of those troops in their countries. We
sent troops into South Africa, and we
had to enter into contracts and relations
with the people there. Is there any possible distinction between making a contract, which is called a treaty, with a
foreign country regarding the admission
of goods into that country or the admission of goods into this country and making
a contract to borrow money from that
nation? In order that this country may
be governed, it is necessary that in all
affairs which affect it alone, it shall have
as much right as any independent state to
make a contract by treaty or by covenant;
and in making contracts with foreign nations we are not in the slightest degree
treading on the rights of the Imperial
Parliament, and I cannot understand how
we ever came to concede the right to the
Secretary for the Colonies to pass our
Hon. Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON.

contracts on to His Majesty the King.
To my mind it is clearly expressed in the
British North America Act that we have
the right to make laws for the peace,
order, and good government of Canada,
and that the sending of these contracts
to His Majesty through the Secretary for
the Colonies is a mere practice, and not
a legal duty on our part. But we have
gradually, from year to year, realized that
there is nothing more serious or more
sacred or more imperial in making a treaty
regarding our own individual affairs
with the United States or with France
than there is in making a contract to borrow money in either of those countries.
I am not in favour of this Bill, for the
reason that in my opinion it never was
intended by the British North America
Act, nor can it be spelled out of the British
North America Act, that we should have
power to make war or peace, or that we
should have had power to enter into any
contract or relation which would embarrass
or prejudice the Empire as a whole. All
such arrangements, agreements, treaties,
or obligations as we become bound by must
of necessity be entered into by the Imperial
Government. It will be conceded that Canada could not go to war without involving
the Empire; therefore Canada has no
authority or justification to commit either
the whole Empire or any portion of it to
hostile relations with any other nation.
How can we function-to use a modern
term-in regard to Imperial relations with

ferences. I listened with great interest and
pleasure to that luminous explanation
given by the right ho.nourable the Prime
Minister in his speech in the House of Commons of what he regards as the position
that he will occupy when he goes presently
to the conference to be held in London. He
stated that the very meaning of a conference precluded any contract being made.
A conference is a meeting at which people
discuss, but do not agree upon anything.
The Prime Minister said that at the coming
conference he would not commit Canada
in the slightest degree to anything. If a
great national question arises in which
the whole Empire is interested, if a great
policy is to be agreed upon, the Prime
Ministers of all the commonwealths which
compose the British nation will meet, in
London or elsewhere, will resolve upon a
policy and come to some understanding,
and will return to their respective parliaments and submit what they believe to
be in the interest of the country. If that

MAY 12, 1921
is approved of by the respective parliaments of the different commonwealths or
dominions, then the Empire, speaking
through the Prime Minister or Cabinet of
Great Britain, will enter into the proposed
relations. That is the only practicable
scheme by which we can make our influence
felt in foreign lands. In the nature of
things, the majority of the nations which
compose this Empire must necessarily prevail.
Not to detain the House longer, I will
come to the reason why I disapprove of
this Bill. The rights and powers conferred
on us by the British North America Act,
which are inelastic and cannot be widened
out by usage, do not permit us to interfere
in any relations with foreign countries
which do not affect us alone. I think that
is a very happy condition for us to be in.
If the fathers of the constitution of the
United States did anything wise, it was to
lay it down that the United States should,
as far as possible, keep themselves untrammelled by relations with people outside this
continent. If we can keep ourselves from
interfering in the relations of the nations
of Europe, so much the better for us. It is
proposed by this Bill that we may discuss
the relations between foreign countries,
quite irrespective of the representatives of
the Empire at large, although we may be
sitting beside them. It seems to me an
absolute contradiction.
It seems to me
utterly impossible. If Canada has no right
to make treaties which will bind the whole
Empire, if Canada bas no right to declare
peace or to declare war, what right can she
have to sit, in an International Court and
settle, or try to settle, disputes which may
lead to war between two other countriesbetween some of those barbarians in southern or middle Europe, for instance? It'is
no business of ours at all in such matters.
They -are not within our constitution, and
we are loading up this country with a large
expense for the maintenance of a Court in
which we have no possible interest in the
world. For that reason I think that we
should leave all these peace courts and
Hague tribunals and Geneva conferences,
and all such matters relating to the League
of Nations, to the Imperial Government, and
we should not interfere at all. If in our
personal relations we have a dispute with
the United States, we settle that easily
enough ourselves. Why we should try to
settle the boundaries between Austria and
Hungary, or between Spain and Portugal,
or between Syria and Palestine, passes my
understanding. It is only creating officers

447

to pay them salaries and spending a lot
of money which we have no right to spend
at all, and in matters in which we should
not interfere.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman if he would carry
his argument a little further, to this point,
that every Act of the Parliament of. Canada is subject to the disallowance of the
King. Does he agree with that?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Every
Act is subject to the disallowance of the
King* in every legislature in every part
of the Dominions, from the Imperial Parliament down. If the honourable gentleman means to ask me whether or not in
my opinion, after the Governor General has
assented to an Act, it may be reserved for
the further consideration of the King and
Council in London, my impression is that
there is technically that right, but it never
was and never will be exercised.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, there is the
Supreme Court.
Hon. WILLIAM PROUDFOOT: Honourable gentlemen, I am rather s'urprised
that members of this House should take
a stand against this Bill. It seems to nie
that the Bill is a highly satisfactory one,
and one which we as Canadians should be
proud to concur in. Why should we not
concur in it? Every action that we take
in international matters, in connection with
the Empire, advances Canada a step towards what may be called nationhood.
I do not know that at the present time
we occupy anything like an inferior position.
My honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) said he did
not approve of the Bill because we might
be called upon to assist in settling the
boundaries between some of the nations in
Europe. Why should we not be called
upon to do that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We have good
surveyors.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Yes.
We
might send my honourable friend to assist
in carrying it out, and I have no doubt
that he would be able to give them a great
deal of valuable information and valuable
assistance if he were called upon. When
we consider the position that Canada took
in the war, when we consider the position
that our representatives took at Geneva

authorities may very well say: "They are

in the world's theatre."' Here is a tribunal
which will be a very important one, and it
is possible that we may have a Canadian

Canada need not blush or feel
asham;d at the stand that our men took
on that occasion. Such being the case, why
should we drop out?-for that would be
the eff ect of our refusal to pass this
measurq. We would simply lose the position wlfih, as I said before, we have
attained through the sacrifice of the blood
of some of our best and bravest men and
by the exipenditure of our vast wealth.
We would lose all that and would simply
go back into -an insignificant place. I say,
honourable gentlemen, that that is not the
stand that we should take. , We should
take the stand that we are asked to take.
We should pass this Act and say that we
are ready to proceed, ready to give all
the assistance that can be given ta this
proposal, ready ta pay whatever may be
necessary, so far as we are concerned, for
the carrying on of the affairs of that
Court; and furthermore, ready, if the
occasion should require it, to send as members of that Court men who will ,ably
represent Canada and be a credit ta Canada and the Empire.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman is an experienced lawyer. Will
he tell us, would it make any difference
whether we joined that Court or not?
Would it make any difference to the Court
or to the Empire?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Certainly it
would.
It would strengthen the Court
very greatly if we joined. Not only would
it strengthen the Court, but, as I said a
few moments ago, if they want able surveyors over there, we could assist them in
that respect.
Hon. Mr. .BEAUBIEN: I must confess
that I am rather surprised at the objections made ta this proposal, and at. the
levity with which in some cases they have
been made. .I am not going to dwela upon
the reasons why we should pass this measure. They are quite obvious. This is a
S-29

441

measure passed by practically every big
nation in the world, and its purpose is to
prevent wars in the future. That is sufficient.
But I would like ta deal in just a few
words with the objections that have been
raised. They are of two kinds: one is a
legal objection and the other is a practical
one.
As ta the iegal objection, I am not surprised ta hear it expounded, as it has been,
by a clear legal mind that follows its
argument ta an absolutely logical conclusion. But my answer ta that is that the
British constitution cannot be follaowed in
a logical way, step by step, from the
premises ta the conclusion. The reason
is quite apparent.
If the British North
America Act has not bèen amended in its
text, has it not been amended in its application? Is it really for us ta complain
because its application has gone beyond
the text? Is it not a fact, honourable
gentlemen, that the world is quickly becoming very small, and that the causes
which threw us into the terrible war that
has just closed may occur again?
Is it true or not that not one voice was
raised at the beginning of the war ta prevent this country from doing its share?
Not one voice. If such conditions were repeated, is it not natural and logical ta
think that we would do the same thing over
again? Should the big nations of the
world consider it of permanent necessity
ta open deep again the arteries of humanity,
would not all those of us who want ta
maintain liberty in this world, let alone
England, speak for one-quarter of the
superficies of this globe and one-fifth of its
population? Are any of you honourable
gentlemen willing that England alone
should have ta decide?
Or do you wish
that the voice of the British Empire
should be composed of the voices of the
Dominions that constitute it?
I want
my honourable friends ta face the question
now. Are they willing that Great Britain
should say, "We are going ta war, and we
shall not consult Canada," or are they
willing ta seize upon the opportunity which
is given to us more and more as the years
go by ta decide what we shall do? Are they
willing ta be still infantile, so ta apeak, as
was the case fifty years ago, or are they
willing ta take now their full share :of
manhood? When the British Empire speaks,
when the Prime Minister of England gives
an answer for ail parts of the Empire,
should he not first of all listen ta the voices

of the component parts of the British
Empire which are gradually becoming nations on the same footing?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Thatis
exactly what he is going to do, as I said:
he will consult our people before he goes to
war.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I said that my
honourable friend from Hamilton had presented his arguments logically but basing
them on the written constitution, and he
has taken absolutely no account of its
modification by the application in a wider
way.
Now, gentlemen, take this Bill: it may
decide peace or it may decide war for us; it
may prevent calamities equal to what we
have had to record. Is any man ready to
stand up in this chamber and say that he
does not want the voice of Canada to be
heard in that court? All the nations of the
world are united there: forty-two of them
were glad and proud to see Canada joining
in this effort. Are any members of this
honourable chamber going to stand up and
say they are not willing that Canada
should join?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Could my honourable friend not trust the British Government to do the right thing by the Empire?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Well, I am indeed surprised. I would not be quite so
surprised if that question had come from
the honourable member for De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain), who has a.method
of treating these large questions with a
great deal of levity; but do I understand
My honourable friend to want to revert
to the old system where we had nothing
to say in the administration of the Empire?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That is just exactly what I want. We were quite
satisfied, and everything was quite satisfactory, under the old system, and all the
talk at the present time of our being a
nation is, to my mind, all rot.
That simply
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
means that the honourablei gentleman prefers Canada to stay as it was fifty years
ago, always in embryo, never growing,
never coming to manhood. He may
choose; it is his concern; but I must
say it is a great disappointment to me to
hear him expressing these views, and I
am surprised that even one member of
this House should hold such views. After
ail, gentlemen, time nasses rapidly, and
Hon. Mr. BEAUBTEN.

even a century is little in the life of a nation. Some day or other in the far future,
when our population is very much larger,
we are destined to be independent-I suppose we are. I am not looking for that day.
As far as that is concerned, I absolutely
share the opinion expressed by the honou-rable gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr.
Turriff): I would like the present state to
remain. I want all the nations of the British Empire to be bound together by an
imponderable but unbreakable tie of sympathy; I am absolutely in accord with
that. But I believe that the Crown should
not stand on only one point of support;
I would like it to stand more and more
on practically all the different independent
nations that compose the Empire, and it
seems to me that never was a better opportunity offered to us than thegBill that
is now under consideration, to establish a
Court of International Justice where quarrels will be decided according to law and
not by the sword. For my part, I would
be proud to see in that Court of Justice a
representative of Canada. That representative could do very much, in my opinion,
to protect our future against embroilments
in the world. If the problems which are
distinctively our own were not explained
and defended in that court we would not
be protected as we should be. It is very
easy to conceive of cases where the interests of Canada should be considered
first in the British Empire. Does my honourable friend from Assiniboia think for
one moment that the statesmen from the
British Isles could better explain a case
than one Canadian-born, brought up here,
having lived his life and breathed our atmosphere, and knowing our problems? If
he thinks that, he has a very small opinion of the kind of men we produce in
Canada; and let me add that that is not the
opinion held in Great Britain and in Europe
at the present time. I believe, therefore,
that we can have no better guardian to
protect us from the embroilments that may
come over the world than a man whom
we shall select to sit on that International
Court of Justice. It seems to me that the
objection from the practical point of view
must be eliminated.
As to the legal objection, if we are
estopped, so to speak, in the exercise of
our liberty, who can complain unless it be
Great Britain? Does she complain that the
power is gradually drifting from her hands
into ours, and into the hands of those who
now represent the different nations which
compose the Empire? No, she is not com-

plaining. On the contrary, she is glad of
that. But honourable gentlemen say,
"Well, the text of the contract, you know,
points to something else." We will agree
with that, and say, "You are quite right,
but the contracting party does not complain; he rather encourages us to go beyond the contract, and we have everything
to gain by doing so." My friend, legally
you are right; but allow us to go beyond
your objection, and te reap the benefit that
comes to us if we do so.
Hon.
Mr. BOSTOCK:
Honourable
gentlemen, I did net take part in the discussion of this question at the commencement, because it seemed to me that when
we agreed to the Treaty of Versailles we
practically endorsed what we are as'ked
to do under this Bill. Clause 14 of that
Treaty gives authority to the countries to
propose this Court of Justice. It reads
as follows:
The Council shall formulate and submit to
the memibers of the League for adoption plans
for the establishment of a permanent Court of
International Justice. The Court shall be competent to hear and deternine any di-spute of an
international character which the parties thereto
submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question
referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.

We agreed to that when we passed the
Treaty,-and this is only another step in the
carrying out of that clause of the Treaty.
I therefore felt that we were committed
to this action, and I think that we are
bound to carry out the clause of the Treaty,
as we agreed te it at that time. I agree
with the other honourable gentlemen who
have addressed the House that Canada
is quite able to take her part in dealing with the question of the selection and recommendation of the representatives of Canada in this International
Court. I think it should be the desire
of everyone that as far as possible we
should take our share in this matter, and
trust that the result of the action now
being taken will be the establishment of
this court, and that the court will be the
means of preventing the nations from going
te war. Of course, honourable gentlemen
will remember that under this arrangemerit
only those nations who signed the Treaty
come under the jurisdiction of this court,
and, as I understand the position, the court
has no arbitrary authority: it cannot compel even those nations who signed the
Treaty to come before it. Only by the consent of the parties can questions come
before the court.
S-291

As to the other question, the relation
to Canada within the Empire, that' has
been se fully discussed to-day that I do
not propose te weary the House by going
into it again.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, when I moved the second reading of this Bill I scarcely anticipated that it would assume the constitutional aspect with which it bas been discussed. I must say that no doubt arose
within my own mind as te the authority
of Canada te enter inte an obligation such
as that contained in the Convention of
the League of Nations, the Bill before us
being a part of the obligation which we
then assumed.
In answer te some of the observations
which have been made to-day, I must say
that I have never been able te feel that
degree of anxiety te which some gentlemen
have given expression, in regard te the
developmnent of Canada's powers as te
treaty-making or other matters of that
kind, for the simple reason that I have
always been under the impression that
Canada's ýreedom, nationally expressed,
was entirely within ber own power. I
venture te say there bas never been a
time, from Confederation down te the
.present moment, when Canada could net
have exacted from Great Britain whatever
freedom she desired in regard te the treatymaking power, or any greater freedom that
she might have wished. In my. judgment,
Canada is as free as any people can possibly be. While we may net possess all
the sovereign rights that Great Britain herself possesses, yet we have all the sovereign
rights by. which we may exercise that
measure of freedom which is common te
any people for their national development.
I have never regarded Canada in any
sense as bound in its national expansion
by the British North America Act. That
Act is simply a legislative pact between
the Federal and the provincial entities that
make up Canada to-day. It is simply an
Act of Confederation by which the old
Canada and the provinces which constituted
the old Canada entered into a pact establishing a Federal authority and a provincial
authority. But that Act did not bound the
national powers of Canada.
My honourable friend from Rideau (Hon.
Mr. Edwards) bas repeatedly askëd,
"What is a nation?" He might as well asi,
what is a free agent? I would ask hM,
-what is a free agent? You can' interprèt
the one as easily as the other. A nation

may be circumscribed, as Canada is, and
in a like manner a free agent may be
circumscribed in his activities.
I would refer my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) to
the first recital of the British North America
Act, because he seems to lament that
Canada does not possess greater powers
than he attributes to it. The recital of the
British North America Act says:

thing else disappears in the face of the
throbbing forces of human nature which
impel the people to play the part of men.
My 'honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) gave us a very interesting address upon the evolution of the
treaty-making power from the day of Confederation down to the present time. Historically he was correct; but I must say
that I view the matter from a different
angle to that of my honourable friend. The

history, and I have flot yet seen any satisfactoxy definition of what constitutes a
nation.
Canada has been developing rapidly
owing to the consciousness of her growth.
It is idle to talk, as the honourable gentlemýan from Assiniboja, (Hon. Mr. Turriff)
bas done, about Canada remaining where
she was. My hoxnourable friend might as
well make up bis mind to remain ilp an
inert condition for the rest of his life as to
talk of Canada remaining inert or passive,
or not assuming any more obligations than
abe bas done in the past. A nation bas
obligations in the same way as an individual has Vbem: it may not ait idly
by and remain unconscious of its national
responsibilities to the rest of the world. We
bave precisely the same responsibilities
as an individual, and the individual who
fails tD recognize bis responsibilities must
simply, like a plant, droop away and die.
So will any nation or any people. If Canada is to grow and is to achieve ber destiny
she must recognize ber responsibilitles and
obligations to otber parts of tbe world, and
must be prepared to assume them. .
Hoùi. Mr. TURRIFF: Canada did not
remain inert during tbe war.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
just reveals tbe consciousness of ber power.
Canada is a youn.g giant, just recognizin-g
tbat she possegses tbe same powers and
the same forces possessed by other nations
of the world; recognizin-g that she bas a
destiny equal to that of the grea'test nations of this or any other continent. Wbeýn
we became a member of the League of
Nations it was sim.ply another-evidence of
the conscious growtb wbicb entails national responsibility.
Wben the Peace
Conference was being beld in Versailles,
Canada recognized tbat sbe had to become
a member of tbe League of Nations. Wbat
was it that induced Canada to become a
member of the League but a sense of ber
importance and ber responsibility in tbe
future? Do bonourable gentlemen expect
Canada to remain in a state of tutelage
for tbe rest of ber days? Is it to be said
that we have not conceived her destiny?
I am prepared to say that the time will
corne when Canada will have to assume
even
greater responsibilities-responsibilities just as great as tbose of Great
Britain herseif. The time will corne when
Canada will be as important as Great
Britain, and wben the population of the
northern hall of this continent will be as
great as, or will exceed, that of Great

Britain. We must look forward to the
day wben Canada will ibe &~ sovereign
Power on this continent, with the ýrigbt of
asserting ber power in any way.
As my bonourable friends who have
spoken in favour ci the Bill have pointed
out, the Bill la a most commendable one.
Lt would be difflenît, it seerns to me, for
the Parliament of Canada, or for any otber
body of people, recognizing, our responsib1lties, to say that we sbould not become
a party to endeavouring in every conceivable way to maintain tbe peace of
the world. This is a business wbich. we
do not want to do tbrough Great Britain
wben we bave a consciousness of our
ability to do it, and consequently Canada
proposes to becorne a party to this Court
of Internationval Justice. I have no doubt,
honourable gentlemen, that this Bill, notwithstanding the comnments wbich have
been made and the criticisms to which it
bas been subjected, will receive the unanimous support of tbe Cbamber.

It ha been found
that tbe use of narcoties is growing very
considerably.
Tbe evils proceeding from

of the community, and therefore I have

SENATE
NATIONAL RESEARCH BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 116, an Act to
amend the Research Council Act and to
establish a National Research Institute.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
does not deal with an entirely new subject.
We already have upon the statute book
legislation touching the subject of scientific
research. During the war an Advisory
Council, somewhat similar in plan to that
established in Great Britain, was formed in
Canada. That Council was made up largely
of representatives from the different universities and educational institutions of
Canada; it was under the Chairmanship
of Dr. McCallum, who bas since separated
himself from this work so far as the
Government of Canada is concerned, and
has entered upon other fields.
It is now thought desirable to enter in
a much larger way than heretofore into
scientific and industrial research, the necessity of which has become more apparent
since the close of the war. Our attention
bas been directed to the operation of
similar legislation in almost all countries,
particularly in England, where the different
industrial activities have in their own behalf established research organizations.
Science bas made wonderful progress
within the last generation, probably more
especially since the war, and the necessity
for the application of scientific methods
to all our manufacturing and industrial
activities is being recognized more and
more every day.
The Bill may be said to be divided into
two ýparts: one dealing with the Council,
and the other dealing with the practical
means of carrying out national research.
A substantial sum bas, I believe, been
placed in the Estimates of the present
year, with the anticipation of expending it
in the establishment of a National Research
Institute in Ottawa, as provided in the
Bill.
I forbear going further into this matter,
because I know some honourable gentlemen
in this Chamber have been giving considerable attention to the subject; and
when I can induce honourable gentlemen
to take up subjects of this kind, I recede
with alacrity from the position of strongly
urging the Bill which I may present. My
honourable friend from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) hàs given a good
deal of attention to this subject, and I
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

know that he is prepared to address the
House upon it. I move the second reading
of the Bill.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, the honourable leader of the
House is very kind in saying that I have
devoted a great deal of time to research on
this matter, and the statement is quite true.
I believe this is one of the best moves that
the Government could possibly make. They
are only followinge the example of other
countries engaged in scientific research.
Much as we dislike Germany in many respects, there is certainly one way in which
we might, for the good of our country,
follow the German methods of thoroughnesà and of developing things that already
exist. As honourable gentlemen are aware,
the Germans have invented very few things,
but the things that have been inventedfor instance, the dyes in England--were
taken over to Germany and perfected there.
Illuminating gas was invented in France.
And I rnight enumerate other things. The
Germans do not invent, but, with their
thoroughness, they take the thing that
has been invented and perfect it and turn
it to commercial use, with the help of
large subsidies from the Government, and
with any amount of protection that may
be needed. Before the war they were
invading the world, and if they had waited
for a little time, ne one can predict what
might have happened.' If they had waited
a few years they might have captured the
trade of the world, not only with their dyes,
but also with drugs and medicines. They
were producing drugs that cost next to
nothing-that were worth one cent and
were selling at a dollar in every drug
store. The drug stores, I am told by my
neighbour (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), are full
of such drugs to-day; and they were before
the war.
There is any amount of work that can
be done by the Department of Scientific
Research. The fuel problem is staring us
in the face. As you know, there is no
coal in central Canada. Gasoline also is
all being imported from the United States.
Then there is industrial alcohol, then motor
alcohol, then lignite in briquettes, and sawmill waste, and liquid oxygen, and explosives, and fertilizer. There is fertilizer
made by high pressure. There are the aids
to navigation. Sailing ships, we find, are
coming back owing to the high price of
coal. Sawdust is used as cattle-feed.. It

has been used in Germany for a long turne,
and is being used now, and successfully
in America.
Canada's total production cf coaI is 14,000,000 tons, valued at $55,000,000; whereas we import frein the United States 17,000,000 tons, of which four millions are
anthracite, representing a value of $61,000,000.
The coal we gei from the
United States is cheaper than the coal
we produce in Canada. That should not
be. And we are paying oui good m~oney

it contains, especially if the windows have

If turne permitted, I would tell you about

by-products I have here a list of nô less

I arn indeobted for this list-and it is the
second that he has been good enough to
give-to Mr. de Gaspé Beaubien, brother
af the hououîable gentleman from. Montaiville, who during the war came forward
and at his own expense, without subsidy,
staîrted a dye factory. As you know, dyes
were not; being exported Ürom Gerrnany and
they were not; ranufactured in the United
States. No dyes could be had. Mr. Beaubien succeeded in making some colours. I
arn told he succeeded in making a veiy
good black; and, strange ta, say, the black
was made with benzol, which .js absolutely
white. He mnust be an ingenlous chemist
ta 'be able ta change white into black, as
he did.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
difficulty is ta change black into white.
HEon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If honourable
gentlemen had the tirne ta look at this
list they would see what a mass of Wonderfui things there are in the products derived froin coal. You wouid find saccharine, sweeter than sugar, in the list cf
by-products; you *ould fina aspirin; you
would -find even perfume for the ladies.
The basis of the finest perfume can be extracted froin coal.

Hon. Mr. BLAIN: Is niy hon =uale'
friend going to put the list on Hansard?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I arn afraid
that it would be too bullcy to place it on
Hansard, but it would be very valuable.
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It would be
extremely useful. I *Was unfortuniate
enough to lose one of those liste, and if
it hail fot been for the kindness of the
brother of the honourable Senator froin
Montarville (Hion. Mr. Beaubien), I wouid
not have been able to refresh rny menxory.
It wlll be seen by this list that one of the
greatest things we can get from coal is
gas liquor, which makes any quantity of
ammonia, which, as you know, is the very
basis of ail the best fertilizers. If it is the
desire of the House, I shall be only too
happy to place the list on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That is a list
of the by-products of coal, is it?
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: A list cf the
by-products of coal. I have counted them,
and if niy addition is right there are 102
in this list.

It may surprise honourable gentlemen
to learn (that coal bas become too dear
te he used in cargo boats to-day. Much as
I admire our Canadian Marine, and much
as I favor the building of -steamships, stili
1 have to admit that cargo boats are today operated at a loss. I do nlot make that
statement on my own authority; I 'have
right here the proof, if anybody wishes to
challeinge -any of my state!ments. My authority is the Chamber of Shipping of the
United Kingdom. This year, they say, only
a few steamships are operated at a profit,
and it is at a very small profit, and more
and more ships are being o.perated at
heavy losses. Take for instance a 10,000it will consume
ton ship, a freighter;
roughly speaking, about 1 ton of coal an
hour, which ineans 24 tons a day. That
quantity of coal at the current price, which
wouid be, I suppose, about $10 a ton,
would cost $240 a day. No freigliter can
afi'ord that expense. The Chamber of Shipp.ing of the United Kingdom go Ion to say
that at present frei'ghters are not earning enough to pay for the coal, neot to mention the interest on the ship or the wages
of the crew.
0f course, the use of steam will continue
for fast freight and passenger boats; but
the use of sailing ships for long Voyages
Hon. Mr. CASGuRAIN.

is becoming more profitable. Before the
war, in normal times-for instance, about
15 years ago-ali freight rates were fixed.
by the price of coal at the place to w.hich
the goods were going. If a cargo was sent,
we will say, to the west coast of South
America, the price of coal was governed
by the price at which coal could be got
at Punta Arenas, which is, as you know,
at the west end of the Magellan Straits.
There were coal boats, some from Aijstralia, some from England, waiting there al
the year round so as to be able to supply
coal to ships needing it at that place. An
accident might have happened to a sh-ip,
or it might have been delayed, or it might
not -have taken on enough coal, or might
At whatever
,have encountered storms.
')rice coal was selling at Punta Arenas,
that price was immediately quoted in London, England, and throughout the world.
It was found to be worth while to have a
ship start fromn England with coal as part
of its cargo, in order that it might corne
back with some of that coal rather than
have to pay the outrageous prices. When
I say "outrageous prices," I mean 30 or
40 shillings-which is nothing as compared
with the prices prevailing to-day.
"But," honourable gentlemen may say,
"these sailing ships are too slow." The late
fifties were the clipper ship era. There was
then no need for worry as to speed. To
give you one instance, the Flying Cloud
sailed from New York for San Francisco
in 1851. It travelled 5,912 miles at an average rate of 91 knots an hour, and covered
the remaining 1,256 miles at the rate of 12ý
knots an hour. Mind you, that ship was
going in the wrong direction for speed, for
it was going westward, and, as we ail know,
the prevailing wînds, especially around the
Hor, are ail from west to east; they are
ahl western winds, and there are terrible
storms encountered in rounding Cape
Not-withstanding this, the Flying
Hor.
Cloud made that wonderful voyage in less
than 30 days. No tramp steamer bas ever
made that distance in anything like that
time. Not long afterwards another ship,
called the Lightning, in a gale, went 436
milesin one day-a speed equal to 18 or 18A
knots an hour. To-day we could improve
on that. We have steel for the bull and
for the mast, and wire ropes for ail standing and running gear, and finer lines for
the ships. The old wind-jammer, the old
square rigger, could sail only 6 points to
the wind. Those who understand navigation know that that is almost equal to
going with a beam wind. When you are

MAY 12, 1921
going 6 points to, the wind you are 67l
degrees from the wind, and naturally the
ship must make a 'great deal of leewayso much leeway that a ship of that kind
will go 12 miles to gain one mile to windward. If it makes one tack of 12 miles,
another tack of 12 miles, it goes 24 miles
and gets only 2 miles to windward. But
the fore-and-aft, which is what is called
the schooner rig, just like a foiVr-masted
or five-masted schooner, will go, it is
claimed, 4 points to the wind. That makes
ail the difference in the world in regard
te leeway. When it is gding 4 points to the
wind it is at an angle of 45 degrees te
the wind; consequently the leeway is very
much less, and in covering exactly the same
distance by a tack of 12 miles and another
tek of 12 miles, it would make 171 miles
of headway towards the wind; it would
get 171 miles to W'indward. Those new
ships-I have a design of them herewould be equipped with a small Diesel
engine, net primarily for the purpose of
propelling the ship, but in order to provide
power for hoisting the sails and furnishing
leight. The only objection to the fore-andaft rigging was the fact that those great,
big sail, the mainsail and the foresail and
the others, five of them in a row, were sO
unwieldy that it was almost impossible
without carrying a big crew to hoist one
of them up 80 feet from the boom to the
throat. It took a great number .of men.
Therefore these new ships have a separate
motor and a drum for each halyard and
also for each sheet, and, according to this
new design, the man at the wheel, simply
by turning a switch, can hoist or lower.
These big sails, that were se unwieldy,
have now been eut into two halves, the
upper and the lower. The lower on1e is put
up, and if the ship needs more sail the
other one is just set like an ordinary topsail, along the peak of the lower 011e;
.From, the report entitled, "Transactions
of the Engineers and Shipbuilders of Scotland," February, 1921, I take these statemenits regarding the abaclute necessity cf
turning back: te the sailing ships, on account
of the high price 'of coal.
Mr. P. 0.
Lilj'egren studied with Herreshoif, the great
yacht designer cf America. Before the
engineers and shipbuilders cf Scotland ha
proved that with machine-driven ships the
cost was gteater than the earni1*s and
that this condition would prevail for an indefinite period. Steamships were possible
when fuel was cheap; but, according to al
the authurities that you can find, according
ta our own Research Bureau, the day cf

457

cheap fuel is gone forever. It may ha surprising te hear of the return of sailing
shijbs, but such is the fact. Honourable
members cf this House may be surprised ta
learn that for some years there has beau in
Bostoi a company owning about 20
schooners, fore-and-aft riga, four-masted
and five-masted schooners, and they are
doing a thriving business. We knew that
the steam 'freighters, or machine-driven
boats, are starving. Everybody knows that
until 1842 the sailing ship reigned supreme.
There were no steamn freighters until 1842,
but in 1845 steam-driven vessaIs began ta
break even, because then thera was a
period of very cheap fuel. For some reason
fuel again went up in price and the sailing vessel came back. It was only in 1879,
you will find, that steam vessaIs came ta the
fore for good, and fuel was cheap from then
until the outbreak of the war. Now tha
price of fuel is altogether teo high; but
remember one thing, honourable gentlemen,
that if the prica of fuel has gona up, the
price cf wind is not changed; it is still the
same as in the fifties, when sailing was at
its best. Westward around Cape Hern
ships would go 13 and 15 knots to the China
Seas, leaving the freighters far, far behind. To-day, with the new design, we can
do much better. Now, the design of tha
five-masted ship is not; a new design at all.
It is the ordinary fore-and-aft. All those
Who have lived on the shores of the Great
Lakes have seen these four and five-masted
schooners and know them parfectly well.
If you go to the Atlantic coast you sea tham.
thare also, only thesa have beau made, as I
said, more perfect, and the sails are eut
into upper and Iower halvas.
I might mention that in Vancouver, during the war, I and some others built 9 wooden
sailing ships, with 2 small Diesel engines
of about 160 herse power each: they wera
8,300 tons. That was quite big aneugh
for the lumber trade, because it appears
that there is ne part of the world whare
more than 1,000,000 feet cf lumber is
wanted at oe tima fer oe yard, and it
would be cf ne use ta have the ships any
bigger. At any rate, a couple of cargees
were *sent te Australia, and the trip from
Vancouver to Sydney, Australia, was made
in 52 days. The ships would have sailad
much better if they had had feathered propellars, but unfortunately thay could net
have them. Moreover they have ta keap
the propellers geing pretty much aIl the
time, se as te offer s0 much résistance.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND FREIGHT
RATES
DISCUSSION

AND INQUIRY

Hon. B. C. PROWSE rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the unfavorable conditions affecting the
Province of Prince Edward Island at the present
time in connection with our most important product in the form of the large amount of potatoes
on hand at the present time which cannot be
shipped on account of the prohibitive freight
rates.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Also the prohitbitive freight rates on cordwood,
which made it impossible during the past winter,
when coal could not be obtained from the mines,
and the poor class were unable to obtain wood
for fuel, with which our Province is dotted, and
inquire if .t is the Intention of the Government
to take any action with regard thereto?

He said: Honourable gentlemen, before
proceeding to inquire of the Government
for certain information, I desire to apologize for occupying the precious time of this
honourable House. I will make my remarks
as plain and as short as I can. But the
conditions on the Island are so serious in
a way that it is necessary to draw the
attention of the House to the prohibitive
freight rates on our potatoes. We have
to-day in the province hundreds of thousands, I may say millions, of bushels of
surplus potatoes which, on account of the
prohibitive freight rates, cannot be shipped.
We have, on the other hand, the markets
of New Glasgow, Amherst, Halifax, the
Sydneys, and Newfoundland, if we can
only get the rates down to a normal level.
Cars are going up to the Sydneys and New
Glasgow loaded with coal, and they are
hauled back absolutely empty. The only
extra charge in filling these cars, would be
for the few extra pounds of coal that would
be used. The crews are paid just the
same, and they are expensive crews. The
railways and the cars are there, and the
cars all go back to the mines empty,
although the miners want our potatoes.
Potatoes to-day can be bought in the province of Prince Edward Island for 17 cents
per hundred pounds. The freight rate on
potatoes to Sydney is 43 cents.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is the distance?
Hon. Mr. PROWSE: I am not quite
sure, but it is about twelve hours' run.
I would ask the honourable leader of this
House to take up the matter with the
Minister of Railways. I would ask also for
the co-operation of the Minister of Labour,
who, I know, is as much interested in this
matter as any of us. I know he is interested in reducing the high cost of living,
and I do not know of any way in which
it could be done more quickly.
Another matter, honourable gentlemen,
is the question of cordwood. From one end
of Prince Edward Island to the other, along
the whole line of railway, cordwood is avail-

459

MAY 13, 1921
able. You can hardly go more than a
quarter of a mile without finding birchwood
that is good for fuel. Last year, when it
was impossible to get coal from the mines,
we could flot get the wood hauled into the
towns, because of the prohibitive freight
rates. The only w,çay we could get it In
was to, have the farmerê haul it in.
On Prince Edward Island cars are going
back and forward empty, the same crews
handling them as if they were loaded.
There is no doubt whatever, honourable
gentlemen, that the sooner we get a management of the Prince Edward Island railway that is conversant with local affairs
the better it will be. A Prince Edrward
Island railway cannot be managed from
Toronto by a Toronto man.- It cannot be
nianaged from Moncton. It is necessary to
have a mian who is thoroughly familiar with
the local conditions on Prince Edward
Island.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
thority.

And give him au-

Hon. Mr. PRO WSE: Let me tell you
this further, honourable gentlemen. I am
a business man and know something about
business on Prince Edward Island, and
there is no doubt in my mind that the
Prince Edward Island railway can be mad~
to pay, and pay well, if it is only handled
properly. But it is not rnanaged in the
interests of the people, nor in a business
way in any respect. In a few years, il
present conditions continue-if you make
the rates absolutely prohibitive-the only
thing that the Prince Edward Island railway wil11 be good for will be the pasturing
of sheep.
I do not desire to take up too much
timeHon. Mr. CLORAN: Take aIl the time
you want.
Hon. Mr. PROWSE :-but I niay not be
out of order in saying right here that in
the honourable leader of this House (Hon.
Sir James bougheed) the people of Prince
Edward Island consider they have a friend,
and à warrn friend; and I know that when
you corne to Prince Edwaid Island, if you
should ever corne down. there, sir, you wilI
find a very warrn reception. I can say,
honourable gentlemen, that on more than
one occasion the honourable leadEr has
stepped out of his way to do little sets of
kindness and to see justice done to the
Province that I have the honour to represent. 1 refer, honourable gentlemen, to the

*100,000 that could have been vetoed, but

that the little province got, and got for al
time to come. I can tell you we appreciate that. Down on the Island we have not
the Crown lands; we have not the sources
of revenue that the other, larger provinces
have. The littie acts, of kindness done to
the little Province of Prince Edward Island
are appreciated.
Another instance was when he settled for
ahl time to corne the representation of the
littie Province. He could have said: $'No,
gentlemen, we will let the British North
America Act stand as it is-as -the fathers
of Confederation made it." But he said:
'.No, gentlemen: there has been an injustice
done to the Province and I arn going to have
it set right." Do you think our people in
that little Province have f orgotten that?
No, sir; and they will not forget it. And
I want to ask him this time to interview
the Minister of Railways, with the Minister
of Labour, and see if there cannot be sorne
relief granted with respect to the freight
rates on Prince Edward Island.
In conclusion I beg to submit a unanimous resolution of the Prince Edward
Island Legisiature:
Whereas an unusually large quantity Of
pdtatoes are at present In our farmers' cellar"
awaiting shipment;
And whereas the ýfreight charges are greater
to our Canadian markets than the prIce offered
for this produot;
And whereas on account of the season It ls
Impossible now to feed any considerable quantlty
of this product to live L -ock,
And whereas, If Immediate r2lief Is flot forthcoming in the nature of a substantial reduction
in freight, great loss will ensue to the Province,
and a ýdisaster to those who have large stock
still on hand:
And whereas under existing circuinstances it
is impossible to transact any business, afid the
rilways are suffering with the farmers through
the loss incurred by this condition;
Therefore resolved that tbis Legisiature would
strongly urge upon the Mlnister of Railways the
necessity o? immediately reducing the rate oni
potatoes at least one-third until the 15th day
of June to enabie our farruers to dispose of this
surplus food produict.
Benjamin Gallant.
Walter M. Lea,
Commissioner of Agriculture.

Hon. P. C. MURPHY: 1 will supplement only slightly what has been. so well
said*by my good friend frorn Charlottetw. We have 1,000,000 bushels of
The people in Ottawa and
potapoes.
Toronto are paying a dollar a bushel for
Island
potatoes, but in Prince Edward
they can be bought for 20 cents a bushel.
At that price a carload of 500 bushels
would cost only $100; but it costs $815
to get them to the point of distribution.
There is something wrong under these

460

SENATE

conditions. It is an injustice to the buying public, and it is an injustice to the
people who produce these goods and have
to ship them to the points of distribution.
We were paying 70 cents a bushel for
potatoes last fall.
We were shipping
them largely to Boston; but it takes as
much to get them to Boston, in a twodays' haul, after six months' hard work.
There is something wrong. As the honourable gentleman says, the prohibitive
rates are an injustice to the producer,
and an injustice to the labouring man who
has to buy the potatoes by the peck.
As has been very well said by the honourable Senator from Charlottetown, we
have our cars running half empty most of
the time, when they might just as easily
The situation

seems to be similar to what was so well
demonstrated to us the other day in Quebec, with its terminals, and a 2,000,000bushel elevator that must have cost unto.ld money-a warehouse 1,000 feet long
with nothing in it but a little pulp, and
all the cars running from Vancouver to
Montreal, Quebec, St. John and Halifax
half empty. It would seem to me that
there should be some means of remedying
this situation. Even if you were losing
money for a while, you would be furnishing employment for labour at the distribution point, and you would be taking
goods, even our potatoes, back to Montreal
and to Toronto and giving them to the
labour people at a lower price than they
are now paying, and would enable them
to work for less and -be better satisfied
with -their lot.
Another question referred to by my houourable friend from Charlottetown was that
of our cordwood. We had an extremely low
rate on cordwood; and it was necessarily
low. Our province is dotted throughout
with the second growth of wood. We were
embargoed to a certain extent. The rail
shipment of coal was not allowed while the
ports were open and vessels could get up
to Montreal and relieve the conditions That
might have been necessary, but the rates
on cordwood were 'increased to such an
extent that it would cost twice as much as
the cordwood originally cost for the carrying of the 6 or 8 cords that our small cars
contain. The freight for carrying cordwood
fifteen miles from where I live was twice as
much as the original cost of the wood. That
made it absolutely prohibitive for poor
people.
As bas been very well said by my honourable friend from Charlottetown, there
Hon. P. C. MURPHY.

should be on the ground a man who is able
to deal with the situation. Mr. Hanna may
be a good man. I do not want to find any
fault with him. I have my own ideas, as
a railway man, about those so-called experts
who, as I said the other day, are endeavoring to classify and catalogue things in their
own way. But, as has been said by my
honourable friend, *a man on the ground
knows the conditions better. There should
be some way to harmonize matters so that,
as Sir Thomas White would say, they
might synchronize with local conditions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, Parliament is the proper
place to ventilate grievances of this kind,
and I am very glad my honourable friend
from Charlottetown (Hon. Mr. Prowse)
and also my honourable friend from Tignish
(Hon. Mr. Murphy) have directed the attention of this House to this grievance. It is
another feature of the railway situation.
The trouble with the railways does not
seem to be limited in any particular direction. Apparently it bas extended to Prince
Edward Island. I was under the impression
that Prince Edward Island was absolutely
free from any difficulties of this kind, but
apparently it is not.
However, it seems to me that the Government is not blameable in this matter.
We have a Railway Board with jurisdiction
to fix freight rates throughout the whole
Dominion, and if the provincial authorities
in Prince Edward Island, or the merchants
or the individuals in that province, would
choose to invoke the Railway Act, they
have the right to set in motion an inquiry
by the Railway Commission to adjust this
difficulty. I would suggest to my honourable
friend that he make use of the statutory
authority which is vested in that Commission; that their attention be directed to the
grievance that he bas so well pointed out;
and I have no doubt that the Railway Commission will be very glad to redress the
difficulty under which the people of Prince
Edward Island, with their potatoes, are
labouring.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: How long will that
take? What will become of the potatoes
in the meantime?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is no other way of doing it.
Hon. Mr. PROWSE: May I say to the honourable leader that that has been done
already, and we have got no satisfaction.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The potatoes will
rot in the cellars.

ment that when the incentive to really
conserve our natural resources became
sufficiently strong it would result in the
expansion, the growth, the development of
the activities of the Commission, and that
it must necessarily overlap the departments of Government that were then
charged and were afterwards more fully
charged with giving practical effect to
those same purposes.
This Commission became active immediately after its organization, although it
was intended that it should have a very
modest staff and should confine its activities to a comparatively narrow compass.
The Minister of Agriculture of that day
pointed out to the House that it would
probably cost about $10,000 or $12,000 a
year, and that it was desirable that this
fund should be placed in the Estimates
for the purpose of bringing together to
one common centre the various influential
persons who occupied honorary positions
on the Commission. The staff was to
consist of, I think, three clerks and two
typists, and, with that very modest staff, the
Commission was to begin business and was
to interest various influential citizens, notably Lieutenant-Governors, and men of
that class, throughout the whole Dominion
in order to assure the conservation of the
natural resources of this great country.
It was the intention, honourable gentlemen, to excite an active interest throughout the Dominion in the carrying out of
the objects which the conference held in
the United States had in view; and it was
thought that a body made up of representative citizens, some fifteen or twenty
in number, would be a very effective organization. Consequently, under those very
happy auspices the Commission proceeded
to carry out the activities which had been
outlined in the statute.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Who was the
first Chairman?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
the Hon. Clifford Sifton was the first
Chairman. He retired from the Commisston
shortly after.
Just here may I point out, in regard to
the similar legislation in the United States,
that it became apparent immediately after
the formation of their organization it could
not run along lines parallel with the activities of the administrative Government
in that country. Consequently, after the
first or second year, the Conservation Commission of the United States went out of
being as a Government activity, and became an organization supported by that
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

section of the public that was interested
in work of that particular kind. Consequently, the same difficulty which we were
called upon to face later did not confront
the United States in the activities of their
Conservation Commission, inasmuch as it
became practically a public organization
outside of the control of the Government.
The organization in Canada, however,
began to extend its activities into many
branches until it threatened to absorb the
Government itself. It was something like
the seven lean kine in Joseph's dream: it
had almost swallowed the seven fat kine.
Before long it had invaded the following
spheres of activity of the different Dominion departments: In Agriculture: fertilizers,
farm and county surveys, demonstration
farms, and animal health.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Town planning.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It
eûtered upon external affairs, making independent representations to and before
International Joint Commissions, and by
publicity propaganda which has at times
confused the settled policy of the different
departments in connection with international problems. It invaded the field of
the Department of the Interior in regard
to water-powers, stream flow, forestry,
wild life, natural resources inventory and
information. It then cast its eyes abroad
and saw a field of usefulness in the Marine
and Fisheries Department, and made
representations on the depletion of the
sockeye salmon in British Columbia at a
time when the question had been dealt

satisfied with operating on the surface of
the earth, it went below it, and took up
the question of mines, and dealt with
coal, peat, pulverized fuel, gas, mineral
fertilizers, and mineral resources survey.
It entered the field upon which my honourable friend yesterday delivered a very
interesting address, namly, scientific and
industrial research, and proceeded to take
up the fuel problem of Western Canada,
the briquetting of lignites, the utilization
of fish waste, and so on.
The cost of the Commission began to
mount up from the small sum of about
$12,000, mentioned by the Minister of
Agriculture at the time he introduced the
Bill, until it bas, since its inception down
to the present time, averaged something
like $104,000 per annum.
The staff of
three or four clerks and a couple of typists
increased, and there bas been spent by
the Commission upon salaries of staff over

that may be found therein, you will very.
likely be involved in a further expenditure
of a very considérable sum. of money. In
the printing of reports and the publication
of publicity propaganda the Commission
bas expended over $280,480. The expenditure for the last year-I think this is the
fiscal year ending March, 1920, but I will
net be positive of that-reaches the very
handsome sum of $4e'55,771.31 which is
made up as follows:

The growth of the Commission at this
ratio of progreps would very soon outstrip
the expenditure the Government of Canadp
îe making upon the different deparbmental
activitiee whieh have always 'been carried
on, and which cover the samne class of work.
I do not refer to the activities of the
Commission in any critical or hostile way.
I simply point out what is the logical
sequence of creating an organization and
giving it aut}hority when it cannot be controlied. or restrained by any Minister of
the Crown inasmuch as it is only responsible to Parliament. This Commission is
not controlled by any Department. It
makes use of the Minister of Agriculture
as the channel through whom its desires
and reprçsentatiens reach the Government.

46:

But in a sense it is a law unto itself. With
ail due regard to the work done by the
Commission and to the ability of the staff,
I must say that the position is subversive
of a very well established principle of Governuient. That is to say, the members of
its staff are flot responsible to any Minister,
and therefore are flot responsible to the
Government. The Government cannot satieifactorily control any authority which is
flot responeible to a Minister. In fact, it
is a fundamental principle of representative Government that responsibility must
vest in a Minister. The Minieter is responsible to the Government, and the
Government is responsible to Parliament. Consequently we have been forced
to recognize that some step muet be
taken to prevent a duplication of the
work which is being carried on by
the various Departments to which I
have already referred. That duplication
of, work, as honourable gentlemen will
readily understand, will become intensified
as time, goes on, because we have the departmental branches ana the Conservation
Commission endeavouring ito out-rival each
other .in the saine field of action. The
more eager they are in the race, the greater
the expenditure becomes until in due course
it would overwhelm the exchequer of the
country.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it the intention of the Government to make that valuable iibrary part of the Parliamentary
Library so- that we would have access to it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is no reason why that should not be done.
May I cite some illustrations, honourable
gentlemeni, so that your minds may be duly
impressed with the necessity of the Government taking action along the line which I
have indicated? We 'quite recognize that
once an activity of this kind becomes established, it is very difficult to interfere with
it, and there should be good reason for dispensing with it.
Since its inception until March Slst, 1921,
the Commission of Conservation bas cost
the Dominion of Canada an average of over
$104,000 per annum.
There bas been spent by the Commission
upon salaries of staff over $610,900.
The travelling expensés of the Commission have cost approximately $115,600.
The library of the Commission bas cost
about $24,000.
On the printing of reports, publications
and publicity propaganda the Commission
bas expended over $280,400.

SENATE
The Commission has duplicated the work
and invaded the spheres of activity of the
following Dominion departments:
Fertilizers, Farm and
Agriculture:
County Surveys, Demonstration Farms,
Animal Health.
External Affairs: Independent representations to and before the International
Joint Commission and by publicity propaganda which has at times confused the
settled policy of the different departments
in connection with International problems.
Interior: Water Power, Stream Flow,
Forestry, Wild Life, Natural Resources Inventory and Information.
Marine and Fisheries: Representations
on the depletion of the Sockeye Salmon in
British Columbia at a time when the question had been dealt with by international
negotiation.
Mines: Coal, Peat, Pulverized Fuel, Gas,
Mineral fertilizer, Mineral Resources Survey.
Research Council: Fuel Problems of
Western Canada, Briquetting of Lignites,
Utilization of Fish Waste.
The Commission, through a carefully
thought out system of publicity propaganda, has made a determined effort to
obtain for itself credit for practically all
work relative to Canadian natural resources, generally ignoring the constructive
work done by the permanent governmental
organizations and in many cases claiming
credit for this work, to the detriment, in
the eyes of the public, of the organization
which bas been responsible for its actual
accomplishment.
By the establishing of the Department of
Health in 1919, the Government may be
considered to have adjudged that matters
of public health hitherto dealt with by the
Commission are now outside the functions
of that body, and to have created a precedent which should lead to a like absorption of the functions of the Commission
into the cognate responsible Departments.
The publication, "Fertilizers and their
uses in Canada," issued by the Commission
of Conservation, is a pamphlet written by
the Dominion Chemist, an officer of the Department of Agriculture. This subject
had repeatedly been dealt with by Dr.
Shutt, in the annual reports of the Experimental Farm atd also orally before the
House of Commons Committee on Agriculture.
In the matter of utilization and briquetting of lignites the Commission of Conservation clearly invaded a field whieh was
inaugurated by the Mines Branch, and
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

reported upon by the Advisory Council
for Industrial and Scientifie Research, and
now under the jurisdiction of the Department of Mines, which is carrying on the
work as authorized by Parliament.
Since 1913 the Commission of Conservation has spent large sums of public zmoney
on forest surveys in different provinces
and in research work relating to non-agricultural and cut-over pulp lands. These
surveys are entbodied in five lengthy reports, the work of but two or three men
over two, three, or four seasons. Large
portions of the volumes are, however,
duplication of material provided by responsible forestry departments.
Since 1907 Canada has had a Dominion
Forestry Branch under the Minister of
the Interior performing with its personnel
(500 at this time) of rangers, trained
foresters and experts a national work
covering scientific investigations, fire protection, and a forest products laboratory.
The evidence shows that an irresponsible
organization such as the Commission of
Conservation has no need to invade the
field of the above-mentioned branch and
duplicate its work at the public expense.
Coal mining administration in the
prairie provinces is a function of the
Minister of the Interior. The commission
initiated an entirely unnecessary conference of officers of the two prairie
provinces and of the Dominion Department
of the Interior interested in mining administration questions. At this meeting,
convened in Ottawa at considerable expense, certain round-table discussions was
had, following which general resolutions
were passed and given wide publicity.
The interested officials of the Interior Department were not asked to state whether
or not the resolutions referred to were
practicable, whether they could be incorporated in existing regulations or otherwise, or further, whether the object which
the Conservation Commission was advocating, namely, the curtailment of the excessive waste in mining coal in Western
Canada, could not be secured by some other
indirect method with the co-operation 'of
the Dominion and Provincial officials interested.
The activities of the Commission of Conservation as related to the Water Power
Branch were:
(a) The Commission in its "Power Survey of Canada" is endeavouring to duplicate one of the functions of the responsible investigatory body, viz., the Water
Power Branch, and uses the first-hand
data of this body.

MÀ(Y 18, 1921
(b) In the rnatter of the work of the
Commission re "Water Powers of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta," there was no
justification for the reprinting in an ex-,
pensive volume material, of which 75 per
cent was original data of the Water Power
Branch, and stili less in printing on the
report as co-author the namne of the
Director of the Branch without his knowledge.
(c) 0f tihe 650 pages in the "Water
Powers of British Columbia," 133 pages
are a direct copy of hydrometric survey
information already published iby the Dominion Water Power Branch.
Moreover
"this volume, which wili contribute an
authoritative and standard work for many
years,," will, according to the opinion of
the responsible Branch, stand considerable
revision.

(d) The gathering of stream fiôw and
water level data is a function of the Department of the Interior and it is a waste
of public funds for an outside irresponsible body to attempt this work especially
since the responsible departmnent bas had
staffs in the field engaged for years in
carrying it out.
The Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Mines may be regarded as the
logical and actual custodians of the greater
portion of the natural resources of the Dominion. These Departments have been and
are responsible for the investigation, development and exploitation of these rçstources.
Through careful organization
they have been able to attain their objective
by evolving into a closely-related whole,
built up through the formation of a number
of branches' constituted for the purpose of
.administering these functions to the best
national advantage.
Concurring in -the precedent already
,established by the'Government in the transfer of that portion of the work of the Com-mission of Conservation relating to Public
Health to, the Departinent of Hpalth, suailar action should be taken with reference
to ail phasesi of the work of the Commission.

Extract from explanation given by Comnmission of Conservation'in regard to its
estimates for the year 1919-20, page 1:
An enormous amount of such information has
-already
been gathered, inasmuch as one of the
principal duties of the -Coinmiss!on since its Inception has been to make an !nventory of the
natoural resources of Canada. This, however,
must be kept up to date, mnust be supple.mented
by additional data yet to be secured through
field work and from department'il archives and
must be compiled and publishAd in a convenient
readaible f6rmn for the man who contemplates
risklng bis capital In developing these resources.
It le proposed to Issue a portion of the Directory
of Natural Resources during the fiscal year
1919-20 at an estimated cost of $20,000, for
whlch a new vote will be necessary.

The Departmeiit of the Interior, through
its various branches in co-operation with
the Natural Resources Intelligence Branch
and with similar Federal and Provincial
bodies, has been actively engaged in this
work for many years. The Department of
the Interior has an extensive staff of
highly-trained technicians specializing in
the various fields of natural resources and
bas been and is considered by the public
as the basic source of information in this
connection.

The Commission's report on the "Water
Powers of British Columbia" represents
about 650 pages of material of which over
one-third is repu'blished matter.
One
hundred and thirty-three pages are a
direct copy of hydrometric survey information already published by the Dominion
Water Power Branch, and which was two
years out of date when included in their
report by the Commission.
*Extract from explanation given by the
Commission of Conservation in regard to
its estimates for the year 1919-20, page 15:
Work to be dons under the direction of the
Conimittee on Waters and Water-Powers during
the fiscal year 1919-20, will include the collections and co-ordination of ail avallable streamflow and water-lervel data..
This is a function of the Department
of the Interior and cannot be completed
by otheiý than the investigatory bodies
directly concerned.
The Department of
the Interior has for years had staffs in
the field eiùgaged in gathering stream-flow
and water-Ievel data. The gathering of
S-30i

467

stream-flow and water-level data is a distinct function of the Department of the
Interior, the responsible
Deparliment
charged with the investigation, and administration of water-power and irriga-e
tion, and it is a waste of public moneys
for another Government body-to attempt
this work.
The report of the Commission of, Conservation on the Water Powers of Canada,
published in 1911, has caused the Department of the Interior a great deal of unnecessary and unwarranted expendituire,
arising from the applications for power
privileges submitted to the Department
and often vigorously pressed, most of them
based upon the general information contained in the Comimission's report.
The
city of Saskatoon, for instance, applied
to the Department for power privileges
on the South Saskatchewan river, and the
Department officiads found it very difficult
to convince the municipal officers that the
development of power on the South Saskatchewan river was inadvisable, because
of the paucity of hydrometric data.
The
main support for the city's assumptions
was the very general information contained in the Commission's report.
These, honourable gentlemen, are a few'
of the many. illustrations that might be
clted of deliberate overlapping-it has flot
been accidental, it bas been deliberate-,of
the other activities of the Government Departments, thus inviolving the expenditure
of a considerable amount of money.
An inter-departmental committee, representing many of the Departments, was
appointed, and that committee investigated
very thoroughly the duplication and overlapping of work .and tl<e unnecessary expenditure of money, by way of publicity and
otherwise, on the part of the Commission.
The conclusion is irresistible. It cannot be
gainsaid that the Government of Canada
would not be justified in continuing the
Commission any longer and subjecting the
couintry to the enormous expense, which is
annually increasing, and which during the
last fiscal year exceeded something like
$150,000.
We quite recognize, honourable gentlemen, the ability in the way of active research of many of the Commission. The
staff, or at least many of them,- are undoubtedly very capable gentlemen in the
particular branch or profession to which
they belong; but there are equally capable
officiais who are doing precisely the same
work in the other active branches of the
Government. The work for 'which thia

SENATE
Commission was organized bas been done.
As 1 have already pointed out, the intention
of President Roosevelt, in calling bis conference together in Washington, at which
representatives from Canada and Mexico
and other countries attended, was to furnish to the different Governments on this
continent an incentive to give special attention to the conservation of natural resources. That incentive probably found a
refiection in the increased activities of the
different governmental bodies on this continent charged with looking alter those
particular subjects. I may say that in
Canada, since the organization of the Conservation Commission, the attention of the
public bas beeni called to the necessity of
giving dloser attention than in the past
not only to the conservation, but also to the
development, of our natural resources. The
development of our resources involves probably much more consideration and a higher
class of scîentific attention than their conservation. But I am happy to say that the
Government of Canada to-day and for some
years past bas had a most capable organization in its various Departments dealing
wîth those same subjects-dealing not only
with the conservation of our resources, but
likewisc with their development where it
has been desirable that conservation should
cease and development begin. Under these
circumstances the Government feels that it
bas no alternative but to repeal the Act
constituting the Conservation Commission,
wîthout passing any reflection whatever
upon the ability of the gentleman who is at
its head and the staff which bas laboured
so zealously under him. 1 therefore move
the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK:
Honourable gentlemen, my bonourable friend bas
given us a very interesting account of the
work done by tbe Conservation Commission
since the time of its appointment. He bas
sbown to the House the overlapping that
bas apparently gone on as between the
work of the Yiepartments and the work
carried on by the Conservation Comnmhission. 0f course, we are flot in a position to make a comparison in tbat'respect.
I have no doubt there bas arisen a situation
in wbich overlapping between the Departments and the Commission bas occurred.
However, I specially remark the stpatement of my honourable friend about tbe
irresponsibility of this Commission.
AIthougb under the Act the Commission is
not responsible to any particular Minister,
it can get no money except what is voted
by Parliament, and the money bas to be
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

voted every year. If there was so much
overlapping as my honourable friend has
represented in bis i*peecb this afternoon,
it is rather curious that this question was
not discussed before, when the Estimates
were before the House, during the years
that this Commission bas been in existence.
Honourable gentlemen wîll re-member that
the Commission was created 'in 1909. Apparently the amount of money wbich the
Commission each year requested from Parliament for the purpose of carrying on its
work bas gradually niounted up, as my
honourable friend bas said, from $12,000
at the inception of the Commission to
about $150,000, I tbink be said, this last
year; but that increase in tbe money provided for the Commission must bave been
granted by Parliament, and Parliament
would not bave voted tbe money, I presume, if they did not consider that there
was some return for it. In this House we do
not discuss tbe various items of the Estimates as tbey are discussed in anotber
place; but if the overlapping bas been
going on, I sbould tbink the question ougbt
to bave been raised in another place before
tbis.
Although no me-mber of tbis House
would want to see such overlapping as my
bonourable friend bas mentioned, between
the Commission and the Departments, stili
I tbink that tbe Conse~rvation Coemmission
bas a useful work to do in tbis country.
If bonourable gentlemen bad before tbem
tbe Act eistablisbing the Commission, tbey
would see that it was to consist, first of
ail, of "'twenty members appointed by the
Governor in Councîl, who shail bold office
during pleasure."
If I understand that
wording, the Government bad sufficient
control over tbose gentlemen, if they were
not doing wbat was wanted, to bring about
a change, and in tbat case it could bave
been represented to tbem pretty strongly
tbat thbe work of the Commission was not
being conducted along lines conducive to
the best interests of the country, or tbat
the Commission's work was overlapping
the work of the various Departments. It
was provided also:
The Minister off Agriculture, the Minister off
the Interior, the Minister of Mines, and the
member of each Provincial Government who is
charged wi th the administration off the natural
resources off such Province shall be ex officjo
members of the Commission.

Then, clause 4 of the Act of 1909 says:
Of the members appointed by the G-overnor
in Council at least one membvr appointed from
each province shall be a member off the faculty
off a university within such province, if there
be such university.

MAY 13, 1921
The effect of that provision is that it
brings into, touch with the naturai resources of Canada, and particularly the
conservation of those resources, men who
are studying such questions, and who, by
their training and experience, are in a
position to bring to. the consideration of
themn a point of view different froin that
of officiais, of the Departments.
Section 5 of the.BiHl provides:
The Governor In Couneil may appoint one of
the ineribers of the Co'nmissb n to be its chairman.
I understand that the first chairman of
the Commission was the Hon. Sir Clifford
Sifton, who heid the chairmaneship, I think,
from. 1909 to 1917 or 1918.
Since that
time the Government do not seem to have
feit called upon to appoint a successor.
In appointing a new chairman, had they
wished to do so, the Government could
have instructed him to curtail the work of
the Commission in so far as it was overlapping the work of the various De'partments to wbich my honourable friend has
referred, and could at the samne time, in
continuing the Commission, give it an opportuity to do the valuable work which I
thi.nk such a Commission can do, outside
of the actual work done by the Departments.
My bonourable friend, referring to the
reports published by the Commission, bas
nientioned that there is in thom a great
deal of repetition, and that in one instance,
I think, they are not brought quite up to
date. But I have frnxnd in varlous parts
of the country that those reports have
been read very widely. There is sometimes a disposition on the part of the
public to read the report of a Commission
of this kind more readily than a departmental report. Without wishing to cast
any reflections on any of the Departments,
I think there is on the part of the public
a feeling that the report of a Department
may be biased in favour of the policy of
the Governmnènt; that it would flot criticize
in any way a -policy laid down by the departmental head. It is quite possible that
some friction might arise as 1between a
Commission of this kind and a Department
in this respect.
Th *en, àgain, this-Commission should be
in dloser touch with the different provincial
governments througbout the Dominion and
there je possibly quite an advantage -for
the country in the fact that, in dealing
with the question of our natural resources,
the Commission can keep in touch witb the

469

various provinces of the Dominion in a
better, more friendly, perhaps more unofficiai way than can the officiais of a department of the Government.
I think:
there bas been a considerable amount of
good work done by the Commission'since
its establishment, and that, if anything,
from what my honourable friend bas said
here to-day, Parliament; itself bas been
somewhat remiss in not paying more attention to the work of the Commission and
keeping down the expenditure or making
the Commission show more particularly,
each Session, how the money was going to
be spent, or pointing out to the Commission that tbey sbould be careful to effi that
their work did not overlap the work of the
Department.
Wîtb regard to the statement of my
honourable friend that the Commission
was appointed before the Water Powers
Brancb of the Department of the Interior
was created, I amn not absolutély sure, but
FI hink that the Water Powers Branch of
the Interior Department was estabiished
after the Comniiesion, and that the work
taken up by the Commission in regard to
water powers was begun by them before
the work of the -Interior Department was
initiated.
At the present time we are ail most
anxious tbat as much expense should, be
saved as possible in the administration of
the affairs of the country. According to
the statements of my honourable friend,
there bas been considerabie expense connected with this Commission, and if they
are overlapping in the way he bas described to the House, this expenditure should
certainly be reduced. But I regret very
much that the Government, instead of
trying to curtail tbe work of the Commission and direct it along certain uines of
woe' whicb it can do, I tbink, better than
tbe Departments, bave determined to
abolish the Commission altogether.
Then the Library, as bas been nientioned
by my bonourable friend fromn De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain), is part of the
work of the Commission. There may be
in that Library a considerable amount of
usef ni information, and it would be a great
pity if stepe were not taken to see that
the books were placed either in the LibrarY
of Parliament or in some other place where
tbey would be available for members and
for the public generally. We have ohserved lately that certain books 'Whicb unfortunately were not considered by certain
persons to be of any value were destroyed.

SENATE
The country has, I fear, suffered considerable loss by the destruction of those
volumes, simply because there was apparently nobody to look after them and they
were put away.
They were destroyed
through a mistake or a misunderstanding
of some kind. The country has thus lost a
consîderable amount of valuable information. It is quite conceivable that when this
Commission is wound up and put out of
business, unless special steps are taken to
see that the publications of the Commission are properly housed and properly put
away, and unless somehody is responsible
for looking after them, the samne thing
may happen again.
I would simply say that I regret that the
Government have decided on this policy
and have not seen their way to continuing
the work of the Commission along lines
which would be of great value to the country.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I shou'ld like to ask mny honourable
friend the leader of the Governmnent what
it is proposed to do with the staff, numbering about fifty, which is now engaged in
connection with the Commission of Conservation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Where
it is possible, with advantage tô the Gevernment to absorb any of the staff, I think
it will be done. No particular scheme of
th4t kind has been worked out at the present time; but I say without hesitation that
no institution looks more carefully after
a staff that has been dispenseà with than
the Government of Canada.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Thon 1 think we
may take it for granted that nione of thein
will1 he dismissed, and that in that respect
we shaill not make much of a saving by
doing away with the Commiission.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend allow me 10o reply
now se that I shail net coitside-r myseif
bound to do so later? There :s this to be
said: any surplus staff that is absorbed in
any branch of Government work takes the
place of those who might subsea'uently be
hîred to do the samne work. Ail we have to
do is to follow the activities of the Civil
Service Commission to know that every day
we engage many employees, sometimes
hundreds. I do net say that we engage
one hundred every day, but it is a very
sho~rt period of time in whîch we do net
employ say one hundred civil servants.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: From the reryarkçs
of my honourable friend during most of
the time hie was speaking, the public at
ail events will take it that the Commisszion
of Conservation started in a very small
way, and that its sole object was gradually
to, monopolize everything until, as the
leader of the GoveTn'ment bas said, the
Government itself was in danger of being
swallowed up by it.
I want to say te
my honourable friend that ail this waÊ
done under the Government of which hie
himseilf is a member. The Government had
to supply every dollar required to enable
the Commission to go on, and ýduring aill
these years has consented to every activity
in which the Commission bas enýgaged. So
I do nýot think it is fair to make it appear
that it was the Commission of Conservation that brought about aIl this duplication. That is absolutely not the fact,
because every dollar of expenditure was
voted in the Estimates, and the Government fathered it aIl. As, my honourable
friend stated, in the beginning, before hie
was a member of the Governânent, the
expenses of the Commission were about

,$10,0O0 or $12,00O a year.

Since then ahl

the Government departments have spent a
great deal ,more money than they did previousýly. The point that 1 want to make
is that it would appear, from the manner
in which this matter bas been .presented,
that the Commission was altogether to
blame; whereas the fact is. that the Comnmission did its work âa through wîth the
authority and the consent of the GoFvernment.
1 arn sorry that there has been dapiication, but I think a good deal of it was
brought about because othe;s, heing jealous of what the Coýmmission haid doue,
took up similar work. This condition may
have re'ached such a stage that the Gevernment is right in ýputting a stop to it;
but the bMaine, if there is blamne, cannot
a&P put on the Commission; the Governhe
ment has got to take its share.
Hlon. J. W. DANIEL: If the statement
made by the leader of the Government in
introducing this subject is correct, I think
the remarks of the honourable gentleman
from Assiniboîa (Hon. Mr. Turriff) will
hardly apiply, because the leader of the
Government has told us that the gentlemen comprising the Commission were not
under the controq of the Government, but
under the control1 of Parliament., I think
it is quite evident that the graduai increases in expenditure is a resUlt of the
work of the Commissioners themseives.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But there is no

Commerce to use the inspectors of the Inland Revenue Department?
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: They are two separate departments entirely?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
they are separate departmnents. It would
not resuit in any duplication or clashing of

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But what occurred
to me was that in the interest of economy
the sarne rnan who was inspecting for the
Inland Revenue Department might bie able
to inspeet for this work as well, and where
he is travelling from. one town to another,
hie might be able to ernploy his tirne more

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is there to be any

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
are changed f-rom Urne to time. They are
not a fixity. I do not know that any
change is contemplated; it is a matter
for the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
The idea
apparent]y is that the Act should pay for
its own administration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
This is practically the old section; the
only change is in subsection 1, where we
strike out the words "and shahl form part
of the Consolidated Revenue Fund."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the object
of that? I see that the fees are to be
"accounted for and paid to the Minister of
Finance."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
that is a matter of bookkeeping.

Yes,

Hon. Mi. BOSTOCK: I t.hought that
ail fees of this kcind were paid into the
Consolidated Fund, and remained there at
the order of the Minister.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The cost of the stamps, apparently, wil

Sections 12 and 13 were agreed to.
On section 14-penalty for forging and
counterfeiting stamps and seals:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
Is there any
change in this section?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
is a recast of clauses 52 and 56 of the old
Act, and makes the text more definite.
For instance, the person who forges or
assists in forging any stamp or seal is
declared to be "guilty of forgery," and any
person who steals any such stamp or seal
is "guilty of theft," thus making the guilty
person liable to punishment under the
Criminal Code.
In other respects the
penalties remain unchanged. I fancy that
is to bring it in accordance, with the
Criminal Code.
Sections 14 and 15 were agreed to.
On section 16-penalties for not keeping records or permitting inspection of

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
This
is the same as the old, excepting that we
use the word "records" instead of the word
"books."
The word "records"
includes
both.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In the old Act
the penalty was simply $50. There is a
change here, ân makingý the contractor
liable to a penalty of not less than $5 and
not more than $50.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: They are not
very consistent in the penalties.
Sections 16 and 17, were agreed to.

This is an alto-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
but the penalties are the same.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There was no
clause of that kind in the old Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, but
as to selling gas.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Or electricity?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

Section 18 was agreed to.
Sections 19 and 20 were agreed to.
On section 21-procedure:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Why is paragraph b limited to "two justices of the
peace, if the penalty exceeds $25"? In
most towns and cities in Ontario we now
have 'police magistrates, and the police
magistrate has the same jurisdiction under
the Ontario Acts as two justices of the
peace, and if this clause stands as it is
it will lead to a great deal of confusion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May
I ask my honourable friend, does not the
Criminal Code provide that where two justices of the peace have jurisdiction, a
magistrate may exercise the same jurisdiction? I think they are convertible terms.
That is my impression.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The honourable leader is quite right in that statement, but where an Act expressly mentions,
as .this Bill does, two justices of the peace,
without referring to the police magistrate,
it may cause confusion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend look into that? Before we take the third reading we could
correct it if it is wrong. But I am under
the impression that that is what is intended.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I am satisfied
that that is what is intended, but it is not
made clear.

MAY 13, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
flot do to say "a magistrate" becausé that
would exelude the two justices of the peace;
but if you give jurisdiction to two justices
of the peaoe, that would include the magistrate.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Cominittee on Bill 73,
an Act to authorize the ratification and
carrying into effect of the Protocol of the
sixteenth day of December, 1920, accepting
the Statute for the Permanent Court of
International Justice of the thirteenth day
of December, 1920. Hlon. Mr. Mitchener in

On section l-power to ratify Protocol:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable 'friend tell us what is going to be the
cost to Canada of 'this Court? I understand that Canada has to bear her part of
the expense of the Court, and that some
question has been raised about the way in
which the basis of Canada's share was
arrived at. Perhaps my honourable friend
can give us some explanation as to how
much we are hiable to have to pay towards
providing for the Court.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That 1
could flot do at the moment. There has been
a great deal of satisfaction up to the
present tinie at Canada having been placed
ispon a parity of responsibility with the
other povVers. 0f course, the other smaller
nations have likewise complained as to
the distribution of the expense. Hence,
I understand, at the next meeting of the
Assembly the matter 'will be adjusted so

47E

that the more important members of 'the
League wîhl bear a -greater proportion of
expense, more commensurate with their
importance. Whàt the expense of this Court
of International Justice will be I cannot
say. It will be distributed upon the samne
basis as the general expenditures of the
League. I understand that ahi the expenditures
involved in carryîng the
different articles of the Covenant will be
distributed pro rata, according to the proportion that xnay be determined upon at
the next Assembly.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Are the judges
that are ampinted to be paid an annual
salary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Not just paid for
the particular work that they have to do?
1Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
think it will be very large, but it will be, I
understand, an annual honorarium.
Hon. Mr. IVOSTOCK: It is conceivable
that the work might be of a nature to take
up ail their time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If large
questions come up, that may be the case.
However, I cannot say anything about that

SENATE
COURTS OF CRIMINAL APPEAL
DISCUSSION

AND

INQUIRY

Hon. L. MeMEANS rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That in the opinion of the Senate it is essential for the better administration of the criminal law that a Court of Criminal Appeal
should be established in the different provinces,
with jurisdiction similar to that possessed by
the Court of Criminal Appeal in England, and
will inquire whether it is the intention of the
Government to create such Courts.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, in
rising to move this resolution I desire to
say that it is done with no intention of
criticising the judges or the officials or
others engaged in the administration of
the criminal law. I have no fault to find
with the administration of the criminal
law as it exists at the present time; but
I do say without hesitation that the system under which the criminal law is administered is out of date I think that
Canada is to-day the only civilized country
in the world in which such a system exists
without any appeal.
Prior to the year 1907 there was no
such thing as a Court of Criminal Appeal
in England, although various attempts had
been made by very eminent jurists to
introduce that great reform. Since 1907
a Court of Criminal Appeal bas been
established in England, and bas been very
satisfactory in every respect. At the risk
of taking up the time of this House for a
few moments, I would like to call the attention of honourable gentlemen to what was
done prior to 1907 in regard to criminal
appeals. In a work by Mr. Cohen on the
Criminal Appeal Act of 1907, he starts
out by saying:
Numerous proposals have been made from
time to time to establish a Court of Criminal
Appeal and to enable persons convicted on
ind-ictment to apply to such court to review
their cases on the ground that they have been
improperly convicted or sentenced too severely.
So early as 1841 Mr. (afterwards Lord Chief
Baron) 'Fitzroy Kelly introduced a Bill on this
subject, and frrm that time up lo the year
1906 as many as twenty-eight Bills (at least)
had been introduced with the same object.
Some of these-namely, the Criminal Codeswere Government Bills, and were introduced
by the At'tornev-General, the Solicitor-General,
the Attorney-Greral for Ireland, and the Home
Secretary, but it was found impossible to pass
them.
In 1'883 there was also a Court of Criminal
Appeal 'Bill introduced by the Attorney-General
(Sir Henry James), the Home Secretary (Sir
William Harcourt), and the. Solicitor-General
(.Sir F. Percy", which passed through
the
Standing Committee and was reported to the
House but was withdrawn the 21st August. The
other Bills were introduced by members of the
House of Commons, sorne of whom had had

large experience in the administration of the
Criminal Law, as will be seen by the Rteturn
referred to, but they ail met the same fate.
In 1892 the judges were consulted on this
thorny subject, and I think it desirable to
state what then happened.
under the
The Council of Judges, beld

(July, 189<2)
(Return to 'House of Commons, 2,4th May, 1894,
No. 127) Lord Coleridge was Lord Chief Justice. It will be seen that the judges were in
favour of a Court of Criminal Appeal for some
purposes, and with reasonable limitations. The
Report was as follows:
Court to Review Sentences
Besides the foregoing matters relating to the
working of the Judicature Acts, the Judges of
the Supreme Court have thought it their duty
to consider that which is the most responsible
and the most difficult part of the administration of the law, namely, the administration of

sentences passerl by different Courts in respect
of offen.ces of the same kind, where the circumstances are very similar. It is much to be desired that this diversity should be if possible
avoided.
It often happens when a person is con.victed
of a serious crime and is sentenced to a severe
punishment and most frequently when a person
is convicted of murder that a petition is presented after having been circulated for signatures, and the Home Secretary is- pressed ta
review the finding of the jury and the sentences
of the judgs.

sponsibility of the HRome Secretary than any
one man ought to have imposed upon him. After
fuli consid'eration the institution of a court is
recommended, W ving full jurisdiction to review and alter sentences, and a limited juriediction to assist the Home Secretary in reconsidering sentenes or convictions at his request.
As to sentences, the great object is to procure
a greater unifornity than existe. A series of
decisions by one court would, by examples and
the reasons gixen for them, tend to secure
uniformity. Thi court sbould, as far as possible, for long periods consist of the same
judges.

I need not take up the time of the House
in going through the report of the judges
to the House of Parliament. They were
unanimous at that time in recommending
that a Court of Criminal Appeal should
be established. As I understand the establishment of the Criminal Court of Appeal
in England, a similar court in this country
would not entail any additional expense on
the Government. The Court in England
is merely made up of a Board of Judges
selected by the Lord Chief Justice, and
there is no increased expense of any kind.

MAY 17, 1921
The reasons that were given at that time
for the establishment of a Court of
Criminal Appeal in EnglandHon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is the year
of that report?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: July, 1892. The
Bill was flot passed until the year 1907,
and it did flot, corne into, force until the
year 1908.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: When there is an
appeal is there a second trial, and if so
does it take place before a 'second jury?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No, the case is
reviewed and the court can remedy any
injustice which has been done in the trial.
1 shall refer to one or two cases that
occurred in Englandý which were fully
discussed by the British Parliament, and
which in my opinion, had a great denl
to do with the decision arrived at to establish a Court of Criminal Appeal.
The Court of Crirninal Appeal has of
course no power under the Act to, interfere
with a sentence that is fixed by'law. Take
for instance the crime of murder, for
which the penalty is death. The Court of
Criminal Appeal cannot interefere' with
that sentence; but it could interfere with
the sentence if the man had been sent to
the penitentiary for ten years. One of
the advantages of that system is that ail
the courts and judges throughout the land
know of the decision that is given, and.it
is a guide to them in dealing with cases
of a similar kind.
In Canada we have judges of the Court
of Appeal sitting upon the trial of criminal
appeals on questions of law. I looked up
the current report of the Ontario Law
.Times the other day, in the case of the
King vs. Mouer, in which two younfg girls
and their familles had rnoved away into
the woods north of North Bay. These girls
dressed themselves as- boys when they got
to North Bay. They were going down
a road, and a young fellow carne along and
grabbed one of them, flot knowing they
were girls masquerading in boys' clothes.
The sister became excited and cried out
that he was carrying away her sister.
Another young boy carne along and pulled
a revolver and shot the first -boy through
the heart, instantly killing him. This boy
was tried for murder at North Bay, and a
verdict of guilty was brought in and he
was sentenced to be hanged. The case was
taken to the Court of Appeal on a question
of law; as to the admissibility of certain
-evidence. At the trial counsel tried to get

477

in evidence of what was said by the girl
who was dragged away, and it was objected
that that would not be heard by the one
who had committed the-crimhe. The judge
ruled it out. It took the Court of Appeal
three or four days to hear the argument
in the case. If they found that the evidence
was irnproperly rejected, they could order
a new trial; but apArt -from that they
were powerless to do anything. Supposing
that the jury had brought in a verdict of
rnansalughter, and the sarne question arose
as to the admissibility of evidence: in that
case the court would have heard argument
for sorne four or five days, and would then
have been powerless to deal with the facts,
and could only have dealt with the question
of w hether the evidence was properly admitted or otherwise. The case was brought
to the attention of the Minister of Justice,
and he remitted the sentence of death to
one of irnprisonment for ten years.
Now, take the case of a man sentenced
to life imprisonment for manslaughter. An
appeal is made to the Minister of Justice.
The difflculty is that nobody hears of his
decision: it is flot published, and it is no
guide to any judge in the country. One.of the drawbacks of the system of administering justice in this country-I know it
is the case in Ontario and the West, I do
n-ot know about Quebec-is that layrnen
without any experience in the administration of justice are appointed
magistrates. In Toronto and Winnipeg they have
lawyers for magistrates; but there are
towns ail over the country where the magistrates are flot lawyers. The Criminal Code
gives to those magistrates the power. to
impose sentence. I need flot go into the
question-I have discussed it before-of
magistrates imýosing widely differing sentences for sirnilar crimes, and their being
no provision for review.
Mr. Boulton, one of the members of the
British Hou-se of Comrnons, in the introduction to his work on the Court of Crirninal
Appeal, said:
Both the publie and the profession hall
therelfore arrived at the conclusion that soane
revlew of the evidence upon whlch convictions
in criminal cases rested was necessary.
The disadyantages of the late system may 'be
summedL up In a few wordq. In the first Place,
the Home Office has no power, if it -is d&ssatlsled with a conviction, of quashlng It. If, after
full inquiry, the case appears doubtful, the
Home Secretary may advise the gran'ting ce a
pardon to the prisoner, or he can grant a remission of the Imprisonment. But the Hlome
Office can give no definite and final judiclal finding, such as a court of laJw cen give.
In the second place, on a petition to, the Homne
Office the prlsoner's case only in before it. Trhe

478

SENATE

resuit of that is that the 'Home Office has to
discover the case against the prisoner,' to test
his conviction and his guilt in order to establish,
if possible, his innocence.
In the third place, there is no legal flnality
in the position of the Home Secretary. The
consequence is thaýt, although he m-ight coame to
a clear and definite decision, hie is aI'ways expnsed to pressure to reconsider his dcision.
In the fourth place, the Home Office cannot,
as a general rule, state its reasons for its
decision.
Fifthly, the Home Office cannot take, fresh
evidence on oath and allow the cross-examninatin of witnbesses.
The Home Office inquiry is not conducted by
legal mincis. There is no representation of the
accused and nu argument. The resns
upon
which the decision is based are flot disclosed,
and therefore unknown to the public.
CIft late
there has undoubteýdly
been a
tendency to criticize proceedings of the Home
Secretary in a tone which would flot be
tolerated
by any judicial tribunal in the
country. There must, therefore, be a great advane~ in our legal system if the burden of an
investigation, which must bc essentially iudicia
in lis character, ia cast upon a jud-icial tribunal.
The Court orf Criminal Appeal will be composed
nf judges of the King's Bench Division. It will
have the power of quashing a decision. and
thus remnoving the effect which, -a conviction
must have upon the status of the prisoner. Its
decisions will, save in exceptional cases when an
appeal to the House of Lords is permissible, te
final, and it will be enalbled to hear both sides,
and, if necessary, to take the sworn tegtimony
nf fresh witnesses, or heýar fresh evidence and
allnw of cross-exaiminations.
Finally, it can
give the reasons for its deciilo-ns.
The 1-ome Office, ton, will have an sdded
advantage.
In the flrst place, the number of cases which
come before the 'Home Office for interference
will be greatly diminished, th&ugh they will certainly flot be 'altogether removed.
In the next place, it will hýave a ch oice.' The
Hoine Secre'tary cao either deal with the case as
heretofore by confidential inquiry, and arrive at
an independent judgment if necessary ;or he
will be able, under -the power given by the Act,
to refer the whnle case, or any point in connectin with the case, for the opinion of the Court
of Criminal Appeal.

One of the peculiarities of our system. is
that, in the case of a mnan who is charged
with a crime and convicted by a jury or
by a judge, and afterwards found to be
absolutely innocent, there is no power that
can pronounce hlmi an innocent man. If
he is once convicted hie is gui]ty, and we
have the very extranrdýinary state of
affairs that this man, alter it is found
that hie is innncent, is gracinusly pardoned
by the Crown. 1 do not know how that
systeým might affect some honourable gentlemen in t.his House. 1 tbink that a Senator
.cnnvicted of a crime must forfeit his seat.
Consequently, if an honourable member of
this House were accused of some crime
and cnnvicted by a niagistrate, although he
was absolutely innocent and the evidence
was there to, show it, hie would stili be a
convicted man, and the only redress that
Hlon.

hie would have would be that the Crown
would be gracious enough to extend to,
him. a pardon for, an act which he bad
neyer committed.
In a country like Canada, extending as
it does for 3,000 miles, and having a great
diversity of population, it is a difficuit
thing to admninister criminal justice. I
know, and other honourable gentlemen who
have practised iaw know, the difficulty of
making an appeal for clemency to the
Crown, on accounit of the time it takes to,
get the petition here and for the Department to report back and get the opinion
of thle judge. There is another peculiarity
-and I am flot criticizingth±e Departmnent,
but merely the method on which they work:
the first thing that is done when a petition
is made for clemency is to go to the judge
who tried the man and get ýthe report of
that judge--the veIey man froni whom in
England the appeal is taken. Surely it is
not reasonable that a judge who has convicted a man after hie bas heard the
evidence should 'be asked to report and
stultify bfimself hy saying that hie is
wrnng. I think the systens is wrong, and
it is about tume .that there was soine
remedy for that sort of thing.
During the discussion of this question
in the House of Gommons in Great Britain
there were two cases referred to. One of
them was the well-known Beck case, and
I think it is a very gond illustration of
what the power of a Court of Criminal
Appeal wouid ibe. A man of the namne of
Smith had procured money fromn certain
loose womnen in London by representing
hiniself to be a lord, and stating that he
was -going to start an estàblishment of bis
own inSt. John's Wood, and that he wanted
a mistress. He wrote out cheques to these
wonien and told them to go and buy
furniture; but in the meantime hie horrowed
ail the money he could from them, and ail
their jewelry. He was convicted of this
crime, and was sentenced to penal servitude
for some seven years. Alter serving part
of bis sentence hie was let out. Then the
crime was committed again under very
similar circumstances, the namne of a
different lord being used. A man named
Beck was goîng along a street in London,
when a woman rusbed up to bim, and said,
"You are the man that defrauded me."
He said, "I neyer saw you in my life."
They got into an altercation, and a policeman came along, and they were both taken
to the police station. The woman said

endeavoured ta find the report in the
library, but was unable ta do so, and
bath the Diibrarian and myself assumed
that there bad not been any return made
during the last three or four years owing
ta the war. But I wvas able ta find the
report of the Comniissioners for 1914, and
the table shows that between April 18,
1908, and July 15, 1913, there were 167
convictions quashed and 164 sentences
reduced. Out of these, 21 convictions were
quashed and 21 sentences reduced in cases
in %~hich leave ta appeal was given by
the Court, though refused by the examining judge. 0f the total number of sucessful appeals, 12.6 per cent were cases in
'which the judge had refused bis consent.
Under the English law, application for
appeal must be made ta the judge trying
the case, and, if he refused application may
be ma-de direct ta the Court of Criminal
Appeal.
Another feature about the Court of
Appeal is that it works out as stated by
Sibley, at page 33:
It may be that the chief use of the Act will
be to prevent iniscarriages rather than ta put
them right.

A judge trying a case and knowing that
there is an appeal, either on the facts or
on the sentence he gîves, will certainly be
more careful. When this question was
before the Parliament of Great Britain, it
was held very strongly by one of the
eminent judges that the Act might affect
juries in the verdicts they gave, as he
feared it would make theni less mindful
of giving prisoners the benefit of the doubt,
because they would bave a chance of
-appeal. Montagu Williams, K.C., the great
criminal lawyer, replied ta that. He said
it would be rather a good thing, and in a
wark which he wrote, in discussing the
Hungerford poaching murders, said:

right in caying that, in acquitting my two
clients, the jury were inrfluenced by the consideration I thus brought to their notice.

This matter does not in any way initerfere with the prerogative of the Crown,
because, even if the Court of Appeal should
refuse ta interfere, there is stili recourse
ta the Minister of Justice. In a case of
murder they could flot of course alter the
sentence or anything of that kind, but the
prerogative stili exists.
There has been some objection on the
ground that the courts'would b-e filled with
appeals of a petty nature, or those without
foundation. That was alleged recently in
one of the law journals. While no doubt
that was one of the weaknesses of the Act,
it bas been adjusted in this way, that the
Criminal Appeal Court in England has
said that if frivolous appeals are brought
before them, or those which are not justified, they will punish the appellants by
increasing the sentences and making them
pay the cost. That has served ta a very
±arge extent ta minimize that type of appeal.
Honourable gentlemen, if a country like
England, which has always stood for justice, and which is renowned throughout the
world for its administration of criminal
law, feit it necessary ta the administration
of criminal law as far back as 1907 ta,
institute the Court of Criminal Appeal,
and if that Court bas been of great benefit
ta the people of England, as it undoubtedly
has, is there any reason why we in this
country should continue the antediluvian
system that we have at present? The only
reason that can be given for aur present
system is that in matters of criminal law
the majority of the people of this country
do not take any interesb. Criminal law is
the most difficuit of ail ta administer;
yet we notice that when a trial is gaing
on the vast majority of the population
take a very keen interest in it and watch
its outcome; and on the conduct of those
cases the people form their opinions as ta

affects every resident in the community,
and to my mind is the most important
phase of administration of-justice that we
have to deal with.
I do not desire to take up any more
time, ibecause I know that among the
honourable gentlemen in this House there
are very many eminent lawyers-men who
are more capable than I am te deal with
this matter; but if I have succeeded in
interesting the House or any of those
honourable gentlemen in this matter, I
will consider myself very well repaid for
any trouble I have taken in the matter,
and I trust it will receive full consideration from this honour.able body.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Can the Crown
appeal from a sentence under that law
in England?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I believe se. If
not, there should be such a provision, and
it would be a very easy matter to put it
in the Act.
Why should a guilty man
escape and an innocent man be punished?
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, I said a few words last year in support of my honourable friend when, he
introduced his Bill te provide for appeals
in criminal cases. It might probably be
felt that I was not with him in regard
to the present resolution if I did net say
something on this occasion.
I think this is a question which should
be very carefully considered, as it is one
of tire most important that has -come
before the Senate for a long time. The
issues at stake in civil matters are small
compared with those involved in criminal
matters; and yet a man can appeal from
a decision where he is adjudged liable to
pay $100 to a party who has brought
action against him, while under our
criminal law, where his life or his liberty
is at stake, he has absolutely no appeal
on questions of fact, though, as my honourable friend pointed out, there is an
appeal on questions of law. If the attorney for the accused thinks there has 'been
a misdirection on a point of law by the
trial judge in his charge te the jury, he
may ask for a stated case, and there may
be an appeal on a point of law.
I have seen cases where the greatest
possible miscarriage of justice has taken
place, and yet the accused had absolutely
no remedy under the present law. I think
I cited a case lest year that had come
under my own observation, where a boy

S-31

481

of 15 or 16, going down the street of a
town one evening, as a prank took an
overcoat, put it on his back, and walked
around the town. The boy had never been
guilty of any criminal offence before. His
character was good. He belonged te a
respectable family. The owner of the coat
saw him on the street, and ran and took
it away from him. That boy was arrested
and taken to court. The feeling in the
town was rather intense at that particular
time, because there had been a great many
cases of petty theft, in many of which
the guilty persons had gone unpunished.
This boy was tried and sentenced by the
County Court judge te three years in the
penitentiary. An appeal was made to the
Minister of Justice, and the boy was let
out on ticket-of-leave; but the stamp of
criminality was placed upon him, and any
one eoud say to him that he had been
in the penitentiary, that he had been convicted of theft; and, while he was clearly
not guilty of any criminal offence, he was
nevertheless an ex-conviet.
Had there
been a court of appeal where the evidence
could have been reviewed, no doubt it
would have led to this young boy being
released.
Cases like this are occurring
every day throughout Canada, perhaps
because of public
feeling
in
the
community, perhaps because of prejudice,
or because in many cases of the fact that
a criminal may net be properly defended;
that is to say, he may not be able to
engage counsel and his case may go practically undefended. I feel sure that the
institution of a Court of Criminal Appeal
would be a step in the right direction.
The English Act as I read it gives very
wide powers indeed te the Court of Appeal.
They can get the same witnesses examined;
they can summon new witnesses; they can
take evidence by commission; they can do
anything that the Court of Appeal can do
in civil cases. There does net seem te me te
be any reason why, when an appeal is
granted in a civil case, it should net be
granted also in a criminal case. My
experience as a criminal lawyer has net
been very wide, but from what little experience I have had I have come te the
conclusion that the establishment of a
Court of Criminal Appeal is most desirable.
The objection has been raised that a Court
of this kind would encourage appeals. I
do net think that that is a correct view of
what would actually take place. The fact
that no costs are allowed in appeals of
this kind, and the further fact that there
will be a uniformity of decisions established

REVID NDITION.

SENATE

482

and that lawyers will in many cases
be able to judge what is likely to happen on
certain evidence on appeal, will have, I
think, the contrary effect. Once there is a
uniformity of decisions, once counsel is able
to judge fairly accurately what will result
trom the hearing by the Court of Appeal
on certain evidence, he can be guided by
that and is most unlikely to appeal unless
he bas reasonable grounds for believing
that the Court of Appeal will lighten the
sentence. Then there is this further fact,
that the Court of Appeal, besides having
the power to lighten the sentence passed
upon the accused, bas the further power
to increase the sentence, and no counsel or
accused will take the risk of appealing
when the evidence is so strong that there is
a possibility that the Court of Appeal,
instead of lightening the sentence, may
increase it. For these reasons I think there
is no danger of the number of appeals
being greater than is reasonable under all
the circumstances. That bas not been the
case in England, where this Court of
Appeal bas been in operation since 1907.
The number of appeals bas not been
greater than is reasonable, and the judgment of eminent counsel and judges who
have had to do with the administration of
the Act is that it bas worked no injustice
to anyone, but, on the contrary, bas been
productive of great good and is a most
desirable law to have in force.

tried him that it is a fit case for appeal against
his conviction on any ground of appeal which
involves a questicn of fact alone, or a question
of mixed law and fact, or any other ground
which appears to -the court to be a sufficient
ground of appeal;

That seems to be the extent of the jurisdiction of the Court.
I was just now discussing the point
raised, that the institution of a Court such
as this would increase the number of appeals, and I wanted to read the answer to
that, as set forth in the resolution of the
judges who were appointed in 1892 to
inquire into this question. This is what
they say on that point:
These proposais are made in the anticipation that the number of appeals will not be
greater than the Court, constituted and acting
as suggested, will be able to deal w'ith. The
non-paymrnent. of costs, the possibility of an
increased sentence, and, after a short time, the
increased uniformity of sentences throughout
the country, and the consequent difficulty of
obtaining an alteration, will prevent hopeless
appeals.

That is what they say about it, and I
believe that that is what has worked out
in fact. Knowing what has happened in
other countries-knowing that in the United
States, in England, and in practically all
civilized countries there is an appeal on
questions of fact in criminal matters-I
think it is quite right that we should devote
some time to discussion of this very important matter and, if the majority of the

be very dangerous to submit the case to a
new trial and have him convicted by
another jury.
But there is another point. The liberty
of the subject demands here, as in England,
that anybody that bas been accused and
convicted should be afforded an opportunity
to show his innocence. As was very properly stated, if a person has been condemned to pay a sum of money, hie is ailowed to appeal, whether the conviction
was made upon the verdict rendered by a
judge, or one-rendered by h jury. Why
should hie not have the samne opportunity
in matters which are of much more importance, when his. liberty is at àtake? The
point which has been brought to our attention, that if a person bas been condemned
hie cannot 'be declared innocent even if
upon further inquiry made by the Minister
of Justice or at bis instance it is found
that bie was improperiy convicted, is to
my mind a very strong point in support
of tbe resolution propounded by tbe bonourabie genlleman (Hon. Mr. MeMeans).
We have, of course, in tbis country tbe
rigbt to appeal on questions of law. If
the evidence has been adduced the accused
may demand a reserved case. If tbe trial
judge refuses to reserve the case, bie can
be forced by a Court of Appeal to make
a reserve case, or a stated case. Therefore there is an appeal on questions of law.
But tbere are. no appeals on questions of
fact, and to my mind there sbould be bere,
as in.England, appeals on sucb questions.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, the matter wbich is before us
is introduced in the form of an inquiry
and flot as a motion.
The honourable
gentleman seems to solicit the opinion of
the Seniate, but hie concludes bis statement by a simply inquiry of the Government. I do not know wbetbe*r or not it
was bis intention to bave this adopted as
a resolution.
1t would surprise me to
learn that that was bis intention, because
the Senate passed upon this last year.
A Bill presented ,by bimself was adopted;
consequently bie bas tbe opinion of tbe
Senate as to tbe advisability of appeale
from convictions ýbeing granted.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Did we pass the
Bill last Session?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I am not
mistaken, tbe bonourable gentleman's Bill
of last year covered this very matter.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: In part, not ail. It
was not as wide a Bill.
S-Suà

483

Hlon. Mr. McME ANS: Tbe Bill of last
year was simply a Bill witb' regard to
excessive or inadequate sentences, to provide tbat tbe Court be empowered eitber
to reduce or to increase tbe sentence. It
did not deal witb the question of appeal
in any way, and under that tbe Court could
not bear facts. and could not declare a
person innocent. In tbe discussion of the
Bili1 hast year it was quite apparent that
it was a temporary measure, more tban
anytbing else, and that its scope was not
wide enough to constitute a regular Court
of Appeal.
Tbat is tbe reason wby we
bave submitted tbe present inquiry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
From tbe
inquiry wbicb is, before us I observe that
the bonourable gentleman intends to ascertain from the Goverument its opinion
as to the creation of sucb a Court of
Appeal as hie suggests. Perbaps bie could
bimself have brougbt -in a Bill enlarging
the right of appeal. If the Government
intends to move in the matter on the hunes
indicated by this inquiry, I would suggest
that, since it would be too late to do so tbis
Session, the attention of the AttorneysGeneral througbout the Dominion be
drawn to the Governxnent's intentions,
because then, I am quite sure, tbe Attorneys-Generai of the various provinces
would indicate tbe modifications tbat migbt
be nmade to the English procedure, and
valuable information could be gatbered by
the Department of Justice.
Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The subject referred to by the honourable
gentleman is the establishment of a Court
of Criminal Appeal. It seenis te me tbat
this is a matter whicb, under section 92,
subsection 14, of the British Nortb America Act, sbould ,be dealt with by the provinces. Tbe Act says:
The administration of justice in the Province,
includlng the constitution, maintenance, and
organization of the provincial courts, both of
civil and criminal jurisdiction and includiing
procedure In civil matters In those courts.

Under that section tbis matter is given
to the provincial legisiatures te deal with
and the Dominion would have. no power
to establisb courts in the various provinces. Perhaps what the bonourable gentleman intends is that the rigbt of appeal
fromn a convertion, sucb as exists in civil
cases, should be given.
As I understand it, when a man is tr;ied
by a jury no court of appeal would reverse
the finding of the jury on the facts, be cause that would be depriving the man of
bis trial by jury. Tbere is no appeal from

484

SENATE

a trial by jury in any British jurisprudence
that I know of, and the only remedy that
the court may apply is to grant a new trial
or reverse the decision, if, in their opinion,
there was no evidence to go to the jury,
or if the jury was improperly charged.
But there can be an appeal in the case of a
trial by a judge, because it is not an appeal
to a different tribunal but only to a higher
tribunal of the same class. I could never
understand why a man whose life, liberty,
or honour was at stake, should not have
as much right to appeal as a man who has
$400 or $500 at stake.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the
debate was adjourned.

JUDGES BILL
CONSID®RATION OF HOUSE OF COMMONS
DI1SAGR EEMENT-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

On the Order for the consideration of
the message from the House of Commons
disagreeing to the second and third amendments made by the Senate to Bill 60, an
Act to amend the Judges Act:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That the Senate doth not insist on the second
and third amendments made by the Senate to
Bill 60, an Act to amend the Judges Act.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I do not feel inclined to
concur in this motion and to abandon our
amendments ta the Judges Act. I read the
remarks that were made in the House of
Commons, and I could not see that any
reason- was advanced for our doing so. If
we had the assurance of the Government
that a Bill would be introduced to prevent
judges acting en arbitrations and dealing
with matters involved in the amendments,
very well, w'3 might abandon the amendments; but we are simply told that this is
not a proper way to amend the Act. But
all kinds of amendments are made to all
kinds of Acts; and if that is the only
reason the Government bas for objecting
to the amendments, personally I do not feel
inclined to vote in favour of withdrawing
them.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have given this matter a good
deal of consideration.
The amendments
were fully considered when they were
before this House, and they were voted on
and carried by a large majority. I followed
the matter in the House of Commons.
Like my honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon. M- Lynch-Staunton) I have
read what appears in their Hansard in
reference to what took place in that House,
and there is no reason given by the Minister of Justice, who appears to be the
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

only member in the House of Commons
who took any particular interest in the
matter, for disagreeing with the amendments put forward by the Senate. When
amendmhents are made to a Bill by the
Senate after full and mature consideration, we are entitled to receive from the
Commons some particularly good reason
for their declining to adopt them.
If any good reason had been advanced
one could understand why the Minister of
Justice did not concur in the amendments
which we proposed. I am rather inclined
to think that he wanted to treat the matter
in a sort of offhand way, as if the Senate
had no right to make these particular
amendments, apparently on the ground
that they were dealing with matters outside of the Bill which was then before
the House. I say this more particularly
in view of the language used by Mr.
Lemieux and also by Mr. Mowat.
Having read the discussion that took
place in the Commons, I took the trouble
to investigate the procedure and to inquire
as to what course should be taken by the
Senate or the House of Commons as the
case may be, and I am satisfied that
when amendments are proposed to an Act,
the Act is then before the particular body
discussing it, and that it has the right to
propose amendments, not only to the
clauses which are brought forward in the
Bills, but th? clauses in the Act itself.
I do not know that any one would seriously
The authorcontrovert that statement.
ities on the question are very clear, and I
do not intend to take up the time of the
House in dealing with them.
I was very much surprised to find that
our amendments had been dealt with as
they have been, and it seems to me that
if the members of this House, in view of
what took place in the Commons, should
reverse what they did a few days ago,
they would be simply stultifying themselves. That is a position that I do
not think we should be placed in. If the
amendments proposed had not been fully
considered, one could understand the
House changing its view on the question,
providing, of course, if some good reasons
were advanced for doing so; but to reverse our decision wben no reasons are
advanced for doing so would be equal to
saying that we passèd the amendments
without giving them consideration and
without fully understanding their nature.
I therefore submit, honourable gentlemen,
that, in justice to ourselves and in justice
to the position which we took, we should

MAY 17, 1921
stand by the amendments which were sent
forward to the Commons; and, so far as I
personally amn concerned, I decline to concur in the motion now before the House.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
gentlemen, this is the first.occasion in my
expérience that cither Chamber or Parliament has sent back a message refusing to
concur in an amendmient adopted by the
other House and giving no reason whatever for so doig.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes,
reasons are given.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have read the discussion, and thereis no good reason given at
ail. The pretext is that this amendment
does not fit in with'the rest of the Bihl-fs
flot germane to the Bill. It did not please
the fastidjous eye of the Minister of Justice; it is flot in the place where he would
like to have it; and that is the only reason
there is; you cannot find a shadow of any
other. I submit that the least that should
have been done hy the honourable Minister
was to indicate the reasons why he could
riot accede to the amendments. He does
not go into the merits of the question at ail;
he does not say he is against the principle of the 'amendment or for it; he simply
says: "I do not hike it where you put it.ip
There can be no doubt where this House
stands on the question, because this us by
no means the first time we have adopted
the principle émbodied in the amendment.
Last Session or the Session before the honourable gentleman from. Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross) had a Bihl to which I was
pleased to give my support, because I was
very strongly in favour of the principle
which it embodied. The Bilh was passed by
th 'is House, I think unanimously, and went
to the other H1ouse, and died there, as our
Bis often do. There can be no doubt as
to what the Senate thiihks of this subject,
because it is on record as being in favour
of the principle which we reafflrmed the
other day in ibhis Bill. It simply means
that when Bis are proposed in this House,
if they do not just suit some Minister of
the Crown, ail he bas to do is to say, "I
don't like it," and that is the end of it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, for myseif I feel like adhering to the
action of this House with regard to this
Bill. 1 do not think there is anything in
the statement of the Minister of Justice
that is worthy of attention except, perhaps
one particular point, and I do not think
there is very much in that.

.487

There was rothing irregular in what we
did. The question was raised here as to
whether we were in order in doing what we
did, and the Speaker ruled that we were;
and to my personal knowledge, during the
last fine years amendments of the samne
character Énd principie have been mnade
again and again. There was at one time a
rule that when an amendment which substantially constituted a new Bill was introduced, the amendment would not be received. But that is not the fact with regard to this legislation. The Minister of
Justice, or say the other House, had a Bill
amending the Judges Act containing certain sections. What we did was simpiy to
add another clause to the Judges Act. The
samne thing bas been done again and again;
and it bas been challenged; 'and it has
always been conceded by the majority of
this House that we had the right to do as
we have done. More than that, Bis have
corne up f rom the other House, and, after
they have corne here the Government has
introduced amendments of the saine kindsomething they have forgotten, or something some one bas suggested-and they
have been added to the Bill. Therefore I
do not agree with the statement that there
is anything irregular in what bas taken
place.
The only thing that is worth talking about
is the assertion that they cannot consider
the subject-matter as wel' in the formi of
an amendment as in an independent Bill,
Such a statement will not stand a moment's
examination, and, while 1 do not want to
use disrespectful language, to me it is almost absurd-I hope that is not too strong
-and the argument kas no validit'y at ail.
Suppose you introduced a new Bill with
one section, just one sentence, such as you
have in this amendment, the subject-matter could then be discussed in the House of
Commons as fully and elaborately on* that
amendment as if it were an independent
Bill. If that cannot he done, somebody
had better explain to us why it is that they
cannot talk of it in the shape of an amendment just as well as they could in the shape
of a new Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was the subject
flot discussed in the other House on its
merits?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: No. The Government
were cautions not to express an opinion
about it; but one or two members say they
are in favour of what lies back of that
amendment. There seems to be cropping

488

SENATE

up in the lower House an expression of
opinion in accord with the action of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is what I
meant.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Oh, yes, that has
been made clear.
I want to speak about the way we have
been treated by the lower House. Three
Bills have gone from this House to the
lower House, and that is the last that we
have heard of them. Now it is being suggested that we prepare a new Bill, and send
that. Well, there is no reason to suppose
that that would not go the way of those
other three Bills-into the waste basket
of the Minister of Justice, or whatever
other Minister takes the matter up. I
think that that is not very good treatment
of this House. I for one have always resented it, as I resent it now; and, as far
as I am personally concerned, I feel like
adhering to the amendment, because we
have the Bill, and they have to deal with
it; they cannot put it into the waste basket
without putting the whole Bill in, and that
is one way we have of keeping ourselves
right with the other House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
reciprocity.

Hear, hear;

Hon. W. B. ROSS:
If they will
not treat the Bills that we send down there
with ordinary respect, then we have the
matter in our own hands, to take care of
their Bills when they come up here.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I would ask the
honourable member for Hamilton, who is
so strong an advocate of this amendmeht,
this question: does the honourable gentleman maintain that the clause which limits
the jurisdiction of provincial parliaments
ismot ultra vires? We have in the Province
of Quebec statutes giving the right to the
Government to appoint judges to make
inquiries in connection with municipalities,
and several inquiries have been made in the
Province of Quebec under that statute.
Can Parliament pass a law the effect of
which would be to limit the jurisdiction of
a provincial parliament, and do away with
statutes which have been passed by those
Provincial Parliaments?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
As I
understand the honourable gentleman's
question, he asks me whether or not the
parliament of Canada has jurisdiction to
prohibit their appointees, the judges, from
acting in any capacity other than that to
Son. W. B. ROsa

which they are appointed. My opinion,
whatever it is worth, is that the Dominion
Government bas that tpower; but 'if a
provincial government were to pass an Act
making those duties a part of the duties
of the judges as a whole, of the court to
which they are appointed-in other words,
if they attach those duties of making inquiries to the court-then it might be a
very serious question whether they had not
that power. But the Dominion Government,
if it bas the right to appoint.the judges,
can limit them to that office if it chooses,
as it appears to me. It can say who
may be appoirited, and that men who do
not act in other capacities shall alone be
entitled to exercise judicial functions in
the province. It appears to me that it
bas that right: it bas exercised it from
of old. Every Government from 1896 bas
assumed that it bas that right, and I never
heard of anybody challenging it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? If a
law of a province were so drafted that the
duties of an ordinary commissioner would
become the duties of an ordinary court, I
understand that would be altogether outside of the provision that we want to put
in this Bill?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
tainly.

Cer-

Hon. Mr. .BEAUBIEN: Therefore it
seems to me the question that you put,
with all due respect, does not apply.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Not
the question I put; the answer I made
agrees with you.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The evidence of
that appears very clearly when a judge
in the Province of Quebec is obliged to
make an inveýtigation-in a corporation,
for instance; therefore it is the plain duty
of the judge, though it is a commission
that he holds.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
does not sit as a judge at all.

He

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In such a case
he bas not only the right but the duty
and obligation to go on the investigation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How does the
obligation arise?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: By a petition.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Under a statute?

MAY 17, 1921
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Under a statute;
and there the Government bas made this
duty judicial, which otherwise would be
the duty of a commissioner.
Hon. Mr. LYNCI--STAUNTON:
But
there is no statute making it a duty.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know there
is no statute covering what we in this
House want to eliminate jbut I say that
if there were a law in the Province of Quebec that woùld make any such duty a
judicial duty, then of course it would be
absolutely outside of what we want to
provide against; therefore we do nlot need
to bother about it.
Hon..Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Has the province the right to say what is judicial
dutyT
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No. This is the fact,
that the province bas a right to constitute,
the court, and it puts the -matter into
court. There xnay be a dispute between
two, municipalities, and the province may
decide that that shall be tried in a court,
as part of the work of a court. No one
dbjects te tha't. That 'would be taken into
concern along with other matters; it may
be the duty of Judge A or Judge B or
Judge C. No one wants to interfere with
that. But this is another thing altogether;
it relates to the appointment of judges
te extra duties-duties outside -of
the
courts altogether.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think we should
adhere to our ainendment, which I think
is the best that- bas ever been made to
prevent judges f rom doing things that do
not pertain to 'their office. Let them stay
in the courts as long as they remain in
office; they are ail right there, and have
the respect of the community; but when they
become arbitrators they lower their office,
and people have no more confidence
them.
I could cite thc -case of two judgesinin Ontario who have been investigating some
timber limits, and it la awful to read what
bas been said about them in the papers
and on the floor of the legisiature. It bas
lowered the bench in Ontario, and it bas
been taken up -in this House. If there
ever was a good amendment made in the
Senate during the twenty years I have been
here, it is that amendiment to prevent
judges from doing business that is flot
judges' work. As long as they do judges'
work the provinces have a right to tell
them what they are to do.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Yes. It is worse
than that, te-) because there are judges

489

who do not want to be dragged into the
dirt of political and extra-judicial duties,
yet who are i orced to perform them, and
are complàiniig of it. There are many
complaints frt m judges, and I think weý
ought to help them out.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think my
honourable frcend would not object te a
concrete ins.,ance from Saskatchewan.
The judges of our Distriet Court are made
the arbitrators for the assessment of
certain danmage cases against municipalities. 0f course, they are so named by
virtue of the 1ýct of the Province. I know
that none of uz object to that, but I would
like to ask, is it the right of the Province
to say that that is a judicial duty?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The moment they
assign it to the judges they make it a
judicial duty at once, provided it is assigned to those judges en masse.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is no
jurisdiction imposed on the legisiature as
to what it will refer to the courts. There
is no reason why disputes between two
municipalities should not be a judicial
function just as much as it would bé between my honourable friend and myseif.
When it is done by statute it could not
possibly come under the operation of this
amendment.
Hon. Sir JAM4ES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, 1 ami going to ask for the
adjournment oi this debate until to-morrow. We have a lengthy Order Paper before us, and this discussion is going to run
along constitutional lines, and a great deal
of ingenuity i going to be exercised to
show how the action of the House of'Comnmeons can be circumvented, and aIl that
kind of thing. In the meantime 1 shall
have the plensure of directing the attention of the Minister of Justice to the illuminating arguments which have been presented in behaîf of the amendments, and
possibl t-morrow we may be able to
throw a little more light on the subject. 'I
therefore move the adjournment of the
consideration of the message until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is the honourable leader sinvere in his compliments?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
I shaîl know better to-morrow.

Well,

On the motion of Hon. Sir

BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 118, an Act
to amend The Bankruptcy Act. He said:
Although this is apparently a lengthy
Bill, it is not as formidable as it
seems to be upon the' face of it.
There are a great number of amendments being made to the Act as it stands
upon the statute book. Many of the old
sections are being repealed, and replaced
by entire secth ns which appear in this Bill.
The amendments chiefly relate to procedure.
The Act has been in operation for a couple
of years, and from the experience gained
in its operation many suggestions have
been presented to the Department of Justice, and this Bill is very largely the outcome. There is no departure in principle
from the Bankruptcy Act as it at present

stands on the statute book, and we can consider the amendments very much better in
committee than by any explanation I might
make at this time. I therefore move the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have gone
over this Bill, and I think there are a
number of amendments which are very
important. I was going to ask for an explanation of some of them, but, as suggested, I presume we can take all those
questions up in committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
is the best place for them.

That

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have received
letters asking to have this Bill amended in
a certain way when it came up. The objection, I dnderstand, is to the principle of
this Bill, because it appears that in the province of Quebec, under the operation of this
Bill, a merchant doing business, say in
Rimouski, could assign in any place in that
province which he might choose; and, as
many creditors would be for small amounts,
if the liquidator were not absolutely honest
and wanted to connive with the bankrupt,
they could arrange the assignment in a
locality to which the people could not go
on account of the expense, and thus small
creditors would have to forego their claims.
I saw the Minister of Justice about this,
and he thought that that provision was
very wrong and should be amended, though
I do not know whether or not it could
be, because in other provinces the system
is different. On its face, it does not look
right that a man should have the privilege
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

of assigning in another district than the
one in which he does business, and in a
place so far away as to put him beyond
the reach of the creditors.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Bring

SUSPENSION OF RULES
MOTION

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I was going to ask my honourable
friend if he intended to press that motion
to-day. I do not know how the business
coming before Parliament stands at the

491

MAY 18, 1921.
present time, but apparently we have not
on the Order Paper so iuch business that
it is necessary to move the suspension of
the rules. I do not want to stand in the
way of the Government proceeding with
necessary business, but I do think that the
rules should be amaintained, and not suspended, until it is absolutely necessary to
suspend them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to my honourable friend that it
is very desirable, for the purpose of
expediting the business before Parliament,
to pass the motion which I have placed on
the Order Paper, inasmuch as there are
a great number of private Bills that have
come or will come before the House, and
the probabilities are that they will have
to be dropped unless this motion is passed.
I have been informed this morning that
there is a probability of Parliament proroguing at an earlier date than we anticipated: from all I can learn, there is
every probability of Parliament proroguing
next week. Even if the motion passes, it
cannot be subject to abuse, because if it
becomes apparent that any injustice would
be done or that the public business would
suffer by the suspension of the rules, any
honourable gentleman will have the opportunity of moving that this shall not apply
to any Bill in question. I think it is very
desirable that this motion should be
passed.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND FREIGHT
RATES
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. B. C. PROWSE: Honourable
gentlemen, I wish to draw the attention
of the Government to a certain article that
appeared in the Ottawa Journal on Saturday last, which reads as follows:
Senator Prowse in the Senate yesterday
drew the attention of the Goverrnment to the
prohibitive freight rates in effect in Prince
Edward Island.
There was a surplus of a
million -bushels of potatoes which could not be
marketed because of these high rates. Potatoes were selling for 17 cents a bushel, while
the freight rates to the nearest markets in
Nova Scotia were 43 cents per 100 pounds.
Sir James Lougheed, speaking for the Government, said that although Parliament was
the place to air grievances he had to remind
him-

That is myself-that
this was a matter for the Railway
Board.
The Government had no authority
over rates.

This statement, to my mind, 'honourable
gentlemen, is absolutely out of order and
misleading. Naturally the general public
would suppose that there was no answer
to this statement coming from the leader
of the Government. We know that there
is an answer, but the general public outside
do not know that there is. Any person
knowing the leader of the Government
would certainly take his word. I would,

SENATE

Legally the rates of the P.E.T. and I.C.R. are
not under our control. I am, however, forwarding a copy of your letter to the Canadian
National authorities in Toronto.

We have the leader of the Government
saying that the Government has no authority; we have the Chief Commissioner of
the Railway Board saying that they have
no authority. Now, what we want to know,
and what the country wants to know, is,
who, in Heaven's name, has got authority?
We know of cases in which the Government bas stepped in before now. We do not
want to create a precedent. A few years
ago there was a shortage of the hay crop
in Prince Edward Island, and our cattle and
horses were starving for the want of hay.
What did the Government do? They stepped
in and delivered hay to Prince Edward
Island absolutely free all the way from
Quebec. In the West, when the farmers in
Alberta and Saskatchewan had two or three
crop failures, the Government stepped in
and supplied the seed wheat for those
farmers.
Here is a case of emergency, in which
the people not only in Prince Edward
Island but also in New Brunswick have a
surplus crop of potatoes. The people down
in the mines do not grow potatoes and they
need our potatoes. The people of Newfoundland, who do not grow potatoes, need
our potatoes. There is no reason why the
Government should not act immediately in
this matter. There is no use in shifting
from pillar to post and throwing the responsibility from one department to another.
I say, honourable gentlemen, it is time for
action. We do not want answers from the
floor of the House or through the papers; it
is action on the part of the Government
that we want. As I have said, those cars
come up from the mines-from the Sydneys
and Glace Bay and various other localities
-filled with coal, and they go back absolutely empty. Those cars can be filled with
potatoes, and it will not cost the country
one cent to carry the potatoes absolutely
free to the people down there who want
them. It can be done. Not only that, honourable gentlemen, but there are hundreds
of cars that come to the Island loaded with
dry goods, groceries, fertilizers, etc., and
in which there is nothing to be shipped off
the Island at present except potatoes.
There is no reason why those cars should
not be shipped back full, if the freight rate
were made a nominal one.
I do not wish to take up too much of the
time of the House, or to become a bore; but
I would like just to give you some idea of
Hon. Mr. PROWSE.

the high rates. The freight rate on coal
from Sydney to Charlottetown is 16 cents
per cwt. The freight rate on potatoes from
Charlottetown to Sydney is 43 cents per
cwt. Why should that difference be? The
people of Sydney want our potatoes as
much as we want their coal. They cannot
do without our potatoes; neither can we get
along without their coal. From Springhill mines coal is delivered in Charlottetown
at 11 cents per cwt. The rate on potatoes
from Charlottetown to Springhill is 35i
cents per cwt. Why should that difference
be? There is absolutely no excuse for it.
This is a question for the Government to
take up, and the party responsible for these
rates should be called up. In conclusion,
honourable gentlemen, I want to mention
that I have here a telegram from a party
in St. John, which shows you that this
matter is attracting notice not merely in
Prince Edward Island, but also in New
Brunswick:
Press despatches state Sir James Lougheed
claims Government had no control over freight
rates. We understand Governmen!t can and
should absolutely control all Intercolonial rates,
and any other control is not in accord with Confederation promises. Have wired Sir James
Lougheed to this effect.
(S.gned)
H. R. MeLennan,
Secretary Commercial Club, St. John, N.B.

I do not want to take up any more time,
honourable gentlemen, but I would ask the
Government not to drop this thing by
making an excuse. I would ask them to
act in this matter. And I would not waste
any time in correspondence; I would spend
a few dollars in telegrams to have the rates
adjusted, because every day that is lost now
means a loss of thousands of dollars to the
producer, the shipper, and also the consumer, who has to pay too high a price. The
adjustment of the freight rates, by lowering the price, would help the producer, the
shipper, and the consumer. Every day that
is lost there are thousands of bushels of
potatoes going to waste, and in a few weeks'
time they will have to be dumped out. I
thank you, honourable gentlemen, and am
sorry for having taken up so much of the
time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
say to my honourable friend that it is
possible there may be some misunderstanding as to the authority for fixing rates in
Prince Edward Island and upon the Intercolonial generally. The policy of Parliament, as embodied in the Act touching our
National Railway System, is that all rates
I
shall be fixed by the Railway Board.

MAY 18, 1921
understand that that provision wili corne
into operation by proclamation at a very
early date. In the meantime, I arn informed by the Minister of Railways,
authority was given to the Railway Bo'ard
on behaif of the Government to fix freight
rates on the Intercolonial, inchuding the
Prince Edward Island Railway. If the
Chairman of the Railway Board does not
act, hie probably cannot be compelled to
act; but I was under the impression, as
was the Minister of Railways, that he was
prepared to assurne that authority.
-I shaîl be very glad to direct the attention of the Government to the remarks
made by rny honourable friend frorn Charlottetown (Hon. Mr. Prowse).. It is a
situation which. should be met by prompt
action. I quite agrée with hirn in that
respect.

NATIONAL RESEARCH BILL
,SECOND

READING

The Senate resurned fromn Thursday,
May 12, consideration of the motion for
the second reading of Bill 116, an Act to
amend the Research Council Act and to
establish a National Research Instit ite.
Hon. J. P. B. CAS GRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, at 6 o'clock on Thursday hast,
I was discussing the advýisability and the
great probability in the near future of
the use of sailing ships for freight in
place of steamers, and I us just about to
say that srnall Diesel engines, with srnaii
power, would propel these shi-ps in a calrn
at a speed of four or five knots an hour.
Still, that is equal to 100 miles a day and
would bring any ship out of a calm area
to where there, was a breeze. These Diesel
engines would be very inexpensive, for the
great consumption of fuel in the propulsion of a ship is aitogether due to the high

493

speed. Take for instance the Mauretania.
Going at full speed, it covers 26 knots an
hour and consumes 1,000 tong of coal a
day. The Mauretania, leaving Liverpool
in September, 1919, was taking on coal at
100 shillings, practically $25, a ton, and
was burning 1,000 tons or $25,000 worth
of coal a day, when steaming at the rate
of 26 knots an hour. After the ship got
away froin the coast of England, the cost
of coal having been found excessive, the
speed was reduced to 23 knots or 26 miles
an hour, a speed equal to that of an ordinary passenger train, which has to make
frequent stops.
By the -reduction of
speed by 3 knots an hour the consumption
of coal was reduced by 500 tons a day,
which shows that it is the last few knots
that cause the high consumption of coal.
Approaching the shores of America, the
Mauretania, desiring to arrive in New
York at 6, o'clock in the evening instead of
9 o'clock, put on full speed again for 24
hours, in order to gain 86 or 87 miles, and
that increase of speed by three knots cost
the cornpany $12,500 additional in coal.
I arn speaking in favour of a Bill presented
by the Government, and do not want
honourable gentlemen to think, that I amn
straying away from the subject.
This Bill provides:
The Institute shall bave charge of:
(a) researches undertaken to promuote the
utilization of the natural resources of Canada.

You gee, that embraces a great deal. I
skip over sub-clause b. The next paragraph provides for:
(c) researches undertaken with the vew of
utilizing the waste products of said industries.

I promise, honourable gentlemen, that I
will not go beyond the scope of this Bill.
Skipping paragraphs d and e and coming
to paragraph f, we find:
The investigation and standardization at the
request of any of the industries of Canada of
the materials which are or may be used in, or
of the products of, the Industries making such
a request.

I have already deait with the coal situation. Honourablemembers of this House
may ask: if coal is so dear, why flot use
petroleum,, as Vhey are doing during the
great strike in England at present, when
the rniners will not produce coal? But
there is a strange thing about petroleum.we will not enter into a discussion of that:

cinders from the coal, falling on the white

The company therefore changed from coal

good deal of money. The production of
petroleum can easily bie carried on. May
I be allowed to quote from a recent statement by Sir Edward MacKay Edgar:
"In ten years' timË America will be forced
to boy annually from Great Britain 500 million
barrels off oit." This is a most startling prediction, and, if it be fulfllled, might spell disaster
to many off our interests.

Sir Edward MacKay Edgar has caused a
great stir, especially in the United States,
and bas considerably affected the Imperial
policy in Persia. At present there are
being used in the United States, roughly
speaking, about 31 barrels of petroleuin
yearly per capita; that is, 350,000,000 barrels. If Nwe assume that the increase in
the use of ýpetroleum will in future be the
samne as it bas been in the last 20 years,

of the process. That is one thing to which
this Department of Scientific Research
might very well devote some attention.
It would be a wise provision if, besides
the Advisory Council, this honourable
House appointed a Committee of some men
who have devoted some attention to scientific research to advise with the Advisory
Council. These people are very likely to
go into questions of research for the
pie asure of looking 'Into things that are not
absolutely of interest or use to the publie.
The Director of the Advisory Council will
be like a Deputy Minister in this new
Department, and a Commîttee of this
bouse such as I propose would be very
useful. They could tell them that before
they go into new researches they should
apply to the Bureau of Standards in
Washington and find what they know, and
how far they have gone. That Bureau has
been in existence for many years and has
made great advances. Then some one
could be sent to Europe to find out what
they are doing in England and France, and
lastly in Germany, where, as we ail know,
industrial processes have been developed to
a very great degree.
The next subject which this new Department could take up is Aids to Navigation.
We are par excellence a country which is
sure to have a large liavy, It has been
kiiown alI ovter thec world since the days of
Carthage that no country bas become
great without a navy-I do not mean a
military navy, but a merchant marine.
0f course, a war navy may become necessary to, defend the merchant marine; but
a country to become great must have a
navy.
I have here a description of another aid
to navigation to which I caîl the attention
of this new Department, and which I ýbelieve would be of great use. Like many
other things that I arn referring to to-day,
it is not new at ahl, but simply seenis to
have been forgotten by the large majority
of the members present. This is the leader
gear, a Canadian invention:
What is technically known as Leader Gear
or Leader Cable for guiding vessels in and out
off harbors or in, channels and rivers which
rendered such useful services during the war
was invented by two MeGili University professors: Dr. R. B. Owens, now secretary of the
Franklyn Institute, Philadeiphia. U.S.A., and
Dr. L:. A. Herdt, Head of the Department off
Electrical Engineering, MoGili University, Montreal.
The Leader Gear consists essentlitAly in a
cable laid at the bottom of the sea or river.

in or out of a harbor or to pilot It along the
course of a river can do so with perfect security
as the deviation of the s'hip from the laid-out
course (marked biy the submerged cable) is
given by visible indicators which point in feet
the distance right or left from the subme'rged
cable.
Such electric cables were laid by the British
Àdmiralty in the harbors of Great Britain
during the war, and fog, snowstorms, enemy
sumarines, and mines lost much of their intense danger under such conditions.
This device, initlated by Canadians, has not
yet been adopted in Canada.
In 1904 experiments were carried out on the
'St. Lawrence ship channel by Professor L. A.
Herdt, of McGilI University, under authority
of the Department of Marine and Fisheries, ta
try out this guiding systeni.
A submerged
cable was laid out from 'Sorel into the St.
Lawrence river.
The cable was fine miles in
These experiments were witnessed by
the Hon. R. PrOfontaine, Minister of Marine,
in 1904, and proved without a doubt that the
device employed enabled the pilo' of a steamer
t
ta locate exactly the position of his ship in
a channel within a few feet-the center of the
navigable channel being marked out by a submerged electric cable.
The Department of Marine is fully conversant with this system, which would render
great services ta navigation, and is particularly
adaptable as an aid ta navigation la the St.
Lawrence river.

~length.

I may say here that a cable like this in
the bad places in the St. Lawrence river
would soon bring down the high insurance
rates of which we hear so much complaint,
because Lloyds' rates every year are
fixed according to figures based on the
last preceding period.
It would enable navigation ta be extended
a month earlier in the spring, and could be
carried out much later la the autumn. The
cost of installation is quite sniall. Fog, snowscost of installation is qulte smali. Fog, snowstornis, bends on the river, wouid lose their
danger wlth the systeni la operation. It could
be used with great advantage in enterlng
Halifax hai'bor, Vancouver, St. John, and, in
the 'St. Lawrence river at the dangerous spots
where numerous groundings have taken place.
This Leader Cable is now being Installed la
the entrance of the New 'York harbour, following exhaustive tests carrled out by the United
States Navy.
The French Ministry of Marine has decided
ta lay down a cable in ail French ports and
across the Bnglish channel in collaboration
with the British Admiralty.
Shlps will steer
safely into port la the densest of foge.
We may well ask what is Canada going to
do? Will an Invention by Canadians be appreciated last la 'Canada?

What drew my attention to this
leader gear -was the fact that the French
Admiralty had done a great deal of
advertising of the fact that a cable had
beep laid in the harbour of Brest, France,
and that ships had entered that harbour
in dense fogs without any difficulty what-

495

soever. It bas also been suggested that
two of these cables should ha laid across
the British channel, parallel to one another, and at sufficient distance apart to
guard against accident. A ship going from
England to France would follow the cabie
to the south, and a shtp going from Francêi
to England the 'one to, the north, and in the
densest fog they could cross with the
greatest ease without fear of collision. As
I say, this system. rwas in operation in
Canada eig'hteen years ago, but it bas neyer
been accepted in this country. These cables
were laid in the mine fields during the
war, and, ships fQllowed the cables; and
even if a man were blindfolded hie could
steer a ship, because n-ot only do the indicators show the position of the ship, but
there is also a bell ringing, and the intensity of the ringing increases as the ship
gets away ta the right or ta the left of
the cable.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I should like to
ask the honourable gentleman if that invention would not be very useful for the
navigation of the Hudson bay?.
Hon. ýSir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, do
not ask this honourable gentleman.
Hon. M~'r. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman from Portage la Prairie (Hon.
Mr. Watson) asked me that question sotto
voce just now, but, as this is. a rather
difficuit subject, and as I am following
notes from books, I would rather not be
disturbed at present. Ail this is just as
new to me as it is to, some of my honourable coîreagues.
But there is another aid to navigation,
a most marvellous onde, and it is good in
the open sea. This aid toi navigation makes
use of sound waves. We ail know the
shorter the ways the higher the note.
Thesle waves are so short and the notes
sa high tbat they are inaudible ta the
human ear; but they will pass not; only'
through the air but through the water,
and, strange ta, say, they pass through
the water with greater rapidity, and will
indicatle the presence of an iceberg anywhere within a radius of 5 miles of a ship.
These sound waves strike the side, of the
iceberg and rebound back ta, the ship,
where a iprecision instrument w'ill ' tell
exactly or very nearly the distance and
the direction from the ship in which the
iceberg lies. This device was used during
the war. One of the gentlemen who, has
given me this information said he thought
that.perhaps I should not make it public,
because the Germans would get hold of
it; but then hae said the Germans probably

SENATE
knew it already, so there was no danger.
This mechanism was so perfect that it
could detect a submarine; it could detect
the submarine even if t was against a
wall or embedded in rocks, and it could
detect it either still or in motion.
These are two aids to navigation which
our Research Committee could very weil
inquire into to see whether they are practical and commercial.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Will this device
tell the nationality of the submarines?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The next thing,
and a very important one, in view of the
cost of fuel, is industrial alcohol. We all
know that alcohol, after water, is the very
best solvent of any other liquid. This
industrial alcohol makes a very superior
fuel, and for chafing dishes, for spirit
lamps, and for all sorts of uses it is the
very best substance that can be had. But
a greater use that can be made of such
alcohol is for motor cars. It is, I am informed, much better than gasoline, and it
will give more miles to the gallon. Honourable gentlemen all know that the post office
of the United States bas been sending their
mail by aeroplane for the last three years
daily without interruption from New York
to Washington, a distance of I think some
220 or 250 miles. The aeroplanes in that
service have never used anything lut alcohol as fuel, because alcohol, it appears,
will not carbonize the spark plugs; 'it
keeps them clean.
The United States Bureau of Standards
says that alcohol extraction from cokeoven gas is commercially possible. The
Cleveland Institute of Engineers in England says the same thing, and àt adds
that alcohol can be made from almost
anything. Here in Canada wood waste is
the very cheapest thing from which we
can make alcohol. To give this House an
idea of the quantity of alcohol that is being
made in the United States, I may say that
there is one plant there which manufactures 60,000 gallons a day of pure alcohol.
The great trouble with that manufacture
is that the alcohol is perfectly good, potable alcohol, and it bas to be denatured,
that is to say, given a bad taste and poison
put into it so that people will not use it
as a beverage. It was difficult to find
something cheap to denature this alcohol,
and ethyl alcohol was used. Ethyl alcohol
is made directly from wood; it is a very
simple way of making alcohol. You simply
put the wood into a red-hot retort, and the
vapour which comes out of the wood makes
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

ethyl alcohol, which is poisonous, and Iby
adding 10 per cent of the poisonous alcohol
to the pure alcohol you get the alcohol
which can be brought into the trade. This
one mill in manufacturing 60,000 gallons
makes a return in money, at around 40
cents a gallon, of $8,760,000 a year. There
is no reason in the world why we should
not do the same thing in Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
is that made from?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: From wood.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
thousand gallons?

Sixty

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Sixty thousand
gallons daily from wood. We could have
many of these mills in this country, and
could effect a saving by using wood alcohol
in place of gasoline for our motors. We
could keep our money in Canada, and on
the exchange alone to-day we could save
over $1,000,000.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS:
mill situated?

Where is that

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I should be very
glad if any honourable gentleman takes
enough interest in this matter to ask me
afterwards. I have all the notes and clippings from the papers here, and would be
very glad to show any honourable gentleman my authorities. Naturally I cannot
go fully into the subject. My honourable
friend to my left has reminded me, "Do
not take too long," so I must cut short
my remarks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend is perhaps referring to me. I
told him that if he had many subjects to
touch upon he might limit his remarks on
each to what is absolutely necessary;
because otherwise his exposition might
take too many days.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: May I ask the
honourable gentleman, what would be the
output of that mill on which a million
dollars would be saved on exchange?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I said, and I
shall be very glad to repeat, that they
make 60,000 gallons of pure alcohol every
day.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Where is that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have the paper
here. I mentioned that a minute ago. To
manufacture this alcohol in Canada would
mean a saving to us of $8,760,000 a year.
That same amount in American money,

MAY 18, 1921
at the exehange rate prevailing to-day, is
worth $1,000,000 more; so we would save
$1,000,000 in exchangle
alone, besides
keeping the $8,000,000 in this country, if
that were manufactured in Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, that nul is in
the States?
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Whgt State is it
in?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: With regard to
ethyl alcohol for motor fuel, 50 tons of
sawdust will -make 500 gallons daily or
175,000 gallons yearly, in a~ plant that
would cost $50,000. This statement appears
ia Government publication, in which
honourable gentlemen can find it il they
wish: it is the Report of the Administrative Chairman of the Honorary Advisory
Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research of Canada for the year ending
March 31, 1920. The receipts from the
manufacture of this pure alcohol would be,
at 30 cents a gallon, over $52,000.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Has the honourable gentleman addressed his mind to this
question: the gathering together of the
sawdust from the different milis?'
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Yes. I will corne
to that in a moment. I wouldi remind
honourable gentlemen, in answer to the
very point raised by the honourable member from Kings and Albert <Hon. Mr.
Fowler), that there would be no long haul
necessary. For years and years, adjacent
to our sawrnills, there wHi be burners; and
for the making of alcohol the wood is even
better than the sawdust into which it is
reduced.
There is also industrial alcohol made
from sulphite liquor waste. Not long ago
honourable members of this House visited
Grand'Mêre at the kind invitation of the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
R. S. White), and they saw there those
huge digesters. The chips are blown into
those digesters. They are about an inch
or an inch and a quarter in length, according to the choice of the mill, and they are
put under a very high steam pressure,
with a littie suiphurous acid, which eats
the gum which holds the fibres of the wood
together. Consequently the fibres are left
just like so much cotton or so much oakum,
and they form the warp and woof of
newsprint paper, which, 'when made, is
filled ift with ordinary wood-pulp-simply
ground wood, with no chemicals at ail in
it. There is one part of chemical pulp to
S-32

497

three parts of wood-pulp in the ordinary
newsprint. It has not very much consistency, because there is, as littie as possible
of sulphite pulp put into it, sulphite pulp~
being as a rule twice as expensive as the\
ordinary w.ood-pulp.
But, when this is
done, at the bottom of those huge digesters
that honourable gentlemen nuay have seen
there is the sulphite liquor, and this sulphite liquor is the part of the wood that
is turned into sugar. In the St. Maurice
valley there are two firms, the Laurentide
Paper Company at Grand'Mère and the
Belgo-Canadian Pulp and Paper Comnpany
at Shawinigan Falls, about five miles
fromn there, who can supply without any
cost-thjs thing is not used at ahl now,
but is lost-2,000,000 pounds of this sulphite liquor waste. I have not at the
moment the exact figure showing the nurnber of gallons of pure alcohol it would
make. The cost of making it 'would be 40
cents a gallon, and it would be 95 per cent
pure. And again-the irony of fate-lt
would be absolutely, good alcohol, but, I
arn sorry to say, it would have to be denatured and rendered so that we could not
drink it; it wouald have to be mixed with
wood alcohol for use in industry. I may
say that the governments throughout the
world have always been chary about permitting any industrial plant to make alcohol from any of those produets, because no
matter how. much the alcohol is denatured,
no matter how much you extract from it,
or what a bad taste you give to it, or how
much poison you put into it, a very ordinary chemist can extract that poison or
that bad taste, and again it is good alcohol.
Governrnents have always tried to prevent
the manufacture of alcohol in that way;
but Germany has gone, ahead so far that
in that country at present there are 2,000,000 gallons of industrial alcohol made
annually, and during the war the quantity inanufactured was considerahle. This
alcohol is largely used also in the making
of explosives, and during the war we
suffered from that to a great extent.
Another thing that costs nothing, and
which this new departrnent might develop,
is blasting with liquid oxygen.
Now,
liquid oxygen costs absolutely nothing. It
is extracted from, the air simply by decomposing the air. Simply by having the
air in a chamber and by sending through
that chamber a stro'ng electric current,
the air is immediately decomposed, the nitrogen coming out on the positive pole and
the oxygen coming out on the «negative pole.
Those are the two, outlets. 'The oxygen

under pressure becomes liquid, and once it
is liquid it loses its pressure; there is
absolutely no pressure in the liquid form.
It is put into a bucket or any other receptacle, and all that it is necessary to do is to
soak in it any porous substance, such as
wool, cotton, or even paper, for about
fifteen minutes, so that it is well saturated,
and this will keep for at least 24 hours.
It is used instead of dynamite, and it bas
a strength that is 40 per cent greater than
that of dynamite. There is not all the
danger which is present in transporting
dynamite from place to place, exposing the
lives of people. Besides, as I say, it costs
so little that it was possible to manufacture
it all through the war. The Germans had
motor trucks the engines of which they
used for the liquefaction of oxygen, and
nearly all the blasting in tunnels during
the war was done with this liquid oxygen,
that cost nothing. This bas not been used

absolutely new invention.
I come now to the question of chemical
fertilizers. These have not been as much
used in Canada as they should have been.
It is not because they were not known.
I find in Hansard of May 12, 1908:
Smelting by Electricity
The process of electrie smelting is based
simply on the enormous temperature produced
by the electric furnace. The ores fuse and the
oxygen which they contain is driven off as gas,
leaving the pure molten metal behind.
It is different in principle from smelting
with coke, where the carbon of the burning
coke first combines with one atom of oxygen
of the air, making carbon monoxide, and then
with another atom of oxygen from the ore
which does not fuse, forming carbonic acid gas
and escaping as such from the furnace. The
exygen of the ore is thus slowly taken up by
the carbon of the coke until nothing but the
metal is left in a molten state.
Production of Nitrates by Electric Power
Another use of electric power is fixing, as it
is called, atmospheric nitrogen so as .to
it available for fertilizing agricultural lands
in precisely the same way that the famous
nitrates from Chili and the guano from Peru
are used.

4nake

We all know that before this fixation of
nitrogen, ships, mostly wooden sailing
ships, were sent to Chili. Evidently, in
ages gone by, Chili must have been a wet
country. Now, as we know, in most parts
of Chili along the coast it never rains. In
the olden days, however, it must have been
a wet country with lakes. These lakes
have dried up and left, at the bottom deposits of nitrates; for there are plenty of
nitrates in the water. The nitrates were
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

taken to Europe and sold there, years ago,
at about $40 a ton. That practice has been
given up, because in Europe, especially in
Norway, where water power was cheap,
electricity could be obtained at as low a
rate as $5 per horse power a year. But
years ago the atmosphere was used in the
making of fertilizers.
The atmosphere contains an inexhaustible
supply of nitrogen, but in an inert form as the
scientists say, that is, it is not taken up readily
by plants, or rather by the bacteriae through
which they feed on nitrogen. The best means
have always been to supply the nitrogen to
the ground in the form of a soluble salt, and
hitherto only nitrate and guano, and animal or
vegetable manure have been used, because
chemists had fiot found the way to produce
nitrogen salts out of atmospheric nitrogen.
But, by means of the terrifie temperature of
the electrie furnace, that long sought result bas
been achieved, and the production of nitrate
from atmospheric nitrogen is to-day an industrial fact in Norway. At such temperature,
the recalcitrant nitrogen combines with lime
and makes a soluble salt, that is, all that is
necessary for the purposes of fertilizing.
And those eminently useful applications of
the electric furnace are only recent developments.

Mark you, honourable gentlemen, that
was 13 years ago.

I would like to know what progress lias
been made in Canada. Those words were
spoken in this Chamber in 1908, but there
was no department to take up the question
of the development of the inexhaustible
quantity of power in the country. Of the
25,000,000 horse-power which exist in Canada, 17,000,000 are in Quebec. I do not
believe there are more than 2,000,000 developed-Hon. Mr.
000,000.

FOWLER:

There are

13,-

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In Quebec. It
would have been quite feasible to make all
the fertilizer required, and the effect would
have been to increase consiterably the
yield per acre, not only in the eastern
provinces, but even in the West.
Here is another development, and this is
a new one. I do not think that it is known.
Instead of using electricity to obtain the
nitrates from the atmosphere, they are obtained by tremendous pressures. Here is
an article entitled, "Azote for the Land of
France." I may say that "azote" is a perfectly good English word. The gas is generally called nitrogen, but it should be called
azote. The nitrogen-if you like-is ob-

tained from the air through the action of
electricity.
This invention is due to
Monsieur Georges Claude, at Montereau,
an the banks of the Seine. *The factory is
located in an aid shed that was used during
the war for the making of asphyxiating
gases. The liquid nitrogen is formed at.a
temperature of 150 degrees below zero. In
the presence of the reporters of the journal
froni which I arn taking this information,
L'Illustration, M. Glande drew a bucketful
of this liquid, and spilled it on an iran
bucket, whirh immediately became covered
with ice, making the air ail about intensely
cold. By accident-not while the reporter
was there, but shortly before-some one
dropped a lighted candie into a bucket of
this liquid, and there was a terrible explosion. The inventor, M. Claude, nearly
lost his eyesight.
This new fertilizer is made with liquid
nitrogen and hydrogen, froni the decomposition of water. The mixture is one part
of nitrogen to three parts of hydrogen. I
may say the liquid hydrogen is obtained
under very high pressure, and because of
the fear of explosions the process is carried
on in the open air. The one part of
nitrogen and the three parts of hydrogen
are brought together by very small tubes
*and put under very high pressure. They
are compressed first at from 200 ta 250
atmospheres, in one receptacle, and they
are compressed again, in anather receptacle
at from 900 ta 1,000 atmospheres. As an
atmrosphere is 14f pounds, honourable gentlemen wiil see that the pressure is equal
to that of gunpDwder in the bore of the
biggest cannons that were used in the war.
It may be asked, but how did they get
such a pressure? It is very simple. The
pressure is obtained by means of pistons
*of very small surface. AIl that is required
is simply cheap power. The machine at
Montereau on the banks of the Seine makes
about 10,000 pounds daily -of this new
fertilizer, which, as I say, is manufactured
simply by the pressure of hydrogen and
nitrogen gas.
Honaurable gentlemen are aware that the
critical temperature for the liquefaction of
ammania is 600 degrees above zero. The
mixture under pressure is brought through
small tubes of the catalyzator, and there, by
electric heating and tremendously high
temperature of 600 dégrees above zero is
obtained. As I have said, the catalyzators
are placed outside the building, for
fear of accident, and they are surraunded by reinforced. cancrete walls.

than $50,000,000 at the usual rate of exchange. This Frenchman, George Claude,
has in this small mili inanufactured this
sanie fertilizer 30 per cent cheaper than
the Germans have done. It was thought
in France that it would be necessary ta
import nxachinery froni Germany, and also
ta employ German engineers; but Glande
has dispensed with bath, yet he had made
a mixture costing very much less than the
German one, thus beating the Germans
altagether.
Now, in getting hydrogen you have ta be
near sanie place where there are coke
avens, and you also require cheap power
for compression. As we have plenty of
cheap power and also coke avens in Canada, it wauld be very easy for this new department ta take up this probleni, and produce fertilizing material not merely for
the land in Canada but also for sale ta the
whole world.
The honourable member
£ram Mantarville (Hon. Mr., Beaubien)
intends shortly ta invite a delegation of
savants from France ta corne here and give
us the benefit of their inventions. I would
sugges't that he invite Mr. George Claude
ta tell us haw we can start a fertilizer
factary of this kind. The honourable gentleman would certairnly be a benefactar ta
Canada if he could persuade Mr.- Claude
ta start factories where we could make
ahl the nece&sary fertilizer out of the simple
atmosphere.
The cement dust that accumulates around
cernent warks, now going ta waste, wauld
make an excellent fertilizer.
Then, in the Maritime Provinces we have

2(0,000 tans of fish waste yearly, about

haîf of which, or 150,000 tans, would be
available, and cauld be transfarmed into
the very best fertilizer, as it cantains more
phosphorus than any ather material that I
know of.
Now I came ta the most interesting thing,
which. I thought was new, but in this publication of which I gave the title sanie
tume aga, printed an March 31, 1920, I
find it fully described; .and even my honourable friend ta myr right (Hon. Mr.
Edwards), when I told hini about it, said:
"It is nat new; it is very aId." I refer ta
the conversion of sawdust into cattle-feed.
Here are the particulars:

SENATE

500

The Conversion of Sawdust into Cattle Feed
Recent investigations carried out at the Forest
Products Laboratory indi.cate that the sawdust
of coniferous woods can be converted into a
wholesome cattle feed.
The process for preparing such cattle feed
depends upon the conversion of part of the wood
into sugar by cooking it for about fifteen
minutes with a dilute acid under 120 lb. pressure. In this treatment about 20 per cent of the
wood is converted into sugar and the remainder rendered more digestible. The sugars are
Ihen extracted from the digested dust with hot
water, the ac'id is removed from the resulting
solution by neutralization, and the liquor is
evapaorated under reduced pressure to a thick
syrup. The concentrated sugar solution thus dbtained is then mixed with the residue left atter
cooking and the whole is dried to less than 15
per cent moisture content. The finished material
is darker than the original sawdust, is very
brittie, and contains a larger proportion of fine
dust.
A preliminary feed'ing trial, using a product
prepared in this way from Eastern white pl.ne,
was conducted by the Wisconsin College of
Agriculture with favorable results. Three cows
were fed by the reversal method for three
periods of four weeks each. In tlie first and third
periods they were given an excellent ration consisting of alfalfa hay, corn silage and a concentrate mixture of 55 parts of ground barley,
30 parts of wheat bran and 15 parts -of lInseed
meal. In the second period hydrolized sawdust
wa-s substituted for part of the barley, 21b. of
,sawdust being fed in place of each pound of
barley, as it was not expected that hydrolized
sa.wdust would have as high a feeding value.
pound for pound, as barley. The mixture used
during the second period contained about 26 per
cent of hydrolized sawdust. At no time was any
difficulty experienced in getting the cows to
clean up this concentrate mixture. The cows
maintained their production of milk in the
second period as well as in the first and third
and showed an appreciable increase in butter
fat production. A decided increase in weight was
noted during the period in which they were fed
the treated sawdust.
While no definite conclusions can be reached
from this brief trial, the results do show that
cattle may be fed a limited amount of hydrolized
sawdust with beneficial results. It should be
po'inted out that hydrolized sawdust contains
only a negligible amount of protein and that it
must necessarily be fed in conjunction with other
nitrogen-contatining materiais. In both rations
used in this trial plenty of protein was furnished
by the other feeds used.
We wish to emphasize the tact that these experiments are preliminary and that as yet the
laboratory is not in position to advise as to the
commercial application of the process. Further
trials will be carried out to ,furnish additional
data on the feeding value and methods of preparation.-From Chem. and Met. Eng.

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I understand my
honourable friend is arguing that sawdust
with other material might be used for feeding cattle. I was wondering if shavings
could be used in some way.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly; perhaps better.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What about wire
nails?
Hon. Mr. CASGŒRAIN.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have here the
Government book dealing with those substances which are made with the help of
Referring to the conversion of
acids.
wood and mill waste into feeding material,
I find this extract from a report on this
subject:
Molasses from wood which consists almost
entireiy of digestible carbohydrates and may be
defined as a super-concentrated feed was used
als early as 1830 for feed'ing horses and bas recently come into very general use with extremely
satisfactory results. When thus used, it is sometimes sprinkled on dry feed, being first diluted
with water, or it is mIxed with some material
which a)bsorbs it and renders it easy to handle
such as peat dust, etc. It is also corumon practice
to mi.x wood molasses with the drinking water
in a trough allowing the animals to drink
from this ad libi.tum. The best plan, however, is
to thoroughly incorporate it with a coarse fodder
so that the animals do not become smeared in
eating.
As a part of a mixed ration it bas been
proved that one quart of molesses from wood
will replace three to four quarts af oats.

I am not a farmer, but I can read books
as well as anybody else, and it may be
true. I give you the authority.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What has that to
do with sawdust? What is the use of
molasses in feeding cattle with sawdust?

I don't understand.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: My honourable
friend surely is not serious. The wood
molasses is made from sawdust or from
wood. I thought I had made myself clear.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I thought it was
made from sugar-cane.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is a certain amount of sugar in everything. As
I told you, there is about 20 per cent of
sugar in wood after it has been digested
by these agents. My honourable friend
probably bas seen these digesters himself.
The pulp, after the gum has been separated, is floating on the top. At the bottom
of the digester is the liquid sulphur waste,
which is the sugar. Everything, in order
to be absorbed, even in the human body,
must be changed into sugar before it can
be assimilated; and the minute you have
the molasses you have the alcohol also. The
alcohol that was used in this country for
years and years was made from molasses,
and what was rum made from except sugar
and other ingredients?
I did not want to detain the House so
long with this matter. I only wanted to say
that I entirely approve of this Bill, and I
may say to honourable gentlemen that I
have here all the proofs in reference to

MAY 18, 1921
the matters I have discussed, and if they
wish to examine them for themselves they
can do so.
Another matter to which I wish to draw
the attention of this Senate is that of
briquetting lignite in the Northwest. At a
place called Bienfait, which I think is in
south-east Saskatchewan, a plant bas been
erected by the Government which has cost
some $490,000 to ditte, according to the
report, although I noticed from a statement in another place that it had cost
something over $500,000.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: About $600,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They need tar
as a binder for these briquettes after they
have carbonized the coal and reduced the
lignites to powder and put them under
pressure. The Government awarded the
contract for the tar recovery plant to the
Mechanical and Chemical Recovery Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia. The
switchboard contract was given to the
Monarch Electrie Company. The wiring
contract bas been let.to the United Electrie
Company of Regina and this work is more
than half done. The piping contract bas
been let to the Garth Company of Montreal.
These briquettes have been made in
Ottawa, at the Experimental Farm, I think,
and small quantities have been sent outsome to the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen,
the Prime Minister of Canada, some to the
Hon. Sir James , Lougheed, Minister of
Mines, some to the Hon. T. C. Norris,
Premier of Manitoba. and some to the
Hon. William Martin, Premier of Saskatchewan, and I am told they were found
satisfactory. A Mr. Stansfield made tests
in his own house, and found those briquettes quite equal to ordinary anthracite. It
will be a wonderful thing for the Northwest if these coal briquettes can be manufactured out of the inexhaustible supplies
of lignite that exist in the Northwest
Territory. If the by-products can also be
had, hydrogen can be made from the coke
ovens that are there, and with the three
parts of hydrogen and one part of nitrogen,
which is God Almighty's atmosphere-and
there is plenty of it in the Northwest and
everywhere else-those two will produce
fertilizer right at hand to enrich the land,
especially in Manitoba, where the yield
is not as great as it used to be because the
land bas been farmed so làng without
having any manure put on it.
In the sixth issue of, Progress Report No.
19 we have mention of two official visits from
representatives of the Bureau of Mines
at Washington on the 5th of March. Mr.

501

Foster Bain, the Director, called on the
Bureau of Research here in company with
Mr. Camsell, the Deputy Minister of Mines
at Ottawa. A few days later W. W. Edgley, the principal of the engineering staff,
spent three days with the Bureau of Research here-two days in Montreal and
one in Ottawa.
Those gentlemen were
given all the information that could be
placed at their disposal. This shows that
we are moving in research matters, when
gentlemen from the United States take
the trouble to corne all the way from Washington to see what we are doing in the
way of briquetting our lignite.
Now, honourable gentlemen, there are
many other matters about which I might
speak, but I do not want to abuse the
patience of this House, and any• one of
these subjects would require a long speech
to give anything like a full account of it.
When you come to consider what bas been
done in connection with navigation, the
su*bstitution of sails for coal, the conversion of sawdust into cattle feed, the
liquidization of oxygen, and so on, and
making fertilizers in different ways, a
proper exposition of these would require
hours; and it is very difficult to give an
explanation that would be satisfactory unless we would all Ibe prepared to receive
the technical details. I might say I have
devoted weeks to this investigation, and
spent more than one Sunday preparing this
summary but I would be very glad indeed if honourable gentlemen would take
enough interest in these problems so that
they could examine for themselves the details and the proof of every word I have
said.
Hon. WM. ROCHE: There is so very
little in the actions of the ýGovernment to
commend that it is a great pleasure to
endorse what is proposed on this occasion.
I am very well disposed towards it, and
glad to be able to support it. We are
very much indebted to my honourable
friend who bas given us so much information on various subjects, both on the land,
in the air, and in the sea.
May 'I submit, with great diffidence, that
it would be more useful to Canada if, instead of recondite science and the chemical
aspect of inquiry, the attention of this Research Bureau would be devoted to the
economical and substantial subjects rather
than aerial or purely chemical ones?
Obscure scientific combinations can be made
commercially of real value, when composed
of the prolific production of nature, and
will promote public comfort and economy.

SENATE
I think that the attention of the Bureau
might be bestowed, first, upon economyeconomy of food products.
Everybody
knows that there is an enormous waste
in this country of valuable food products,
and that other food products could be
made, not exactly from wood, but from
vegetable matter, which would be very
valuable for the food of men and animals.
We have also been wasteful in the forests.
Great quantites of most valuable oak,
birch, and other woods have been used
for firewood and inferior purposes. They
are now very scarce in Canada, and had
they been conserved' and economically used
they might have been a vast resource of
great benefit to the country; but they have
been eut down and used and wasted. We
know that in the food-producing countries
of Europe there is a great scarcity of
food. In some countries vast numbers of
people have died of starvation. A very
observable feature in those countries which
were large producers of food, and a very
lamentable one, is that, in consequence of
the war and the unemployment of the
farming and productive interests, they are
destitute of food and must draw upon the
resources of other countries for the purpose of sustaining their population. In
the United States, with the great increase
in population which is taking place, there
will come a time, and it will not be far
distant, when they will not be able to
export wheat and grain and other natural
products; and that condition will rebound
on the fast-growing population.
Scientific research should be directed to
the inventing and producing of new articles
of food as substitutes. .They may be found
in the ground, in the vegetation, and so
on, and such research may be useful along
economic if not purely scientific lines. I
do not think these people should be engaged in seeking to have alphabets placed
after their names, or in going to Europe
to learn of discoveries that may have been
made there, or that they should take part
in a mutual admiration society, or endeavour to find out from others what they
already know instead of making new discoveries. We have a new land. Canada
is probably a part of the oldest formation
on the globe. In Siberia, which is opposita
the northern part of Canada, there are
found under the ice the remains of tropic
animals and of old vegetation, which is
the result either of that portion of the
globe having been a part of the tropies
at one time, or of a uniformly warm climate
over the whole globe that may have been
changed by the earth's nutation or some
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

other process. It is very probable that in
the new districts of Canada there may be
found metals of the old formation, which
are not to be found 'in Europe; and if
there be discoveries of these metals and
new combinations of metals, that would
give a great impetus to Canada, because
articles of a higher and more refined quaitiy could be made, and it would be of vast
industrial benefit.
I leave that, because it might be enlarged
upon, and some gentleman who thinks
of it might
take it up.
But it
appears
to me
that
the
mineral
resources of Canada are untouched, and
that there are valuable minerals and possessions now under the ice of the far North
that might be of material advantage, and
will be of material advantage, to Canada,
when people have devoted their attention
to utilizing the products of those regions
that are now of no use whatever to civilized
man.
I turn away from this for a moment to
the excursion which was made by my honoura'ble friend on the high seas. He gave
us the speed of steamers and the speed
of sailing ships in the old times. I am
perfectly familiar with the progress of
steam development, because I lived next
door to, and my walk adjoined the walk
of Sir Samuel Cunard, the Halifax man
who projected the great Cunard steamship
line. Two years ago I saw the Mauretania lying at the wharf formerly owned
by Sir Samuel Cunard and his fathera beautiful ship, one, I believe,.that has
the blue ribbon of the Atlantic for superior
speed. I remembered the Hibernia, the
America, the Canada, the Asia, the Africa,
the Europa, the Arabia, all those being of
the old Cunard line; and what were they?
Vessels of 12,000 tons; and it seemed to me
a remarkable coincidence that that great
ship, the best 'produet of English skill,
should come back to the place where it
originated in the mind of Sir Samuel
Cunard some seventy years ago.
There is another subject upon which my
honourable friend dilated with great satisfaction to me, and that is the speed of
sailing,ships. Hfe told us of the sensational
performances of the Flying ,Cloud,. the
Lightning, the Great Republic, the James
Bain, and all those other wind-jammers of
the forties. The Lightning, the Flying
Cloud, and the Great Republic were all
built by Nova Scot4ans. Donald McKay
was the architect and the builder of those
great ships, and the man who sailed them
was Captain Lauchlan McKay, a brother

MAY 18, 1921
of the builder, who came to Halifax years
ago and visited my father, an old townsmate, and told about the performances of
ships and how in the Sandwich
-those
Islands his ship, the Great Republic, had
alongside five American wŽialers whose
cargoes of oil he took into the Great Republic. That shows what Nova Scotia could
do in those days. Nova Scotian captains
were known as being the most daring
and enterprising and skilful of any
sailing nmen in the world. What is
the fact to-day, honourable gentlemen?
I would like to call it to the -attention of the Government, because I think
it is a very important matter. In the
United States; where they have built so
many new steamers, they are seeking out
the best of ou r Nova Scotian captains
and are putting themn in command. Those
saine men cannot get employment in Canada; they are driven out by the policy of
this Government, and forced to go to a
foreign land for a living, and strangers
are ibrought in and put in the places that
they ought to occupy. That is a policy
which ought to be condemned. I should
like to see some Canadian rise up with a
voice powerful enough and -with influence
enough to info-rm the Government and the
people that that is not a policy to comnmend--that Canada should be for Canadians first, and the worl afterwards if we
like; that our money and prombtions and
honours and emoluments ought, firs~t of
ail, to be for our o&wn people.
I arn very sorry that I have not more
time to address to the observations of my
honoured friend to whom we are indebted.
He made a littie digression on the subject
of coal. There are a great many people,
some of them on commissions inquiring into the coal question, who know very litule
about it. I would say to my honourabie
friend who made a comparison of. British
or Nova Scotian or other coal with the
American coal, that there is this great
physical fact: The British coal and the
Nova Scotiair coal are brought from a
great depth, and in the British coal mines
there are five tons of wàter to be pumped
up to the surface for every ton of coal that
is raised, thus making its production expensive, whereas some of the best coals of
the United States are above ground, where
cars can be run right in and loaded directiy, which will always give the Americans
the advant-age in competition in coal. Also,
some of their coals are of better quality
than any in Canada. But the physical
fact remains that the cost of raising coal
in the British Islands and in Canada is

503

far greater than in the United States, and
that therefore they will have the advantage in the markets of the world adjacent
to them and communicable with by shipping, over those coals which are more
costly to raise, and where there is no longer
transportation.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Take the

supply
longer
States
of the

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: No. The coal of the
United States can be produced so much
cheaper as to overcome the extra cost of
transportation. The distance is not appreciably greater, and when it is only 100
miles or 200 miles, it does not make much
difference.
The other day I listened to, some observations from the acute and inquisitive mind
of my honourable frîend fromn Midland
(Hon. Mr. Bennett). He said that you
could transport the grain of the West
down to Sydney, which was a commodious
and available port, and bring coal back. I
would remind my honourable friend that
hie need not go so far as Sydney, and that
the grain of the West, if there were sufficient transportation, could be shipped to
the commodions port of Halifax, which
would accommodate ail the shipping of
Canada for hundreds of years to come.
But a feature ifl the transportation of
grain is the high cost, and that cost is
emphasized by the fact that there is no
return freight, and that the empty cars
have to be dragged back. I have noticed
that in the railway transportation on the
Intercolonial and connecting railways the
locomotive powtr is not sufficient to drag
back the accumulation of cars. But if
grain were transported from the far West
to Halifax, on the way back we have the
mines, now but slightly developed, in
Cumberland county, the mines in Pictou,
and other mines on the main line between
Halifax and the Great West, and they
could carry coal to the parts of Ontario
and the Northwest that are now served
by American coal, thus saving haîf the cost
of transport because they would have retura freight the whole way.
I might go on to' expand further upon
what bas been said by my honourable
friend; but hie bas gone so thoroughly
into the chemical and other departmnents
of this discussion that I do not propose
to weary the House by further extending
the remarks which I have made, and which

,>04

SENATE

I have put before them only because I do
not think the things I have mentioned are
as familiar to the other members of the
House as they are to me. I should like
to have my honourable friends consider
theim and remember that all these problems
are to be solved by relying upon our own
resources, using our own people, and doing
all that we can for the comfort of the
inhabitants of the whole of Canada.

this matter in another place, said that a
part of the work carried out by the Research
Council was the investigation of this coal
question, the briquetting of lignite, to which
my hon. friend from DeLanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) has referred, and also the
question of that peat industry. There is
already established under the Government a
Department of Mines, and I should have
thought that both those subjects were very
largely matters coming within the scope
of that Department. I think there is
great danger of considerable overlapping
between the work of the Research Council
and the work of other departments unless
the line between them is very clearly drawn.
I hope that when we go into committee, my
honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) will be able to give us more definite
information about this than we now have
from the Government.
Hon. WM. PROUDFOOT: Honourabl'
gentlemen, I have a word or two to say in
reference to this Bill. In the House a few
days ago we heard the honourable leader
refer to the Conservation Bill and state
reasons why the Commission of Conservation should be abolished. It seems to me,
on reading over this Bill, that the Government are going to repeat exactly what took
place in connection with the organization
that they are now so anxious to get rid of.
Section 3 of this Bill provides:

Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, we have had two very interesting speeches this afternoon on this subject
by the honourable member from De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) and the
honourable gentleman from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Roche). I do not wish to take up
the time of the House in following their
speeches through, but there are one or two
matters in regard to this Bill to which
I should like to draw the attention of the
leader of the Government.
He did not, I think, give us quite as
full an explanation as I for one would
have looked for as to the objects of this
Research Council. My honourable friend
apparently knew that some honourable
gentlemen in this House were going to
make rather extended speeches on the
question of the resources of this country,
and the proper lines of investigation and
research to be followed, and apparently
he did not think it necessary to go into

zation is a very good one: I understand
it has done a great deal of good
for this country. I would suggest that,
instead of doing away with that organization, the Government should hand over
to it the work which is intended to be
covered by the Research CounciL. In that
way the Government could take greater
control over the Conservation Commission
and could also secure what is required.
It would also prevent the overlapping
which has just been referred to by the honourable the leader of the Opposition, and
which was mentioned the other day by the
honourable the leader of the Government in
dealing with the Conservation Act. It
strikes me that the Government are now
going to repeat what the honourable leader
said the other day was a mistake. I
tHlink that under the circumstances this
House might very well pause and consider
before entering upon expenditure of the
kind which will be incurred if we pass this
Bill.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable
gentlemen, I desire for a few moments
to support the position taken by the last
speaker. We have now on the Order Paper
a Pill for the abolition of the Commission
of Conservation. We have also this Bill
to appoint a National Research Council.
The statement made the other day by my
honourable friend the leader of the Government was that the Conservation Commission /was duplicating work that was
being done by the various departments of
the Government, and here we are appointing a Council that is going to do exactly
the same thing.
This Counoil is to be composed chiefly
of scientific men in Canada, who will receive no remuneration whatever, except
the Chairman. The Chairman of the Council is to receive $10,000 a year. The Chairman of the Conservation Commission did
not get anything. So far as I can see,
that is the one and only difference between these two ibodies.
The honourable leader of the House
pointed out some undertakings of the Conservation Commission that were a duplication of work being done by various
branches of the Department, several of
them branches over which my honourable
friend presides so well. ' But I have here a
little publication issued by the Research
Council, and it mentions some things that
they propose to deal with and that are
being dealt with by branches of the Department of the Interior and other Departments.

Remember, honourable gentlemen, I am
not opposed to this Research Council if
the Conservation Commission is to be
abolished. I believe that it has done and
will do good work, just as I believe the
Conservation Commission bas done good
work, which could not and would not
have been done by any department. But
here is one of the things that this Research
Council propose to take up: "the method
of reforestation most suitable to conditions in Canada." That is one of the
things which my honourable friend the
leader of the Government objected to the
Conservation Commission doing, simply because a branch of the Department of the
Interior is dealing with that. The Conservation Commission dealt with many other
things. It devoted attention to the ques-,
tion of fox-breeding. I do not think my
honourable friend dbjected to that, but
here is this Research Council proposing to
deal with that very thing. There are two
or three other subjects mentioned in this
publication. One is the briquetting of the
low-grade lignites of southeastern Saskatchewan. That is a subject which, as
the honourable leader of the Government
pointed out the other day, the Department
of Mines has been dealing with for years.
I may say that I know something about
the conditions, for the briquetting plant is
located in the constituency that I represented in the House of Commons, and I
want to say that the Research Council has
done particularly good work in that respect, with the result that now, although
the report is not public, they have absolutely proven that the common lignite coal
in southeastern Saskatchewan can be so
treated as to make a fuel equal to the
ordinary anthracite, at a cost, delivered
in Winnipeg of from $11 to $12 a ton.
So they have done excellent work.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS:: May I tell my
honourable friend that that is as old as the
hills. It has been done for years, long
before that Research Council was ever
thought of.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: All that I can say,
honourable gentlemen, is that the Saskatchewan Government some years ago estab.
lished a small plant in Estevan, right near
where the Government has established one
at Bienfait. They are only Il miles apart.
They showed that something could be done,
but it was not proven definitely at all, so
that private enterprise would care to engage in it. The work that bas been done
by the Research Council is undoubtedly a

SENATE
great work. The Dominion Government
and the Government of Saskatchewan have
expended about $600,000, and there will be
probably some further expenditure, but
they have proven that private capital can
make of that coal, which is rather low
grade, a first-class fuel. So if they did
nothing else they have done a good work.
But the honourable leader of the Government objected to the Commission of Conservation on the ground of expense. I do
not know from where I got the sum which
is in my mind, but I understand that this
Research Council is to have a building put
up at a cost of $600,000 or $500,000.
Although my honourable friend objected to
expenditures by the Conservation Commission, we are now running into exactly the
same class of expenditure. We are establishing a similar commission or council, the
difference being that the chairman of the
Research Council gets $10,000 a year. The
other members of the Council are to receive
nothing, but the officials have to be paid.
I take it for granted that this Research
Council will cost very much more than the
Commission of Conservation costs. Whether
the value of its work will compensate for
the extra cost or not nobody can say;; it
remains to be seen. However, we are
doing away with one organization because
it was duplicating work done by the different departments, and we are now passing
a Bill to establish another body, the Research Council, that will duplicate in exactly the same way and that is going to
cost two or three times as much money.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: Honourable gentlemen, my honourable friend refers to the
briquetting of lignites in Saskatchewan, regarding it as something new. It is just as
new as all the items that my honourable
friend here referred to this afternoon: it
is as old as the hills. It is not new at all.
Now, honourable gentlemen, there was just
one value in the former research institution
in Canada, and that was the salary paid to
the chief. That is all there was in it for
anybody.

Hon. W. C. EDWARDS: It is absolute

lnay I be privileged to correct an inaccuracy
in a short statement which 1 made in the
House yesterday in regard to the briquetting of coal dust or screenings? I was
undei the inisappréhension that there was
no difference between the briquetting of
screenings from hard coal, or anthracite,
and lignite, or soft coal. I made that statement with a good deal of confidence; but
I find that I was entirely wrong, and that,
while the briquetting of the screenings of
bard coal has been in vogue for many
years, the briquetting of the other is very
new. This shows how careful one should
be in making statements.
LIQUOR LAWS IN QUEBEC
INQUXIRY

On the Orders of theý Day:
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to draw the attention oif
the Government and of the members of
,this House to an item which appears in
this morning's Montreal Gazette, in which
it is said that the Premier of that Province
bas asked the Government of Canada to
suspend the Scott Act in the city of Quebec. In order that the members of this
House niay properly understand what the
article is about, I will read it:
No .Answer to Quebeo's Request has been
Received From Ottawa
Quebec, May 15.-In another interview to-day
regarding the de]ay iii putting into effeet the
new Que-bec liquor law in the City o~f Quebec,
owin-g to the non-repeal of the Scott Act,
Premier Taschereau commented as follows:
"The delay In granting licenses for the sale
of beer and wlne In the city of Quebec ls due
to tihe continuance of the Scott Act, whtch la a
federal Iaw, and prevents the puttlng into effeet
of the provincial law. Before the latter measure
can be gdminlstered, the Scott Act must fIrst be
suspended or repealed. Wehave applied to the
Federal Government to suspend the Scott Act,
pending a referendum, so as to allow the
temporary administration of the provincial law,
sand, although we have been promIsed. conalderation of the request, we have not yet recelved any definite answer.
"lIt does appear .that the Federal Gýoverninent
desires that the provincial Governinent should.
kold a eeferendum in the City of Quebec. The
Quebec Govennment ls incllned to meet this vlew
as It ls thought better to clear up thie question
forever. But In the unterval the Quegbec Govennment asks for the suspension of nie Scott
Act pendlng the holding of the referendum.
The reason for asklng the suspension la onl acoount of the length of time It will take to have
the referendum. In the aneantime the business Of
the city ls sufferlng from the prevallng conditions, that coul-d ibe easily corrected by the
Federal Government consenting temporarily to
suspend the Canada Temperance Act. Consideraible injury la belng done to, the hotel business
and general trade in the City. The fact that
the City of Queïbec la dry has been spread broad-

cast and is deterring touriats and others from
oming here. Only the other day thlrty motoring parties were on their way to, Quebec, and
when they reached Three Rivera they were told
that owing to the conifloet of the Scott Act and
the Quebec liquor law, the clty of Quebec was
absolutely dry. The result of this Inlformation
was that the motoring parties returned to Montreal , where the new provincial law la In operation."

desire to express to the leader of the
him to the Government, the hope that while that interview
comes froan high authority the Government have not deprived and are not going
to deprive the people of the province of
Quebec, who are in favour of temperance
principles, of the right of having the law
e~vern Vhem -for which they have voteld,
and which they want. The Scott Act was
passed in the province of Quebec, as it was
in many other provinces.
The Quebec
License Ac't, as it is called, has flot
power to wipe out the Scott Act, and 1
may say to nxy honourable friend thgt,
scattered throughout the counties of that
province, notwithstanding this or any other
Act, are men and wonmen who have no
intention of entering into the business of
selling whisky. The Government of the
province of Quebec haàve decided that they
want to do it, and apparently in many
counties the people are behind that idea.
But 1 do net want the Governmnent at
Ottawa to understand for one moment that,
because the Premier of Quebec is supposed
to have given expression to the utterances
contained in this supposed intervieW, it is
the unanimous wish of the people of Quebec that the Scott Act should be suspended.
That is not the case. I know of xnany
counties in the province of Quebec where
the Scott Act is in force to-day and where
it will be in force to-morrow, and where
the people have no intention of submitting
to what they termi an unfair and unreasonable Act passed by the Province of Quebec.
If the leader of. the G4vernment in this
House can tell me that the Government
are not going to suspend the Scott Act,
it will allay a great deal of feeling.

House, and through

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The article
which the honourable gentleman bas just
read seeins to refer exclusively to the City
of Quebec. Do I understand that the demand of the Premier of Quebec covers the
Eastern Townships, from which My honourable friend halls, or simply the city
of Quebec?

Hon. Mr. FOSTER:
My honourable
friend is too good a lawyer to be sincere
in asking that question. He knows perfectly well that if at the demand of the

>08

SENATE

Premier of the Province of Quebec this
Government renders assistance as to the
city of Quebec, on the next day or the
day following every other section of the
Province will have a demand made on the
Government and will cite the city of Quebec as a precedent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If I may
be permitted again. We claim a fair
measure of autonomy throughout the Province of Quebec. We have left the counties
to speak for themselves, and I am quite
sure that no one in the province wants the
principles of the minority to be imposed on
the majority in any county, so that if
there is a majority in my honourable
friend's district who are in favour of a
bone-dry policy they will get it.
But I would like to cite one little incident
which will throw some light on the administration of the Scott Act in the Eastern
Townships. Hon. Mr. Duffy was appointed
Provincial Treasurer in 1897. He had
lived all his time within a stone's throw
of my honourable friend's summer residence
in Sweetsburg. The summer after he was
made Provincial Treasurer he had occasion
to go through the Province of Quebec and
examine the public buildings, the court
bouses and the gaols. It was the first time
that he had occasion to go to the rural
parts of the province to examine those
institutions. When he came back he expressed his surprise that in four large
judicial districts in which there were some
licenses he had found that there had not
been a prisoner in the gaols for two or
three or four years, whereas in Sweetsburg there had never been a day when
there were not a few prisoners in the gaol
for drunkenness.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Is
there any right vested in any Government
to suspend the Canada Temperance Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am not
discùssing the merits of the question raised
by my honourable friend, but the spirit of
it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

I am

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it for
granted that the Scott Act, once imposed,
can only be withdrawn after a vote.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: By the people.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
Act before me.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I have listened to
the remarks made by my honourable
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

friend with regard to the gaols of the
province of Quebec; and, while I must
apologize to thir House for taking up its
time in discussing this question, I want
to tell him that the gacl in the district of
Bedford is as free of prisoners for breaking the Scott Act as that in any other
district in the province of Quebec. So far
as I know, there may have been a time
when the statement be bas made was borne
out by the facts; but, as a matter of fact,
in the district of Bedford there is not and
bas not been for some time anything but
the simple observance of the Scott Act as
it exists.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
sure the Chamber will learn with sympathy
and regret of thie suffering and hardship
to which the city of Quebec bas been subjected by reason of the operation of the
Scott Act. I am unaware-I stand subject
to correction-of any power that is vested
in the Government to suspend the operation
of the Scott Act where it bas once come
into operation. My recollection of the provisions of the Act is that it can only be
suspended or repealed by a vote of the
people in the district in which it is in
force. I have no knowledge whatever of
the Government having come to any conclusion upon the subject.

OF INTERNATIONAL

TFIRD READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the third reading of Bill 73, an Act to
authorize the ratification and carrying into
effect of the Protocol of the sixteenth day
of December, 1920, accepting the Statute
for the Permarnent Court of International
Justice of the thirteenth day of December,
1920.

Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, before this Bill is passed I
would call the attention of this Chamber
to the fact that I expressed some regret
when the Bill was in Committee that the
reference to the Permanent Court of International Just:ce had not been made compulsory. I thought that this was a great

-

I

MAY 19, 1921
weakness in the constitution of this court,
and should be noted. I desire 'to draw the
attention of this Chamber to article 36 of
the statute which we are now about to
ratify. It reads as follows:
The jurisdiction of the Court comprises all
cases which the parties refer to it and ail matters specially provided for in Treaties and Conventions in force.
The Members of the League of 'Nations and
the iStates mentioned in the Annex to the Covenant may, either when signing or ratifying the
protocol to which the present Statute la adjoined, or at a later moment, declare that they
recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other
Member or State acoepting the same obligation,
the jurisdiction of the Court in alt or any of
the classes of legal disputes concerning:
(a) The interpretation of a Treaty;
(b) Any question of International Law;
(c) The existence of any fact which, if
established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation;
(d) The nature or extent of the reparatian
to be made for the breach of an international
obligation.
The declaration referred to above may be
made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain Members
or States, or for a certain time.
In .the event of a dispute as to whether the
Court bas jurisdiction, the matter shall be
settled by the decision of the Court.

I am . surprised that the Minister of
Justice, who returned from Geneva last
winter, has not deemed it proper to add
to this Act which is now before us a statement that Canada accepted jurisdiction
in all cases as a matter of reciprocity with
other countries that would pass such a
declaration. I submit that there is nothing
which Canada is not disposed to arbitrate
with other countries, and that we should
follow the example of many other small
states which have already gone on record
as accepting compulsorily the jurisdiction
of the International Court of Justice. The
states that have already agreed to submit
all issues under thé four items which. I
have read are: Luxemburg, Costa Rica,
Denmark, Portugal, Salvador, Switzerland and Uiuguay. Demnark and Switzerland thave limited their engagement to
five years, but the other yive have agreed
to no limitation. Of course, Canada, as
weli as ail other nations, after ratifying
this statute, can at any time by official
act declare that it joins with the other
nations, under the reciprocity clause, in
submitting all the matters that could arise
under the sections of Article 36.
There is another matter of great importance which was discussed at the Assembly

of the League of Nations on December

ia,

last, which adopted the resolution asking
ratification of the convention signed at St.

509

Germain on 'December 110, 1919, which
creates an International Bureau of Control
over the sale of firearms and munitions.
That convention was signed by the following states:
United States of America,
Belgium, Bolivia, Great Britain, Canada
and the other dominions in the Empire,
China, Cuba,' Ecuador, France, Greece,
Denmark, Hayti, the Fiji Islands, Italy,
Japan, and some other nations of which I
have not a list. To my mind this is a most
important move, on a par with the limitation of armaments, which we should all
support. The absence of control in the
manufacturing and sale of munitions of
war suggests perpetual danger to the peace
of the world. We all know that enormous
capital is invested in the manufacture of
munitions and arms in half-a-dozen large
countries on the two continents. That
capital bas earned for its shareholders
and owners considerable profits; and when
you find the manufacturers in France, Great
Britain, Japan, and the United States seeking for markets, you realize that there is
nothing that will increase their profits and
their wealth like a war somewhere. I do.
not know whether honourable gentlemen
are aware of the incident which was made
public.a year or two before the war when
the Krupps were caught red-handed subsidizing the French press, through their
own channels and agencies, to raise a scare
in that country on the increase of armaments in Germany, in order to provide the
French Parliament to increase its own
armaments, and thus give reason to the
military party in Berlin to do likewise when
the budget would be under discussion. The
evidence was clear, and it was admitted
from Berlin. There 'was considerable discussion and excitement over the discovery
of that scheme. But all this shows that
the creation of this International Bureau
to control the manufacture and sale of munitions of war is now due to mature and to
operate. I hope that as Canada was one
of the signers of that convention of St.
Germain in December, 1919, it will join
hands with the other countries in establisb,
ing and putting inte operation that convenion and that International Bureau.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third timne, and paesed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

MAY 19, 1921
a few days ago, was somewhat in
error, an*d I desire to correct him.
He made the statement, I think, that the
expenditure was in the neighbourhood of
$250,000 a year, whereas the fact is that
the expenditure for 1910 was $22,00, for
1910-11 it was -$66,000-1 will mention,
not ail, but only a few figures to show; for
1919-20 it was $140,000, and for 1920-21,
$141,000. In the 13 years of the existence
of the Commission the total expenditure
has been $1,295,000. 1 say again that
.Canada is better off by twenty, thirty, or
forty times that amount, because of the'
operations of the Commission.
On the subject of the conservation ýof
our foi4sts I may be pardoned for claiming
to speak with some authority, because east
of the Great Lakes my old firm has explored the forest resources'more than al
the other lumbermen together. That may
seem to be a broad statement, but it is
true. From the Albany River to the
.Straits of Belle Isle we have explored
practically the wbole country. We spent
three winters in Labrador at very large
expenditure. Therefore 1 think it ought
to be adniitted, honourable gentlemen, that
on this question I have some comprehension of what I am talking about; and 1
say here and now that instead of our
forests being inexhaustible the fact is that
our production of sawn tixnber east of the
Great' Lakes will very soon be a thing of
the past.
The re-forestation. and the
preservation of the forests, so strongly
advocated by this Commission, should have
been put into effect many years ago. I do
not say the same with regard to our pulp
resourcea; but I give the warning that
unless our pulp resources are better
conserved tban our timber resources
have been, tbey too will
comparatively soon be exhausted. I have devoted a great deal of time and energy to
this question, not only in Parliament, but
also at various meetings on conservation
and forest preservation. I need not dwell
longer on that subject.
Anotlher department, whieh deait with
a matter that is necessarily of very great
importance to Canada, was that of agriculture. The chairman of that section was
Dr. J. W. Robertson, so well known to, the
Canadian people that I .need not say one
word regarding him.
The Chief under
,him was Mr. Nunnick. In tbat department a great deal has been done for Canlada-a very great deal indeed. I spoke
at greater length on the timber branch
than I will on that of agriculture or on any

511

other; but I may say that the inauguration
of the system of illustrative farms
througbout a large portion of Canada bas
done an immense good, for agriculture.
In tbat department, next to that of forestry, perhaps the most has been done.
The water-power branch was headed byr
Mr. Arthur P. White, *a consulting engineer, a capable man of great prominence.
,In that department, again, a great deal
,indeed bas been done for Canada.
The work of town planning was under
the administration of Mr. Thomas Adams,
îwbo bas hud a great deal of experience in
Engl-and. With this question I am not so
familiar, and I cannot speak with the same
~freedom, but I undestand that very good
work bas been done in this respect.
Mr. James. White was the deputy to the
Hon. Sir Clifford Sifton.
Mr. White is
now in England on sick leave. Whetber
the closing o~f tbis Commission has had
anything to do with bis illness or not 1
,am not prepared to say. I bave bad a
great deal of experience with bim, and I
,consider bim to be a most capable and
efficient officer.
I will not trouble the House much longer
on this niatter. The chairman of the department of health was Sir Edmuild Osler,
of Toronto. The various branches, whicb
I will not enumerate here, were beaded by
,equally eminent men from. various parts of
Canada.
This statement I am very sorry to make,
but it is my duty to do so. My own conviction is that tbe mind of the present
Prime Minister was poisoned by two
officers of the Department of tbe Interior
during the time tbat he occupied the
position of Minister of that Department;
and I am afraid, my honourable friend the
present Minister of that Department -(Hon.
Sir James Lougheed)
hs been very
seriously misled by the same two men.
Considerable jealousy bas existed. Whether
At was due to the magnificent operations
of this Commission or not 1 do not know,
nor do I know whetber there was any
indiscretion on the part of Mr. White, the
Deputy. At any rate, I am strongly convinced that but for tbe actions of those
two gentlemen the present condition would
neyer have been brougbt about. All that
is required is to place at the bead of that
Commission as capable a man for the
position as can be found.
Now, as to the organization of the
Commission, I have been for fôrty years,

comprehension of departments, having
lived in or near Ottawa practically all my
life, and I here make the statement without
fear of successful contradiction that no
department of any Government in Canada
ever was as wela organized or so effective
in the best interests of 'Canada as the
Conservation Commission.
There may be on either side of the House
bonourable gentlemen who know something
about the operations of the Commission,
and I should be very glad if they would
speak freely on the subject. The only member of the House who asked me for particulars was the honourable member from
Kamloops (Hon. Mr. Bostock), and I had
him furnished with such particulars as he
desired. This is not a party question and
should not be made a contentions one. I
for one do not wish to make it such.
May I say, in conclusion, that I have
great confidence in the honourable gentleman who is the leader of the Government in
this House. I have great respect for his
opinions and his judgment. There is in the
Commission a staff that is, I think, unequalled by any staff in any department of
the governmental system of Canada, and
I would urge upon him most earnestly that
no injustice be done that staff, and that
where positions can be obtained they should
not suffer as a consequence of losing their
positions in the Commission.
It is well known to the House that
I am not in a condition to make long
speeches, even if I were disposed to do so.
My short statement has been absolutely
frank and unbiased. I shall be very glad
to hear the opinions of honourable gentlemen on either side of the House who may
feel disposed to express their views. Of
course, I consider that this matter is ended
and that there is no help for it. As to the
possible replacgment of the Commission
of Conservation by the Research Council,
I do not like to say what I think. I used
rather strong language yesterday, but it
expressed my honest opinion. I am engaged
personally in the three leading natural
resource industries of Canada. Let us take
first the lumber industry: if there is anything that the Research Council can do to
assist lumbering operations, I have failed
to see where it can be done. The same
applies to the pulp and paper industry, in
which I am also engaged. It applies likewise to the hydro-electrie undertakings. I
look upon it as a most regrettable thing
that Canada is losing one of the best institutions it has ever had, and is introducing possibly another organization which
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS.

will never do the slightest good for Canada.
I said yesterday and I say now again that
the only one who ever profited by the
operations of the late Industrial Research
Commission was the Chairnan, who direw
a salary. I will not detain you longer,
honourable gentlemen. There may arise in
the course of the proceedings on this Bill
some point on which I may have something
to say, but it is not at all likely. In concluding this short statement, may I again
express the hope that my honourable
friend the leader of the Government in
this House will not reproach me for having
stated my views.
Hon. W. PROUDFOOT: May I be permitted to ask the honourable gentleman
a question? It bas been reported that the
Commission gave valuable information to
the Imperial authorities in reference to certain timber used for the construction of
flying machines, and that a large amount
of money was saved thereby. I would like
to know if that report tis correct and to
learn the particulars.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: That is quite
correct. i have all those items, but did
not want to trouble the House with them.
When in the course of the war the aeroplane situation became serious, an inquiry
was made in the United States and in
Canada for lumber suitable for the making
of aeroplanes. It was a curious fact that
in all Eastern Canada, where spruce predominates, as it does in the Eastern Townships and other parts of Quebec and in
parts of Ontario, there was practically
none of that material that could be supplied; but this Commission was enabled,
because of its knowledge of conditions, to
point at once to a district in British
Columbia, the Queen Charlotte Islands,
where that material could be obtained. In
that respect alone a service was done to
Canada and the Empire that was worth
the cost of the Commission many times
over. That is only one instance of the
many things the Commission has done for
Canada.

these days of super-taxation we exa-ý

is effected, and we approve of them
if they are in the interest of true
economy; but I cannot understand, though
I may on obtaining further information
from other members, in what way the
Research Council on which we are asked
to spend several hundred thousand dollars
at once for the -building and equipment of
laýboratories, can do more effective work
than the Commission of Conservation has
done in the past. It is charged that there
has been a great deal of duplication in
the work of the Conservation Commission
and that of certain departments, but, so
far as I have knowledge, the publications
of the Conservation Commission are standard-they are in libraries throughout the
world, and are consulted by Government
officiais and others in every country. Busineýs men like snyseif refer to them, because. we find in those publications, ready
to hand, the essence of the information
th-at we want. I would not know where
else to get such information. I do not
know the publications of the various departments, and it wouid be a work of considerable research for me to obtain otherwise the information which is readily available in the publications of the Conservation
Commission. Yesterday I asked the librarian to, ]et me have, if possible, a list of
those publications, and I now have it in
niy hand. I will neot read it, because any
honourable meinber can get the iist from
the librarian and can form -bis owni jud-gment of the inestimable value of the work
they have been ,doing.
Early in the year I was asked ta write
an article for the Annual Financiai Review
of the Montreal Gazette, and 1 was forced
at that tiqne ta pay this deserved tribute
te the Commission ofConservaion. This
part of the article is very short, and I
read it oniy ta, show you the practicai
resuit that has been accomplished by their
efforts in various departments. I said:
The Commission of Conservation oa aooi-

tIlshed a great work In Investi-gating and surveying aur available water vawers and campiling and publishIng statisticu ooncernI.ng their
development and distribution. Trhis wcoel of the
commission bas attracted mueh attention In
other countries, which are now commencing ta
appreciate Canada'a wealth of natural resources. As evidence, I may aubmlt ,that one of the
United States great financial corporations, the
Bankers Trust Comipany, has recently published
and widelY circulated. a book entitled, 'Mhe
Dominion of eanada.- whIch it cals «'The Land
of AchI.evemeyit," and gives un full measure of
credit for what this country han acooilishe-d.
The chapter devoted ta, aur water powers ls a
model of compilation and concludes with the
foilowing paragraph :

"The bearing of these great resources upan the
future manufacturing power of the country Is
signifteant, especially when the fact In held In
miod that the electric power compa-nies are
adopting a policy of xnaintaining Industriai
departments whose duty It Io ta locate industries
in the territory served by such companles. The
combination of cheap power, favorable Ilving
conditions for labar and good laibor markets, is
rapidiy transforming Canada fram a country
wçhieh was a few years ago aimost wholly agr-i-

cultural ta one in whIch the manufacturing Interests are of great and growing Isnportance.1

That -article published by the Bankers
Trust Company is just a prelude. Now
let me tell you llhat Mr. G. H. Ashley, State
Geologist of Pennsylvania, says. He dlaims:
that the industrial East bas maintained its
supremacy because of cheap fuel and nearness
to mnarkets. As cheap) coal or wood fuel cah no
longer be obtained, industriai supremacy *must
be diverted ta where cheap electric power is
availabie, and as Canada particuiarly Eastern
flanada, has this great advantage, one need noDt
be considered unduiy optiinistic
when he
cherishes the belief tht In the near future the
present movement of great United States industries ta locate branch establiesments In Canada will te greatly acoelerated.

Anather eminent scientist, Sir Charles A.
Parsons, inventer of the steam turbine, aiso
bears witnéss ta the saine effect. At the
iast meeting 'of the British Association for
the Advaifement of Science, hie stated:
At some time more or less remote-long
before the exhaustion of aur coal-the population will gradually inigrate to those countries
where -the natural sources of energy are mont
wbundant.

There is a great deai more te the samne
effect, but I wiil not weary the House with
that. The point I want ta make is that the
publications of the Conservation Commission are looked upon as standards when
they are dealing with the natural resources
of the country. They have created favourable comment, and ta my own knowledge
have brought many millions of invested
capital te this country because the people
having money ta invest, after consuiting
those documents, have felt that there were
certain resources here which they could
use ta their advantage.
Why shouid this Act be braught forward
ta aboiish the Commission? The Commission is the creature of the Government.
They can let it spend $50,000 a year or
$500,000 a year; they have absolute contrai
over it. Section 2 of the Act says:
In addition to ex officia membere, the Commission shall consist of twenty inembers, ap-

pointed by the Governor in Council, and who
shail hold oMeie during pleasure.

It is altogether in the hands of the Gevernment. If there is any one there who is
net satisfactory te them, or who is spending

too much money, or who the Government
feels is too aggressive in exploiting interests that should be looked after by one of
the departments, the situation can be
remedied immediately.
The third section of the Act says:
The Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of
the Interior, the Min-ister of Mines, and the
member of each provincial Government in Canada who is charged with the administration of
the natural resources of sudlh province shall
be ex-officio Tnembers of the Commission.

Now we come to the de facto members of
the Commission. Section 9 says:
No fees or emoluments of any kind whatever
shall be received by the Chairmnan or other
member of the Commission, but they shall be
repaid, their actual reasonable disbursements incurred in travelling to, returning from, and remaining at meetings of the Commission.

Therefore I claim, honourable gentlemen,
that the Government has the most perfect
and absolute control, not only of the personnel of this Commission, but of the expenditure of the Commission, and if the
members of the Commission are exceeding
their prerogatives they can be brought up
with as short a turn as the Government
likes to administer.
Here we are abolishing a Commission
whose utility bas been proved, on account
of what is claimed to be their unreasonable expenditures. We are rushing from
Scylla to Charybdis. On the same Order
Paper we have a Bill to establish a National Research Institute, which, I understand from the speeches in this Chamber,
is going to cost at least $400,000 or $500,000 for a building and equipment before it
will be ready to act, and we do not know
whether it is going to overstep its prerogatives. Surely we had better put up
with the ill that we have than fly to that
which we wot not of. In war time we
might expend a few hundred thousand dollars in experiment. A research council
might be a splen:did thing to develop the
resources of Canada at a time when we
can better afford it; but I consider the
expenditure is unnecessary at the present time, and-I think I am in order in
referring to another item on the Order
Paper-it seems to me the most inconsistent legislation to bring in one Bill to
abolish a Research Commission, and at the
same time to bring in another Bill to establish a Research Institute at a large expense.
Personally, I am not going to oppose any
measures of the Government that tend towards economy; on the other hand, I do
feel inclined to oppose a new measure that
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

tends to extravagant expenditure at a time
when we can very well defer action until a
later date.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, there were some remarks made
by my honourable friend the leader of the
Government the other day, when he spoke
on the second reading of the Bill, to which
I think attention should be called. On
reading over the speech of my honourable
friend, I noticed that he read from the
report of the Commission of 1920 a passage
which was as follows:
"We have secured a building which we will
over for a kind of club house.....
Last week a little farce, 'Love in all corners,
was put on which brought down the house.
Next week there will be a charter members
open fireside 'at home,' and then a splendid
play with which it is hoped to do a little tour(Extract from notes by a member of
ing."
the Community Association).

inove

My honourable friend led me to believe,
and I think he led others to believe, that
that was something that was done by the
members of the Commission themselvesthat they were arranging to put on this
play. But I am informed that that is an
extract from a letter written to the Commission.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
taken from a report of the Commission.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The letter appears in the report of the Commission, but
it was written by a farmer or a member
of a farming community in which the Commission had been trying to carry out a
certain line of work, in encouraging the
farming community to establish and carry
on some kind of amusement for the people.
I think that honourable gentlemen will
agree with me that that is a good work,
and that it will help to make life on the
farm happier than a great many people
think it is at the present time.
Further, in regard to the question of
overlapping, my honourable friend referred to the report of Dr. Shutt, of the
Department of Agriculture, as having also
been printed in the report of the Commission. I do not think there was any
very great harm in that, because we all
know that Dr. Shutt's work is valuable,
and that it should be read by people from
one end of the country to the other. The
effect of the publication of that particular
statement in the report of the Commission
was that it would be more widely read, and
that some people who perhaps do not
read the reports of the Agricultural Department would get information which

MAY 19, 1921
they would flot otherwise have. In regard
to agriculture, the Commission have tried
as far as possible to deal with points that
they considered were in the interests of
the country, and have endeavoured to lead
the way in certain instances and to show
the people and possibly the Department
the value of work done along certain uines.
Once they have got work of this kind under
way, they have dropped it and leit it to
the Department of AgricultuÉe or to some
other department to take hold of and carry
on. In th.ýt way I think the Commission
h'ave donc a vcry vahiable work for the
country, and, although it may appear that
for the time being there was overlapping,
the fact that they 'have discontinued their
activities in certain directions shows that
they have tried not to interfere with the
work of the departments.
There is another point referred to, by
my honourable friend which affects the
province of British Columbia particularly.
I refer to the Water Powers Branch.. My
honourable friend stated, I think, that 133
pages of the report of the Commission were
a duplication of the work of the Water
Powers Brâanch of the Department of the
Interior. I am informed that that particular work was the subject of arrange-,
ment between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Lands of
British Columbia. Perhaps 1 had better
explain for the benefit of the members of
the House that in 1908 it was decided
that -the water in the railway beit of
British Columbia belonged to the Federal
Government, not to the provincial Government. I think it was in 1911 that it was
decided that the Federal Government
shoulçl hand over the administration of the
waters in the railway beit to the British
Columbia Government. Previous to that
time the Interior Department had taken in
hand the question of the measurement of
the streams, which was a most important
one, and also the question of looking into
the water powers of the province of British Columbia. The understanding between
the Water Powers Branch and the province of British Columbia was that information in regard to, the gauging of the
streams should lac supplied to the British
Columbia Department of Lands when it
was collected by the Interior Department.
This arrangement was accordingly carried
out. The Commission also received this
information before it was published by
the Water Powers Branch of the Department of the Interior. There *a> a dlear
and distinct undeérstanding that there was
S-833

no objection to the Commission making use
of this information; and, further, when
the Commission were bringing out their
report they consulted with the director of
the Dominion Water Powers Branch, and
received from him a letter in which he
said that he had been informed that his
name was to lac included as joint author
of the report of the Conservation Commi.ssion on water powcrs. He added:
This was an absolute surprise to me, and I
assure you that I very much appreoiate the
courtesy te me personally and the consideration to the Branch over whleh I have the honour
te presid-e w'hich prompted your decision to
have this appear under our joint authorship.

Froin what my honourable friend said
the other day, it appcared to me that the
Water Powers Branch of the Interior Department did not approve of the use of the
name of the director in the report of the
Conservation Commission. The letter froin
which I have just quoted is on file in therecords of the Conservation Commission,
and I thought it only right to dTaw it toi
the attention of the House, because there
secins to be a conflict between what is set
forth in the letter and what I understood
the other day.
Whcn this report of the Water Powers
Branch of the Conservation Commission
was brought out it received the endorsation of many of the newspapers of British
Columbia. The Daily Colonist, of Victoria,
said:
it la casly the outstanding work of its kind
yet put ouit ln Canada ....
lifte the themne
of water-powers to, a new sphere of interegt
*....
There is no publication dcaling with any
resource of the province . . .. whlch le so
complete ...
It will remain a standard publication land the most exhaustive authorilty on
the subject for many years.

The Victoria Daily Times said:
A magnificent report . ... an exceedingly
valirable document and in iys preparation the
commission of Conservation has perforaned a
valuable service to British Columbia.

This report of the Commission of Conservation is, I think, a xnost valuable one
in the interest of the development of the
water powcrs of this country. The, 133
pages referred to by my honoura-ble friend
will stand as a record o! the measurements
of the streams, and will show that the Commission have not duplicatcd the 'work. I
am infornied that they would take measurements on a. stream on which no measurement had 'been taken, and that those
measurenients would give thein useful information in the work they were doing,
but that there has been no attempt on the
part of the Conservation Commission ta

SENATE

516

duplicate the work carried on by the Water
Powers Branch of the Department of the
Interior. The measurement of streams is a
work that has to go on from year to year
over a number of years, because it is only
after the streams have been measured for
a considerable time that really reliable data
can be obtained as to the amount of water
available. Therefore the information published, while it may soon become out of date
on account of changing conditions, is always
valuable as a record; and even if it has
been duplicated by the Conservation Commission, it is very proper that it should
have been contained in the report.
There are other matters in connection
with this question that make it a great
pity that my honourable friend bas decided to do away with the Commission. A
great deal of valuable work has been done
by the Commission, and it is going to be
difficult to supply its place. The association of the departments of the provinces
with those of the Dominion in certain
work was certainly brought about by the
Commission, and that valuable work, under
proper direction, would have tended to prevent overlapping, and the union of effort
would have resulted in a large amount of
very valuable information being supplied
to the country.
ý Hon. Mr. DAVID: I have followed the
monthly reports of the Conservation Commission, and T think they contain more
useful information than can be found in
any other publication in the country. I
regret, and I am sure all those who have
read the reports of the Commission must
regret that their publication will be discontinued.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-provision for carrying on
Commission's work; officers, clerks, etc.:
My lionourable
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
friend bas not given us any reply to my
question as to what arrangement bas been
made for the carrying on of the work of
the Commission,
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
say to my honourable friend, as I said the
other day, that the work which the Conservation Commission has been attempting
to do is being actively carried on by at
least half-a-dozen departments which are
doing very much more thorough, very much
more conclusive, and very much more intelligent work than the Commission did.
The Commission is not an administrative
body. At the most it could only have a
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

couple of experts w-ho would advise as to
what should be done; but they are not doing this work, and at the same time the
Government of Canada is paying out no
less than $150,000 a year for the maintenance of an organization that is simply an
advisory department to half-a-dozen departments that are charged with the actual
and practical work of covering the field, as
I pointed out the other day.
I regret that some honourable gentlemen who have spoken on this subject were
not present on May 13, when Iwent most
conclusively into this subject, and I think
fully informed the House not only as to
the overlapping of the Conservation Commission with those various departmentsthe Department of the Interior, the Department of Marine and Fisheries, the Department of Mines, the Department of
Health, the Department of Agricultureand duplicating the work of those departments, but as to practically publishing
their reports as its own. We have spent
$280,000 in publishing the reports of the
Conservation Commission-reports which
had already been published. It seems to
me, honourable gentlemen, that when the
Government of the day attempts to introduce a measure that will result in economical methôds in the public service of
Canada, it is met very frequently with an
amount of censure which should not be
visited upon the Government
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will those reports
and that monthly publication to which I
referred be replaced by something of the
same nature?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
say this to my honourable friend: it may
entail a little more research on bis part and
a little more time, but all the reports that
have been published by the Conservation
Commission will be found in the departmental reports issued from time to time.
Those reports will continue to be published,
and while they may not present the same
artistic appearance, and involve the same
cost as the Conservation reports, I will
venture to say to my honourable friend,
who is an excellent judge both of literature
and the contents of reports, that he will find
them very much more reliable and more
authoritative than those of the Conservation Commissioner, while equally interesting.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Might I ask the
Minister what department bas supervision
over the Conservation Commission?

MAY 19, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No department. As I pointed ont to the House
the other day, the difflculty lay in this: that
in 1909, when the Commission was created
by statute, it was intended to caver a very
modest field. The Minister of Agriculture
of that day stated that the staff of the Commission would cost about $10,000 a year.
It was flot controlled -by any Minister of
the Crown: -it rep<orted to PaI#ament. The
consetjuence was that there was no restraint
upon it, and the Commission grew, and
grew, and grew, being composed of a
personnel of ability, ta whom I paàid a tribute the other day when I spake on this
subject, pointing out that the staff was
composed of extremely gble men. But having once called into existence an organization of that kind, not having made it
responsible to any Minister of the Crown,
and having provided by statute that it
should report only to Parliament, it was
of course unrestrained, and it had to have
a field, and a more extended field every year.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Who wguld have
the money contrai over it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Parliament voted the money. No department
had the right ta, pass upon its expenditures; parliament passedl upon them. The
consequence wa-s that ta warrant its existence itnatqral1y went into aimost every
field of departmnental activity.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: How could parliament- vote the money uniess it was put in
the Estimatbes?
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
done in this 'way. The jonsiervation Commission made its reports through the Minister of Agriculture. At the samne time,
the Minister of Agriculture had no contrai
wbatsoever over the Commission.
That
was the advice given by the Department of
Justice ta the Minister of Agriculture;
oonsequently hie siffpiy presetnted its reports and requirements ta Parlianient fromn
time to time. Consequenkiy, the 'Coimniibsion grew until, in tihe dnterets of the
ather Departments, the intensity of rivalry
which obtained between the, Commission
and the Departmnents and the overlapping
of the work of the Departments had ta be
terminated, and the Government has taken
this method of doing it.
With regard ta the question of MY
honourable friend as ta the staff, every
attention wili be given towards seeing that
no injustice shail be done, wherever the
Government can possibly avoid it. That

517

matter is already receiving the attentian of
the Government, and I might say ta my
honourable friend who brought this matter
up that I arn very sympathetic with the
Conservation Commission staff, because it
is not their fault, and in my judgment the
Government should make every provision
to sneet the situation that wiil be creaited
by the repeai orf the Act.
Hon. G. W. FOWLER:
Honourable
gentlemen, I feel that the members of this
House would perhaps have greater confidence in this new departure if the Department ta whom it is being entrusted
were a littie mare aggressive in their
work. I think there is no Ministry
more important ta this country than
that of Trade and Commerce; but I
think I share the opinion with many others,
that that Ministry, either in the late Gavernment or in the present, bas net shawn
itself as aggressive as sa important a
Ministry should be. The Conservation Commission did very excellent work; there is
no doubt about that. It wasnat necessary
for us to hear from the Chairman af that
Commission the recital af what they had
done, in order te realize that they had
accomplished very valuabie wark far
Canada. If there bas been overiapping, as
the Minister says-and I suppose there bas
been, or he would net say it-in the
interest of economy perhaps it is better,
they having done their work, that another
line should be taken up. But I do hape that
the Ministry af Trade and Commerce,
under whose pratecting wing this Research
Council and Institute arè ta operate, wiil
wake up a bit, and see that this new institution bas an opportunity of doi-g real,
active work far Canada. As we ahl know,
we have, a ceuntry of vast resaurces, and
these shauld be developed, and it should
be the part of the Ministry of Trade and
Commerce ta see that those industries are
extended.
.Hon, J. G. TURRIFF: Honourabie
gentlemen, I hardly think that an the
question of expense my honourable friend
the leader of the Government is justified
in taking the position that the expense of
this Commission'is grawing practically out
of baunds, and is liable ta swaliaw up the
Gevernment-the lean kine swalawing up
the fat kine. Let us see what the facts are.
!n 1914-1915 the expenditure wýas $136,000
in round numbers; the next year, $132,000;.
in 1917, $116,000; in 1918, $121,000; in
1919, $124,000; in 1920, $140,000; in 19201921, $141,000. During the lait seven years

518

SENATE

there had been an increase of $15,000 per
annum. I will venture the assertion, without having looked it up, that there is not
another department under the Government
in which the increase has been so little in
the last seven years as in the Conservation
Commission. That is something to think
about-an increase of $15,000 in seven
years. That is not very much when you
come to consider Government departments,
as every one of us knows.
Another point is that there has been
duplication. I think it is impossible that
there should not be duplication. That work
involves duplication. See what the Act
says as to what the duties were, or are.
Section 10 of the Act says:
It shall be the duty of the Commission to take
into consideration all questions which may be
brought to its notice relating to the conservation and better utilizati.on of the natural resources of Canada'. to make such inventories,
collect and disseminate such information, conduct such Investigation inside and outside of
Canada, and frame such recommendations as
seem condusi-ve to the accomplishment of that
end.

Now, I maintain that if the Commission
carried out the very work that the Government stipulated they were to do, under the
Act, they could not help but deal with the
same matters that had been dealt with
by many of the departments of Government. That was the object of incorporating this Commission.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: 1 would like to
ask the honourable gentleman if he means
that the Commission of Conservation should
ascertain the quantity of water powers in
Canada, when af the same time another
department was doing the same thing?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: No.
I would
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
like to remind honourable gentlemen that
the principle of the Bill has been already
adopted, and that we have to debate now
section 2, which refers to provisions for
carrying on the Commission's work, and
what should be done with the officers and
clerks. That is ail that is left to us now
to debate.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I happened to be
called out for a little while when my honourable friend the Senator for Kamloops
(Hon. Mr. Bostock) was speaking, so I
may have missed a little of it; but I think
it is quite within the scope of the section
that you are dealing with, Mr. Chairman, to
have this discussion. What I am particularly anxious to do is this. In the speech
made by my honourable friend the leader
the other day, it seemed to me that he
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF,

cast unnecessary reflections on the Conservation Commission, accusing them of
doing ail sorts of things whieh they were
appointed to do by the Act; and therefore I want to clear the matter up a little,
and show that they were not so much to
blame. Further, I claim that they did
good work, and I only hope, if the Commission is done away with, that we shal
have some other power outside of the Government that will see to it that our great
heritage of wa-ter-power on the St. Lawrence River is not allowed to get into the
hands of American private interests. The
Conservation Commission set its face
against thât, and was instrumental in
keeping that power as the heritage of
Canada, for us and ail who may come
after us. Desperate efforts will be made
by private American interests to get
control of that power. There is not a man
in this assembly who does not know that
when that power is fully developed we
shall not have the capacity in Canada for
utilizing our full share of it, and if it is
running idle it will go to the United States;
and if ever it goes there, no power on this
earth will be able ta bring it back and
make it available for the citizens of
Canada. That was one of the things for
which I admired the Commission-the stand
they took on that particular question-and
even if the Commission is done away with,
I think the Government would be wise to
leave this matter alone until another year.
There is no chairman of that Commission
at the present time. You have a chairman
of this Research Council. If the chairman
of the Research Council is a good man,
worth $10,000 a year, as I suppose he is,
why could he not be put into the vacant
position of chairman of the Commission
of Conservation and why not let the work
go on?
There are two or three items that have
been brought to my attention and on
which I would like to say a few words.
I will not be long, These are replies by
some officer of the Commission of Conservation to the statements which had
been made concerning the Commission.
On page 4 of the memorandum, for instance, under the heading of "Alleged
Duplication and Interference re External
Affairs," here is what the Commission
officer says:
It may, however, be stated that as matters of
international moment have arisen, the Commis-

sion, from time to time, has received formal

notice of such through the Department of External Affairs, the International Joint CommisConsequent upon such notice, the
sion, etc.
Commission has taken appropriate action in
accordance with what it believed to be its right.

MAY 19, 1921
By way of illustratton, the Commission bas
publicly ' opposed the illegal diversion by the
City of Chica-go of water freim the Great La-kes
System to the Mississipi river. It has oppoeed
the granting of water power rights in the St.
Lawrence river to Driva-te intereste as in the
case of the Application for the Long Sa-uit Water
power. It has publicly contepided for the preservation of Canadian rlghts In the St. Croix,
St. Lawrence, Lake of the Woods and other international waters. The records of the International Joint Commission, and of other organizatiens, clearly demonstrate that the stand taken
by the Commission of Conservation upon ail such
issues has been lu the best Intereats of Canada
and, aise, In accord wtth the contentions of
other organizations whlch. have striven to preserve the integrity of Canada's interest lu International waters.

ail know perfectly weil that a com-.
in Chicago tapped a lake without
or license. Aîter a whiie an arrangewas made by which they g"ot 10,000
cubic feet per second and we received a
compensation in Niagara river of 10,000
feet per second. But at the present time
this samne drainage company in Chicago
are estabiishing a water power and are
trying to take an additional 10,0.00 cubic
feet per second, making 20,000 cubic feet
per second. The Conservation Commission
have set their face against that and have
been working ail the time against it, and
have done very good work.
Anotber item that is referred to is the
aiieged duplication in regard to forestry:
We

The forestry -work of the Commission Is aise
clted as au instance of duplication. This a-gain
ls Incorrect. Thbe work carried ont by the Commission hasbeen very largely in fields where
there ha-s been no contact wbatsoever with the
jurisdiction of the Forestry Bra-ncb of the
Department of the Interior. Wherever there ha-s
been such contact the Commission bas given,
and until reoýeutly has received bearty co-operatien. The wrong impression of duplication In
this case is due to lack of knowledge of the work
done by the Commission.
Sena-tor Lougheed referre-d to the Investigation, by the Commission, of cut-over lands, and
leaves the Impression that these studies were
either of an overlapping or of a wasteiful character. In reality they have been 0f the utmost
importance. Cut-over areas, under proper protection a-nd management. ca-n and should be
ma-de perpetually productive. The Commission
bas endeavoured to secure the fa-cts and figures
necessary to demonstrate their value and to
ensure their management as Important sources
cf future tlmber supplies.
-Pulp and paver interests, representing one of
Canada's foremaost Industrial asse-te, have paid
a unique testimnony to the value of the Commission s Investigations by voluntarlly defraying a
very substautial- portion of their cost. It ls
doubtful whether any otlier governmental
a-ctivity has .received such signal proof 0f appreciation by commercial Intereste. Instead of
duplication, the Commission la guilty only of a
keen perc'eption of thse need for scientifle stud"'s
of practical utilktY lu advanclng the industrial
developinent of the Dominion.

And in their a-ct of incorporation that
"as one of the very subjects with which
they were instructed to, deal.
Under the heading of "Aileged Duplication of Wild Life Conservation" the
memorandum sets forth th-at the Commis.sion have been doing just the work that
they were ca-lied upon to, do. Then, on the
"Aileged Duplication re Natural Resources
Inventory and Information" the memorandum states:
The duplication under this heading la equally
flctitlous. Wbhen the Commission was created
there was a lamentable lack of rellable dataoucerniug the extent, character, etc., of certain natural resources. The Conunission undertook to remedy this want only ln regard to sncb
resources as were net already the subject of
systematic study. The need was especially urgent
with respect to forest resources. The most extravagant Idea prevailed concerning the extent
of Canacla's supplies of standing tianher, and no
systematlc effort was being ma-de to obtain
definite information. Conseqnently, the Commission initiated a national stock-taking of forest
resources. In every instance it worked lu closest
co-operation with the federal and provincial
forestry branches.
This buge task is now well-advanced, and
i-t la worthy of note that, thanka to the Commission's efforts, Canada is yeara ahead of the
United *States iu thîs respect. The* latter country has only recently become seized of the importance of taking an early, and thorough lnventory of lts rema-ining supplies of standing
ti;nber.
Il should be empha-sized that tbe Commission
has engaged in such work only where adequate
Investiga-tory machinery had not a-lready been
put into operation. No service performed by it
bas been of greater value to Canada than 'tbis
work of making known, wîth the least possi.ble
delay, the real extent and nature of ber resources. If any proof of Its utlity or dlsproof of
duplica-tion ls required, It Io furulshed by the
constant caIl made upon the Commission for the
resuits of ls studies.
It should further be clearly understood that

bow to your ruling and will refrain from
placing on Hansard what I think should go
there. I was flot under the impression
that the Senate was so pressed with work
or that the rules of the House have been
applied as closely as they are being applied
now on the suggestion of my honourable
friend from Mîddleton (Hon. W. B. Ross),
who has transgressed the rules more often
in the past than I have. However, I respect your ruling, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to say to my honourable
friend the leader (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) that it seems to me it would
be advisable at this late day to allow this
Bill to stand; not to insist on its passage
at the present time, but to, think over the
question whether the two organizations,
the Conservation Commission and the Research Council, could not be amalgamated
with great advantage to, Canada.

the extract that I was reading, I will

alleged duplication in connection with
"Natural Resources Inventory and Information." The ]ast clause that I wish to

It should further be clearly understood that

BANKRUPTCY BILL
CONSIDE =ED IN COMM.%ITTEE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 118,
an Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act. Hon.
Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3-"Available Act of Bankruptcy":
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: What is the
change in section 3? What is the difference
between the clause in the present Act and
section 3 of thîs Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
in the definition. The definition of "Available Act of Bankruptcy" is very much
clearer and more coFmplete in this than in
the Act.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The objection
I see to it is that "available act of bankruptcy" means "«an act of bankruptey commîtted within six months before the date,"
etc. The period of six months strikes me
as being too long. I think the period should
be limited to thirty or at the most sixty
days; otherwise in the case of a man who
has committed an act of bankruptcy nearly
six months before, although he has recovered from it, a petition might be presented against him and he might be declared a bankrupt under this very section.
It seems to me that sixty days at any rate
would -be quite sufficient and would serve
ail necessary purposes. I move that "sixty
days" be inserted instead of "six months"
in line 2 of paragraph h, section 3.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wll
the Committee permit me to bring Mr.
O'Connor within the Bar? I would say to
my honourable friend from Goderich (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot) that not only is this the
period that has been in the Act since it was
passed, but it is the same as in the English
Act, after which our statute bas been
largely modelled.
Even so, I
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
think the period is too long and that it
should be shortened. We are not bound to
accept the period fixed in England, and the
rnere fact that it bas been in force in our
statute for a couple of years should not be
a governîng factor.
But
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
this refers to an act of bankruptcy committed "within six months."
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:

Quite true.

MAY 19, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Consequently, if the act has been committed
within sixty days, as mentioned by rny honourable friend, this clause covers it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
Quite true,
but why go back six montha? That is the
point I arn trying to make-that six months
is toc far to go back, and that the act of
bankruptcy should be an act which has
been committed within sixty days and not
within six months.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No;
because the effect of an act may not have
been feit until nearly six months have gone
by, or the act may nlot have been discovered. Take, for instance, the transfer
of property or the contraction of an obligation which manifestly would render the
man bankrupt: it might not be disclesed
within sixty days; it might take six months
for some one to ascertain that it had been
done or committed.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is just
the point: there should be some finality
about it, and persons who are dealing with
property should not be subject to the liability of a petition being presented that refers
back beyond sixty days, which. is the period
fixed in the Assignments and Preferences
Act of the Province of Ontario, and Vhis
is considered in that province to be quite
sufficient. The section~ which deals with
the transfer of property, if I remember
correctly, is section 30; and section 31 deals
with the assignant or co«iveyance of botok
dobts. Why should a pergon who, bas
taken a conveyance which might be attacked under section 30 be subject 'to that
liability beyond say thirty or sixty days
bacc? I submait that that shouldi be
changed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:. If my
honourable frier.d will look up the statute
under section 3, he will find the Act that
constitutes bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
I know the
section.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
are practically fraudulent cases. It must
he manifest to every honourgble gentleman that the disclosure might not take
place within two montha. The very person
in whose favour it would be made would
conceal the fact of its having been made
until the two monthe went by.
lion. Mr. BEIQUE: I think six months
is too short. I think it should be a year
or two years.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: In my view it
is toc long. A man takes a conveyance of
proêperty, and il it is going te be attacked the attack should be made within
a reasonable time. If it is attacked within
sixty days the party attadekng it cougM
proive what is requiréd te be proved; it
would be prima fadie evidence that the
conveyance was fraudulent.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: What woulçl the
honourable gentleman say to this? A creditor may be in .England, and may not
know of the act fer three or four months
or more, and then the time would have
expired.
Hon. -Mr. PROUDFOOT: The principal
objection I have is that this extends the
time beyond sixty days, which is the period
that we 'have had for years under the
Aiseigniments scnd Preferences Act in the
Province of Ontario, and is found to work
very satisfactorily.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Does it flot bear on
the date of conveyances which are supposed to be registered and made public?
Here we are dealing with any act of bankruptcy, which may not be made known..
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.: A purely
fraudulent transfer might be attacked at
any time; -but the abject of fixing six
n1onths or sixty days is te deal with a case
in which no fraudulent transfer takes
place. This makes it prima facie fraudulent, and a man has really no defence;
while, if you could'establish the fact that
it was clearly a fraudulent transaction, you
could set it aside, no matter what the
limits of time might be. In my opinion,
when an Act operates in this way, the
time limit should net be longer than I have
stated.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot was negatived, and section 3 wa,
agreed to.
Section 4 was agreed te.
On section 5-person:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
change in the definitian is made se as to
include within the Act the definition appearing in the Interpretation Act. It has
been contended that the definition in the
Interpretation Act did net apply to the
Bankruptcy Act.
Section 5 was agreed te.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have an amendment to propose, as section 5-A of the
Bill. It is ta add to section 3 of the Act, as

SENATE

paragraph i, a further statement of an Act
of bankruptcy. It reads as follows: "who
being a trader, ceases to meet his liabilities
generally as they become due." I understand that this point was raised before, but
that it was not confined to traders. I understand this provision was included in the
Act of 1874.
Hon. Sir. JAMES LOUGHEED: If my

honourable friend will hand that in after
we go through the other sections, we will
return to it.
On section 6-dismissal of petition:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Why is that
change considered desirable?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is to
make it compulsory on the court to dismiss
a bankrupt's petition when the court is not
satisfied that the estate can be best administered under the assignment. Why should
it not be made compulsory?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It should stili
be left in the discretion of the court.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 7 and 8 were agreed to.
On section 9-fyling of assignments

in

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is a further amendment that we wish to
make to section 9. It is proposed to add
at the end of the provisions thereof the
following:
This section, substituting "forthwlth"' for
"within four days of such assignment," and for
"Within four days of bis appointment," shall

It is simply to bring all the cases up to

meeting, who must exercise proper discretion.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: As the estatp
would be in the hands of the authorized
trustee, I do not see how it could be dissipated.
Section 13 was agreed to.
Sections 14 and 15 were agreed to.
On section 16-new trustee may
substituted:

be

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do flot see
that there is any difference between the
old section and the new ohe except in
phraseology, and 1 take exception to either.
The section provides that:
A maJority in number of those who have
Proved debts of $25 or upwards and holding haif
or more of the amount of the proved debts of
$25 or upwards may, at their discretion, ait any
meeting of creditors, substitute any other authorized trustee acting for or within the same
bankruptcy district or division for the trustee
named in the receiving order or to whomo an
authorized assignment has been made.
In practice, I arn told that has been
working out in a certain place in this way.
Companies acting as authorized trustees
tave been empowered to act in more than
.
one province. They have acted in several
of the western provinces and perhaps in
the eastern provinces as well. The debtor
to an approved
makes an assignment
trustee in the first instance. Immediately
a certain body-I do not want to name it
here-gets busy with the creditors and
gets the assignment transferred to it. It is
within the right of the creditors to consent to the transfer of the assignment to
some one other than the original assignee,
the authorized
Act empowers
but the
trustee to be appointed for a district. In
the West a district is a province. A cornpany such as 1 speak of may have offices
in more than one province: it may have

MAY 19, 1921
offices in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and
Alberta. The debtor makes an assignment,
say in the province .of
Saskatchewan.
Immediately this company gets busy and
says, "We want to change that assignment,"
and frequently they interview the creditors, who give the requisite consent,
although under the Act there are authorized trustees for that district. The work
of the assignment is carried on in a
province outside of that in which it was
mnade. Say the assignment is made in
Saskatoon. As a resuit of this, operations
are carried on in the city of Winnipeg,
which was neyer contemplated by the Act
at ail. What I think was contemplated by
the Act originally is that ail the operations
of clerical and office work and the convening of the meetings should be carried on
in the province. Some of the companies say
they have the power to carry on the work
in Calgary, or Winnipeg, or Vancouver, or
anywhere .else, even though the assignment
is made in Saskatoon.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
clerical work.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Ail the work
-the meeting of the creditors.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What would my
honourable friend propose?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That ail the
work in connection with the winding-up
of the estate should be carried on in the
district in which the authorized assignment
is made.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The district or the
province?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: -In the West
the province is the district:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
is the objection to the creditors determining that? It is entirely in the hands of
the creditors. If it can be more economically carried on at some point distant from
where the bankrupt lives, and where the
business is, why shouldn't it?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The creditors
in the first- instance seek to do business
with a trader at a certain point. He, as
well as the creditor, is interested in the
bankruptcy proceediÉgs. He may be interested in getting a discharge afterwards,
and there may be a 'lot of local creditors.
I think it is very important that the man
who gives him credit in a certain district
should go into that district for the purpose
of liquidating the estate.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
point out this case? Take a merchant carrying on business in one of the smaller towns
of the West. His creditors are chiefly in
the large wholesale centres such as Montreal, Toronto, and Winnipeg. There would
be very few of the' creditors in the small
town in which he is carrying on business.
My honourable friend surely does not propose that the creditors should be called to
that particular distant hamlet.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The proceedings should be conducted in that district.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I'always understood the Act to mean that you had to
make an assignment to an -authorized
assignee in the province, and that the work
would be carried on in that province. I
understand, from what my honourable
ifriend fromn Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) says, that .some of the companies
which are authorized assignees in Saskatchewan have offices in Winnipeg also, and
that they yvoulId carry on the business in
Winnipeg. I do not think they are authorized to do that. I think they must have
a place of business in the province. I do
not see how we could remedy that very
well; but the objection I see to the subsection is this:
Creditors constituting a majorlty in number
of those who have proved debts of $25 or upwards.

I think that should be $100. In ail
Acts, in Ontario at any rate, we have neyer
had creditors appear at those meetings
unless they had dlaims ainounting to $100
or upwards. That was the way under the
old Insolvent Act in Ontario, what we
called the Act of 1875, and we operated
under that Act for many years until it was
repealed. It is very objectionable to have
a large number of creditors with dlaims of
only $25 attending meetings of creditors.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- I would
point out that the amendment which is
under consideration éloes not touch the
point we are discussing. It is simply to
prevent an interpretation being placed on
the word "majority," as it is contended
that it is a majority of the majority that
gives the trustee authority.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: My objection
to it goes to the original section.
Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
you are flnot discussin-g the amendment
which we have mnade, because the change
which has been made in section 16 is in
the first two Uines.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: My remarks
as to the $25 are quite in order.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
runs ail through the Act, 1 arn informed.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: .It seerns to me that
the point mentioned by the honourable
member for Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) is governed by 'section 9 of the Act.
There it is stated where and to whorn the
assignrnent may be smade. Then if you
turn to, section 14 you find that the Governor in Council may appoint trustees in
bankruptcy for the different districts or
divisions. 1 do not take it that there is
any assignee or trustee -appointed to cover
more than one province. I arn farniliar
with the Orders in Council that have been
passed, but 1 take it for granted that each
district bas a trustee or assignee, who is
limited, and does not extend t'o more than
one province, and has authorîty in only
a very small part of that province.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Would the honourable gentleman look at subsection 2
of section 14 of the Act, and he will see
that the trustee has power to act anywhere.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: He bas, as far as
concerns the enforcing of the interest with
whîcb he bas been vested, but bis autbority
to receive an assignment is limited to the
district to wbicb be was appointed.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The district
to wbich be is appointed-tbis may cbange
to another one under the Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No; if you refer
to section 16 of tbe Bill it says:
Any other authorized trustee acting for or
withjn the same bankruptcy district or division
for the trustee named in the receiving order
or to whom an authorized assignment ha& been
made.

So it is the trustee named, acting for or
within tbe same bankruptcy district. So
it, strikes me tbat tbis does not allow the
taking of the affairs of the debtor away
outside of the district.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I move that
$25 be cban-ged to $100 'wberever it occurs.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose rny bonourable friend proposes moving
the same arnendrnent throughout tbe Act?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:

Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Tbat
*will give us considerable trouble, will It
flot?
Hon. Sir JA-MES LOUGIHEED.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I find in tbe
working out of the Act that wbere you
send a notice to a creditor who bas a dlaim
cf $25 or $30, you have more trouble, fine
times out of ten, with bim than with tbe
people who corne forward witb daims
amounting to tbousands of dollars.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
will you do witb it?

What

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Tbey rnay file
their daims, but they have no voting power,
and tbey do not corne to tbe meeting, and
da not botber you wben tbey bave no voting

Preferences Act a creditor bad no rigbt at a

Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

number of people with small daims, and
you bave more trouble witb tbem tban

tbink we should make tbat change in the
interest of the working out of the Act.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I tbink SO too. I
agree witb the bonourable gentleman.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED : We will
let section 16 stand.
Section 16 stands.
Sections 17, 18 and 19 were agreed to.
On section 20-permission limited to particular thing or class:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not quite
understand tbe object of that change.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
object is, that tbe trustees have found it
awkward to receive written instructions
from the inspectors of the individual thing
that requires to be done. It is now proposed to secure the autborization of tbe
doing of classes of things, instead of every
itemized tbing being authorized.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I bave acted as
inspector under tbis Act where it was impossible for the inspector to attend, and
we always had it entered if writing and
signed, so tbat it would be filed in the
form of a minute of the particular proceeding that we were taking. I tbink tbis
proposai will'give rise to looseness in carrying out the business.

MAY 19, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is not
a general permission. As my honourable
friend will see, that is negative:
The permission given for the pur-posez of this
section shaltl flot be a general permnission to do
ail or any of the above mentioned thIngs but
shall only be a permrission to do the perticular
thing or things or clams of thing or tbiings
which. the wiitten permission speoifles.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I see; it is not
very important.

SITTINGS 0F THE SENATE
MOTION

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That, commenclng on May 21, Instant, uniess
differently ordered, there shall be two distinct
*ittings of the Senate every day, the flrst oittIng
to commence at eleven o'clock, a.m., until one
o'ciock, p.m., and the second sitting to comtnence at three o'clock, p.m., and tihat ail Standing and Select Committees of the Senate be permitted to ait whlle the Senate la In Session, notwithstandi-ng tanything contrary In Rule"86.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What necessity is
there for sitting to-morrow?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
there is not only every possibility but
every .probability
of prorogation being
reached next week.
The fact that the
Commons is sitting on Saturday la another
reason why this Chamber should sit. But
there is the further reason, whieh will
possibly appeal to many honourable gentlemen, that, owing to the rather rigid
interpretation of the Indemnity Act, some
of our members unfortunately wlll not be
able to make the grade, if I may use the
expression; but, il we should ait to-morrow
and also next week, they will succeed in
reaching the terminal, and it is very desirable to assist them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand that the honourable gentleman
intends to hold two sittings on Monday?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If we
sit to-niorrow we will then adjourn until
Monday night. I see no necessity at present
for 'two sittings a day, but I desire the
motion to go through in this way in case
of necessity.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It does nôt
mean that we will sit at il to-morrow.
*Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
leave that to the House.,
Hlon. Mr. WATS ON: Sit at 10 o'clock.
Hoft. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
be willing to do that.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: Sit at 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning, and then adjourn until
Monday night?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: I was going to
objectHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I know
my honourable ftiend is always willing to
help a fellow Senator in distress.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: I have not the Act
before me, but my recollection of it is that
it mentions the number of days threequarters of which members must be
present: it is not the number of sittings.
Would this cover that point?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, I
understand this would cover the point, if
we meet to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: To-morrow morning would count as a day. I do not
want to be at cross purposes; but I
think that honourable imembers have been
very remiss in this regard and they
require to be, even by statute, "jacked
up," to use the vernacular; especially
some of our friends from the central parts
of Canada. I do not wish to be personal.
Honourable members from the East and
from the West have sat here every day
the House bas been in session. We have
come here at the beginning of the Session,
as the statute demands of us. The Western members have to leave home a week
in advance. Then, after three or four
days of perfunctory work in dealing with
the Address, the House adjourns for a
fortnight and Western and Eastern members are left to tramp the streets of Ottawa with nothing to do. I think the Act
should be amended. The present condition of affairs is an anomaly. I have no
sympathy at all with my honourable
friends from Quebec and Eastern Ontario.
We adjourn at certain hours in order to
permit them to go home. We are all paid
for doing a certain amount of work, but
the members from the West and from the
extreme East have to stay here continuously, while other honourable members
may go to their homes. I think it is an
outrage that the Act should be so framed
as to serve only what I may call the middle
of the country-Quebec and Eastern Ontario.
Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: We do not want
your sympathy at all.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I think the honourable leader of the Government is taking a
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

very wise course. I do not want to see any
honourable member deprived of anything
if by accident or otherwise he is not able
to be present here. I know that some of
my honourable friends might be deprived
through an improper interpretation of the
law. I might have been in a similar position myself. I think the utmost leniency
should be exercised in order that honourable members may have the opportunity of
getting their stipend for this year, but
after this year all should be expected to
do their duty.
The motion was agreed to.
HALIFAX GRAVING DOCK EXPRO.
PRIATION
MOTION FOR PAPERS

Hon. WM. ROCHE moved:
That an humble address be presen-ted to His
Excellency the Governor General praying His
Excellency to cause to be laid before the Senate;
Copies of all letters, Orders in Council
Memorials, Decisions, Judgments and Appeals
arising out of or connected with the action of the
Federal Government in expropriating the property of the Halifax Graving Dock Company,
Limited, and in afterwards transferring the said
property to the Halifax Shipyards, Limited.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I will
briefly state the facts on which this motion
is founded. The Halifax drydock was built
some 40 years ago. It was supported by
subsidies from the Dominion Government,
the Provincial Government, and the city of
Halifax. For 10 years those subsidies were
passed. The dock and the works accompanying it cost about $2,000,000. The dock
was in a good state of repair. The company and management appropriated yearly
a sufficient sum to maintain it in its original
condition. The excavations being made out
of the solid rock, it did not cost much for
repairs to the lower portion; it was only
the upper portion that had to be maintained as I have described. The earnings
of the drydock were $264,000 a year. It had
accommodated the ships of the navy before
and during the war, and other vessels also
found accommodation in the dock. It was
in good order, with the exception of some
damage to the buildings by the explosion
which took place in the neighbourhood.
The dock, in the condition that I have
described, was expropriated by the Federal
Government and handed over to the Halifax Shipyards, Limited.
We all recognize that for the purposes
of railway extension or of a public work
of the Government's ownership it is necessary for the private individual to give
way; but for the Government to expropri-

MAY 20, 1921
ate private property and hand it over to
another private individual or company, unlees the very strongest and most pressing
reasons exist for that transfer, le regardedi
as an outrage and an exercise of arbitrary
power.
If this had been done to, an opponent of
the Government a great many people might
say that it served him right; but the
gentleman who was the manager of the
dock in which part of his private fortune
was engaged and upon which he depended
for his business living, was always a firm
supporter of the present Government. I
believe that he went so far on one or two
occasions as to vote against myseif, and
for that reason I think he was one of the
most obdurate supporters of the present
Government.
There was a judicial inquiry held after
this expropriation was made, and after a
prolonged trial the proprietors of the docks,
most of whom were English capitaliste,
were handed $1,250,000, against the $2,000,000 which they had embarked in the enterprise;, and also deductions were made on
account of the sum that was to be handed
over by the Relief Commission. The proprietors of the dock consideied that the
award given was totally inadiequate to the
value ofthe property. The point of my
motion now je to elicit from the Government what overmastering reasons.they had
for taking a property of this description,
sb valuable, so useful, and so niuch endeared to the people of Halifax, and handing it 'over to another company, who will
do a similar business. That is the summary of what I have to say, and I now,
move the motion, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Power.
Hon. JOHN STANFIELD: Before the
honourable gentleman takes hie seat, may
1 ask why did the dock owners not appeal
te the Supreme Court against the judgment of the Exchequer Court?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I cannot say wh4,t
reasons constra'ined them to make firet Ïh
appeal to the sense of justice of the Government.
Hon. L. G. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I arn very glad that my honourable
colleague from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche)
has broughtthis matter before the House.
Juet whiat the practical result of 'hie action
may be I do not know; bfit there -le a very
important piinciple involved in this case,
and I think that the Senate, whieh le
supposed to be a censervative 'body, should

527

hesitate before endorsing the action of the
Government with respect to this Halifax
drydock.
Briefly, the Halifax drydock was started
more than thirty years ago. Tho company
received a very moderate help £rom the
Admiiralty, from the city of Halifax, and
from the Government of Canada, the assistance in the whole amounting, I think, to
$600,000. The company began in a comparat-ively mod'est way, and they worked
along quietly year after year, and in the
end had succeeded in building up a really
good and profitable business. The Halifax drydock did a vast amount of good
work before the war and during the early
part of the war. It was not the largest
dock in the world, -but it was large enough
to accommodate every ship that put in to
the' port for repaire.
Everything was going on eatisfactorily.
Then the ýGovernment, apparently repreeenting another coinpany, preposed to take
this very valuable property, worth over a
million 'dollars, away from the company that
had 'built; up the business. The Halifax
Drydock Company were net willing te seli
at the figure that was mentioned. Then
the Government exercised a right which
I think should be very carefully watched:
they expropriated this valuable propertytook it 'by force of law; se that the Halifax
Drydock Company lost their property for
what they looked upon as toc, email a compensation. If the Govemsnent intefnded
carrying on a drydock at Halifax 'bhesnselves, tbley might poosibly'have, been pardoned for exprop'iating the pToperty. But
they did not: they took the property over
and transferred it to ainobher Comnpany.
Thatr, I thinic, niust strike every honoudrable
gentleman as being a greiat aibuse cf
pewer.
If you go back to the dfye of King
John, you finid that he under-took in thle
Great Charter not only not to interfere with
the personal liberty of hie subjects, but
not to interfere with their property except
by due course of law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the honcurable gentleman declare that the drydock
wae expropriated by the Federal Government for the purpose of harding it over
to another coinpany?
Hon. Mr. POWER: That is just .it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And not for
the purpose of natienalizing it-using it
as a national drydock?
That le just it.
Hon. Mr. POWER:
When they started to expropriate they did

SENATE
not publish the fact that they were going
to hand the property over to another
company; but that was their intention, and
every one who was in the know was aware
of that fact. Honourable gentlemen must
feel that, as I say, that is a great violation
of the fundamental principles of British
law and of our constitution. I think that
the Senate should certainly not approve
of the action of the Government-that they
should distinctly disapprove of it. It is
really taking the property of one set of
men and handing it over to another set of
men, not to the public.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I do not know how you can thrash
out this question thoroughly until you get
the return. The motion for the return does
not affirm or deny anything in particular.
As I understand the case with regard to
the Halifax Drydock Company, they complain of two things: first, that the Government, under the War Measures Act, took
the fee simple of the dry dock instead of
taking it for thé period of the war'; and,
secondly, that even if they took the fee
simple they should have taken it only for
the purpose of the Government and not
for the purpose of selling it to a private
company.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Or turning it over.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is the complaint.
I presume this matter can be, discussed
when the papers are brought down. You
cannot very well discuss it now. If what
the Halifax Graving Dock Company say
is correct-that the property was taken
under the War Measures Act in fee simple,
-of course there is no doubt that that, was
illegal; but that point would come up, I
should think, in the courts of law when the
case was contested there. You want to see
the judgment, you want to see all the facts,
before you arrive at a conclusion with
regard to that. You also want to know
whether it is a fact or not that the Government expropriated, not for themselves, but
for the Halifax Shipyards, Limited. But
I do not see how we are going to discuss
it now, or until we get these papers.
Of course,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the motion for the papers can be passed,
but the affirmation will go out to the public
that this private property was expropriated
for private ends by the Government. That
is the accusation, and it is one of the most
serious accusations that I have heard
against any Government; and because the
accusation has been launched I would ask
my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James
Hon. Mr. POWER.

Lougheed) that if he is not familiar with
the facts he will inform himself before
prorogation. I can quite understand that
the Government would expropriate private
property, whether a graving dock or anything else, for public ends; but a totally
different complexion is given to the transaction by the assertion that it was not
brought about' by the Government for the
purposes of the State, but that quite
apparently there was a private motive
behind the transaction, and certain private
interests were urging the Government to
make the expropriation in order that the
property might pass, into their bands. I
really cannot believe that such a thing is
possible, and I would like the honourable
leader of the Government to enlighten the
House, or, if he has not the information
at present, to supply it in the course of

next week.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say in answer to my honourable friend
that I regret having no information upon
the subject.
These charges against the
Government of the day are of course so
frequently made and are so frequently
couched in somewhat uncharitable language
to say the least, that one does not take
them as seriously as the public may. I am
unaware of the facts touching this particular subject. I shall endeavour to have the
papers brought down at an early day, so
that before prorogation, as my honourable
friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandarand) has suggested, we may be able to
discuss the matter with some intelligence.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Excuse me a moment.
This motion, to be of value, ought to be a
little wider than it is. It calls for: "Copies
of all letters, Orders in Council, Memorials, Decisions, Judgments and Appeals."
What you really want is the record of the
trial before the Exchequer Court judge,
if that can be got, because that would give
the facts.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Was there a trial
of the case?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: There was a trial. That
is just where we are handicapped in discussing this thing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has a
judgment been given?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes, but the trouble
is that we have not a copy of it. Of course,
one of the answers may be: "Why were not
these points raised at the trial?"

MAY 20, 1921
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Was it a
trial to fix ,the amount of the expropriation?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes; by Judge Cassels.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it under consideration now?
Hon. Mr. ROSS. No. He gave jildgment
and the Com.pany got their money, as I
understand.,
Honl. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course,
that would answer one part of the question as to the expropriation and the fixing of the anxount; but there is coupled
with that the allegation that this expropriation was made for the purpose of tiransferring the drydock to another private
finm.
That is the surprising part of the
charge.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes, but do you not see,
-with regard to that, that it would 'be open
to the Exchequer Court judge to say that
the whole expropriation was bad, because
it was not taken for the purposes of the
Expropriation Act, but was an act of spoliation. You see, you want to get the record
before you, in order to be sure of your
ground.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was that issue
raised?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: That is what we want
to know.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
We do not
know.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: We want the record.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I thought my
honourable friend knew.
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If it
was not raised, the assumption would be
that ail parties were willing parties to the
transaction.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: Not necessanily the expropriated party.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The two complaints I
mentioned you can get only froni the
record: that is, that the Governmient took
the fee simple instead of taking the
property for -a terni of years, and then,
that they made the expropriation for the
purposes, not of the Governnxent, bûft of a
private company.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: On page 426 of
the Journals of 1920 1 see that a motion
w4s made in -respect to this matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

papers brought down?

Hon, W. B. ROSS: I do flot think that

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We have flot the

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK,: Do I understand
that this motion 110w covers those proceedings? We want to be quite clear about that.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think we need
another word in there-the word "record.»
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Record of ail

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Perhaps the honourable member for Halifax would agree to
enlarging the motion by adding the words
"and the records of the Exchequer Court."
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I would be very glad
to agree to any amendment made to include
any judgment of the Exchequer Court,.or
whatever might be acceptable to the House.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would move to
add, after the word "decisions," the words
"and the record of the Exchequer Court."

BANKRUPTCY BILL
PEJRTHER 1CýON8ID]DRED IN COMMITTFIE

The Senate again went into committee on
Bill 118, an Act to amend the.Bankruptcy
Act.-Hon. Sir James Lougheed. Hon. Mr.
Blain in the chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
16 stood over, that we might consider the
motion made by the honourable member for
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) to, substitute $100 for $25 as the amount of dlaim
that would entitie a creditor to be present
at a meeting.
Hon. Mr. PIROUDFOOT: I asked the
committee to let that section stand; but, in
view of the circumstances which happened
at the time the Act was passed, and the
arrangement made with certain dealers at
that time, I will withdraw my objection
in the meantime and let it go as it is.
Section 16 was agreed to.
On section 28-removal of goods; bank
deposits:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
change consists in substituting the word
"epermission" for the word "consent" in a
nDIrION.

530

SENATE

case where the permission of inspectors is
required to the removal of property out of
the jurisdiction. The word "consent" may
have an ex post facto operation: the word
"permission" has not. The result is to
make the provision more stringent.
Section 23 was agreed to.
On section 24-trustee carrying on business of debtor may apply to court for sale
of property by tender if creditors refuse or
neglect to repay advances:
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
object of adding section e is to protect
trustees, especially in connection with
estates of some magnitude. If the property of the estate is being offered for
sale and no bidders appear, the court reoffers it, and on the re-offering the trustee
may bid for his own protection. The section is new.
One would
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
suppose- that a trustee, with the consent
of the inspectors, would be sufficiently protected. I am afraid this clause is brought
forward byý trustees more in their own
interest than anything else.
Section 24 was agreed to.
On section 25-avoidance of general
assignment of book debts:
This
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
section is exactly the same as the one in
the present Act except that the words "to
any other person" have been dropped after
the word "thereof" in the third line. The
words dropped were in all probability
innocuous, and it is immaterial whether
they remain as in the original Act, or are
dropped as in this amendment. I do not
know that it makes any serious change.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The preceding
section is certainly a very serious one,
giving the trustee very wide powers. However, I suppose the court will protect the
creditors.
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
court can always intervene.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is all done
with the sanction of the court but these
orders are usually obtained from the court
by the trustee, and of course they are presented in such a way as only to show the
reason why the trustee wants such and
such things done.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
inspectors have perfect liberty to express
their views on it.
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But it does not
seem to incorporate any action-on the part
of the inspectors.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Look
under the first three lines of paragraph c:
If the credttors, within ten days after demand
by the trustee (made to the inspectors or at
any meeting of creditors called by the trustes
for the purpose of making any such demand)

refuse, etc.
You cannot blame the trustee for protecting himself.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Oh, no.
BeHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
cause he is usually the target.
They take
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
pretty good care of themselves.
Section 25 was agreed to.
On section 26-payments, etc., without
notice of bankruptcy:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Owing
to the amendment. by this Bill, of the
definition of "available act of bankruptcy,"
which we discussed and passed yesterday,
the three words "before that time" which
appear at the end of subsection 1 of secThe
tion 32 have become superfluous,
amendment strikes them out.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot follow
that. That seems to be a mistake in the
numbering of the section.
Section 26 was agreed to.
On section 27-when misrepresentation
or fraud a defence for contributory to insolvent corporation:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: This is a very
drastie, and I think a most undesirable
piece of legislation. Under the subsection
as it is now proposed to be amended, any
contributory who is called on must have
brought an action to set aside any purchase by him before the Act of Bankruptcy. Prowling all over the prairie provinces before the war and since then, I presume, were fellows selling shares in all
kinds of companies. They sold them to
everybody who was willing to buy. The
bulk of the soteks turn out to be abUnder this proposed

nection with the purchase of the shares.
Big business men do not need protection,
perhaps, but the average srnali purchaser
does. There are rnany people ail over the
West, particularly in villages and towns,
who buy shares in companies on the representations of agents working on commission. Those purchasers, often live remote
from large centres, and are not informed
as to the standing of the company, and
tbey accept the representations, of the
agent who selis the stock. It is a long time
before those buyers know anything about
the financiai condition of the company,
and it is only when bankruptcy or something like that is committed that tbey learn
that they should be on the list of contributors; and by that tirne they are too
late. I think this is a singularly unfortunate section. It wouid cut out the right
of redress that crowds of people many of
them within my own knowiedge would have
against shares sold on a fraudulent misrepresentation. It may be that it is desirable, in 'winding up an estate, to put some
limit of time within which the contributor
must put in the notice of cancellation of
bis subscription, but this subsection igs
going to deprive hirn of every right he now
possesses. The first notice the .amali investor tas of the bankruptcy is the notice
that he is to be put on the list of contributories;' and if he bas not done someI
thing before that he is out of court.
think some reasonable time sbould be put
in-one year, two years, or something of
that kind. That would not unduly prolong the liquidation of the estate. I arn
not making a formai motion, but I suggest
to the leader the propriety of putting some
limitation on the drastic nature of that
provision.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I think that
clause shouid come out altogether, because
it is highly unfair to the person who bas
purchased stockc. The !Iaw as it stands at
present gives a person who lias bougbt
stock under misrepresentation of the facts
leave to bring an action to have bis contract cancelled. Uxnder this subsection he
is going to be deprived of 'that right uniess he brings the action to have his subscription canoeiled at a time when possibly
he does not; ksnow that--there is anything
at aIl wrong with it. It looks to me as
though some assignee or trustee were
trying to put something into the Act whereby hie wouid be able to place people on the list
of contributories who sbould not be there.
In Ontario we bave bad a great many actions brougbt under the Winding-up Act,
S-34î

and portions of that Act are very unfair
to peuple wbo bave subscribed for stock.
I arn satisfied that the latter portion of this
clause bas been put in for 'the purpose of
meeting certain actions wbicb have been
brought in the province of Ontario, and
wbich are flot satisfactory to certain trustees there. If we get at the root of thi.3
I believe we will find that some person in
tbe position of a trustee bas inspired just
such a clause as this.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Before
rny honourable friend indulges too mucli in
suspicions as to bow this subsection *bas
corne to be here, we 'had botter consider the
origin of it. Tbe fact is that this clause'
is practically taken frorn the Windring-up.
ActHon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
where it cornes from.

Yes, that fs-

Hon. Sir JAMES ILOUGHEED:-and
the object of introducing the clause bere
is to harmonize the two Acts. That is to
say, under the Winding-up Act, where a
cornpany is being wound tup, you invoke
precisely this saine priaciple of law.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But my rec'ollection of our Winding-up Act la that the
contributory is not bound to take proceedings within a certain tirne 'before the order
for winding-up is made, and I think the
words in the latter portion of tbis section
are intended to overcorne certain decisions
of our courts under tbe Winding-up Act
dealinýg exactly witb tbe question at issue.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU*GHEED: I do
not understand that to be the case. Should
it be so, I would suggest to my honouraible
friend to introduce into this Bill the same
clause as the Winding-up 'Act contains, and
I will let this stand, because there is no
reason why the two should be differentthe contributor being precluded in one and
allowed in tbe other-both having *to do
witb practically bankrupt estates.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Wby sbould
a person be placed in a different position
sirnply because of a winding-up order or because the -man lbas made an assignment
under tbis Act? Is hie to ibe placed in 'a
different position te that which he *would
occupy if the company hrought action

brought action against him, he would
be in a position to succeed; but in
this case lie cannot succeed uniess

course, we could flot give effect to those.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The Dominion
Act supersedes ail the local Acts.

Consequently the trustee intervenes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Why not have
him intervene in the first instance?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Because the application may be on the part of the contributory.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Has my honourable friend the section of the Winding-up
Act that deals with this matter?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is the
adjustment of the dîfferences between the
contributories.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
have not. We will allow this section to
stand and will look into it, because honourable gentlemen will recaîl that provision
is made in the Bankruptcy Act by which
a winding-up under the Winding-up Act
may ibe transferred to this Act; consequently you are confronted with a similar
provision to this in the Winding-up Act,
and if we omit it in this Bill we have that
inconsistency.
Probably it
lion. Mr. BELCOURT:
would be well to amend the provisions
in the Winding-up Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
or to strike it out. I would be quite prepared to strike it out of both.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That seems to
me quite proper. But why is the word
"may" substituted for the word "shaîl?"

This very
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
question was raised in the courts in Toronto
the other day. Where a mnan ha-d made an
assigniment, and application was then made
to have it tra-nsferred un#ier the Windiingup Act, it was held that this Ac.t was quite
suffIcient, and the court declined to make
the order asked for.
Section 27 stands.
On section 28-adjustments of rights of
contributories:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Act as it at present stands enables the court
to adjust dlaims of contributories between
themselves, but it does not provide machinery for doing it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why is the word
"imay"' substituted -for the word "shah"'?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not think
the clause bears the interpretation which
you put upon it. It says:
The court may, on the application of any contributory,-

1 thînk it should be on the application
of the trustee.
Hon. Mr,.

PROUDFOOT.-

It
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
leaves it discretionary wvith the court. The
court, on hearing the application, may consider it flot well grounded. Why not leave
the discretion with the court?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The duties delegated to it are very wide. It says, "adjust
the rates." I think the word "shaîl" is
better than the word "n¶ay," and I suggest
that you make the substitution.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: AlI
right.
The proposed amendinent of Hon. Mr.
Bëlcourt wae agreed to, and section 28,
as amended, was agreed to.
Sections 29 and 30 were agreed to.
On section 31-notice that If dlaim not
proved within thirty days, divîdend or final
dividend will be made:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I think that
when a person has notice of a dlaim it
would be only fair and right that there
should be some judicial steps taken to compel him to bring in his dlaim, and that if
the dlaim were not brought in within a
certain time it should he disallowed. Many
persons who have dlaims and receive a
notice of that kind might be cut out; and
it would be hetter for the trustee and better for the creditor if the clause provîded
for some judicial disposition of the dlaim.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, I do not
know. I should think thirty days were
ample time for any person to prove hîs
dlaim. Expedition is what you want.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 have
an amendment to move to section 31. It is
as follows:

MAY 20, 1921
To insert between the words "within" and
"thirty days", in the 8th line of the section,
the words, "a period limited by the notice, and
expiring not sooner than"-

The proposed amendment of Hon. Sir
James Lougheed was agreed to, and the
section as amended was agreed to.
On section 32-final dividend and' division of estate:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Sections 32 and 33 really make no change
except to better the phraseology of the
provisions of the Act.
Section 32 was agreed to.
Section 33 was agreed to.
On section 34-no action for dividend
unless improperly refused:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
section is in the same terms as the present
one, with the addition of the word "improperly" which appears in the second line.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: What is the idea
of the change? What does it mean? Does it
mean some misconduct on the part of the
trustee? Because, if the trustee refuses and
the creditor is put to the expense of obtaining an order of the court, he ought to pay,
and ought also to pay the interest.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is it not
only declaratory of the law?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: You are putting
the word "improperly" in. It should be as
it was.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then it
would read:
No action for a dividend shall lie against the
trustee, but if the trustee refuses to pay any
dividend the court may order him to pay it.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: You prohibit an
action against the trustee. You are throwing the onus on the creditor.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me that It is a proper rendering of
the liability which the trustee bas assumed.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not quite
un4lerstand why the section is there at
all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There seems
to be a contradiction in the clause. It says:

It can only be done on an action or a
petition, and that action or petition is prohibited or precluded by the first phrase.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No. Is not the
first phrase qualified by the following one?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I might put
it this way: if you have a proper action,
you can take it; if you succeed you are
justified in having taken it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The object is
ta prevent actions being brought against a
trustee, so that all these proceedings shall
be disposed of by the court without actions
being brought against the parties. I think
that is all right. But why is the word
"improperly" in there?
Does that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mean that no action shall lie against the
trustee personally?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Why cast the
onus of showing that the trustee has acted
improperly on the other party? Al it
should be necessary to show is that he has
simply refused to pay.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He might have r
fused properly.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOOT: Then he
could show that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There might be
circumstances which would justify the
trustee in delaying the payment. He
might receive a notice of a conflicting
claim. There might be one or two or three
or four parties claiming the same dividends,
and thàt would be a justification for delay.
That is always subject to the direction of
the court. For that reason, I think it is
quite proper to use the word "improperly."
It seems to me the Bill is quite all right ,in
that respect. I would suggest, however,
that possibly the section might be improved
so as to enable any one of the creditors to
apply to the court onspetition or otherwise
to have an order of that kind made.
They
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
have the right in the bankruptcy proceedings to make an application to the court.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know
that that follows. You simply say: "No
action for a dividend shall lie against the
trustee."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
that means that no action shall lie because it is not intended to be an action
against the trustee, but you may make the
application in the proceedings.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, I quite understand that, but this section does not
indîcate any proceeding in order to bring
the matter before the court.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: IV is by
way of application. The ruies make provision for that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not knew.
You are creating a right there; you are
not rnereiy indicating a remedy. That is
flot a matter for rules or regulations. It
is a substantive right that you are creating
by that provision. I think it would be betVer to say at whose instance or upon whose
action this substantive right could be set
Up.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But if the
trustee "improperly refuses refuses to pay"
a dividend, he can be sued.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But how will
the court be apprised of this matter? Perhaps he cannot be sued, but if he irnproperly refuses Vo pay any dividend, the court
*iay order hirn to pay it. The court will
not order him to pay it un]ess* by petition
or action the dernand has been made.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: No; by an application in the bankruptcy proceedings, not
by an independent action outside of the
bankruptcy proceedings, which is prohïbited.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then it means
that no action lies against the trustee personally because he does not pay a dividend;
but a petition rnay be made Vo Vhe court?
Is that what the clause means?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is why I
arn suggesting that there should be sorne
indication of a person or persons who rnay
exercise that right by petition.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
first place, the action is precluded because
it is miade by way of application in Vhe
proceedings. In the next place, this application ghouId not be made unless there is
evidence that the trus tee wîthholds improperly a dividend which is sought to be
paid. Is there anything wrong about that?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: What is meant by
"improperly"?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
for the court to decide that. This is simply
declaratory of what the la'w is. Unless the
trustee irnproperly withhoids the dividend,
the application should not be made.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: If be withholis
it bona fide.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You would have an
action against even if it were not provided for there. You could make an application to the Barkruptcy Court to make him
pay if he was withholding. It is flot; necessary to declare it in the Act at ail.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. This
is sirnply declaratory. I do not think it is
necessary myseif, because the court could
very well say that he improperly withholds it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But is not the
clause which is sought Vo be replaced betVer than the arnendnient?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I think so.
Hon. M'r. DANDURAND (reading):
No action for a divi.dend shall lie against the
trustee, but if the trustes refuses to pay any
divident the court may order hlm to pay It.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
section is precisely in the sanie terrns as
that of the present Acrt, except that we
have inserted the word "improperly."
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: What is the object of putting the word "irnproFperly" in?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
strike it out. It is acknowledýged on al]
sides that the dîvîdend must be hnproperiy
withheld. Consequently I ýsee no reason
why it should noV be there.
Hon. Mr. ýBELCOURT: 1 agree with
my honourable friend: I see no reason
why it should flot be there. But I think
the remedy ought Vo be entrusted Vo somebody. The clause ought to indicate in
what way, whetther 'by petition or otherwise, the reme-dy is to, be applied.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suggest that after the word " court," in the
third line of the subsection, we nilght insert the words, "on the application of any
interested person." Then it would read:
" The court, on the application of any
interested person, m.ay order hirn to pay
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, that is better.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not Vhink

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is ail right

MAY 20, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: Perhapa the old clause, like the ark of the
covenant, should noV have been touched.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: What is
the arnendment?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I niove
that the words, "On the application of any
interested party," be inseTted. Or, if the
opinion is that we had better leave out
those words, we will leave the subsection
as it was.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
s0.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My impression is that the honourable gentleman's
arnendment improves the clause. The
clause sitarts with the statemffnt, "No
action for a dividend shall lie against the
trustee." Se there seems Vo be no right
vested in anyone to move against the Vmus-tee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 0f
course, the whole Act presupposes the right
of the parties to set the court in motion.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 0f course, the
court miust really find ont, before it
makes an order Vo compel hlm to pay the
dividend, interest, etc., that he bias improperly refused to pay.
Hon. MT. DANDURAND: On representations made by sonie person.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: -I would dra-w attention to one thing: the -old clause contains the word 'interest," and in this new
clause the words "legal interest " are used.

that the proposed amendment to section 51
be struck out and be replaced by the f ollowing:

Hon. Mrt. PROUDFOOT: The idea is
to give a preference to, such indebtedniess,
is it?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What difference does that inake?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
object is to give a priority to payments,
due under Workmen's Compensation Acts.
When the Bill was in the House of Commons an amendment from the floor was
acoepted. The resuit was to produce a
cumbersonie section which requires amendment. The drafting of this is better than
that of the amendment that was inserted
in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: You attain

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The effeet of
this amendment is that if the debtor has
net paid C~e fees that he should pay to the
Workmen's Compensation Board of, say,
the province of Ontario, that would be a
preferential lien on the estate?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
it takes priority.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Why should
it? Why should it Ibe placed in a position
different from that of ordinary indebtedness?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 suppose it is on a parity with wages and other
compensations paid to working people.

MAY 20, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
ta correct errars in the French translation.
Instead of the amendment which -we have
in the Bill, we propose a new amendnient,
to read as follows:
55. Section eleven of the Fr ehl version of
the Act, as amended by sectionrsix and seven
of chapter thlrty-four of the Statutes Qf 1920,
je further amended by striking out the word
"meuloles'
wherever In silch section -as eo
amended such word occurs, and substituting ln
each case the wpord "réels".

The amendment of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed ta.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
ta add, as new section 56, the following:
56. Subsection eight of section four of the Act
la repealed and the following substL.tuted therefor:
(8) Where proceedings have been stayed or
have flot been prosecuted with -effect the Court
rnay, if 'by reason oyf the delay or for any other
cause 1V is deemed just so ta do, make a receiving order on the petition of another creditor,
and shall thereupon dismiss on such terme as It
may deen just the petitian in the stayed or
non-prosecuted proceedings.

The amendment of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed ta.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I pove
ta add new section 57 ta the Bill, this being
&one at the instance of the several provincial authorities:
57. Section eleven of the Act ls amendled by
adding as subsection seventeen the following:
(17) The law of the province ln whlch reai,
or imznovable, praperty is situate as ta registratlon and the effect of non-regtstration of documents affecting title ta or liens upon real, or
Immovable,

anything in this Act, apply in favour of purchasers for value without notice, to any lot of
real, or immrovable, property whieh bas flot been
identilled in manner required by subsection
eleven af this section 'within three months after

and in cases la which the foregoing provIsion
shall corne into operation the trustee's tltle ta or
Interest ln such lot shail be and be deemed

That gives recognition to the provincial
registration of real property after the
registration bas be6n omitted three months.
It gives a party three months ta fix up bis
titie, that is ta say, if he bas not completed
bis titie within three months the provincial
law becomes applicable.
the amendment of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed to.
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
ta add new section 58, es follows:
68. Subsection two of section thirty-four of
the Act la amended I>y Inserting between the
words "bankrupt" and '"tben" in tihe second Uine

the words "or has made an authorized asalgnmient," and by inserting .between -the wards
"bankruptcy" and "of" ln the fLfth Une the worgs
"or authorized assignment proceedings."

The abject is ta supply an omission in
section 34 of the main Act. By the Act as
it stands a banker who holds .funds of an
undischarged bankrupt is compelled ta, inform the trustee of the fact. The amendment compels the banker to inform the
trustee under an authorized assignment as
well.
The amendment af Han. Sir James
Laugheed was agreed ta.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
proposed ta add a new section, 59, ta the
Bill, -as follows:
59. Subsection three of section thtrty-six la
arnended by striking out of the fifth and sixth
uines thereof the words 'lassignment .for the
general benefit of creditars" and substituting the
words "authorized assignment."

That is the term used in the Act.
The amendment of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed ta.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
ta add new section 60 ta the Bill, in the
following words:
60. Section thirty-seven of the Act is amended by adding thereto as subsection ten the
following:
(10) Natwithstanding the declaration 0f a
final dividend tif any assets reserved for contingent dlaims, or assets subsequently received,
become available for the payment 0f a -further

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: What is the
meaning of that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
At

Secretary of State.
This transfers the
administration of the Act ta the Department af Justice, which, it seems ta me,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Certainly.
The amendment of Hon. Sir James

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I move that
the following be added as section 62 of
the Bill:
Section sixty-seven is amended by adddng

That is simply for the purpose of enabling the court to fix the fees under that
section. Those words were left out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
is quite satisfactory.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Proudfoot

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There was an
amendment which I gave you; how does
that stand?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It will come
in as section 5A of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: As I recoIlect,
you wanted to have a trader declared an
insolvent.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes, it comes in
in this way. The Cha.irman has the amendment.

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Hon. Mr.
Bostock moves that section 3 of the Act
be amended 'by adding thereto, as paragraph i:
Who being a trader, ceases to meet his liabilities generally as they become due.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That does not
seem to me to. be necessary. The mere
fact that he is not able to meet his
creditors' claims as they become due shows
that the man is bankrupt and I think it is
only stating really what the law is, and is
therefore not necessary.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The point is this:
it comes in clause 3 of the Act, the commencement of which reads:
A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in
each of the following cases.

As I understand the Act at the present
time, without that paragraph, if a trader
Hon. HEiWiTT BOSTOCK.

ceases to pay his liabilities as they become due, he does not commit an act of
bankruptcy, and you have to prove it in
the court. On the other hand, if you have
that paragraph in, then, if he ceases to
pay his liabilities as they become due, he
commits an act of bankruptey.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Surely you are
not going to declare a man a bankrupt
simply because he is not able to pay the
claims just as they come due? He may have
plenty of assets, yet may not be able to
meet the claims just at the time; but because he cannot meet them in that way
you declare him a bankrupt under the terms
of the Act and compel him, probably, to
make an assignment, or permit an order
to be made. It seems to me that is extending it too far.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That would stop
us all from renewing notes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: In every insolvent
Act there was a clause of that kind. Of
course, it is open to the debtor to prove
that his inability to meet his liabilities is
accidental, and that with a little time he
may be able to go on, but it is one of the
main signs of insolvency that a trader is
unable to meet his liabilities.
My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honourable friend uses the two terms synonymously. There is a distinction between
a man who is insolvent and a man who is
bankrupt. This is a compulsory Act. Because a man for the moment may not be
able to meet an obligation, that bare fact
should not make him a bankrupt. There is
a certain proceeding provided in this Act
by which he can be made a bankrupt, but
the mere fact of his not meeting an obligation at a particular time does not necessarily bring him within the Act.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Fifty per cent of
the traders to-day are bankrupt.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Possibly we may
have been wrong in the past, but I repeat
that in every Insolvency Act-in 1864, 1869,
1875-that provision was embodied in the
Act. A man is not deemed insolvent because he does not meet one or two liabilities; but if he fails to meet his liabilities
generally as they mature it has been taken
everywhere as being the main sign of insolvency. I fail to see what objection there
can be to it.
If a man were
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
brought before a judge on failing to meet
his liability the result would follow accord-

ing to the constitution and disposition of
the judge 'before whom the matter is
heard; and it seems to me it would be a
very cruel law that would say that because
a man was flot able' to meet a note when
it became due, and he asked for a renewal
of part, he would be declared a bankrupt.
That is the way the Act would operate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It would be
very much more drastic than the Winding* up Act.
* Hon. Mr. PRO UDFOOT: 'Jhere is
nothing to, prevent a creditor suing a debtor
for his dlaim, and getting a judgment;
and if the execution is not paid within a
certain number of days, then that is declared to be an act of bankruptcy. I do

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is sufficient.

ANIMAL CONTAGIOUS DISEASES
BILL
COieNSIDERED

IN COMMI'PTEE AND
REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
136, an Act to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act. Hon. Mr. Blain in
the Chair.
On sectiohi 1-operation of provision for
compensation for slaughtered animais, extended for three years:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the purpose of this Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The ohject of the Bill is simply to continue the
compensation provisions. The Act provides
compensation for animais destroyed on account of a contagious disease, and this
simply continues the coperation of te statute for three years. That is to say, the
Act when passed was to remain in operation for three years fromn the 24th of May,
1918, and the present measure simply renews its operation for three years longer.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There is no alteration made in the amount that will be paid
for those animals, or anything like that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. As
you will sec, the Bill simply provides for
a bare extension of time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the Government publishied an annual statement of
the operations of this Act and the amount
yearly expended under this head?
Hon. Sir J.AMES LOUGHEED: I presume the report of the Department of
Agriculture would give that information,
but I cannot state, even approximately,
what has been the amount spent. If n'y

I should be very glad to obtain the information for hlm.

MAY 21, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
Iooked up the statement made by the Minister of Justice, who is in charge of this
Bill. This provision is being enacted at
the instance of the Government of Nova
Scotia. It is for -the purpose of assim.ilating the législa.tion that we have un the
statute book to the provincial enactmnents.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Referring*
again to section 1. Does the Act as framed
allow a boy .below the age of 18 to be
sentenced to or received into one of these
reformatories; or does the age limit debar
the reforrnatory from retaining the cuiprit
after hie bas completed his lSth year?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As I
understand the present Act, any youth
above the age of 16 cannot be sentenced to
one of these reformatories. It is the intention now to increase the age limit to
18. There are many cases, I suppose the
majority, in which it is desirable that
youths under 18 should flot be sent to
penitentiaries, but rather that they should
corne under thé more salutary influences
of a reformatory.
They should not be
called upon by the law to mix with more
mature criminals.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But if a boy
in his l8th year is sentenced to three years
imprisonment, he would remain in the reforrnatory until he was past 20.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Certainly; but the
same thing %çould apply if he were sent
to the penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I want to
know to what"the age limit applies? Does
it apply to the age when he is sentenced
or to the age above which the reformatory
will not be able to retain hirn?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEP: To the
date of the sentence.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The point raised by
the honourable gentleman from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Power), namely, the objection
to boys bet'ween, 18 and 21 being placed
where they would have an influence on boys
of 10 or 11, is a good one; but I think the
Act is so constructed that this change in
the age limit will not corne into force until
the Government of Nova Scotia provides
for the segregation of the older boys from
the younger ones.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is there any obligation on the part of the Dominion Government to see that the ségrégation is properly carried out before this proviAion goes
into effect? Who is responsible for it?

541

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As the
institution is a provincial one, I presume
the province will comply with the requirements of the Act, and will ask that it be
brought into operation. The Federal Government will of course accept the representation of the province that the Act
should be brought into force.

DOMINION LANDS BILL
SEDCOND

READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOT3GHEED moved
the second reading of Bill X4, an Act to
amend the Dominion Lands Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
very short Bill. It is for the purpose of
overconing a conflict wlhich lias arhisen
between the Administration and the Auditor General as to, the interpretation of the
siatutes. It was contended by the Auditor
General, under the former legislation, that
some 200 odd employees appointed by the
Minister to the Outside Service, and who
are in the Departments at Ottawa, were
precluded from receiving their salaries
under the Civil Service Act. This is simply
to, place a construction on the Act by which
payments may be made to the officers or
employees. The impression heretofore was
that one might be appointed to the Outside
Service and stili be employed in Ottawa;
but apparently the Civil Service Act has
been differently interpireted.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I arn not quite
clear whether this Bill 'brings the officials
under the Civil Service Act or not. Are
they transferred from the Outside to the
Inside Service by this Bill? Do they corne
under the Civil Service Commission?
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is a provision now by which all outside servants who are recommended can be 'blanketted into the Inside Civil Service. This
would permit of that blanketting, as it is
called, bjeing done.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill Y4, an Act to
amend the Northwest Territories Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the unorganized portions of the Northwest Territories are adminstered by a Commissioner.
The present Commissioner is the. Deputy
Minister of the Interior, Mr. Cory. Owing
to the opening up of the Mackenzie river
district, which was brought about by the
discovery of oil, it is desirable that the administration of thalt enormous tract of
country should be further strengthened by
the appointment of additional members. It
is therefore proposed that the Administration shall be increased; and subsection 2
of section 1 of the Bill provides what the
offices shall be to which the officers shall
be appointed. It is simply a formal matter.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I understand from
this Act that the Council heretofore has
consisted of four members; the Deputy
Minister of the Interior in Ottawa being
the Commissioner, and the other three members being in the Northwest.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. My
recollection is that they are all officers of
the Department of the Interior.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. It
consists of that portion of the Northwest
lying north of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That the Senate do now adjourn until Monday,

MOST FAVOURED

NATION CLAUSE

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN inquired of the
Government:
1. What compensation in tariff concessions
bas Canada obtained from each country benefiting by the extension to it by Canada of the
Most Favoured Nation Clause.
2. State for each country what these concessions are, what other nations benefit by the
same, and to what extent.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
following is a revised list of countries accorded most-favoured-nation treatment in
tariff matters by Canada: Argentine Republic, Colombia, Denmark, France, Japan,
Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Venezuela.
Argentine Republie: The tariff of Argentina contains only one schedule of
duties. This schedule is called the minimum tariff. The rates of duty thus provided are applicable te Canada, and apparently to all countries, for Argentina is
said to have a common tariff for the world.
The Argentine law, nevertheless, provides
for an increase of 50 per cent in the duties
and a levy of 15 per cent on free goods in
the case of imports from countries which
"exceptionally reduce" their tariffs to
countries other than Argentina. There is
no information that these surtaxes have
been made operative against any country.

MAY 23, 1921
Colombia: Colorhbia has oniy one schedule of customs duties. There is no provision in the -Colombian tariff for discrimi4ating duties. If any tariff concession
were made to a third country, by treaty or
otherwise, Canada would be entitled to the
same terms reciprocally and unconditionally.
Denmark: The Denmark tariff consists
of a single schedule of duties, which applies
to Canada and other countries alike. Provision is made for levying a surtax of 40
per cent of the duties on dutiable goods and
10 per cent ad valorem on free goods in the
case of imports from countries which discriminate against Danish goods. It is
understood that these surtaxes have not
been brought into effect against any country. -The most-favourcd-nation treaty with
the United Kingdom, which is applicable
to Canada, provides most-favoured-nation
treatment with respect to ail third countries except Sweden.
France: The most-favoured-nation clause
is extended by Canada only in consequence
of the Franco-Canadian Trade Agreement
of 1921. The compensation obtained by
Canada in that case was the French minimum tariff with a few modifications as
was provided for in the Franco-Canadian
treaty of 1907-09. In view if the fact that
France extends its minimum tariff in its
entirety to many countries and in part to
many others, it does flot appear that any
third nations would benefit by the concessions miade to Canada in the new treaty.
Japan: By vîrtue of the most-favourednation clause, Canada enjoys conventional
rates of duty on several items of the Japanese tariff. Usually the conventional rates
are one-quarter, one-third, or one-half iower
than the rates under the general tariff.
The conventional tariff of Japan applied
to the following pre-war iist of countries.
Argentina, Austria-Hungary (since denounced), Belgium, Brazîl, Chule, Colombia,
Denmark including colonies, France, German Empire including the Grand Duchy
of Luxemburg and the Austrian communes
of Jungholz and Mittleberg <since denounced), Greece, Italy, Mexico, The
Netherlands, including colonies, Norway,
Peru, Russia, Siain, Spain including the
Balearic and Canary Islands, Sweden,
Switzeriand, the -United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland including India and
Canada, the United States of America
including outlying possessions.
Norway: (1) Norway has two schedules
of duties, 'a minimum and a maximum.
The minimum tariff is applicable' to in-

ports fromn Canada.
The minimum is,
usually between 20 and 40 per cent lower
than the maximum. The maximum is applicable to any country not; having a treaty
with Norway and where Norwegian goods
are less favourably treated than goods of
any other country.
(2) The Norwegian
tariff does not show the countries which
have become entitled to the minimum rates
of duty.
Russia: The pre-w.ar tariff of Russia for
the European trade was that authorizcd
unuder I-mperial Decree of 1906. In 1915
the rates of duty were increased by another decree. The tariff thus aitered was
intended to be a temporary measure
pending a completerevision at the end of
the war. Owing to the internai troubles
in Russia, the tariff in 1919 underwent
independent modifications for different
sections of the country. 'There was, for
example, a different tarif! in North Russia,
in South Russia, and in the republic of
Georgia. AIl these tariffs, however, were
bascd on the tariff of 1906. The 1906 tariff
contains a general and a conventional
schedule of duties. Canada enjoys ail the
benefits of the conventional tariff.
The
concessions under the conventional tariff
came into existence through treaties between Russia and various other countries.
Under the 1915 tariff revision, these conventional rates were wiithdrawn f rom Germany and Austria-Hungary, and in 1917
notice was given of termination of the
mos't-favoured-nation treaties with Japan,
Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
The concessions to France, Itaiy and
Portugal were continued and no doubt
most-favoured-nation treatment applies
also to other countries, as well as to Canada and the United Kingdom.
The Russian generai tariff aiso discriminates
against imports over the European land
frontier on certain ciases of goods as coinpared with, imports by ses. The former
rates are 20 per cent higher.
Spain: Spain has a maximum and a
minimum tariff, a third dr conventionai
tariff originating from various treaties,
and also a fourth tariff giving special concessions to Portugal. The maximum tarif!
applies to countries not enumerated in one
of the privileged groups. The minimum
tariff appiies to Colombia and Ecuador.
The conventional tarif! has some rates
iower than the minimum.
The
mostfavoured nations, which. include Canada,
are entitled to the conventional or the
minimum tariff, giving them ail thea customs benefits extended 'to any country

Sweden: Sweden has accorded conventional rates of duty to certain countries
and these are also applicable to Canada.
There is only one schedule of rates in the
Swedish tariff. The effect of the treaties
seems to have been the lowering of the
ordinary tariff on certain items. The advantage, if any, of the favoured-nation
clause to Canada is not specified in the
tariff.
Switzerland: (1) The Swiss tariff is based
to a large extent on treaties. The conventional rates thus granted are applicable
tc Canada. The Federal Council of Switzerland is empowered to increase the general tariff against countries treating
Swiss goods less favourably than goods of
other countries. (2) Commercial treaties
providing for -conventional rates of duty
were principally with Germany, AustriaHungary, France, Italy, Spain and Serbia.
No doubt most-favoured-nation treatment
is also extended to other countries.

European countries have given notice of
termination of commercial treaties with
a view to revising tariffs, which may, in
sume instances, modify the relations
among some of the countries in the above
list.

HOUSE
0F C0MMONS8 MODIFIED
AMEN'DMENT iSUJGGESTED

The Senate proceeded to, consider the
message from, the House of Gommons disagreeing to thc second and third amendments made by the Senate to Bill 604 an
Act to, amend the Judges Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEIY: Honourable gentlemen, I am rather at a loss to
know exactly what course to pursue in regard to the amendments which have been
made by this Chamber to the Bill in question. As the House was very ]argely in
favour of the amendmnents which have been
carried and as there did not seem to be
a disposition on the part of the House to
comply with the message from the House
of Gommons, but, on the contrary, to-insist
upon the amendments which were made by
this House, I took the li'berty of anticipating what I might term a conference.
It seemed to me that it was desirable to
get the promotor of the Bill in the House
of Gommons, who was the Minister of Justice, to meet several legal gentlemen of
this Chamber who were active, and very
pToperly so, according to, the opinions
which they entertained, in regard to the
amendments which were carried by this
Chamber. We therefore had a conference
of ail parties interested with a view to
apý)rox1fnating as closely as possible to
sonie common consent as to, the amendments which should be made, because I
assumed it would be difficult to escape
making some amendment to, the Bull. The
result was that a modified amendment« was
suggested at tl'at informa] conference. I
cannot at the moment say wýhether the
other Chamber will be prepared to accept
that modified amendment, -which would repS-35

resent, I fancy, the minimum of the sympathy or of the opinion or of the iudgment of those who favour the amendments
passed by this House. The message that
has come froin the Gommons will have to
be dealt with, I presume, in thfs way:
by iy moving that the Senate doth not insist on the second and third amendments.
I take the liberty of mov!ng that motion.,
seconded by the honourable Minister of
LaJbour (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and thit
will open up the question that I have already alluded to, of the informai conference that took place.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: I do not think the
House is 'quito seized of the amendments
that my honourable friend lFas moved that
we should nat insist upon.

Commissioner or Arbitrator on any CommisSion or Enquiry. P'rovided that this section
shall not interfere with judges who are at present acting as Commissioners or Ar4 bî,trato>rs
completing the work on w}iich they are engaged.

That meant that neither the Federal
nor the Provincial authorities shouId have
the power to appoint a judge to act as a
Gommissioner or Arbitrator.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: If my honourable
friend moves that we do not insist on those
amendments, I arn unable to see at the
present moment how we are going to put
in any other amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend will be good enough to,
wait, he wilI see what is about to be done.
Hon. Mr. LYNGH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, I desire to, move in
amendment, seconded by Hon. Mr. Fowler:
That the Senate doth not InsLst upon their
second and third amnendinents to the said Bill,
to which the House of Commons have disagreed,
but substitute the fohlowing amnendments In
lieu thereof:
The Judges Act, Chapter 138 of the Revlaed
Statutes, 11,06, Is hereby aimended by adding
thereto the followlng sections:
4. Subsection 2 of section 3 of the Judges Act,
chapter 138 of the Revised Statutes, 1906, as
the said subsection is enacted by section 12 of
chapter 56 of the statutes o4f 1920, la hereby
repealed and the followiflg siiistituted:

RSISUED XDITIOM.

SENATE
35. Unless nominated by the Governor in
Council, no judge mentioned in this Act shall
act as commissioner or arbi'trator on any commission or enquiry. Provided that this section
shall not interfere with judges who are at present acting as commissioners or arbitrators completing the work on which they are engaged.

This proposed amendment will allow the
Governor General in Council to engage
judges as arbitrators on commissions of
enqUry.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is what we
do not want.
And
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
there is nothing said about the Provincial
Legislatures, because it was stated-and
it is appreciated by those who are in favour
of this Bill-that it is not perhaps proper
for the Parliament of Canada to pass any
Act directly naming a local legislature;
for, it is conceded, we have no power to
direct legislation against the local legislatures. Therefore, if the House of Commons accept this amendment, the Act will
allow the Governor in Council to employ
judges on these conmissions, but will prevent the judges from acting on any other
commissions than those of the Dominion

Government.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: If I understand the
amendment correctly, the Provincial Governménts would not 'be allowed to appoint
judges as commissioners.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: This
amendment does not directly refer to Provincial Governments at all.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: And then?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Let the
law, whatever it is, take its course. It is
conceded to be improper for the Parliament
of Canada to enact legislation which would
prohibit the Provincial Governments.
Hon. L. G. POWER : Honourable gentlemen, I am not very profoundly interested-certainly I am not personally interested-in this measure, and generally I am
in favour of allowing things to go as they
are, unless they are going badly; but in
the present instance I think that it is the
duty of the Senate to assert itself.
The parliamentary rule, which has
always been adhered to, is that where the
Commons decline to accept a Senate amendment, then the Gommons send to the Senate their reasons for not accepting the
amendment. And, when you come ,to think
of it, honourable gentlemen, we are supposed to be two bodies of men who are
governed by reason, and there should
always be a reason given for any action
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

which is in the slightest degree out of the
ordinary. While I am not a great advocate of the dignity of the Senate, I feel
that there are cases, and this is one, in
which it is really our duty, a duty that
we owe to the House, to insist that, if the
Gommons do not agree to our amendments,
they shall at least signify their non-concurrence in a proper and respectful way.
So I feel, honourable gentlemen, that in
undertaking to pass the amendment moved
by the honourable Senator from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) we are doing
the right thing by the House.
Again, with respect to this question of
commissions, our judges in this country
are paid, not quite as liberally as the judges
in England are, but more liberally, as a
rule, than the judges in the United States;
and it is not very long since Parliament
made a considerable increase in the sums
paid to the judges of the higher courts. I
feel, honourable gentlemen, that if you
have a body of men like our judges, occupying responsible anß important positions,
and very often called upon to discharge
very important functions, the salary which
they get should be, and I think under
present conditions is, sufficient to pay for
all their time. I think that if a judge
gets $6,000 or $8,000, and if, having leasure, he is called upon to devote part of
it to the public service, that is no reason
why he should be paid anything beyond his
necessary travelling and living expenses.
Hon. Mr BOSTOCK: In view of the
fact that many honourable members have
not seen this amendment, I would ask the
honourable leader to allow this matter to
stand until to-morrow, so that we may
give it better consideration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To-mprrow is
a holiday. Could we not defer the matter
till Wednesday?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
we had better say to-morrow, because the
Session is drawing to a close, and in any
event this will necessitate a conference
between the two Houses. Of course, if we
cannot proceed with it to-anorrow in such
a way as to serve the public interest best
we will further postpone it.
The Order stands.

MAY 23, 1921
OPIUM AND NARCQTIC DRUG
BILL
MOTION

FOR

CONSIDERATION
miE

IN

CIOM-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
that the Senate go into Comnmittee on Bill
81, an Act to amexd the Opium and Natcotic Drug Act.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Honourable gentlinen, before the Senate goes into Committee of the whole, which I suppose ineans
the adoption of the principle of the Bill,
though I ar n ft opposed to the principle,
I wish to give notice thst I intend to -move
an amendment te one of its clauses. The
measure fol-lows generally the line of some
very drastie legisflation which has been
brought into force origin-ally, I think, because of the enactmnent orf various prohibition laws in the different provinces. It
changes the old principle of legisiation, in
so far as I, who arn not a lawyer, amn acqunînted with it. Formerly it was generally understood that a man wes innocent
uxltil hie was proven guilty; but, according to this legisiation, the 'nccused. is considered guilty until 'he has proven himself
innocent. That is an entire reversai of the
ordinnry principle of criminal.legislation,
sO far as I have understood it.
,However, I arn not going to speak of
that. Soine of the methods for carrying
this lnw into force are extremely drastic,
and it is agaliist one of them that I intend.
to niove an arnen.dment. The Act gives
constables and pence officers very enorIt -allows a
mous and unusuni puwers.
constable or a peace officer to enter forcibly any building of any kind, even the
dwelling-house of any individual in thecountry, at any timie, by day or by night, without a warrant-without anything at al
except the mere idea of the constable himself. I hold, honourable geéntlemen, that
nny mensure authorizing any constable to
enter, forcibly or otherwise, a man's home
at any time, by night or by day, is legislation that this Parliament should not pass.
The principle, to my mind, is a very bnd
one indeed. We cannot tell whether the
pearce officer who 'is authorized to eniter
hais any cause for suspicion or not. Apart
from. thnt, 'I migh't rernind honourable
gentlemen that, in these dnys of highway
robberies and burglaries and banditti, it
would give an opportubity to un eviliy-,
disposed person to go to a hj>use *n the
middle of the night, wake up the occupants,
force bis way in and say: " I arn an officer
of the law; I have corne to examine this

547

bouse to see if I can find any paregorie or
morphine or cocaine."' Then hie may walk
in and go through the bouse. I object to
that, and, in. order to test the feeling of
this Chamber with regard to it, I intend
when we go into Cornrittee of the Whole
to rnbve an amendrnent to seètid5n 7 to
the follewing effect:
That section 7 be amnended by striking out
the word "dwefling-house" in Uine 3 of the sald
section, and by adding the words, "and such
constable or peace officer may enter any dwellIng-house or procuring a search-warrant from
a magistrate havlng Jurisdiction in the matter."

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
wihll become of the druga in the meantirne?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I presume they wMl
be there -still, if they have been there
at ail. You do not allow in nny other
circunistances the entering of a private
dwelling-house et nny time, night or day,
without a search-warrant. There is na
dearth of magistrates in this country, if
what I hear is correct. Down our wny
there are large numbers of them. They
are always available. Why should not a
constable be compeh¶ed to go and make
his sworn statement before a magistrate
and get a warrant? If hie has to go at
night to break into a bouse for the purpose of searching it, hie has plenty of tirne
Vo ýgo to a magistrate and swenr out such
information as rnay be ýrequired in order
that 'he may ebtain a searoh-warrant. I
therefore give notice that in Cornmittee
of the Whole I will move that amendment.
OON'SIDERED

IN COMMrTEE--PROGRESe
REPORTED

The motion was ngreed to, and the House
went into Cornmittee on the Blill. Hon. Mr.Blaîn in the Chair.
On section 1, paragraph a-prescriptions
not to be filled more titan once:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would rny honour-,
able friend, tell us what the change is?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Certain words are stricken out of the section which is at present in the Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is that the original
Act of 1907?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
as amended by the Act of 1920.
We strike out of subsection 1 of section
5 the words, "without. the authority of. a
prescribing physician, veterinary surgeon
or dentist," in the 9th and lOth line thereof.
This amendment bas been found neeeaary

548

SENATE

because of the great abuse that exists in the
refilling of narcotie prescriptions, in most
cases for drug habitues, on an understanding arrived at between the druggist and the
physician. By the Harrison law in the
United States and by the law of Great
Britain, the refilling of all narcotit prescriptions is prohibited under any circumstances. This is simply bringing our law
into line with that of Great Britain and
that of the United States.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The effect of it is
to prevent a prescription being filled a
second time?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is going to
work a hardship on people of slender means.
To get a prescription they will have to go
to a doctor each time. I think the hardship
it will work will be greater than the evil
that would otherwise result.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: You have not
seen the effects of it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is all very well
for the doctors: they issue the prescriptions.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: How far-reaching would that be? A doctor might issue
a prescription that would contain one onethousandth part of one of these drugs.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
object is to prevent the refilling of a prescription for an opiate.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Is it just purely
an opiate? Must it be confined to the
individual drug, or would it include prescriptions that contain one-thousandth part
of the drug?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: In many harmless
prescriptions there is some opium or kindred drug. I think this is bad legislation.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: • Why not state the
percentage that may be allowed?
Paragraph a was agreed to.
On paragraph b of section 1-physician
not to prescribe drugs, etc., except for
medicinal purposes:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:' Mr.
Chairman, I am going to ask the Committee
to rise and report progress. Legislation
of this kind is sent down te this House entirely without any explanation and without
anyone to represent it. It seems to be taken
for granted by those having charge of the
legislation that this Chamber inherently
and intuitively should know what is desired.
Unless we can get proper information, I do
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

not feel that there is any justification for
asking the House to consider such legislation.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I just at
this moment remind my honourable friend
of a subject which I perennially bring up
in the Senate, generally at the close of the
Session? My honourable friend has on
several occasions very kindly promised to
take up my suggestion that the Bills should
be printed in parallel columns, one showing
the part of the Act that it is sought to
amend, and the other the amendments proposed. I know my honourable friend has
done a great deal, and I had hoped that this
Session he would be able to tell us that he
had succeeded in obtaining that very desirable and very much needed alteration in
the method of printing our Bills. I wonder
if he is in a position te tell us that the
matter has progressed te some extent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No one
would appreciate a practice of that kind
more than I would. Inasmuch as my bonourable friend has made this proposal on
many occasions, I would suggest that he
go further and take the necessary steps
to iake it a rule of this House. There is
no reason why that should not be done. I
have suggested from time to time that some
change be made in the method of printing
the Bills, but apparently my efforts have
been abortive. Therefore I would suggest
that my honourable friend take the matter
in hand, and see that the House, either by
rule or otherwise, should insist upon a
change being made. I would be prepared
to support him very warmly.
Han. Mr. BELCOURT: It would have
to be brought up as a substantive matter,
I imagine. If my honourable friend gives
me his kind co-operation, I shall be glad to
proceed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I see
no reason why this Chamber should not
adopt a rule stating in what form Bills
should be presented to this House.
Progress was reported.
DOMINION LANDS BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMýITTEE
REPORTED

AND

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
X4, an Act to amend the Dominion Lands
Act. Han. Mr. Michener in the Chair.

MAY 23, 1921
On section 1--confirmation of appointments, etc.:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -As I
explained to the House the other day, this
is simply to overcome an inter.pretation of
the statute by .which a great number of
public servants would be prevented from
receiving their salaries.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I beg
to move that the following be added as
section 2:
Ail the officers so appointed shall be deemed
to be permanent or temporary officers of the
Civil Service, according to the nature and lntent of the appointment ln each case.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do I understand
that these officers are now under the Civil
Service Commission?
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,
they are not, because they have been appointed to the Outs.ide Service. Two hundred and some odd of tliese servants have
been appointed under the Dominion Lands
Act, and are now stationed in 4)ttawa. It
is contended that according to the Civil
Service Act they cannot biý locatecl at
Ottawa and draw their salaries.
Hon.. Mr. FOWLER: Are you putting
them under the Civil Service Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
They would come under the Civil Service
Act anyway. They would be blanketed
under the Civil Service Act by reason of
certain Orders in Council which lately have
been passed, and by which the Outaide
Service is being absorbed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I thought we were
changing ail that, and getting back to first
principles again.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is a Bill before the Gommons which possibly wîll corne down .here. It would not
affect this case. These are men who have
been in the employ of the Government
since 1908.
Hon. Mr. ýFOWLER: Why do you put
them in and take others out? Why do you
not leave them out when they are safely
out?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
have always been regarded as part and
parcel of the Civil Service; but, owing to
a conflict of interpretation between the two
statutes, the Civil Service Act and the
Dominion Lands Act, they have been regarded as outside men stationed in Ottawa

541

and flot entitled to any sa]ary whatsoever.
That is one of those mysterious things
that will happen under Acts of this kind.
The amendment of Hlon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed to.
The preamble and the titie were agreed
to.
The Bill as amended was reported.
NORTHWEST TERRITORTES BILL
CONSIDERED [N COMMIT12EZ AND
RElPORTED

On !motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
Y4, an Act to amend the Northwest Territories Act. Hon. Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
On section 1-Council increased to six
members; 'Deputy ,Commissiozier may be
appointed:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend-told us the other day, on the second
reading, that this Council is located in
Ottawa. Ail these regulations, I suppose,
are promulgated in Ottiqwa?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGH.EED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can hie teli «us
what officers are on the ground, and at
what points in the Northwest Territories,
to administer these regulations?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I could
net enumerate them ail, but, for instance,
special staffs are being sent out to -the
Mackenzie River district while attention
is being given to the development of the
oul fields there. But this Bill bas only to
do with regulations ànd with the passing
of ordinances. It does not deal with the
administration on the ground, so to speak.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But I imagine
that the Commissioner and this Council
practically direct the policy of the administration of those Territories.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:ý Yes,
the regulations will be promulgated by
them. They will re]y probably upon the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police to carry
out many of the regulatý,ons; otherregulations will be administered by officers specially designated by the Department of the
Interior, who may be engaged in carrying
on special departmental work in the.unorganized territories.
Hon. Mr.. DANDURAND: Whère is the
seat of that administration?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Ottawa.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see by section 5 that the seat "shall be fixed and may
from time to time be changed by the Gov-ernor in Council."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
fixed by Order in Council. The time will
probably come when, population having
gone in to the unorganized territories, it
will be necessary to have even some kind
of representative council; but up to the
present time no undertaking has been carried on to any extent in the unorganized
sections of the Territories.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Commissioner?

Who is the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:, The
Deputy Minister of the Interior, Mr. Cory.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I understand that
at present in all that. Territory there is
practically no settlement of any kind, outside probably this one that is now being
built up at Fort Norman.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The purpose of
this legislation is probably to deal with
that situation as it arises?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta
were carved out of the Northwest Territories. Ever since the Territories were
erected there bas been a Commissioner, who
has been stationed in Ottawa. The first
Commissioner, I think, was the late Mr.
Fred White, who was Comptroller of the
Northwest Mounted Police. Upon his decease Mr. Cory was appointed as Commissioner. The Commissioner bas authority to
pass ordinances with all the force and effect of law. Of course, he is assisted by
the Council, as indicated by the Bill. Force
will be given to those ordinances just the
same as to any other laws of the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would my honourable friend care to say what steps have
been taken for the purpose of protecting
the situation at Fort Norman by preventing
persons from going in there unless they
are properly equipped to take care of themselves? I understand that in that territory
there is practically nothing raised; that
there are no provisions except what people
themselves take in, and there is great
danger that if a large number of people
are allowed to go in there, when the winter
comes on, the Government may find a great
many persons on their hands and may have
great difficulty in taking care of them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

For
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
some months past, in fact since it became
evident that there would be a con siderable
influx of people into the Mackenzie river
district, the Mounted Police have been spe'cially charged to make inquiry into every
case. They are sufficiently organized and
distributed, I understand, to make not
merely a general inquiry, but a particular
one, as to aIl persons coming in. The in
structions of the police are not to permit
any persons to go into that far north
country unless they have sufficient means
to carry them through*a reasonable time.
So the Government is fully alive to the
necessities which my honourable friend has
pointed out, and I have no doubt that that
inquiry is being rigidly prosecuted.
Section 1 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
THIRD READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.
THE DRAFTING OF BILLS
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, with the permission of the House I
will now read the motion moved by myself
and seconded by Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton:
That a Committee composed of Honourable
Messieurs Lynch-Staunton, Willoughby, Ross
(fMiddleton), Proudfoot, and the mover, be appointed to submit to the Senate an amendment
to the rules of this House so as to provide that
all Bills subrmitted to this House shall contain
in full the section or sections of Acts which
it is proposed to repeal or amend.
The motion was agreed to.

LAKE OF THE WOODS BILL
FIRST READING

Bill A6, an Act respecting the Lake of
the Woods and other waters.-Hon. Sir
James Lougheed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable friend give us an explanation as to
what that Bill means?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
do so on the second reading to-morrow.
VICTORIA DAY SITTING
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
that the Senate adjourn until to-morrow at
11 a.m.

MAY 23, 1921
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would like to
know if the pressure of public business is
so very great that it is necessary for the
Senate to sit upon a public holiday such as
the 24th of May. The House of Commons,
which is supposed to be the busy part of
this Parliament, is observing the day. The
24th of 1Vay is a, very important holiday:
it is a day that is hèld in commemoration
of the great Queen Victoria, and it seems
to me that we as loyal subjects are paying
very little respect to the memory of that
illustrious woman and queen when we sit
on that day. Of course, if the pressure of
public business is such that it is absolutely
necessary to sit, my objections would disappear; but if it is not absolutely necessary, it does seem to me that it is, to say
the least, a very improper thing for us to
sit on that particular day.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say, honourable gentlemen, that the pressure of public business is thought to be sufficiently great to warrant our sitting tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend does not disclose all his thought.
I know that his mind is set on the necessity
of the Divorce Committee meeting to-morrow morning.
The motion was agreed t.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow

THE DRAFTING OF BIL4S.
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT, from the Special
Comittee on the method of printing
Senate Bilés, preseinted its firet report, as
fol'laws:
Your Comrittee recommends that ail Bills
which propose to amend or repeal any existing
sta,tute shall, when first printed, have in
parallel columne the sections of the Act proposed to be repealed or amended, and the sections as it lu proposed to amend then, showi-rrg in brackets the words to be deleted in the
existing Act, and showing in brackets the words
to be added by said amendment.

He moved concurrence in the said report.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, may I suggest what prssents itsef to my mind as an omission
from the report. I had not the oppodbanity
of seeing or hearing the report until I
heard it read at the Table. It seems ta me
that there should have been a recommendation that the Committee take up this matter
with the House of Commono, because that
House must be apprised of it in some way.
Unless they adopt a practice similar to
that which we propose ta adopt in this
Chamiber, it is manifest that when Bills
come from the Commons there will arise a
difficulty as to having them printed in accordance with our rules. It is undesirable
that there shou'ld' be two printings of the
same Bill. My own opinion is that this
matter should be taken up with the Commons. I belleve the recommendation is t
be made a rule of this House. We should
prosecute the matter further and, if possible, induce the Commons to adopt the
same practice. They would probably agree
to do so, because it would be equally convenient for them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could we not
add an instruction to His Honour the
Speaker to transmit this resolution of the
Senate to the House of Commons for their
information? We state what is our desire
and-our intention, and, as it is a rule which
will certainly be welcomed in the House of
Gommons, they are very likely to pass a
similar resolution.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, that matter was discussed by the
Committee. I thiink there was a feeling tihat
this resolution should be adopted by this
House whether it is also adopted by the
House of Commons or not. If it is adopted
and put into practice by the House of Commons as well as by ourselves, so much the
better; we shall be all the better pleased;
but there is ip the Committee a strong
feeling that, whether the House of Commons adopts ths resdlution or not, we
should adopt it, The idea was that we
houild report accardingly, recommnerding
tihe adoption cf the resolution by this House,
and then, by some subsequent resolution or
recomendation, have it submitted to the
House of Cormnons. We did not wish to
jeopardize the falte of this amnendment by
tying up witlh it any recomunendation to the
House of Commons. We felt that we should
aet independently for the tine being, but
that when the proposai is ladopted as a rule
of this House we might, ask the co-operttien of the House of Comimons.

552

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
make another suggestion while the matter
is under consideration? That is, ypome provision should be made in the report for a
suspension of the irule where there is a
complete consolidation or revision of a very
lengthy statute. If we make the proposal
a rule of the House, the difficulty will be to
suspend the rule. A rule cannot be suspended except by a somewhat elaborate
process. I am not prepared to criticise the
report except to say that, unless some provision is made of the character which I
suggest, the rule would in some cases be
impracticable.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend understand that all that the
committee recommends is that only the
section to be amended, and not the Act itself, be printed?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
might explain that it is only a resolution
and not a rule that we are bringing in.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is merely a
recommendation. We cannot make a rule.
It is a recommendation to the House that
the resolution which has been read be
adopted. What I desire to point out to
my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) is this: he seems to be under
the impression that the whole statute a
portion of which is to be amended is goilng
to be printed, but that is not the case.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
What I have reference to is this. My honourable friend will recall that on many occasions it is thought desirable, instead of
amending a statute, to consolidate the
statute. Hence, if we made say a dozen
amendments, this rule would necessitate in
regard to some very immaterial amendments, the printing of very lengthy sections in the existing statute and also the
printing of the sections as proposed to be
revised. However, if this is simply a resolution of the House and not one of the
standing rules, we can easily obviate that
difficulty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course,
a standing rule can be altered only by the
,Senate being specially convened in Committee for the purpose.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
what I thought it was.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As pointed out
by the honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), it is not

they will take the opportunity of acting

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
good food regulation.
It would be
. Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
a fairly good food regulation, but, on the
other hand, I think we should be logical.
The reason which was alleged by the representatives of the labour element in this
country through the honourable the Minister of Labour has disappeared. He told
us very candidly that his objection had no
longer any raison d'être, since the judges,
baving been debarred from the right to
receive an extra fee for acting as members
of Boards of Conciliation, have positively
refused to act on those arbitrations. Consequently that objection, the only one that
was raised, bas fallen to the ground, and
the way would now seem to be clear for
àffirming the principle generally. Now, instead of doing that, we are proceeding to
cut away from the Provincial Governments
the right to appoint judges on commissions,
but we reserve that right to the Federal
authorities. I .say this is bad legislation,
because any argument that can be set up
against the provincial governments, as
applying to judges on those commissions,
should, to my mind, and will, I think, in the
minds of the majority of this Chamber, be
set up against the employment of judges
on federal commissions. It seems to me
that it is belittling the authority of our
Provincial Governments to say that ,they
shall not be able to use their own judgment
with regard to calling upon a judge to preside over a commission, whereas the Federal authorities may exercise that discretion. I think that the Governments of this
country are on an equal'footing, and the
principle that you now apply to the Provincial Governments should be applied as
well to the Federal Government. I have
yet to hear of any reason why a distinction should be made. If one is made which
appeals to my judgment, I shall alter my
opinion, but so far I see no reason why
we should make that distinction.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to say
to the honourable gentleman that I think
there is a distinction. Of course, I am not
going back upon the general principle for
which I have contended for some years in
this House, namely, that none of the Governments should have the right to appoint
judges to Commissions; but there is a vast
distinction between the position of the Provincial Governnents, and that of the Dominion Government, because the constitution of the provincial courts, in both civil
and criminal matters, is entirely in the
hands of the Provincial Governments. The
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Provincial Govenments, instead of appointing a judge as a conmissioner, can
assign any dispute they desire to a courtto the Supreme Court or to a County Court
-and say that the matter shall be heard
and determined there. Then, what happens
is this. It goes in among a list of causes
for trial in that court, and whatever judge
is assigned to the particular court to try
these causes deals with that matter in the
regular way, just as be deals with the
quarrels between A and B, or between
E and D. In that way, the naming by
the Government of a particular judge as a
special commissioner to suit themselves is
done away with. There is no objection at
all to the Provincial Governments having
the benefit of the judges' services, but they
ought to obtain them through the medium
of their courts.
Coming now to the Dominion Government, we find that it has not, as the
Provincial Governments have, the power to
constitute the courts. Therefore, the
positions are not exactly the same. With
regard to the appointment of judges as
commissioners by the Dominion Government, I would like' to see the law provide
that, while judges might be appointed, in
cases that are special or urgent, yet they
should be appointed, not by the Minister of
Justice or the Dominion Government naming
them, but by the Chief Justice selecting and
nominating the judge. There may be a
very important matter, involving a constitutional question, or an international
question, in which

the

national Govern-

ment might want the services of one or
of
more judges, say in the province
Ontario or in the province of Quebec. If
they wanted judges from the province of
Ontàrio, they would write to the Chief
Justice saying that the services of say
two judges were required. That would give
tie Chief Justice a chance to arrange the
circuit and the courts with the minimum
of disturbance. It is very undesirable that
either the Provincial Governments or the
Dominion Government should call away two
judges without consulting the court. This
provision would obviate that. It ought to
remove the suspicion that exists in the
minds of the public when the Dominion
Government name a judge, that they are
naming him to suit themselves.
This matter bas got into a position that
is somewhat complicated. I moved some
time ago, I think, the first amendinent.
That simply dealt with the provincial
judges, leaving the matter of the Dominion
judges to stand over. I did that as a matter
of policy, because I find that when a person

SENATE

and not appointing a commission to deal
with it, would be that it would be heard,
not by a specially selected judge, but
by the judge who happened to be sitting
in that particular court at that particular
time, and that would prevent interested
people from saying that this judge was
selected for the purpose and was merely
the tool of the Government, the judiciary
being in that way subjected, as I have said,
to a certain degree of disrespect. That is
the whole point. I recognize the fact that
there are splendid men on the benches of
the various sùpreme courts of this country.
The great majority of them, are men of
high character and sterling integrity. But,
in order that the public mind shall retain
the opinion that it has of our judges today-or that it did have a few years ago,
for it has been shaken to some extent by
reason of the fact that judges are used in
quasi-political matters-we should keep
them out of this sort of thing, and restrict
them to the work of the courts. That is
my opinion, and that is the soile reason
that induced me to support this amendment.
As I have said, this amendment does not
suit me. It does not suit the honourable
gentleman who moved it in the first place.
But, in order that there might not be collision between the two Houses of Parliament,
we were willing to consent to this change

being made, and submitted to the House for
its approval. I am prepared, if it is necessary, to fight the other Chamber at the
drop of the bat; but I do not want to fight
it at any time if we can get along smoothly.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I assure you, bonourable gentlemen, that I am essentially a
man of peace, but if I have to fight-well,
I try to fight. Now, let u's try to settle
this matter, if we can, without quarrelling.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend says that if he has to fight he will
fight; but I would prefer to see him in a
fighting mood when the time for fighting
bas arrived rather than see him put it off.
There is a great deal of confusion about
this whole matter, and, if honourable gentlemen will allow me a few moments, I
will try to elucidate the situation. What
we did was this. We sent the Bill to the
Commons with this clause:
No judge mentioned in this Act shall act as
commissioner or arbitrator on a commission or
inquiry. ProvIded that this section shall not
interfere with judges who are alt present acting
as commissioners or arbitrators completing the
work on wbich they are engaged.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

There is the fighting ground. It is on that
point that there is a disagreement between
the Commons and ourselves, and my bonourable friend who bas just sat down made
a very effective argument in favour of the
amendment as I have read it and as it
went from this House to the Commons. I
understand my honourable friend to say
that he is now prepared, for the sake of
compromise,
to
adopt-what?
This
clause:
Unless nominated by the Governor in Council,
no judge mentioned in this Act shall act as
commissioner or arbi-trator on any commission
or inquiry. Provided ýthat this section shal, not
interfere with judges who are at present acting
as commissioners or arbitrators completing the
work on which they are engaged.
For my part, I am not prepared to
accept the compromise which has been suggested to this House, because it does not at

all meet my view, nor does it meet the
unanimous view of this House, as expressed in the amendment which we sent
over to the Commons.

My honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) bas to my mind
made an absolutely conclusive case. While
you take away from the provinces the right
to have judges act as commissioners or
arbitrators, you are permitting this Government to appoint them. If it is bad in
one case, I should like to. know by what
principle it can be good in the other. Why,
this is a complete abandonment of the position taken by this House: it is an absolute
renunciation of the expressed desire of the
Senate in passing its amendment before
sending it to the Commons. This is not a
compromise at all; it is a sacrifice of the
principle.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
It allows the
Dominion Gavernment to go on appointing
judges to act as arbitrators or commissioners in such an arbitration as that of the
Grand Trunk which is now in progress.
That is the very thing that this House
waints to suppress. We do not want to
prevent provincial judge's from sitting on
inquiries into merely provincial miatters so
much as we desire to prevent the larger
things. It is the bigger offence that we
must strely have in view first.
I am not prepared to accept a compromise
of this kind. It is no compromise at all;
it is a complete sacrifice of principle. We
are absolutely stultifying ourselves if we
adopt even the sub-amendment proposed.
It seems to me extraordinary that in this
House, or in Parliament generally, public

MAY 24, 1921
opinion should not receive the sanetàon
which is demanded throughout this country.
I think the people are almost unanimous in
asking that judges should be prevented
from sitting on commissions. There is a
universal outcry against what bas been
going on in the last few years. Will Parliament be recreant to its duties in one of
the most important matters? I look upon
the administration of justice as of essential
importance to the welfare of the community, and there is no doubt that the judiciary
of Canada is suffering a great deal because
judges are being discussed in the newspapers, villified, and accused, rightly or
wrongly, of all sorts of things. If the present tendency continues, the respect in which
the community holds the judiciary will in a
few years be entirely gone. It is not because I have expressed myself in this way
before that I insist upon the matter; but
I say that it is the duty of Parliament to
do what is requirei, not onLy by the demands of justice, but also by public opinion
throughout this country. I repeat, I am
not prepared to accept the compromise. I
think that this House, in order to preserve
its dignity and honour, and to uphold the
principle -for which it fought, ought to
insist upon the amendments to the Judges
Act that we adopted, and if we cannot get
them accepted, let us accept our defeat
gracefully, but let us not make a compromise which would make matters worse.
Hori. Mr. LYNCH-S'AUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I most heartily agree
with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Queen's and Albert
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) and the honourable
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt).
I have not personally acceded to this compromise from any regard for the desire of
the Dominion Government; for, in my judgment, the Dominion Governrnent, like the
Provincial Governments, should recognize
the transcendant importance of keeping
free from all public disrespect the men from
whom justice to the people of Canada flows.
I agree with them that it is of the very
greatest importance that our judges should
be held in the very highest esteem throughout Canada, and that neither the Government nor the citizens should request or
require them to take part in any proceedings which would in any degree tend to
tarnish the mirror of their righteousness.
But I believe that even if we cannot succeed
in extricating them from embarrassment
in all cases it is worthy of the effort of the
Senate to rescue them from positions of
embarrassment. We were assured by the

557

other House that they would drop the Bill
rather than accede to our amendment.
Believing that it was of some advantage
to the public interest that we should gain
st least one step, I felt that by this amendmen we were advancing along the road
we wished to tread, and I trust and hope
that those who are in favour of eliminating
from the duties of the judges these Commissions that reflect so discreditably on
them will not for a moment, merely for
form's sake, hesitate to vote for this
amendment, as otherwise I fear we shall
gain nothing.
It must be remembered, honourable
gentlemen, as the old Act has been construed, and I think improperly construed,
that the judges of the East considered
themselves free to enter upon arbitrations
between private individuals, notwithstanding the most stringent provisions laid down
in the Revised Statutes; and we should
teach them.by this measure that they are
not entitled to give their services for any
corporation or individual or for any interest other than those which they are
permitted by the statute to serve. It is
with a feeling of great dissatisfaction that
I find that the House of Commons have
sent back this Bill to us; but I trust,
honourable gentlemen, that those members
of this House who are not lawyers will
agree with those who are lawyers, and
will agree not only from the public point
of view but from that of the administration
of justice. to take as much as we can get
instead of refusing it from a feeling of
pique or annoyance.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
I am not a
laçwyer, but we who are not lawyers might
be allowed our opinions also. The amendment of the honourable gentleman from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton),
stripped of legal verbiage, means that the
Governor in Council will go on, as he bas
always done, appointing arbitrators and
commissioners on inquiries. Therefore it
is much better that the Senate should do
as we have done on many other occasions.
The House of Commons sometimes choose
to say that they will not accept what we
suggest, but afterwards they come around
all right. All that is needed is a little
backbone in' this House. Years ago this
House made 149 amendments to the Railway Act, and the House of Commons
concurred in 145 of them.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: When this question
first came before the House I raised the
objection that it was an infringment upon

SENATE
provincial rights, and that the effect of
the legislation would be to limit the
jurisdiction of the courts. I said that
we had in the province of Quebec legislation under which judges were appointed
arbitrators, and that this amendment
would have the effect of doing away with
that legislation and limiting the powers of
the provincial governments and the courts
of justice. The first part of clause 5940
of the Revised Statutes of the Province of
Quebec reads as follows:
The council of any city or other municipality,
by resolution thereof, or fifty electors of any
city or other municipality, may by petition to
a judge of the Superior Court, in the district
in which such city or other munici.pality is
situated, in term or in vacation, require such
judge to investigate any matter to be mentioned in the resolution or petition, and relating
to a malfeasance, breach of trust or other misconduct on the part of one or more members of
the council or officers of the municipality.

If the amendment is adopted, the provincial Government cannot appoint judges
for the purpose mentioned in that statute.
Where is the judge who would accept if the
amendment were adopted? There is no exception niade in the amendment. It says:
Unless nominated by the Governor in Council, no judge mentioned in this Act shall act as
a commissioner or arbitrator on any commission or enquiry.

What does that mean? It means that any
judge appointed by a provincial Government under this or any other statute could
not act without the permission and approbation of the Governor in Council. So I
say that our courts of justice would be subject to the will and consent of the Governor
in Council. I contend that this is a limitation of provincial rights and of the
powers of our courts of justice.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, a peculiar situation bas developed in
connection with this matter. Everyone
seems desirous of doing away with this
ancient and well established privilege which
bas been possessed by Dominion, provincial,
and municipal Governments.
The
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
gentleman should call it a
honourable
license.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: They have had the
privilege of appointing judges upon their
commissions. Honourable gentlemen are
all ready to execute the victim, but they
have not quite agreed upon the point of
attack: one says, "Stab the victim in the
back;" another says, "Hit him on the
head." They cannot agree, because Dominion Governments, provincial Govern-

Hon.

Mr. DAVID.

ments, municipal Governments, and, above
all, militant labour, protest against doing
away with this privilege.
An amendment was prepared and sent
down to the Commons. A conference was
held, as a result of which some honourable
gentlemen here are agitating for the abolition of that privilege. Then it further developed that the provincial Governments
were not mentioned, because, no doubt,
there was a protest from certain quarters
against doing away with the privilege in
regard to provincial Governments. And
lastly, and to my mind even more important than all the other protests, is the pro-test of labour. The Minister of Labour
protested last year, and no doubt again this
year.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He disavowed that
this year.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He agreed.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: So much the worse.
At any rate, labour for a long time has
made a protest against doing away with
this privilege. It seems to me that the
real point is this: the judges, because they
are not being paid for sitting on commissions, do not wish to sit further upon commissions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They will be
paid now if they are appointed.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: This is giving them
more work, and I think they do not wish to
take on any more work unless they are
given extra pay for it. Notwithstanding
what has been said on the floor of this
House, I believe the general feeling throughout the country is in favour of the appointment of judges to commissions. When a
decision is given by a commission on which
judges are acting, either with or without
others, there is a general feeling throughout the country that fair consideration bas
been given to all the points involved in the
question submitted, and that the decision
is a fair one. Those against whom the decision is given will protest; they will cry
aloud and say the decision was wrong;
they will ascribe all sorts of improper
motives to the commission, and generally,
through the press or the platform, they
will make it as uncomfortable as they can
for the gentlemen who sat upon the commission. But I still believe, and I think
the public believes, that, after all is said
and done, national questions, whether pul-

MAY 24, 1921
itical or quasi-political in their nature,
havq to be decided, and 1 believe the public
stili thinks the best men to appoint to those
commissions are judges, net laymen; men
who by virtue of their experience have a
knowledge of procedure and of publie questions which is ofgreat value; and who,
by virtue of the fact that they are absolutely independent in their positions and
cannot be removed from them, are likely
to be the verymen most impartial under
the circumstances. There are no other
men who can be appointed to a commission who will not be open to ail the objections which are urged against the judges,
and to a very much greater extent than the
judges, because they may be aspirants for
positions, as the judges are not, because of
their independent and secure positions; and
it might be alleged against those men, as I
believe it could and would be, that they
were more liable to be actuated by the
motives wvhich have been attributed to the
judges than would the judges themselves.
A judge in sitting upon a commission is
absolutely independent, and, because of bis
high judicial position and bis experience
and judgment, bis decision is entitled to
very much more weight than would be the
judgment of a layman. It is trfie that
mixed commissions are very desirable when
* questions requiring expert knowledge have
to be. decided, but it is a Very easy matter
to associate with the judges men who have
expert knowledge of the question at issue.
In that way you can overcome any objection that may be raised as to a judge not
having special knowledge of the subject
with wbich he is dealing. But the further
you go in this movemnent to deprive the
country of the privilege of having judges
sit upon commissions, the greater are the
difficulties that will confront you;' and
when a body of men sncb as we have here,
men of high intelligence and great experience, are unable to agree upon the
method -of dealing the death blow to this
sacred and cherished institution, it seems
to me that it would be a long tiffie before
the country at large would decide upon any
special manner of doing away with this institution. I think that, instead of devising
further ways and means of doing away with
this priviiege, which bas existed for se long,
it would be far better for us to support
the resolution which has been introduced
by the leader of the House -and to agree net
to insist upon our amendment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, 1 desire to reassure the honourable
gentleman from Mille Iles (Hon. Mr.

559

David) as te the danger which t~e thinks is
to be found in the -Bill in question. It will
be easy for the Legislature of Quebec,
by a stroke of the pen, te invest the courts
of that province with the power necessary
to give effect te section 5940 et the Revised
Statutes, to which ie 'bas called attention.
We arg, 1 believe, almost unanimous in'
the opinion that it is inadvisable for either
the Governor in Council or.-the Lieutenant
Governor in Council of any province ta
caîl upon'any judge and entrust him wit#i
the duties connected with a commission et
ijiquiry or an arbitration, for the reason
that it tends te damage bis reputation as
a judge; but I do not think we are opposed
te the principle of the Federal judges or
the provincial judges dealing with matters
of that kind, provided they do it as courts,
or as members of the courts. If we are
ail united in that view, it will be easy for
the local Parliament -and the Federal Parliament te change the law in sucb -a way
as -to give the necessary power to the
courts te render the service in question;
but it will -be rendered by the courts, and
net by indi.zidual judges.
My trouble is that, wbereas we are of the
opinion that I have mentioned, yet, as was
very properly statèd by the honourable
gentleman from De Lerimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), we are net logical in denyîng
to the Lieutenant Governor of a Province
the exercise of a power which'we, concede
te the Governor General in Council. T-here
are, as -was very properly said, the sanie
objections in the one case as in the other.
By this amendment we would countenance
the doing by the Governor General in
Council of wbat is denied te the Lieutenant-Governors. I do not see that we can
at ail justify that position. I think .that
if that amendment were te go te the House
of Commons, the Gommons would be entitled te say that we are net logical; but
if we concede the right to tbe Governor in
Council, we should concede it aise te the
Lieutenant-Governors in Council, because
the sanie reason exists in the one case as
in the other. For my part, I think it
would ho mucli bebter te insist upon.eur
amendment as it was originally adopted,
and, if we cannot carry the amiendrnent,
thon we sbould at the next' Session try te
bave à law passed which would amend
the jurisdictions..pf the Federal court ini
such a way that it could deal with these
mattere.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I think that some reply should be

SENATE

560

made to the honourable gentleman from
Antigonish (Hon. Mr. Girroir). The impression I got from the remarks that he
made was that he thought some desire had
been expressed by the judges that they
should not be employed on Commissions,
because of the legislation that we passed
last Session. I do not think it is fair
to the judges that any expression of that
kind should go out from the Senate. We
should object to the statement made by
the honourable gentleman that such a desire on the part of the members of the
Bench is possible-that because last Session we passed legislation preventing them
from accepting remuneration for sitting on
Commissions, they now wish to be relieved
altogether of such work. The whole question bas been thrashed out so much in this
House that I think honourable gentlemen
are fully seized of the importance of not
appointing judges to sit on Commissions.
I think the general opinion of the House
is against allowing the judges to do so;
but unfortunately, when our amendment
reacbed the House of Commons, there was
hardly any discussion of that. It is unfortunate that amendments which, I think,
are favoured by a large number of the
members of the other Chamber were not
discussed. I had the honour the other day,
with one or two other honourable members
of attending a meeting at which the question was discussed. As a result of that
meeting, I think, my honourable friend
from Hamilton has brought in his amendment to-day; but the amendment he is proposing is not a satisfactory one so far
as I am concerned. I share the view of
my honourable friend from de Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) that we are not getting any farther when we have an amendment such as that which my honourable
friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) has brought down. , I think the
question has *reached a stage at which we
should insist upon its being considered, and
if the Bill does not become law this year,
there will be no great harm done to the
country. My honourable friend (Hon. Sir
James Lougheed) on one occasion mentioned that thv Bill deals with the appointment of a judge in Saskatchewan; but
probably the people of Saskatchewan would
not be very much disturbed if they did not
have this addition to the Bench made for
another seven or eight months. I therefore
think that the matter should now be
brought to an ilssue, and we should impress
Fcn. Mr. BOSTOCK.

firmily upon the co'untry that this is an important question and one which should be
dealt with.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not quite understand how
any charge of inconsistency could be made
against any honourable member of this
House who, being absolutely convinced that
the judges should not sit on Commissions,
would accept the amendment now proposed.
The situation to my mind is simply this.
There are now ten Governments that can
appoint judges to Commissions. When this
amendment is passed there will be 'only
one left. Is not that exactly the case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it covers
the whole Dominion.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Very we.ll.
There will be nine sources of disorder, so
to speak, which will be closed. I will put
it at the worst. There will be one still
open. Is not that making some progress?
My honourable friends oppositd are not
logical. They can now, if they wish, improve the situation to the extent of ninetenths; yet they are not doing it-4why?
With regard to the provinces, the honourable member for Mille Iles (Hon. Mr.
David), said that the legisiation might interfere with the practical working of the
courts; that is to say, that it might prevent the. reference, already provided for
by our law, of disputes in certain cases
to our courts. I must say that I have
absolutely no anxiety on that score. The
law which the honourable gentleman has
cited states clearly that a member of our
bench can receive, consider and determinc
an application made by a certain nuiber
of municipal electors, in certain cases, asking for an investigation.
Should it be
thought necessary in any province to extend the law so as to give similar
authority to judges in cases akin to those,
why should not that be done? I must, of
course, admit that there are exceptional
cases requiring immediate solution, making it inconvenient to await another Session and the enactment of a special law.
I understand that. But there is no law
in this world that is perfect; there is no
law that does not work a hardship now
and then; and we must be satisfied if,
after all, the result as a whole is satisfactory. To my mind, this law, although
it does not attain the goal which we have
in view, makes a great deal of progress in
that direction and comes very close to that
goal. If I understand the inteution of my
honourable friend here (Hon. W. B. Ross),
lie will next year make a sprint for it.

He is making the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, when I introduced the
question a*week or ten days ago, I had no
idea that it would be susceptible to s0
much diversity of opinion and s0 many suggestions by way of amendment. Owing to
the different motions which have been
moved the situation has become somewhat
involved, and it may not be amiss for me
simply to review the situation, so that we
may understand what we are about to vote
upon. May I, before doing that, trace
the development of the principle which. is
enunciated in those resolutions and. which
has been asserted from 1906 down to the
present time. In the Revised Statutes of
1906, honourable gentlemen will recali,
there is to ýbe found legisiation precluding
the judges of Canada from sitting on
Boards and accepting remuneration for
work outside of their judicial duties, but
not; including the Iduties which they would
perform as commissioners or arbitrators.
The law remained pretty inuch in that condition until 1920. In that year legisiation
amending the Judges Act was placed upon
the statute book, and two principles, as I
think we may call them, were introduoed
into the Act. One provided that the judge
appointed as an arbitrator or a commissioner should not receive a remuneration
for the services which he rendered; and the
second was that the judge shouhd not; act
as' a commissioner or arbitrator unless he
was appointed by the Governor in Council
or by the Lieutenant-Governor. Previous
to that time a judge, of bis own motion,
could accept a commission to act as eitber
an arbitrator or a commissioner. In niy
judgment, sufficient time bas not; been
given for us ta realize whether or not the
amendments which were made in the
statutes of 1920 wihl work out satisfac±orihy.
There is, so far as I know, no case in which
there bas been an abuse, in a judge's acceptance of a commission to act, since that time.
The very fact of a judge flot being able to
receive remuneration in an outside capacity
bas really sbut the road to tbe abuse wbich
bas been pointed out.
Hon., Mr. FOWLER.:
Toronto case?
S-36

561

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
judges in the Toronto case were appointed
before the Act was passed, and they are,
I understand, receiving remuneration. The
commission to tbose judges was issued
prior to the statute coming into operation.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: As I' understand
it, if they bad not grafted off tfiat two
thousand dollars, they would bave been
within tbe scope of the statute.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
in anticipation of that. But I venture to
say that the two judges in question would
not bave accepted tbe very important duties
assigned to tbem under that Commission
had they not had some expectation of receiving remuneratiil.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Would my
honourable friend allow me to ask him a
question at tbis point? Are we to understand that in bis opinion the fact that those
judges were appointed before tbe law came
into force entithed them to be paid, and
tbat tbe haw of 1920 does not affect them
or deprive themn of remuneration?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 'That is
a legal question. It is a vexed question
wbetber they are entitled to any remunerathon or not. However, I tbink the Ontario
Govertiment bas assisted them in overcoining that difflculty by making provision for
their remuneration. However, although I
stand subject to correction, I believe that
the cômmission was jssued before this Act*ê
came into operation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But, .assming
that, they would not be entitled to any reniuneration even thougb tbey were appointed before the statute came. into force.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is not
the point the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) makes. He
believes that from the date of the proclamation of the Act, although the Commission had issued previously, the judges
would be debarred from receiving remuneration.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Their pay would
be docked.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It depends on the Interpretation Act and upon
the legislati'on itself; but if the act had
been entered upon before the statute was
passed, then, I think, under the Interpretation Act, they would be entitled afterwards
to receive any remuneration to which they
had hitherto been entitled.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not agree
with that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: However, that is a controversial subject. Outside of that particular case, I am unaware
of any case in Canada in which a judge
has been subjected to adverse criticism
by reason of accepting a commission; for
the simple reason that the evidence of
the judge having accepted the commission
without being able to receive remuneration
bas to a very large extent overcome the
prejudice and the abuse to which the appointment of judges had previously been
subjected.
0 Now may I point out, honourable gentlemen, where in my judgment this amendment is unwise-is impolitic. It has been
pointed out that, notwithstanding the adoption of certain amendments, the provinces
will not be affected. You only strike a
blow at the Federal Government by pass. ing this amendment. Under the law as it
stands, it is intended, and is, I think,
admitted by all the legal gentlemen in this
Chamber, that inherently the provinces
would have the power, by assigning the
duty to the court, to appoint judges as
commissioners.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let me
follow this up, honorable gentlemen. That
is admitted. The question arises whether
the Governor 'General or the Federal Government is placed upon a parity with the
provinces.
The Dominion Government
would not have power to do the same thing
in the provinces. I quite admit the argument advanced by my honourable friends
Opposite, that the Federal Government
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

would have the right to do the same thing
in respect to Federal judges of the Supreme
Court and judges of the Exehequer court.
But no honourable gentleman in this
Chamber will contend that it would be possible to take judges from the Supreme
Court or the Exchequer Court and assign
them to other duties throughout the Dominion. Why, we would have no Supreme
Court; we would have no Exchequer Court.
The judges are too few to permit of their
attention being diverted by other duties
at this time. Consequently, it would become
necessary 'to establish another judicial
tribunal of some kind, composed of judges
who would perform this particular kind of
work. Therefore you would give the Provincial Governments an advantage which
you do not give Io the Dominion Government. First of all, honourable gentlemen,
I am unawaire of -the power having been at
any time abused by the Federal Government, either that of 'the present day or any
other. I cannot recall that any charge has
been male by any Provincial Government
of an abuse of 'this privilege on the part of
the Federal Government of designating a
provincial judge to make an inquiry into
any particular subject. I stand corrected
if any adverse comments of that character
have been made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman will remember the ten million dollar inquiry on the Canadian Northern, as to which Sir William Meredith has
failed to justify himself before the public
for having declared that there was any
equity in the common shares.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Parliament impliedly fixed the same value as the
commissioners, and I do not think it lies
in the mouth of Parliament to criticize the
findings of the judge on that occasion.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Does the honourable gentleman suppose that any of the
Provincial Governments would refuse to
assent to the suggestion of the Federal
Government if they were asked to change
the powers of the courts in order to provide for the exercise of the duties in question, in 'so far as the' requirements of the
Federal Government are concerned?
It
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
would depend entirely upon the political
interest of the Province. The Province
would repeat the same thing in regard to
the appointment of one of its judges to
investigate a matter for the Federal Government as it would do with regard to a

opporturiity would have been given to discuss the subject. But these amendments
went down at a time when the Budget was
being deait with and when the time of that
Chamber was oecupied with matters of
very much greater importance. Therefore,
we cannot take very grave exception to
the reasons advanced by the House of Coinmous when they say that sufficient time
was flot given them to afford a proper
discussion of the subject.
The other reason advanced is that it:

niatter within its own jurisdiction. My
honourable friend from. De Salaberry (Hon.
MT. Béique) can scarcely argue seriously
that the Dominion Government shou¶Id be
thrown back upon the provinces, and. that
we should. become suppliants of the provinces in regard to the appointment of a
provincial judge to inquire into a Federal
matiter. I do not think that would be in
harmony with the dignity which should be
maintained by the Federal Government in
the investigation of Federal subi ects.
However, the fact remains that if the first
amendment is passed, by which the
Dominion Government would be precluded, from appointîng a provincial
iudge to investigate a subject, it will oe
handicapped as against the provinces.
I simply submit that point for your consideration, honourable gentlemen, and 1
desire to say this: that an opportunîty
was not given to the Gommons to discuss
this matter fully. I know some honourable gentlemen have taken unibrage at the
paucity, s0 to speak, of the reasons advanced by the House of Gommons for flot
concurring in the amendment. The reasons
are as follows:

564

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
like my honourable friend from King's and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler): I am a moderate man, a believer in compromises, one
who does not insist on his opinions, who
lives for peace. But I do want to point
out that we have not given a proper test
to the legislation placed upon the statute
book, and that no abuse of that legislation
has yet been pointed out. I may say, as
is said in those well-known lines of Tennyson, that this is
. A land of settled government,
A land of just and old renown,
Where freedom slowly broadens down
From precedent to precedent.

I ask honourable gentlemen to give the
present legislation an -pportunity of being
tested; and when it is shown that there
are any abuses growing out of the legislation which we placed on the statute book
last year, that will be sufficient time to
strike a blow at that legislation.
Let me say this. The Commons have
sent to this Chamber a message stating
that they do not see their way to concur
in the amendrnents. There is a motion before the House that we do not insist upon
our amendments. The honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) has moved an amendment to the
message along the lines that have been
discussed. Consequently, there are two
matters before the House: first, the motion
that we do not insist on the amendments,
and, secondly, the motion of my honourable
friend from Hamilton, by way of amendment to the motion, that we do not insist
upon the original amendments but suggest another. Under these circumstances,
and considering the improbability of our
being able to agree, it does not seem to
me that we shall be promoting the object
which we have in view if we come into conflict with the House of Commons upon this
subject, 'particularly as we legislated last
Session upon it, and an opportunity has
not yet been given to test the wisdom of
that legislation. When another Session
comes we can resort to the plan I have
suggested, of either introducing a Bill or
of amending the Judges Act when it comes
before us as it does almost every Session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand that the honourable gentleman opposes
the amendment of the honourable gentleman from Hamilton? ,
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
oppose it, but I have submitted the other
motion.
Hon.

Mr.

BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Would any essential interest be materially affected if tne
whole thing went by the board?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes
It would be unfortunate if the Bill should
not go through, inasmuch as it corrects a
very grave abuse which bas been the subject of a great deal of criticism for years
past as to the travelling expenses of certain judges. The Bill is calculated to remedy that abuse, which is a very desirable
provision, and it also provides for the appointment of a judge in Saskatchewan,
Where the business bas been very much congested, owing not only to the illness of
certain judges but to the lack of judges
for the transaction of business. Under
these circumstances I think the House
would be justified in supporting the motion
which I have had the honour to move.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Did I
not understand the honourable gentleman
to say that he would withdraw his motion
and substitute mine?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
but the House will not agree.

Yes,

Hon. Mr. McHUGH: I should like te
get a little information before being asked
te vote on this question. Does an Act
passed by the Federal Parliament override
an Act of a Provincial Parliament? I
should like to hear from some of the legal
talent in this House as to whether such an
Act would interfere with statutory appointments of arbitrators made by the provinces?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
does not.

No, it

Hon. Mr. McHUGH: Take the case of
cemetery or school sites. In such cases the
Board of Trustees want to purchase a certain piece of property, and the owner of
it refuses the price which they offer. Each
side appoints an arbitrator, and those two
arbitrators appoint a third arbitrator. If
they cannot agree upon who is to be the
third arbitrator, there is something in the
Ontario statutes that says the judge of the
county shall, after some thirty days' notice,
be the third arbitrator. In such a case
would you not be interfering with the
statutes of the province of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
ment would not interfere.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: If honourable
gentlemen will possess their souls in
patience, I will give a reason or two.
I beg to
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
call the honourable gentleman to order. If
he moves that the Committee rise, he cannot debate the motion.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I understand
that under the rule I have a right to make
the motion that the Chairman do now leave
the Chair.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: That is,
that the Committee rise. I understand
that motion is not debatable.
-Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is, if I
understand the rules correctly.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not in this House.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: My, motion is
in accordance with rule 145, I think.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Rule 73.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: For what I
want to do this is the proper coiurrse to
take.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: This is a public
Bill passed in the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Yes, it is a
public Bill.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Will my
honourable friend move that the Committee
rise and sit again?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, I move that
you do now leave the Chair. That is the
proper motion to make.
The CHAIRMAN: That motion is not
debatable.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I submit that
it is debatable. Is it your ruling that it
is not?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Then I appeal
from your ruling to the Conmittee.
The Committee rose and reported.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
gentlemen, the Chairman of the Committee
of the Whole, to whom was referred Bill
116, an Act to amend the Research Council Act and to establish a National Research Institute, reports that he bas given
a decision that the motion to rise is not
debatable, and that Hon. Mr. Proudfoot

bas appealed from that decision. Those
who are against the ruling of the Chairman will please rise.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Before that
motion is putSome Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I know it is
not debatable, but I want to point out
that the procedure, if I understand the
rule, is incorrect, and that the Chairman
of the Committee should take a vote. He
should ask whether or not the Chair is
sustained. As I understand the rules, you,
Mr. Speaker, have really nothing to do
with the question, and the Senate should
not go back into session.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: After the
question has been dealt with you may have
a right to make another appeal from the
decision.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have a right
to have that disposed of.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those in
favour of the decisàon of the Chairman will
please rise.
The decision of the Chairman was sustained: yeas, 28; nays, 16.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I desire to have

cedure from the time the Committee rose
until now is out of order.
The Senate again went into Committee.

principle to the present Bill. The Act of
Conservation had Vo do with ithe conservation of oui natural respurces, not with
their development. Unfortunately, in their
eager desire Vo cuver a larger field of usefulne"s Vl'an that, there was a disposition
on the part of the Conservation, Commission to give advice and Vo go into qViestions of science and development. The ohject of this Bill is quite the contrary; it
is Vo begin where the other left off. This
has Vo do with the development of our
natural resources, particularly s0 far as
research and science can be applied to them,
and with the application of modern scientific methods not only to natural resources
but Vo manufactures. 1V is pToposed that

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FOWLER. Oh, I think so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Of
course, common sense has to be exercised
with regard to these matters.
But the
Conservation Commission, in its very machinery, was not fitted for this particular
work. This Bill contemplates the organization of a body of scientists in which the
different scientific institutions, particularly
the universities of Canada, will be represented.
It will be observed by honourable gentlemen from a perusal of the Bill that
provision is made for the appointment of
an Honorary Council. That Council will
be made up, as the present Advisory Council on Industrial Research is made up, of
representatives of the universities of Canada and of our different scientific institutions, and will be a body that will peculiarly
apply scientific methods to all developments of industry.
I would point out to honourable gen.
tlemen that this system bas been evolved
very largely in the United States, in Great
Britain and throughout Europe. Nearly
all the large manufacturing institutions of
Great Britain have their own scientific
industrial research organizations attached
to the enterprises which they are carrying on. The rapid development which took
place in Germany prior to the war was
almost entirely due to the adoption and
application of scientific methods.
Need
I point out to honourable gentlemen, because we all appreciate it, the value of
the great natural resources of which we
on this continent are the possessors. If
some attention is given to this subject, if
a broad and comprehensive policy is laid
down and the methods to which I have alluded are applied, Canada should be in the
very front ranks of the great progressive
nations of the present century.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: My honourable
friend says that conservation and development are opposed to each other. I take exception to that statement. True development should go side by side with conservation. We see a great deal of the farming in our western country, because it is
not conducted along the lines of true conservation, destroying in many cases the
fertility of the soil Weeds have been
allowed to grow and flourish, and the land
in many cases has become exhausted and
practically worthless, because proper conservation methods of farming were not
pursued. Land could be farmed for a thousand years and would be as good at the
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

end of that period as it was at the beginning if true methods of farming were followed, such as are practised in Europe, particularly in Belgium, England, and France;
b ut if the same methods were pursued as
are pursued in a great deal of our western
country, the land would be a desert.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Why the Western
country? Why not take New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Take any country.
I mentioned the West because that is a
farming country.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
anything about it.

You do not know

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I mentioned the
West, not because I wished to take it as
an example, for there are some good farmers -in the West, but because there are in
that area many who are not good farmers,
but are, really agricultural miners; and a
great deal of harm has been done to that
great heritage of ours in Western Canada
because conservation methods have not been
adopted. There is no question about that,
as any man who is not prejudiced and who
knows the West, will admit. I know the
West. I have travelled a great deal in that
section of Canada, and I have a great
admiration for it, but I cannot shut my
eyes to the evil results of bad farming
there. A good many people have gone into
farming there who know nothing about
farming-who were not farmers, who have
no education along farming lines; therefore, the methods they pursued have not
been the best. There is no doubt about
that. So I say that conservation is a very
important feature in the true development
of our resources.
Take lumbering as well as farming. In
lumbering you can destroy forests in two
or three seasons, so that they will not be
productive for very many years, perhaps
for a century. On the other hand, you
can so eut the timber that the annual
growth will keep the forest up ta its original condition. That is done by good lumbermen, men who have the future of the
country at heart, here in the East, where
there are timber lands that have been lumbered for a century and on which the timber
is as good to-day as it was a century ago,
because the lumbering operations have been
conducted on right principles. Even in my
own province-which may generally be held
up as a model to the other provinces-there
are some people who have so far departed
from the principles of conservation that

MAY 24, 1921
they bave destroyed the future productivity
of the land frorn wbich their fortunes bave
been nmade. So it is not true that conservation and developrnent are opposed to each
other.
I would like to see ini this country the
true development of our resources, and at
the sanie tirne I arn old-fasbioned. enough
to want to see true conservation, and I hope
that will be kept in view.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Take the developuient of water-powers.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Wben you conserve your forests you are conserving your
water-pdxwers, and let me tell you that the
usefdiness of your waterýpoweTrj depends
very mucb upen jour forests. There is no
question about tbat. I believe in conserving the water-poweoes, but I believe in using
tbesn, becaruse water-'power la soinething
that cornes every year and you cannot destroy it unless you destroy the forests, for
it is upon the preserve of tbe forests that
the waterýpowers very largely depend.
I arn not opposing this Bill. I believe
in a Researcb Council, and I tbink the
Government sbould bave a body of men
who are fitted for this purpose, and should
pay theni good, respectable salaries, so that
the future of themselves and their families
will be assured, and they may be able to
devote tbemselves absolutely and solely to
research work along different lines. I have
always been greatly in favour of that. Had
I the fortune of a Carnegie, I would not
waste it oný silly libraries, but would devote
it to researcb purposes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I did not gather
from the statement of the bonourable leader
of the Government that be has any decided
view as to bow be is going to prevent overlapping as between bis Department and
tbe Researcb Department. I do tbink that
we ougbt to bave some understanding before proceeding further witb this Bill as
to bow that is to be done. I inight read
from a report of the Committee for tbe
year ending'March 31, 1919. At page 31
of that report they state:
The following brief statement of the work
of the Associate Cocmmittee to date may prove
of interest.
1. Researchi Oouncl.-At each meeting a report on the work of the Council was sufbmitted
by the Chairman and disoussed at length. with
a view to giving the Council the benefit of the
views of the minlng and metallurgical Intereste
as represented by the Associate, Commlttee.
2 . Lignite-The work of the Lignfte Utilization ]Board was also laid before the Committee

-569

ln the forîn of a report personally sulitted by
the Secretary, Mr. Leslie Thonipson, anid was
similarly diseussed.
3. Peat.-It has been recojnmended that the
excellent 'work done by the D>ominion Department of Mines on peat and peat produots be
extended, and a speclal oonilttee has been
formed to take up this matter. Trhe report of
this Ootnmtttee lias been recelved and la being
prepared for distribution.

There are four or five more of those.
Take the item of 4eat alone. 'The honourable leader of the Governrnent in this House
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) knows that in
his Mines . B ranch the peat industry bas
been investigated and very valuable work
has been done in the past. Why this Research Council should take up that question, taking it out of the bauds of the
Mines Branch, I arn unable to see.; Further,
I think there is going to be a considerable
amount of overlapping if that sort of thing
is allowed to go on. I would like the honourable leader of the Government to explain to the House how he proposes to control that in the future.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If niy
honourable friend will observe the Bill, he
wll see that provision is m-ade in clauses 9,
10, 11, and 12, and in fact throughout most
of the Bill, that the purposes of ths organization shall be carried out under the
Minister of Trade and Commerce. It will
therefore be subject to the Government. It
is as much under the Minister as any other
branch of bis Department. Consequently
flot only the Minister, but also the Government of whicb tbat Minister is a member, will assume ail responfsibility. If tbere
be any overlàpping or duplication of work
the responsibility rests upon the Government. This control of tbe organization by
the Governnient will permit of the co-ordination of the work which is now being
done by the different Departments. I amn
not prepared to pass an opinion or judgment at the present moment, as to whetber
it is advisable or flot that scientifle work
sbould be carried on by several Departments. It seems to me that better service
could be rendered by the co-ordination of
tbat work by some central body, and that
such a body bas -been well defined and is
well calculated to carry out the purpose
wbicb we bave in view.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I might point out,
in reply to my bonourable friend, tbat tbis
Bill certainly puts the matter under tbe
Minister of Trade and Commerce; but tbe
Minister of Trade and Commerce bas been
one of the tbree members of the Council
responsible for the work of tbe Research

SENATE
Council up to the present time. Under
the Act of 1917, according to the report
which I have here, there was a Committee
of Council which consisted of the Right
Hon. Sir George Foster, Minister of Trade
and Commerce; the Hon. Arthur Meighen,
Minister of the Interior; the Hon. T. A.
Crerar, Minister of Agriculture; Hon.
Martin Burrell, Secretary of State; Hon.
G. D. Rob'ertson, Minister of Labour;
and Hon. L. A. Sifton, Minister of
Customs and Inland Revenue. That was
a sub-committee of Council, appointed as
I understand, as a -sort of committee
to direct the work of dealing with the
Research Council; but, in place of that;
this overlapping, as I think it may fairly
be termed, bas already occurred, and the
question is: the Minister of Trade and
Commerce having been one of the members
of that sub-committee of Council, whether
in the future he will pay a little closer attention and see that this overlapping is
not allowed to go on.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not prepared to say that there was overlapping in regard to the particular activities referred to by my honourable friend.
I understand that the research work was
done by this Council, and the administrative work was carried on by the Department. I am unaware of the research
work having been done by the Departments to which my honourable friend refers.
A clear distinction can be drawn. It is
not intended that this body should be an
administrative body. They do the research
work, and the administrative work is carried on by the machinery of the Departments.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But in the case
of the peat investigation that was conmenced some years before the war, the
industry had been brought up to the point
at which it was practically demonstrated
that peat could be satisfactorily used in
place of coal. The Department of Mines
had known that long before this Research
Council was appointed. Why the Research
Council was allowed to take up the question of the rpeat industry I am at a loss
to understand.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
have not satisfied thenselves yet.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps I might
explain that. Honoura'ble gentlemen travelling between Montreal and Ottawa can see
the peat industry in operation. At Alfred
yesterday we saw a carload of briquettes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

Unfortunateýly up to, the present time private capital bas never been successful in
carrying on the peat industry-why?
Because ceal could be had at the seashore
for three dollars a ton. At Goderich,
where I was interested in a salt mine, we
had coal to put into the furnaces selling
at seventy cents a ton. But that is ail
changed: the price of coal bas gone up.
That gives a chance for peat to be manufactured and sold in the market.
It is the same with lignite. At Bienfait, on south-eastern Saskatchewan, lignite is being manufactured now and will
be sold in Winnipeg at $12 or $13 a ton.
It w'il have just the saine calorific value
as the very best anthracite. I am told
that in W'innipeg to-day anthracite is selling at $25 a ton and that In Regina it is
selling at $30 a ton. So there will certainly
be an opportunity for lignite. Formerly
private capital was not available, and the
lignite was not carbonized and briquetted.
The Government, owing to the high cost of
fuel, which is a menace to industry in
this country, had to take some steps, and
now the possibilities for the manufacture
of lignite will be demonstrated at Bienfait.
The price of lignite bas already increased.
Formerly, the price was $1 a ton; now, at
Bienfait they are paying $2 a ton for the
lignite. And remember, it takes two tons
of lignite, carbonized, to make one ton of
good anthracite, for over nine-tenths of
it is coal and the other one-tenth is tar.
I have the figures regarding the price of
that tar at Sault Ste. Marie, where it is
manufactured and from which it is -shipped
to Bienfait to be mixed with lignite. The
mixture of nine-tenths of carbonized lignite
with one-tenth of tar makes a very superior
quality of coal.
We have heard of the peat industry all
our lives, but on account of the cheapness
of coal when it could be bought at $3 a
ton, it was impossible to sell peat. Now
that coal is so dear you can sell peat, and
sell it commercially.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:

Honourable gen-

tlemen, I do not think that the discourse

we have just had from my honourable
friend justifies in any way the Research
Council for meddling with the peat business, if my honourable friend does not desire to have two departnents working on
the sane thing and does not want to have a
duplication of work. I know that twelve
or thirteen years ago, under the Department of the Interior, very good peat was
produced from some bogs in the vicinity of

MAY 24, 1921
Ottawa, because 1 bought some and burned
it in my house in this city. The Department of the Interior has been working on
'that question of production ever since, and
here we have this Ind'ustrial Research
Council working away on the same line,
doing the y'ery same thing as that for which
xny honourable friends put through the Act
establishing the Conservation Commission,
that is, duplicating the work that other departments were doing. So my honourable
friend. is apparently not; going to be able
to avoid the duplication. In a report published by this Industrial Council, of which
I have a copy, they deal with several
matters with wbich my honourable friend's
department is already dealing, and, unless
very strong measures are taken I imagine
that this will continue.
I would point out also that the Council is
ta consist of one paid member, and the
others are to work for nothing. 'They are
to meet at least four times a year. Il does
not seem. to me that you can get work
from a Council that does flot receive any
payment, or only one member of which receives a salary. The Coundil will, say, meet
every three months, and will report. They
will report on the work that the officiais of
the Branch are doing. It will be practically the report of the officiais of the
Branch. So it seems to me il would be a
good deal better either if there were one
man alone in charge of the work, or if
there were a staff also, and ail the members
were paid for the work they did.
Section 1 was agreed to.
B3efore you
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
adopt that clause, I want to say a word or
two with reference to il; and, to show you
t'hat I was absolutely correct in the -motion
I made before, I move that you do now
leave the Chair. I make that motion under
the miles of the Senate.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Do I understand the honourahie gentleman to be
moving the motion that he made before the
House went into Committee?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No. 1 have a
right to move this motion aI any time,
under rule 73.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will the
honourable gentleman read the rule?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT (reading):
Rule 73. The rules o'f the Senate are observed
in a Oommlttee of the Whole, except the rules
limiting the num3iber of times of speaking; and
no motion for the Previous question, or for an
adjoure ment, can be received;

571

Now, here is the point:
But a Senator may at any time move that

the Chs.4rman leave the Chair.

That is the motion which I desire to
make.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May 1
point out that my honourable friend's
motion is entirely out of order. -Hie has
already moved that; and, the motion having
been passed upon, he is out of order in
moving il again. If he could do that, my
honourable friend could move in a circe
until the House prorogued.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is exactly
wvhat I can do, and that is what the rule
states.
Hon. Si, JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is another rule which prevents your doing
that.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 1 have not seen
the other rule, but this is plain enough.
Not only that, but the parliamentary work
says that the motion may be made at any
time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes,
il may be made.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I must eall
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot) ta ordeir. Hie has aiready'made
that motion: he cannot make it again. We
have now before us for consideration clause
2 of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have the
right, Mr. Chairman, to move that motion,
and I move it now; and, if that is your
ruling, I again appeal to the Committee
from your ruling.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: I would draw
the attention of the Chairman to the fact
that we might remain here in perpetuum
if there were not a motion to rise at a
certain time. 0f course, we may rise and
report progress, or we may simply rise.
My subinission is that my honourable
friend would find himseif in a rather
difficult position if he could neyer rise;
and he may do so only on a motion.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I decide that
the question before the Committee at the
present time is clause 2, and nothing else.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Then, I must
insist, Mr. Chairman, on your taking the
sense of the Committee on the appeai which
I made to the Committee from your ruling.

SENATE
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The decision
of the Chair being appealed from, I put to
the Committee the question: Shall the
cecision of the Chair be sustained?
The decision of the Chair was sustained.
On section 2-Advisory Council:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Now I have a
few remarks to make with reference to
this section. I moved that motion a few
moments ago only for the purpose of showing that I was strictly correct in making
the motion before; but you, Mr. Chairman,
took the proper course to dispose of it,
which was not taken on the previous.
occasion, and I may move the same motion
again, later on, under some other clause.
The objection I have to section 2 is that
by appointing an Honorary Advisory Council you are simply going to duplicate the
work that was done undét the Commission
of Conservation. The Conservation Commission is still in existence and will be until
the Act is repealed. The objection I make
is this. If you refer to this particular
section, you will find that there is to be
appointed an Honorary Advisory Council,
in effect the same as the Advisory Council
whic'h was appointed by the Commission of Conservation. The expense in connection with the Advisory Council will be
very considerable, and we are going to find
ourselves with another Commission on our
hands, somewhat similar in organization to
the Conservation Commission.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will not the Bill
abolishing the Conservation Commission
and this Bill, if it passes, be sanctioned and
become law at precisely the same moment?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I presume so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then the honourable gentleman's argument is all wrong.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, I do not
think so. I might point out that we are
doing away with a Commission solely on
the ground of the expense incurred in connection with it, and because it overlapped,
and my contention is that you are going to
repeat, under these particular clauses, exactly the very thing you are doing away
with by the other BUi]1.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That was not
my honourable friend's argument. He is
arguing that now, but he was arguing
something else a moment ago.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
I cannot
follow the vagaries of my honourable
friend's mind. I know the statement I
made; I know the argument I am preHon.

Mr. PROUDFOOT.

senting to the House on this particular
question. My submission to the House is
that we are going to repeat exactly what
the honourable leader of this House pointed
out to us a short time ago as a source of
very considerable expense. The expense
arises largely out of your appointing an
Honorary Advisory Council, and if on the
ground of economy we could not afford to
carry on the Conservation Commission, then
how can we, applying the same argument,
establish an Honorary Advisory Council
under this particular Bill? The position is
so wholly inconsistent that on the ground
of economy alone I fail to see why we
should proceed with this partieular cianse.
I think that all the work which can be
done by the Honorary Advisory Council
referred to in clause 2 may be carried
through by the various departments.
We heard a few days ago about the
splendid work which has been carried
on by many of the departments, dealing,
as they do, with the Federal rights of this
country, and various other matters. It was
also stated that the Conservation Commission overlapped. If that work is being
carried on and the Conservation Commission could very well be abolished, then it
seems to me that by appointing some individual to carry on the research work and
attaching him to one of the Departments,
we could have the work carried on without proceeding with an extensive organization, which, -as I understand it, is going to
spend in its initiation something like half
a million dollars for buildings. I would ask
honourable gentlemen in dealing with this
clause to consider fully the argument
which persuaded them a few days ago that
the other Commission should be abolished.
The Act that we are going to repeal was
passed in 1917, and is known as Chapter
20. Under clause 3 of this Bill-I have to
refer, Mr. Chairman, to a clause which is
slightly ahead of the clause I am dealing
with-the work is to be under the control
of the Minister of Trade and Commerce.
Well, if the Minister of Trade and Commerce is competent to deal with what is
required under this measure, then I cannot
understand the position taken by the Government in connection with the Conservation Commission-that the Government had
no control over it. It was a very easy
thing for the Government to place it under
that Minister. You are now going to place
the Research Council under the wing of
the Minister of Trade and Commerce. I
do not know of any department where it

MAY 24. 1921
would be less likely to be properly looked
after. I thjnk that the Department of
Agriculture or sorne other departrnent dealing with the resources of this Dominion
would be a very rnuch better 'wing to place
it under. I would again ask honourable
gentlemen to consider carefully the inadvisability of passing clause 2, and- thereby
creating this Honorary Advisory Council;
and I move that it be struck out.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have no
desire to prevent research and scientific
work being gone on with. I say, however,
it should be taken up by the various departments, and this new expenditure should
not be incurred.

could easily ascertain what institutions are
deali-ng with the question, or it might refer
the question to one or more of the universities or other institutions and ask them
to conduct experirnents. Another question
that the Couneil might easily arrange to
-deal with is whèther or not the transportation of coal is not in many cases a great
mistake, and, whether it would not be
better to -save the money expended in sorting the coal when it cornes fromn the mines
and distribute it by generating electric
current.
I do not think that there is the slightest
necessity for overlapping because of the
creation of this Scientific Council. There
is only one man, and hie cannot overlap
very much. Hia great function would be to
unify the work that is going on in the country and to prevent o verlapping; and if
that were not to result, then the Minister
of Trade and Commerce would be accountable to, Parliament.

Hon. Mr. ROSS: I understandI that
quite welý.' Research work is being carried
on in sorne'of the departrnents; it is going
on at the experimental farm here, and at
stations scattered alI qver the country.
There is scientific work being carried on
in the schools of the provincial Governments; there is scientifie work .being carried on in the universities. I ,Vhink it is
desirable that there should be somne institution to sort of buckle these ail together,
so that if a farmer or a manufacturer haed
some problemn to meet he could write to a
certain place and know that the person in
charge of that place would be possessed of
practically aIl the knowledge up to date
in regard to the matter, and, if he could
not give himi the information, could refer
him to the proper place to get it.
As I understand this Scientific Council,
it can do two things: there ls scientific
research-and if you appoint a man who
is capable of carrying on scientific research,
I suppose thbre will be no objection to bis
carrying it on* purely in the interest of
science; then there is wbat is very important now, namely, the application of
science. I would suppose that the man i
charge would direct bis attention to this
and wouid get aIl these institutions to
work together. We have a great deal of
wood in this country, and it would be quite
interesting to know what proceas could be
devised for preserving it. Many attempta
have been made along this line, some of
thern fairly succeseful, and somie of tbemn
not successful. This Scientiffa Council

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: As to the overlapping, I may say that the first President
of the Conservation Commission, the, Hon.
Clifford Sifton, was a sort of Napoleon
wbo wanted to conquer the earth, and the
Governrnent liad no control over bim, and
he spread out and miade a large expenditure which was neyer contemplated, and
everyone was afraid to, say, "Hold on, Clîffor-d." That Commission was abolisfhed,
and the mater was put into the hands of
the Minister, and notbing was done without
sanction. This provision simply means
that the- Advisory Board will get no pay,
but that they will corne here four times a
year and will say, "We have discovered
this, and we advise you to look into that."
Sorne agricultural college will find that
a certain seed is better than another.
There is no duplication in that. It is to
prevent duplication that this *matter is
put into the hands of the Minister of
Trade and Commerce; also that these,
scientists will flot be making ali sorte of
research for their own glory. Representatives of tihe Bureau of Standards in
Washington were 4~p here last winter, with
regard to, a lignite proposition, to find
ont wbat we were doing. 'Washington is
not very far from here, and if tbey can
corne here, we could go there to, inquire
what they are doing. I do not think there
is any harrn in that.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I object to the
statement of the honourable gentleman
who bas just taken Mis seat (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain), that the Conservation Commis-

Hon, W. B. ROSS: I arn not in favour of
this motion. If you look at the situation
in Canada, I think you will find that there

SENATE

574

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Have we any
estimate as to what the initial expenditure
will be in connection with this Council under the proposed Act?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Two hundred
thousand dollars has been put in the Estimates.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU-GHEED: Any
estimate that has been made as to the
cost would be purely speculative, because
the organization has to be built up. The
expenditure cannot be very large in the
beginning; of course, it may become necessary to enter into considerable expenditure
in the carry.ing out of a constructive policy
in the way of buildings and so on; but we
are not doing anything of that kind at
the moment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It was in my
mind to suggest something very similar to
that suggested by the leader of the Opposition, namely, that the Deputy Ministers
or some other officers from each of the
Departments should have access to or should
even form part of this Council. I am
not one of those who are looking for a total
absence of duplication in research work.

sion went into increased expenditures one
after another. As I pointed out the other
day, there is no department in the Government whose expenditure has increased
as little in the last seven years as that of
the Conservation Commission. My honourable friend gets up and states that these
vast expenditures were on account of the
Commission branching out into this and
into that; but that .is not true, and it is
not fair to say that they did so.. The
Conservation Commission was not extravagant in that respect, and to my mind, in
doing away with the Conservation Commission and putting this Research Council into
power, you are just beginning an extravagant expenditure. In the case of the Conservation Commission every dollar expended was expended with the knowledge
and consent of the Government, for the
money had to be voted every year.
A few sections further on in this Bill
you will find that there is to be a great institute; and the first thing you know there
will be $1,000,000 expended on that institute. This is not a Bill for the conservation of the funds of the country; it is
a Bill that will result in all sorts of extravagance.

existence, it seems to me that the provisions of this Bill are nlot only justified
but necessary. Research work is a very
important thing in these days, and it is
being carried on in nearly every country
ail over the world, and grea~t resuits wil
flow frSm it. fn a couintry like ours
we cannot afford ta neglect any means of
becoming better acquainted with our resources and the possibilities which they
afford. I amn afraid that some honourable
gentlemen are now indulgîng in more or
less unnecessary criticism in advance of
what this Coùncil is going to do. I amn
strongly in faveur of the Council. At the
same time, I think we ought to see that
every effort is made to make the work
efficient.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Could the leader
of the Gavernment give the Committee
an idea of how much this Research Coun-cil has cost since it was inaugurated in
1917?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
Icannat.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Would my honourable friend get that information before
we- finally pass the Bill. A
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shaîl
be very glad' to niake the inquiry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a statement that goes to show that the cost in
1917-18 was $50,111.74; that in 1918-19 it
*as $51,151.52; that in 1919-20 it was
$99,872.42, and that for 1920-21 there !E
an approximate sum of $110,000 ta covez
their activities.
Thls infoi;mation was
secured from the Secretary cf the Research Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
I omitted ta mention to the House that this
Bill was the subject of a special Com-«
mittee of the Heuss of Commons. That
Committee made a very extended'inquiry
into the whole situation, wlth the resuit
that they reported in faveur of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Has the report
been distributed? I,haVe nlot seen it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
not seen the report myseif; but I understand
that ta be the case.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The question
of expense referred ta shows that the
expense of this Council Jumps up year by
year hy even greater leaps and bounds
than di4 thiat of the Conservation Commission; and I suppose it will continue ta
do so, Although I have made certain re-

57e

marks in reference to some sections of the
Bill I do not want it to be understood that
I am apposed to research work. 1 think we
require research work; but I am strongly
of opinion that it can be better carried on
by the variaus departments than by the
appointment of a separate institution such
as this, which must necessarily> incur a
considerable expense. When I moved that
clause 2 shauld be stricken out, 1 had
before me the Act, chapter 20, of 1917, and
it appears to me that the first eleven or
twelve sections of that Act are practically
the same as the Bill with which we are
dealing. My abject in moving ta strike out
the clause is this: that we strike aut the
ciause and then go an and repeal the Act:"
Han. Mr. BELCOURT: Has my honourable friend considered the passîbility of
niaking some provision in the Bill which
would prevent a Department from carrying on research work unless the work was
previausly approved or requested or
directed by the Council itself? If we could
devise some means whereby the work in
the departments would be subject ta the
direction of the Council, then probably we
might be able ta do away with ahl overlapping, and unnecessary or useless expenditure.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I wauld
commend my honourable friend's attention
ta section 10, which says:
From the money annuaily appropriated by

Parliamnent for the work of the Councjl, or
whtch the Coundil niay receive through request,
donation, or otherwlse, the Councl shall, subject ta the approval of the Minister. expend'
ail such sums as the Counchi deems necessary
for carrylng on its work.

The minister must necessarily keep in
touch with' the entire programn in ail its
parts that is being carried on by the
Research Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The niinister
could exercise his influence in order ta
prevent a duplication of work in the departmnents, or unnecessary expenditure.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Some
such clause as that suggested by xny honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Bostoclc)
might be adopted. I arn not prepared to
say what practical suggestion may be
crystallized into the Act, but I can realize
that it would be an advantage for the
Council to keep in touch with the permanent heads, that is, the Deputy Ministers,
in such departments as have ta deal with
subjects involved in scientific research.

The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot was negatived.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-appointment of Council:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would move that
in the 4th line of section 3, after the word
"1minister", the following words should. be
added:
and the Deputy Ministers of the Departmente
of Mines, Interior, Agriculture. Marine and
Fisheries, and Naval ýService, shali be ýx efficio
members of the Council.

1 think that covers ail the departments
interested in it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What about the
Air Force?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I thýink the Air
Force cornes under the Naval Service.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU;GHEED: That is
under Militia at the present tirne; but it is
rather peripatetic-it goes from one department to another.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should think
that the work of the Air Force is work
which the Research Council would have
to deal with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would object
to the Air Board rbeing included, because
I hope that before airother Session it will
be decided to abolish. the Air Board.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the Air Board
is going to be abolished, it will do no harm
to include it in the snean'time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would not
like to see it given such prominence by
including it with the .departments mentioned.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If we could
locate the Air Board in one of the departments, we need not worry. My honoifrable
friend would know what department it
was in.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
largely in the air and it is difficult to locate
it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we shahl
find that it is 1jargely in the estirnates,
when it cornes to the question of expenditure.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As it is
onhy one branch of a very large department, 1 doubt the wisdom of giving such
significance to it as to provide that it
should have a representative.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I agree with my
honourable friend. We ought to make sure
that the amendment includes ail the departments interested.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, only
the -departments that are -specifically mentioned; but I have no0 doubt that it will be
an easy matter for the Government to
direct the attention of the Counceil to any
subject, and the Council Will of course at
once gîve attention te it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We are leaving
out the Militia and putting in Naval Service. 1 do not quite see the logic of that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I put in Naval
Service because I thought that covered the
Air Board.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It does.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think it
does.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Why not include
Inland Revenue?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would make it top heavy.
Hon. Mr. WAT.SON: The Department
of Inland lkevenue is oqitted; but I would
point out that that is a department with
which the Research Council niight have n
great deal te do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is not that
department being merged ýinto the Customs?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have no objection
to having other departments added.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
might insert the words, " and any other
departments," enumerating the others, and
in that way ýgive authority to the Governor
in Council to include that.
Hn Mr. BOSTOCK: Would it net be
better to amend the motion to say: "the
Deputy Ministers of the Departments interested in research "?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Ail the departments whose work is germane to the objects
of the Bill.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: We ought to include
the Deputy Minister of Finance, because
he is the man who makes up the new taxes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 suggest, Mr.
Chairman, that we stop at the depart-nents
mentioned. When the Bill goes back to
the other Chamber, if the minister decides
to add other departments, he can do so.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why does not

the Minister of Trade and Commerce wants
to suggest an alteration, he will do so in
the House of Gommons. There is in this
amendment a clear indication of oui viow
that the interested Deputies sheuld be included.
Hon.- Mr. BELCOURT: The Gommons
will do what they like with the amondment
when thoy get it, but that does not-relieve
us of the obligation of dealing with it intelligently. I intend to move a second
amendment, unless my honourable leader

which provides that the members of the
Council shall hold office for a period of
three years and five members shall retire
each year?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Deputy Ministers will hold office, not as individuals,
but ex officio.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I am inclined to
think we ought to decide on the different
Departments to be represented by the
Deputy Ministers. If I have any objection
to this Bill, it is that the Minister of Trade
and Commerce has control of the whole
matter. I was in favour of the Conservation Commission because of its independence of Parliament and of the Government, and I think it has done excellent
work. If we know the Departments that
ought to be interested, we ought, in my
opinion, to mention the Deputy Ministers
of those Departments. I am not in favour
of inserting in the Bih a clause that would
extend the power of the Minister of Trade
and Commerce, as there are at the present
time a number of Deputies who are very
efficient, and I think we ought to name
them as members of the Council. I am inclined to think that the Deputy Minister of
Inland Revenue ought to be included, because in connection with the Inspection and
Sale Act and other statutes his Department
has a great deal of scientific work to do.
I would suggest that the name of the
Deputy Minister of Inland Revenue be
added to the names suggested by my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Bostock).
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Inland
Revenue is now combined with Customs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the Inland
Revenue to be merged this Session with the
Customs Department?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes;
there is a Bill for that purpose now before
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In order to meet
certain objections, I will word the amendment in this way:
The Council shall consist of not more than
fifteen members, who shall be appointed by the
Governor in. Council on the recommendation of
the Minister of Trade and Commerce, and in
addition the Deputy 'Ministers of such Departments as the Gdvernor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Trade and Commerce, may designate.

The amendment of Hon. Mr. Belcourt was
agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: With regard to subsection 2, there is no exception made in
Hon. Mr .DAVID.

subsection refers to ali the members of
the Council without exception.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We can make
an exception.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
subsection is ail right as it is.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I think something
should be said as to the time Deputy Ministers shall remain members of the Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend does not distinguish between the
Deputy Minister ex officio and the person
who happens to be occupying that office.
There will always be Deputy Ministers.
Section 3 as amended was agreed to.
Sections 4 to 7 inclusive were agreed to.
On section 8-remuneration:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What remuneration does the Chairman of the Council
receive at the present time?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The old
remuneration was $10,000 a year.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is it the intention to carry that on?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not prepared to say. In my judgment it
would not exceed that.
Hon. M. FOWLER: Will he be a technical man?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Presumably he will be.
Section 8 was agreed to.
On section 9-Council incorporated:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I want ta say
a word or two about clause 9. That clause
is not in the Act pf 1917 as it appears in
this Bill. You will observe that this section gives very large powers to the Council.
The Council is hereby constituted a body corporate, capable of suing and being sued, of
holding lands, tenements, etc.

Then it may receive gifts of money, and
may agree to the conditions upon which
such gifts are made.
The Council shall have power, with the aipproval of the Minister, to appoint such scientifie and technical officers as may be necessary
for the conduct of its business.

That is to say, they may appoint such
officers as they see fit. The only curb the
Government has on them is this provision:
and, subjeot to the approval of the Governor
in Council, to prescribe the remuneration to be
paid the same.

MAY 24, 1921
Yeu wiIl observe that the powers given
teS this Couneil are very extraordinary.
lUnder the authority of this section they
may, at any tinie they feel so disposed, ulose
down any work now being carried on by the
Government, without notice. and without
the case being given full consideration. We
knuw that there is a ýbranch of surveys in
which a considerable amount of money bas
been expended by the Government in thermometers and other scientific instruments.
The Governrnent has expended something
like $50,000 in the buildings and equipment
for that work. The niatter was pointed out
to the Research Council, and they paid no
attention to it. There are a set of officers
who have devoted a great deal of time and
attention to laboratory work. They have
un onganization that is equal te any' fore
this particular wSik. The Research Council, howeve-I do net know :for what
rea'son-declined to have anything to do
with it; and, unless we now make a stand
and say that they must take over that )particillar work, the $50,000 which bas been
expended by the dovernqment in connection
with it will sirnply -be scrapped. I do not
know exactlY what provision we can xnale
in the Bill; but 1 think we should make
it clear to 'the Council that, where moey
has 'been expended in experimental wark
and in the purchase of instruments aad
other equipment, it will be their duty ta
take the appL'ratus over and save this
money to -the country. Baut, as section 9

NIon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it'the intention of the Government ta let the publie
have free access to aIl the publications of
this Council? It seems ta me that they
should be available ta the public.
Hon. lkr. CASGRAIN: Does that not
corne under clause 14?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Immediately a report is laid on the Table of
Parliarnent it is within the authority of
Parlianient ta distribute it. That is the
way biuebooks are deahit with.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Are these not
intended for cammon use-for anyone who
rnay have an interest in the subjects deait
with? The rnethod mentioned by my honourable friend is a rather roundabout one,
and if you have te work 'until the report
is laid on the Table of the House or until
sarneane who bas access ta it gets it, it
takes a long time. If these publications
were issued as early as possible and as
freely as possible, their value would be
greater.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED: That
matter, I understand, is invariably controlled by the King's Printer. A publication is laid on the Table cf Parliarnent and
it gaes ta the Joint Printing Committee of
bath Houses, ami they order the printing
of the report and it then becomes accessiblé ta ail. The King's Printer selîs or distributes the report as Parliament miay determine. I think the machinery lu ample
for that.
Hon. 1fr. FOWLER: Should nat the
Council have power ta issue bulletins?
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I presume that they have.
-Non. Mfr. FOWLER: I do not see anything in the Bill giving them that power.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I arn
quîte *illing that my hanourable friend
should offer an amendment, specifically
mentioniag that matter.
Hon. Mr. FOWT.ER: I would say that
the Council shauld have power ta isdNie
bulletins relative ta their work from time
ta time ai considered necessary.
Hon., Mr. BEIiCOURT: If my honourable friend will look at the end of section
12, I think he will find that bulletins are

covered.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The old Geological
Survey and the Department of the Interior issued bulletins and reports as a
matter of course. In the Mines Branch
they have a library where you can get any
of the reports that are still in print. On
the payment of a very small fee ýyou can
get the reports of the department twenty
years back. It would not be necessary to
put anything into the Act.
-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: All
public printing is regulated now by the
Editorial Committee and the Ki.ng's
Printer.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think there is
probably sufficient machinery for the purpose.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The Natural Resources Committee used to issue reports
from time to time, and I think the reports
of this Research Committee would be more
valuable if we did not have to wait for
them to be laid on the Table of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I notice that a
statement of receipts and expenditures of
the Council is to be laid before Parliament within fifteen days after the opening; but when it comes to the reports, the
'Bill simply states that they are to be laid
before both Houses of Parliament.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: "Shall
be made by the Council to the Minister
after the close of each fiscal year."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOCK: That does not fix
any time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
parliamentary practice of placing the reports on the Table is very closely observed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I thought it was
usual to state that they should be laid
before Parliament within so many days of
the opendng of the next Session.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I have my amendment ready. It is that there shall be
added to section 12 the following:
The said Council shall have power to issue
bulletins from time to time relative to its work,
when, in its opinion, such are necessary in the
public interest.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The Minister is
given complete control of this matter. I
do not know whether it should be left in
the hands of the Minister.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He can
give a hint to the Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
the proposed 'amendment improves the

section at all. I think if my honourable
friend reads section 12 again he will find
that there is sufficient authority as it
stands.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Fowler was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think we should
insist that the words " at the next Session "
should be added after the words " Houses
of Parliament."
All
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
right.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Make it the same
as section 11, " within fifteen days from
its opening."
Section 12, amended as proposed by Hon.
Mr. Fowler, was agreed to.
On section 13, subsection 1-institute
created:
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Can the leader of
the Government say whether or not it is
the intention to put up a building? I have
heard it stated that it is the intention to
build an institute that would cost about
$600,000. Has my honourable friend any
information on that subject?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
understand that the Government is committed at the present time to the building of
such an institute. I have no doubt that in
the interest of the work which is about to
be carried on it will become necessary to
erect a laboratory or some kind of building
to afford every opportundty for the carrying on of the work.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Considering the
fact that a large number of officials of the
Militia Dèpartment and also of some of the
other branches have been dismissed and
that the Government has many buildings
rented in the city, it seems to me that the
Government would not be justified at the
present time in expending a large amount of
money to put up this building. When the
Government starts out to put up a building
for $600,000 you can bank that it is going

to cost $1,000,000 before it is completed.
Conditions are not so bright at present that
we should run into that expense. I do not
say that it is unnecessary, but it does seem
to me that we could get along very well
until we are in better financial condition.
I think the

plenty of room there, and it is a beautiful
building, and I think it would be a quite
suitable place for them.

MAY 24, 1921
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The difficulty
is that if haîf a million dollars or more is
to be expended on a building to house this
institute, the items- will reach this Chamber
in the annual Budget, and, unless we send
it to our Finance Committee, we mnay be
faced with the obligation of upsetting the
Government and the Budget at the saine

SENATE

friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will look
more closely, hie will find that Part 1 deals
with the creation of an organization.
And of a
Hon. Mr. DANDU1IAND:
corporate body.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, of
a corporate body. But it would surely be
unwise, and it would not appeal to the judgment of niy honourable frîend upon second
thought, if hie will be good enough to entertain it, for the Government to create this
organization and pay it, and have it do
nothing. Part I seems to provide for the
staff of workmen, and Part II to provide
the workshop in which they shall be
engaged. It is precisely the same organization, but Part Il niakes provision for the
actual work to be done.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It might be made
clear that the Chairnian, who is to receive
a salary of $10,000, shall also be the
Director.'
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is not clear
in the Bill. There are doubts as to that
point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In answer to
the statemient of my honourable friend that
the workshop is provided for in Part Il,
and that if we stopped at Part I the Council
would be without duties or instructions, I
wQuld draw his attention to section il of
the Bill.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Read sections 5 and
10.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Council,
once appointed, may decide that it does flot
need a special workshop under its control,
as the Workshops of the various universities are available to Wt; and if it should
so decide, so much the better for the finances of the country. It seems to me that
we ought to adhere to the idea of forming
this coxiporate body called the Council and
awaiting their action and their recommendations before launching upon that considerable expenditure which we would bie
calied upon to make under Part IL. For
this reason I move that Part II be struck
out of the Bill.
H1on. W. B. ROSS: Would flot the honourable gentleman move rather that it be
deferred?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Let it be
deferred. It can be deferred only by being
struck out. It is only a question of three
months or six months.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: If you rnove to strike
Wtout, that means that the thing is absoluteiy bad. If you move to defer it, that
means that, while it may 'be a good thing.
it is not quite opportune.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I wull
move that the consideration of Part II be
deferred.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend has not serioyusly considered the
matter or hie wou*ld not make such a proposition. Whatever may be said as to the
propriety or advisability of striking out or
deferring section 13, that cannot be applied
at ail to sections 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and
20, wh'ich are a(bsolutely essential incidents of the proiisions contained in Part I;
and Part I is not capable of being carried
out properly unless ail those sections are
adopted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Section

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No.

tails.

Those are de-

Hon Mr. BELýCOURT: Yes, but they are
details necessary to the operation of the
machinery under Part 1. I do not think
my honourable friend can be v'ery serious
about this. But what I want to draw my
honourabie friend's attention to is this,
that under section 13 there is to be a
director responsible for the carrying on of
the work. It is provided that hie shahl have
a salary, the amount of which is not stated.
Going back to Part I, you find that section
4 pro-vides for another officer, who shall be
the Chairman.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The same one.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why is it necessary to have a Chairman and a Director,
both of them paid? If you consuit section
8 you will see it provided that "no member
of the Council, with the exception of the
Chairman, shahl receive any pay'ment or
emolument for his services." So you are
going to have a high-ly paid Chairman, who
will do nothing but preside at meetings,
and, on the other hand, a highiy paid officer,
the Dîrector, who will do the work. I suggest that we amend section 4 by providing

MAY 24. 1921
that the Chairman of the Council shall be
the Director appointed under the provisions
of Part II.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then you would
have to change section 13, because it evidently was flot contemplated that the
Chairman and the Director shuuld be the
same persan. ýSubsection 3 of section 18
says:
He shall have the right to b. present aaid to
take part in the dWsussions, but without the
right ta vote, at ail meetings of the Cauncil.

That shows it is flot contemplated that
he shal 'be Chaï-rman.
Han. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course, the
change in section 4 might entail other
changes in the Bill, but il my honoureible
friend is prepared 'to adopt the suggestion,
we could go on and make such changes
as are necessary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is this ta be said about it, and I would ask
honourable gentlemen to consider it. The
Director must be a person fantiliar with
the carrying out of scientifie experiments
and that kimi of thing, and might be
totally 'unfitted to act as a Ohaiman.
There is thit point.ta ho considered. That
is ta say, lie mig'ht not be a business man

Iton. Mr. BELCOURT: I certainly hope
that the gentleman that is ta hae appointed
Director 'will b. able ta preside at a meeting.
If lie 'is fot ahle .to de that, 1 do flot think
much of the Director.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Welh,

Hlon. Mr. FOWLER: But you are going
to pay the Chairman $10,000, are you not?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We can pravide
that it esal be the same man.
Han. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have been
considering section 13 and section 9, and
it seems ta me that under section 13 you
are creating an entirely different Ïbody
from that created under PÉrt I of the
Bill. Why should tlhat be? We are going
ta have twa bodies instead, of one.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: A spiritual hbody
and a natural body.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is the
natural body that we want ta deal 'with
just at present.
Under. section 9 yau
constitute a 'body carparate, that is, the
Research Council. Then, under section 13:
There shall be establshed at or In the vicInlty of the c!ty af Ottawa a Natianal Research
Institute, hereinafter called the "Inatitut."

I take it that the Instîtute is ta, been
tirely different fron the Researchi Council. I may Ïb. nistaken, but I have followed the section through, and it seems ta,
me that we are really going ta have twcp
institutions on aur hands.

not s0 read sections 13 and 9. Then section 4 provides that one of the members
of the Council shall be Ohairman, and I
understand that the Chairman is ta give

salary. Under section 13 we have a

I do not intend ta take up any more
time in 'discussing this question, further
than ta say this, ti\at I want to make
it as clear as i can that, considering the
present financiai position of this country,
it is unwise and unfair to the public, particularly ta the soldiers and the widows
and orphans we have ta deai with, ta
spend anything làke a -million dollars, or
hall a million dollars, in creating an institute of this nature.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whether the honourable gentleman bas
heard my motion or not, 'but I have moved
that Part II be deferred. We shaîl have
created the Council, and the 'Council wili
organize and study the situation and see
to what extent Part II is needed. Under
Part II the country wouid be involved
in a very large expenditure on capital
account and a large expenditure in the
organization of a staff. There is no particular hurry. I am quite sure that the
Council will need a few months ta organize,
and we shahl have the advantage of their
suggestions alter they have organized and
have looked about to see ta what extent
they need Part II under which a speciai
workshop would 'be estabiished for them
in Ottawa. I will repeat what 1 said a
f ew moments ago: they mnay find that, because of the research departmnents in our
various universities, they can defer the
organization of such an Institute. That
is the reason why I have moved that
Part II be deferred.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Deferred until when? That dýoes flot mean
anything. You might as well move ta strike
it ýail out as move ta defer it.
Hon W. B. ROSS: I was going ta niake
this suggestion ta miy honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I think myself
that the hionourabie gentleman's motion bas
some menit. The financial condition of this
country is none too good. I do not know
that it is wise ta rush into a large expenditure 110w. At any rate, whether you do
authorize it or not, it is wise t, 'have your
plans well laid. I would suggest ta my
honourahie friend that he move that Part
II shoiild not came into aperation until it
is prýcIaimed by the Governor in Counecil.
Sucb an amendment would flot mangle the

tion, with ail the advantages that would be
derived from the advice of, the Council
established 'under Part I; and if financial
or other reasons make it inadvisable ta
bring Part II into force, it need not be
brought into force at ail. But it will be
there a year from now, whatever Government may be in power.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I inform
honourable gentlemen that severai new and
important things are now being awailed:
It would take too long ta enumerate them.
I have been so informed hy gentlemen who
are 110w engaged in research, and whose
namnes I could mention. They are anxious
ta get this matter settled.* The oid Research
Committee is aboiished and has no0 longer
any power, and until you create something
in its stead, or provide some new maohinery,
or designate some departmnent ta carry on,
nothing further can be done. It appears
that those gentlemen are anxious ta have
this legislation passed, in order ta permit
of certain things being done that will be
of benefit to the public of this country.
Hon Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 would point out
ta my honourabie friend that the Act of
1917 is stili on the statute book, and until
this Bill goes through the Reseiarch Council
established under the Act of 1917 remains
in existence. The difference between. the
honourable member from Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross) and the honourabie gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
as 1 see it, is that the honourable xnember
fromn De Lorimier would, by his motion,
leave it in the hands of Parliament ta
amend the legisiation later on.
H-on.,Mr. DANDURAND:

Or add to it.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOýCK: Or add ta it, if
-addition were shown ta be necessary; but
my honourable friend fromn Middleton
would leave it to the Governor in Council
ta determine whether this Institute shouid,
be estab.lished or flot.
1 do -not think that any hourýable gentleman in this House wants ta prevent praper
scientific research being carried on, if it
is an ýadvantage ta the country. At the
saine time, as bhas already been said more
than once, the finances of this country are
in such a state that we do flot feel justified
in agreeing ta such an expenditure as this
Bill may entail ta the country at the present time. We do flot feel that such a large
expenditure should be incurred untiI the
finances and generail conditions of the
5ountry are in much better condition than
at present.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I should like to get

Hon. Mr. ROSS: If the G«vernment

My honourable friend's, voice carried to

evey tcorner of the Chamber. He has
drawn attention to the fact that if we

"We want a building." AIl right; a building will go up. Then they wlll s'ay, "We
want instruments." If honourable gentlemen di; not kncw the cost of the instruments in the mechanical and physical and
cheinistry departments of a well-equipped
university, such as McGill or Toronto, I
suggest that they will be simply stunned
when they learn of the millions that would
be required to establish such an institution as that proposed. And how can you
think of gathering savants, experts, men
of science, without giving themn tools? The
first thing they will want is something
with which tu work. We have those things
already. They have been provided for out
of private gifts front wealthy people
throughout the country, and it seems tu
me that if the scientific gentlemen were
left under the first part of this Bill to
organize as a Council, and then saw the
fields they had to cover, and pondered over
the financial situation, they could not corne
to any other conclusion than the conclusion that we have corne to in this Chamber, that we cannot afford to go blindly
into such. tremendous expenditure, and
,would say: "We wiIl work with whatever

LAKE 0F THE WOODS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill A6, an Act
respecting the Lake of the Woods and
other Waters.

;88

SENATE

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a Bill growing out of certain legislation
already brought down this Session, but
which, owing to an understanding with
the Ontario Government, did not become
effective.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Did the other
Bill pass?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
other Bill passed, but it did not become
law because of an understanding with the
Ontario Government that they were to
pass similar legislation.
They did not
pass that legislation; consequently the
other Bill fell to the ground.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It was not assented to?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
The object of this Bill, honourable gentlemen, is to give effect to practically the
same legislation that .was embodied in the
Bill to which I have referred. It may go
to some further extent.
As I pointed out on the introduction of
that legislation, it was the outcome of a
recommendation made by the International
Joint Commission that Canada should appoint a commission to exercise powers of
regulation over the flowage of the Lake of
the Woods. There bas been a Board, in
fact, it is still in existence, which represents
the Government of Ontario as well as the
Federal Government. That Board exercises certain powers by virtue of Orders
in Council which have been passed by both
of those Governments. But it is desirable
that greater powers than those contained
in the Orders in Council should be exercised-powers which must necessarily flow
from Parliament itself.
This Bill makes provision for the regulation by the Board of the flowage of those
waters to which I have referred. That is
to say, it is proposed under the Bill to give
certain authority to the Board contemplated
under the Act as a Board representative
of the province of Ontario, and representative of this Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Is that the
same Board that was appointed before?

the fact that certain works have been
established in those waters, the control of
which will be necessary for the protection
of the interests which are involved.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is a
Board that has been acting and that was
appointed previous to the legislation to
which I refer.
Probably the first important provision in
the Bill is one declaring that certain works
are for the general advantage of Canada.
Honourable gentlemen will doubtless recall

plies the great industrial plants of that
province from the waters of the Winnipeg
river. It is ncessary for the purpose of
protecting the waters of that river, as well
as other waters on that watershed, that
the Government should exercise this power;
and it is with that in view that this legislation is being introduced.

Hon. sir J

S LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I see that the
other Bill was assented to and sanctioned
on the 3rd of May.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If it
was assented to, it would be abortive on
account of the legislation, as recited in
the Bill, not having been passed by the
Legislature of Ontario.
Hon. Mr.. BELCOURT: Was there a
provision which made the Bill dependent
on concurrent legislation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
It contemplated and made provision for a
joint Board, two of the members of which
were to be selected by the Ontario Government, and two by this Government. The
Ontario Government, owing to its peculiar
situation and because of there being two
opposing parties in the legislature, was
not able to pass the legislation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is to prevent the Ontario Legislature from passing
that legislation at the next Session?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
anticipated in this Bill. There is provision
in this Bill that, upon the passing of that
or similar legislation by the Ontario
Legislature, this Bill shall be repealed or
suspended as the Governor in Council may
determine.
I was about to say that there are certain
works that have been established in the
waters that I have mentioned-such works
as dams and other structures of that
description, which will come within clause
2 of the Bill. Upon their being declared
to be works for the general advantage of
Canada, the Board will be authorized to
regulate those works. When my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) rose in his place, I think I was
about to say that very important power
interests have been created on the Winnipeg river in the province of Manitoba.
The city of Winnipeg and other points in
Manitoba derive their power which sup-

MAY 24. 1921
I may say that the Government of the
province ef Ontario has expressed its entire sympathy with the object which the
previous Bill had in view, but, owing to
the peculiar situation of the political
parties in the Ontario Legislature, it bas
not been possible apparently to give effeet
to the legisiation which had been agreed
upon between the two Governments.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Does the Ontario
Government deny the jurisdiction of the
Federal Parlianient?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no,
there is. no denial of power. I Vhink the
respective rights of both Governnxents are
very clearly defined by the British North
America Act, and there is no confiiet as
between the Governments.
This Government is clearly entitled to legisiate as to
navigation upon those streams. The Ontario Government dlaims, and the dlaim
has flot been contested so far as
I
t.hat it bas the right to legisiate know,
as to
power. But, as niy honourable friend will
see, the construction of dams and other
works in those waters at once interferes
with the right of the Federal Governnient
to control navigation; consequently this
Government Is only exercising the right
which is admittedly vested in it when it
declares these works to, be works for the
general advantage of Canada, and undertakes the control of works established in'
those waters which impede navigation. We
ask that those works be declared tobe for
the general advantage of Canada, s0 that
the Government of 'Canada may properly
proteet its' rights in maintaining navigation in those waters.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Are there any
provincial rights, invoIved in regard to
fishing?
Hlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No such
question a1Èose.
Under the Navigable
Waters Protection Act power is vested in
the Government to, deal, by> removal or
otherwise, with structures whidi have been
erecte-d In* navigable waters and which
may impede navigation. But under the
British North America Act any declaration of this kind will bring such works
within the jurisdiction of this Government. Honourable gentlemen mig'ht refer
to section 92 of the British North America
Act.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I do not admit that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend will admit the British
North America Act, I suppose.

589

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Oh, yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Even
from my honourable friend that is a
favourable admission, and it gives one a
certain aniount of confidence in proceeding
with the argument.- Under subsection 10
of section 92 of the British North America
Act, the foliowing works are excluded froni
the authority of thé provincial Government-a and b deal wi.th steamship and
.steani railways and so on, and c says:
*Such works as, although wholly g1tuate withIn the province, are before or after their
execution declared by the Parliament of Cannada to be for the general advantage of Canada
or for the advantage of two or more of the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Some years ago I
moved a resolution, in this House, which
was carried with only one dissenting voice,
stating that to declare a work te, be to the
general advantage of Canada would not
be sufficient te give jurisdiction to the
Federal Parliament, but that it was necessary also to prove that the statement was
true, because otherwise it would be very
easyto make such a declaration.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What. was the
necessity for concurrent legislation? As I
understand it, the section of the British
North America Act upon which this legislation is founded gives the exclusive right
to the Federal autherities to ileal with
questions of navigation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
very advisable that the two Governments
should ooperate in carrying outregulations affecting the flowage, of water in
the 'Lake of the Woods. The Ontario Government was interested in the powers; this
Government was interested in -navigation.
The question of whère the one began anid
the other ended niight possibly create a
conflict. There were certain works constructed in these waters whieh by joint regù.lation would be advantageous to both
Governments; and it was antici.pated that
by joint! legisiation we miglit avoid any
thing like a conflict between them. No
confiet lias arisen lup to the p*sent time.
In fact, the waters in. question are being
regilated to-diay by the Board whieh represents both 'Governments, and which was
appointed under an Order in Council passed
hy both' Governments. But it is desirable
that the üaatter should be placed upon a
firmer footing -than Orders in, Council or
the suffera*le of either Government, and
thereforer it has been redueed to legisiation so that we may deal with questions
that -may shortly hecome acute.

390

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Has this Bill received the approval of the Premier of
Ontario?
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUET: Then how can
we be quite sure that we are not going to
infringe on some of the rights of the province?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We
must take our chances as to that. I may
say that we have had conferences between
representatives of the Government of
Manitoba, of the Ontario Government, and
of the Federal Government, touching this
Bilil; the three Governments heing united in
the carrying out of the common purpose
which they all have in view.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Inasmuch as this
Bill deals with waters which have their
source in Ontario and find their way into
lake Winnipeg, I presume that the works
referred to affect the waters to a certain
extent; and I suppose that to that extent
both provinces are interested in it. As far
as I understood my honourable friend, he
did not give that as a reason why we should
assume this power under section 92 of the
British North America Act. But it would
rather appear to me that that is one reason
why we are entitled to deal with this question in this way. It does seem rather
curious that we should be dealing with this
legislation Ln this form at the present time
inasmuch as we put through a Bill at the
beginning of the Session dealing with practically the same legislation. But inasmuch
as the province of Ontario did not follow up
our legislation in the way that we expected,
we are now asked to deal with this Bill.
I am not going to oppose the principle
of the Bill, but I want to draw my honourable friend's attention to one particular
'item. In clause 3 of the Bill the following
words are used:
and so that the obligations, relating to the
level of the Lake of the Woods, of Canada, or
of any of the provinces of Canada, as part of
the British Empire, towards the United States,
arising out of treaty made or to be made between the Empire and the United States, may
be duly performed.

This is the first time, as far as I know,
that the words "British Empire" have
been used in an official way in this manner.
We have been in the habit of talking of the
British Empire in a general way, and
honourable gentlemen have been left to put
their own interpretation on the words. But
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

in this case apparently we are going to use
the words in legislation, and it is quite a
new departure. I think that if we can find
some other term that will express the same
idea, we should do so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is a
very good term.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend says it is a very good term, but
it will need to be defined, because one construction put upon the word " Empire "
in a very good encyclopædia is that it comprises perforce dominant power and anterior power. I thought yesterday when
I saw my honourable friend regulating the
northern unorganized portions of Canada
that we were working towards the creation
of colonies under the Empire of Canada,
and that we were ourselves moving towards becoming a dominant power with
satellites around us.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We moved towards
the dominant power in 1914.
I had ocHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
casion in this Chamber some time ago ta
state that we 'bave been moving towards
self-government more and more; and my
honourable friend the leader of the Government saw the day when we 'would arise
as a power by ourselves, imposing our
laws upon colondes in the North. But
I did not rise to discuss that portion of the
Bill, but simply to ask my honourable
friend if this Bill, which I have not had
time to peruse, is in the form of an amendment to the Act which was passed and
sanctioned lately.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. -DANDURAND: To what extent does it differ from the other Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It
practically repeats the provisions of the
Act, but it introduces the necessary machinery iby which the Federal Government
may carry out the regulations in question
without the action of the Ontario Government, and providing at the same -time
that as soon as the Ontario 'Governinent
shall give effect to the legislation which
we discussed, 'but which proved abortive,
we may repeal or suspend this Act.

LAKE 0F THE WOODS BILL
CONSIDERnED IN'COMMI'ITE ANI
REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Comniittee on Bill
A6, an Act respecting the Lake of the
Woods and other Waters. Rôn Mr. Daniel
in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2 -4eclaration that certain
works are fer the general advantage of
Canada:
Hon. Mr., BOSTOCK: Are the works
that it is proposed to deal with already
constructed?
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK ý The idea is that
the Government will take charge of theïm
to control thé waters.

591

Hon. Sir JAMES>LOUGHEED: Yes, so
far as they may affect navigation.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3., subsection 1-regulations:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I thin< there is
aprinter's error in the second uine there.
The word "made" should be "make."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Paragraph a of subs ection 1 was agreed
to.
On paragraph b-Lake of the Woods out-'
flow and level:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like my
honourable friend to explain the wording
of that clause. As I stated yesterday, I
do not think we can use the words "as part
of the British Empire," commencing in the
8th line. 1 presume the proper designation
would be "of the British Dominions, beyond
the seas."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
term 15 not constitutionally known; the
term "British Em~pire" is. This has relation to what is practically an Imperial
treaty; a treaty between the Empire and
the United States relating to certain waters
in Canada. That is the reason the words
"British Empire" are used to establish the
connection between the treaty and Canada.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I am afraid I do
not quite agree with my honourable friend
in that interpretation, because we can only
go back to the titie the King bears at the
present timne. It is, "His Most Excellent
Majesty George the Fifth, by the Grace of
God, King of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, and of the British Dominians beyond the Seits, Defender
Of the Faith, Emperor of India." If we
talk of the British Empire, the King would
have to be the Eniperor.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: Well,
we will accept a suggestion.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would suggest
the words "'as part of the British Dominions beyond the Seas."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps it would
be more accurate to say, "of the United
Kingdom ,and."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK; I will write out
an amendmnent and submit it.
Paragrapli b, stands.
Paragraph c was, agreed to.
Subsections 2 and 3 of section 1 were
agreed te.

SENATE
Sections 4 to 7. inclusive, were agreed
to.
On section 8-expense of administration:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
not the intention to pass that clause. That
can be inserted in the Commons. That ha!
to do with the money provision.
Section 9 was agreed to.
On section 10-provision for repeal by
Governor in Council if Ontario passes legislation referred to in the previous Act of
this Session:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the Act
which we passed. and which was sanctioned
was there a declaration that these worKs
were for the general advantage of Canada?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; because the Ontario Government could not
assent to that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I notice that
there is no time limit for the legislation by
Ontario. Is that intended?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, it
is intended, because Ontario at any time
may ,pass the Bill which was agreed upon,
and immediately that Bill is passed we undertake to repeal or suspend the operatiin
of this Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It does not matter how late it may be-whether in ten,
fifteen, or twenty-five years?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
not anticipated a delay of that kind; and
of course any Government is at liberty
hereafter torepeal the Act if it is found
to be oppressive.
Section 10 was agreed to.
On section 3, subsection 1, paragraph b
-Lake of the Woods outflow and level:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I will read
paragraph b as amended:
To regulate and control the outflow of the
waters of the Lake of the Woods so as to maintain the level of the said lake between the
elevations recommended by the report of the International Joint Commission of 12th June,
1917. or between such elevations as may be
agreed upon by the United States and Canada,
and so that the obligations relat-ing to the level
of the LIake of the Woods, of Canada, or of any
of the provinces of Canada, as part of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, towards the
United States, arising out of treaty made or
to be made between His Majesty the King of
the Un'ited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the British Dominions beyond the
Seas, Emperor of India, and the United 1States,
may be duly performed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to know
why you have those two words, "of Canada"
after the words, "Lake of the Woods," in
line 7.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The words "of
Canada" are connected with the word
"obligations." It is the obligations relating
to the level of the Lake of the Woods.
Paragraph b of subsection 1 of section 3,
as amended, was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill, as amended, was reported.
THIRD READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the third reading of the Bill.
,The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) had a motion to present.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, when the Committee rose and
reported progress last evening we had
reached Part II of the Bill which is now
under discussion. I will repeat in a few
,words how 'the matter stood, for the information of those honourable members of
the House who were not present yesterday
afternoon. When the House adjourned we
had passed Part I. That first part creates
a National Council of Research, to replace
the Conservation Commission, which has
been abolished. I have claimed that this
first part is complete in itself, and that the
powers given to that Council would enable
them to function. Clause 5 of Part I
says:
The Council shall have charge of all matters
affecting soientific and industrial research in
Canada which may be assigned to it by the
Minister, and shall also have the duty of advising the Minister on questions of scientiflc and
technological methods affecting the expansion
of Canadian industries or the utilization of the
natural resources of Canada.

If honourable gentlemen will look at
section 9, they will see that the Council,
according to the latter part of the clause,
'"shall have power, with the approval of the
Minister, to appoint such scientific and

MAY 25, 1921
technical officers as may be necessary for
the conduct of its business, and, subject
to the approval of the Governor in Council, to prescribe the remuneration to be paid
the samne."
This Council will be composed of fifteen
members, who shall be appointed by the
Governor 'in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Trade and Commerce, and we have amended the clause by
adding that the Minister of Trade and Com,ierce may also select and appoint a certain number of Deputy Ministers, the in-'
tention of this Chamber being that these
Deputy Ministers shall be selected froin
among the Departments that 'have been
carrying on research work and are interested in it.
We are now coming to Part II, which
bas for its purpose the creation of a Research Institute. Section 13 reads jas follows:i
There shall be established at or in the vicinIty of the city of ýOttawa a National Research
Institute, hereinafter called the "Institute". The
staff of the Institute shall consist of a Director
and such scientifie and teclinical and other officers, clerke and emPloyees as may be necessary
for carrying on the work of the 1natitute. SubJect to the approval of the Governor In Council.
the Director and other scientifle and techuLcal
officers shall be appointed by the Counoil, which
subWet to the same approval shall aie prescribe their several duties, remuneration and

tenure of office.
The duties of the Institute are defined in'
section 14.
I have moved, and 1 repeat my motion,
that Part II be deferred; that for the
present Session we limit this Bill to Fart
I. in order that the Council may organizç
and map out a programme to be laid.before
Parliament, before we take the further step
of allowing them to create an Institute;
because if we do so without having a welldefined programme before us, this Council
may decide-of course, always with the approbation of the Governor in Council and of
Parliament, at whose door they will knock
for supply-to organize a staff, purchase
land in the vicinity of Ottawa, and proceed
-with plans to erect a large building; but
when they have done that, they will still be
only at the beginning of the expenditure.
One of my honourable colleagues said: "We
ouglit not to defer'Part II, as there are
already in Ottawa professors from McGili
University awaiting the passage of this
Bill." If they are aiready here, if there
are technical expertà, engineers, and scientiflo men awaiting the passage of this Bill,
how far advanced will they be when we
'have spent hundreda of thousands of dollars
on a building, and the building is. empty?
S-38

The next step will be for. those gentlemen
to ask for tools with which to work. And
what are those tools? They are the laboratories. There are abready costly laboratories, already equipped-though, it is said,
laboratories are neyer complete-tn lie
found in the large universities of Canada.
I will simply mention at the moment those
of Toronto and Montreal. If the scientific
men are already here, ready to accept a
mandate tram the Council to undertake research work, how long will they have to
wait before we have equipped the building
so that it will be on a par with those of
the universities I have mentioned? Will
flot these gentlemen, who will be engaged
here as experts, return to the large universities and utilize in their laboratories, for
a number of years to come, until we have
spent millions of dollars equipping this Institute, the instruments with which to pursue theii, work?
My suggestion is that we suspend Part
Il until the Council forined under Part I
has prepared a programme and laid it before us. You will, I am sure, recognize that
our Départment of Agriculture, at the Experimental'Firm, is already equipped for
considerable research work, and that many
other Departments have already their research laboratories and instruments withi
which to -carry on research work. We shail
he able to take stock of what we now have.
We may decide not to proceed with the
equipment of laboratories such as those of
Toronto andf McGill Universities, which
have cost millions ol dollars. I know something about the anatter, because I happen to
be connected with a university which is now
organizing its laboratory, and I know how
little a few hundred thousand dollars will
'bring in the establishment and equipment of
a laboratory. So it seems to me that in the
present condition o! our finances we should
pause before taking that seçond step
of establishing what my honourable
has
Lougheed)
James
(Sir
friend
described, as the workshop of this
Institute. I am quite sure that those men
will find that they may get along without
providing for the Institute equipment such
as that wvhich is to be found within the
walls o! our universities. Therefore, feeling that in the present condition o! aur
finances we must be prudent in opening up
new avenues of large expenlilture, I anove
that Part II be deferred and left out o!
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-.STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I am always in favour

covering the secrets of nature; but I entirely agree with the last speaker that this
is not a time for us to plunge into limitless
expenditure. We -know that the cost of
building material, and of all other material
and labour, is now more than double what
it was a few years ago. For instance, I
see by an answer given in the House of
Commons the other night that a piece of
road between Hamilton and Dundas bas
cost about $87,000 a mile. Yet, in my
belief, it is the cheapest and easiest piece
of construction that we could have on any
road in Canada; and there is not a bridge
or a culvert on it.
Now, when one sees what staggering
proportions public expenditures can reach,
I do submit that we should not at this
time go into this matter without knowing
in detail what the expenditure may
amount to. It seems to me that if this
Advisory Council is of any use it ean take
advantage of the investigations which
have been made by the country to the south
of -us, and by other countries in the world;
it can ascertain what their work has resulted in, and bring us the results. American Institutes of a similar nature can find
out anything that we might discover in the
next few years, and we will always be able
to take advantage of their work. I do not
think there is such a terribly pressing
necessity for this proposed Institute that
we should gaily walk into a new avenue
of expenditure, of which not a man in this
House knows the limit, at a time of
staggering taxes, and when the Minister
of Finance is at his wits' end to find money
enough to make both ends meet. I submit
it would be a most wise thing for us to stop
at Part II,' and allow that part to be
brought out when éonditions are more
normal, and when we have before us some
knowledge of what this Institute involves.
We know- no more what this expenditure
may amount to than we knew what the
Great War would cost when we went into
it; and as a matter of ordinary business
prudence I think we should hesitate before
giving carte blanche for the establishment
of an Institute of this kind.
Hon. Mr. MILNE: I was on the first
royal commission which 'Sir James Whitney formed to secure information on
Hydro-power matters for the Ontario Government. It took us two years to get that
information. Mr. Cecil B. Smith, a brother
of one of our Senators, was our engineer,
and Messrs. Beck, Patterson, and myself
were the commissioners. We had no reHon. Mr. LYNCH.SrrAUNTON.

muneration whatever for our services, and
were paid only our expenses when we
travelled; it was a matter of benefiting
the country at large.
We procured all
this information for the Government,
which was published in five pamphlets,
but we were as careful as posible in our
outlay. We rented an. office in Toronto
where we had a small staff. We met every
week, and took as much care of financial
matters as possible, not going into any expense unless we were sure it was necessary. We went thoroughly into all questions. When we visited Hamilton the
Cataract Power Company would not give
us the information that we desired, and on
our return to the hotel I suggested that we
should send our accountant ovér to their
office and see what he could do. The result
was that we procured the information that
we needed. If that company had persisted
in refusing it we would have taken their
officials to court and exposed the whole
matter, as it was well known that they
were getting a big price for all the electrical energy they were supplying.
In regard to the subject before us, I do
not think that at this particular time,
when we are taxed up to the handle, one
tax being piled upon another, we should
undertake to expend this enormous amount
of money without getting some returns;
especially when we do not know anything
about this matter. I feel justified in saying that we should not spend the large
amount required by the Research Council
to put up buildings, purchase equipment,
and all that sort of thing. Let the Council rent buildings and keep expenses down.
They ought to be able to get men enough
to do that work without paying them any
salaries. I would like to support this Government, but I think we are setting up too
many commissions of different kinds, with
big salaries for the commissioners.
I
think it is time we stopped all that, and
became a little more careful of what we
were doing, because we aré the people who
have to pay the shot.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I should be very
sorry if, because I vote in any particular
way in this matter, it were understood
that I did not have the deepest sympathy
with the patriotic desire that this country
should acquire all the first-hand information possible with regard to research and
matters connected with the undeveloped resources of our country. I understand, as
this legislation stands now, that the first

My memory serves me correctly, and I
think it dbes, I have noticed in the press
of this country for a great mgny years
appeals to the Federal Government for the
establishment of Research Councils and
laboratories, so that we in this country
might have the opportunity of making original research on our own account. Germany owes perhaps more to its scientific
research in industry in its various ramifications than to, any other source for the
great strides which it has been making for
the last twenty or more years in carrying
-on and en]arging its business and developing its natural resources in every respect.
The great success which, as everyone must
acknowledge, bas attended ail the business
operations of Germany .in late years is,
I tbink, due to the great extent to whicb
the Government of the country have encouraged technical education from the
lower grades up to the most advanced
scientiflc research.
They havei made a
great country of Germany, which is really,
as I understand, not an inventive country,
but one that takes advantage in every
way of the inventions which bave been
made in other countries, and makes better
use of tbem, especially for its own people.
Under these circumistances I sbould be
very sorry to find that Part Il of this
Bill was to be taken out, because I believe
that a Researcb Council, with laboratories
and that sort of tbing, is what is very mucb
needed in tbis country, so that Canada
may bave an opportunity of making original researches, wbicb, in my opinion, are
necessary for the wellbeing and improvement of this country. It is true, we bave
certain laboratories in connection 'witb
some of the universities; but they have
their own courses to pursue. I am n ot personally acquainted with them and do flot
know to what extent research is carried on
in those institutions. However, I am absolutely in unison with the idea of estabIisbing a Research Council for Canada,
under whicb we can bave a bureau of
original research that wi'il belp us in developing our resources as thiey need bie
developed. I hope that the motion to, strike
out Part II wilI flot be carried.

59,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The honourable
gentleman bas addressed the House as if
we were doing away with tbe Research
Council. We are flot doing away with the
Council. It can carry on its work after
we have cut out clauses 13 to 19, inclusive,
just as the Council has done in the last
tbree years. Any honourable gentlemen
wbo bave read the report of the Research
Council will realize that they are doing
considerable work, and good work, in the
country. At the same time, as I have
pointed out bere before, a great deal of
overlapping bas taken place between the
work they are doing and the work of the
other Departments. As was pointed out
yesterday, certain Departments are carrying on research. By reason of the amendment which we bave made to Part I of
thsl Bill, the Research Council will be in
a better position to co-ordinate this work
and prevent overlapping.
I do not tbink that honourable members
would bave expressed their antagonism to,
Part II of tliis measure hadl the finances
of Canada been in a better condition than
tbey are to-day; but many hontourable
gentlemen in this House feel that, in view
of the enormous expenditures that we are
asked to provide for at the present time,
and the fact that we shaîl have to find
some means to borrc'w money to meet the
expenditure in connection with thé railways and other expenditures, and owing
to, the present uncertainty of what the
railway expenditure will anicunt to, no
great harm will be done the country by our
striking out Part II of this Bill and to, that
extent preventing for the present what
may involve a very large outlay. Later
on, 'wben the finances of the country are in
better condition, we shail be well able to
reconsider this matter, and in the meantime tbe Research Council wihl, I think,
have- been able to look over the ground
mucb more thoroughily and arrange more
satisfa>ctorily to prevent overlapping between the work cf the Research Council
and that of the. Departnients.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, as a rule I am pleased to agree with
tbe honourable leader of the Hlouse; but I
regret to say that on the present occasion
I do not feel able to do that with a clear
conscience. We in this House are supposed to, have consciences, and we sho'aid
be governed by theni.
The honourable
leader of the House *made it perfectly
clear a few days ago, when we were repealing the Act with respect to the Conservation Commission, that that Commis-

598

SENATE

sion was no longer necessary-that it was
a sort of fifth ýwheel to the parliamentary
coach. He pointed out that it was not
necessary now because, for one thing, the
work done by the Conservation Commission
could be taken over by the various Departments of the Government-that there were
quite enough departments to take over
that work. I think the honourable leader
of the Government was correct in that
contention. Even though we all felt that
the Conservation Commission had done a
great deal of valuable work, still when the
Government pleaded poverty and the necessity for economy, we gave way.
What do I find to-day? This same Government, which the other day repealed the
law respecting the Conservation Commission because it involved the continuance of
expenditure for staff, etc., are now proposing what is in my humble opinion
simply the Conservation Commission in
another form. The old Conservation Commission is admitted by all parties to have
donc its work well.
The question is
whether the body which is supposed to be
substituted for that Commission will do
the work nearly as well.
Clause 13 starts out to establish a National Research Institute. This clause does
no state that the staff, or certain members
of the staff, of the Commission of Conservation shall be taken over into this National Research Institute. It says:
The staff of the Institute shall consist of a
director and such scientific and technical and
other officers, clerks, and employees as may be
necessary for carrying on the work of the Institute.

Is not that simply duplicating substantially the language used when the Conservation Commission was created? We abolish
the Commission to-day, and to-morrow we
start it up again. Then:
Subject to the approval of the Governor in
Council, the Director and other scientifie and
technical officers shal be appoi.nted by the
Council-

Not

absorbed,

as

we were

told they

would be. They are to be independent appointments-

-which,
subject to the same approval, shall
also prescribe their several duties, remuneration, and tenure of office.
(2) The control and direction of the work
of the Institute shall be exercised by the Council through the Director.

The Director of this new Institute, I
assume, will take substantially the same
position as was taken by the director in
the Conservation Commission, Mr. Whie,
a most capable and thoroughly reliable officer.
Hon. Mr. POWER.

What I object to is that we should one
day abolish an institution and the next day
provi.de for the establishment of the same
institution under another name. We know
that the institution as we have had it has
done its work in a very satisfactory way.
We cannot say the same about this new
institution. The probabilities are that it
will not do its work at all as well as the
old one. For that reason, while, as I say,
I would like to follow the honourable leader
of the House as far as my conscience will
allow, in the present instance conscience
swings me to the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I regret very much that
owing to the sensitive nature of my honourable friend's conscience he cannot see
his way on this -occasion to support the
measure which I have the honour of sponsoring in this House.
It seems to me that this Bill is riding
on an adverse current.
The .wave that
swept the Judges Bill from its moorings
seems to be washing over this Bill, threatening it in the same way that the other was
threatened;-or it is possible that I made
too good a case for the wiping out of the
Conservation Commission.
The reasons
still linger for the destruction of this
measure.
I am not going to weary the House by
advancing further reasons for the passage
of the Bill, because I went into that question rather lengthily yesterday; but I would
point out to honourable gentlemen that in
my humble judgment they are largely dealing with an illusion in thinking that the
eliýmination of Part II would result in the
withholding of authority on the part of
the Government to go ahead with Part I.
In the first place, Part II gives no authority to the Council to proceed with the expenditure of money. The appropriation of
any money has to be voted in the House
of Commons, and I fancy that no honourable gentleman would take the position that
the Government would be prevented from
introducing a resolution or placing an item
in the Estimates for the purpose of carrying qut the objects say of Part I. Consequently Part Il is in a sense superfluous,
so far as concerns the authorizing of Parliament to vote money for this particular
purpose. The object of Part II is, moce
than anything else, to outline an institution which will define to some extent the
purposes in view in the enactment of this
legislation.

MAY 25, 1921
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But mry hon-'
ourable friend will see in the first Uine of
section 13 a very direct mandate.
Hon. Sir JAMES'LOUGHEED: "There
shall be esthablished"; but it does not say
"6at once." That mandate would not necessarily impel the Governrnent to place an
arnount in the Estirnates at the present
Session for the purpose of proceeding with
this work; although, f arn bound to say,
the Governrnent bas had in view proceeding
with this undertaking, and I think provision is being made in the Estirnates for a
beginning of the Institute.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The Dircêtor's
salary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
elirnination of Part II would not prevent
effect being given to that intention, so far
as I can see. I arn simply discussing the
matter now from what I might terni the
constitutional standpoint. Thus the Government would not be prevented fvom
making the expenditure.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Asstning that
we pass no Act at ail, and that the Act of
1917 rernains in force, could not the Gov,ernrnent do what my honourable friend bas
just now described?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Precisely. I amn about to corne to that. Inthe first place, dealing with Part II, it
seerns to be the sense of the House that
this part should be elirninated. That would
leave Part I. Then, it seems to rne, there
would be no0 particular object in the Government accepting Part I, because that
âea1ly does flot substantially differ frorn
the legisiation of 1917.
Hon. Mv. BOSTOCK: It gives the Minister more direct control.
Hon. Sir JAMES- LOUGHEED: It is
sirnply a littie more elaborate in the details
which will be involved in the organ.ization,
and a littie more elaborate as to the constitution of the Council. But there would
certainly be nothing to prevent the Go'vevn-ment under the Act of 1917 pvoceeding
with the scherne which is outlined in the
entire Bill. I therefove see no particular
object in retaini;g Part I if we 'eliminate
Part II, because we already have on the
statute book a statute-which does not;
seern, at the tinte it was passed, in 1917,
to have evoked very rniuch adverse contnient-under which Parliarnent would have
authovity frorn time to, tirne to appropriate
moneys for the purpose of carrying out

599

the policy which is so clearly outlined in
that legisiation. There would-be nothing
to prevent Parliarnent fromn voting an appropriation, for the purpose of building an
Institute in order to give effec *t to the
particular purýposes which are enumerated
in the Act of 1917.
Hon. Mv. PROUDFOOT: Such being the
case, why was the present Bill brought in?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHÉED: I think
it is owing to that peculiar disease which
characterizes ail parliarnentavy bodies at
the present tume: we seern to have an
incurable desire for placing upon the
statute book legislation alrnost without
lumit. It seents to me that we should have
a close season for legislation, and I have
no doubt that, outside of the Supply Bill,
this country for the next five years would,
get. along very well without any legislation.
I appreciate that there is a very stvong
feeling in the House that it would not be
wise at present for thîs Chamber to give
a mandate, as =iy honourable fviend
froni' De Lovimier <Hon. Mv. Danduvand),
has tevnied it. It may not be desivable to
press this matter to a vote. I would suggest.
that the Cornrittee should vise and report
progvess, and I shahl take the oppovtunity
of expressing to the Govevrnent the sense
of this House, so far as I can determine it,
as being against the passage of the Bill
at the present tirne.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honouvable gentlemen, I do not want to speak again, but I
would cahl the attention of thet honourable
member from Ottawa (Hon. Mv. eecourt),
as well as the attention of the honourable
leader of the Governrnent, to the fact that
Part I is essentially different fvom the Act
of 1917.
.Hon. Mr. BELÇOURT: That is what I
said
Hon. Mr. ROSS: But there is no good saying that if you repeal Part II you might
just as well vepeal the 'whole Bihl because the Act of 1917 would take the place
of Part I. It would not do anything of
the kind. This Part I has a clause, number
9, which is not in the Act of 1917. It makes
the Council a body corporate, and eMPOWerS
it to receive grants, bequests, and donations,
and makes it a rnuch more effective institution than does the Act of 1917.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend misunderstood me. That was the
basis of rny whole argument-the difference
between the old Act and this one.

work of the Commission done by day

should be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to know what work is entrusted to the
Secretary,?
Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOUGHEED: Wbatever may be assigned to him by the Commission.
Hon. .Mr. DANDURAND: 1 know, but
the Secretary's work was -light at the inception of the Commissioi%. The intention,
as I judge by this Act, was that tbe work
was to be done by a member of the Civil
Service. My honourable friend now tells
us that the present Secretary is not a member of the Civil Service.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And that the
reason for this Act is to regularize the
situation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIHEEth Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By having the
Governor in Council appoint?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
wbether the work entrusted to that Commission is heavier than it was at its inception.
If it is not, we should perhaps
think twice before creating a new position.
If it could be done at -a certain time by a
member of the Civil Service who did the
work within his hours of service to the
cZrnntry, cou.ld it not be continued in that
manner? ,I am under the impression that
there are members of the Civil Service
whose work is not so beavy that tbey could
not afford to give an hour of their time
per day out of tbe time that belongs to
the country, to perfnrmn that work.* It is
a small tbing, if you will.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do you mean witb
extra pay?
No, but a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
member of the Civil Service gives to bis
duties from 9 o'clock until 4, and if tbe
Deputy Minister can allow him an hour
of that time for this work, it would perbaps be sufficient. 0f course it is a small
item wben we are dealing in our Budget
in these days with millions, but I am won,dering whetber we should not begin to use
the pruning knife in ail directions because
of the present condition of oui finances.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Witb the leave
of the House I might explain that when
we had a Secretary who was a niemvber of
the Civil Service he had other employment in the Departmnent of Public Works.
He kept the minutes, for which he receiveci
an additional tee-I do flot remember how
much, but a very small amount. The Commission, however, had to, keep another
Secretary there ail the, time, so that they
were paying two. Now, the idea is to have
q~ permanent Secretary, and pay only one.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is the honourable
gentleman stili a member of that Commission?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If he cannot tell
us how niuch the Secretary formerly -received, I think we had ibetter change him
at once.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
I will resign
witb pleasure, and give the salary to the
honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I don't want the
salary.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will give you
the salary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me I could not have made myself very
dlear in explaining this. I pointed out
that the Chairman of the Commission, upon
whom the greatet part of the duty falls,
bas a secretary -who has been acting gratuitously, and who wishes te act gratuitously; but under the Act as it is at present
it is obligatory upon the Government to,
appoint a memiber of the Civil Service as
Secretary. That means that the appointment is -within the Civil Service Act; and,
while the Civil Service Commission would
originally appoint the officer, the Governor
in Council would appoint him to this particular office. It simply means te regularize the appointment of this particular
secretary, who happens to be the Secretary
of the Commission,-and rwho is discharging
the duties gratuitously.
The iotion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED.

SIECOND R.EADING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 159, an Act to amend
the Inspection and Sale Act (Hay and
Straw inspection).
He said: Under the Inspection Act as
it appears in the Revised ýStatutes of 1906,
and afterwards amended by chapter 30 of
the statutes of 1918, the word "seller" bas
been uýied instead of the word "presser" of
baled hay. The original draft of the Act
provîded that the presser of baled hay
should attach a tag showing the weight,
etc., of the bale. That was changed to
seller.
Consequently the one originally
responsible for the condition of the bale
of hay is granted immunity and the seller,
who knows nothing about it, is compelled
to attach a tag statîng its weight and contents. It is therefore intended to substitute the word "presser" for that of "seller."
I move the second readîng of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Although I
am not from the farm, I heartily agree
with the move, proposed by thîs Bill, to

MAY 25, 1921
throrw the responsibility upon the person
who has a knowledge of the hay that he is
selling. A fe'w years ago the reputation
of Canada in foreign markets was injured,
because of the fact that our hay which was
sold abroad did not corne up to the standard bargained for. Under the law at that
time the trader was made responsible, even
though he had flot seen the inside of the
bale. Ur.der this Bill the presser, who has
opportunity to see the inside of the bale,
is made reaponsible. I think this is a move
-in the right direction.
I arn told that some further amendments
which would make thé Act more applicable
to, present conditions could very well be
mnade. Before entering the Chamber I was
offered a memorandum of desirable amendments to the Act. I asked the gentleman
who offered thern if he concurred in the
present Bill, and-2he said that ail the hay
dealers concur in it, but that they believe
some other iniprovements should be made.
r think thia is a inove which, pro tanto, is
to be comrnended.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: J)'
the attention of'-the Senate to an article

6

that appeared i the Toronto Globe of the
24th of May instant. It ia frorn the staff
correspondent of that paper in Ottawa,
and reads as follows:
It Is a race between the Senatdrs and the
end of the session to see whet-her each Senixtor
who bas been punctual in attendance gets
$1,225 for bis services or $4,000.
The law passed last year statedI that the
$4,000 was to be paid for any session exceedi-ng
50 days- in length, and Lt bas been interpreted
that thls clause refers to 50 days of aotual sitting.
The Bouse of Gommons made the grade
easily, to-day being its sixty-ninth day of
meeting, but the Senate on Saturday met for
only the forty-fourth Lime 'this session, leaving
six days (in which it bas to nieet in ordêr to
make the 50 days -necessary to reach the $4,000
mark.
The; Senate. being a amaller body and flot
having any general election to -trouble its tran-,
quility, can get through the business that comes
before it in much quicker -time than the Coinmons. The new law forces it .to spend more days
in discussron on something or other, and somestimes on anything, than otherwise would be
done.
It met Saturday, perhaps, for tbe purpose of
getting In an extra day for feuxr larlLament
sbould close on Friday next. The Bouse of
Commons will flot meet to-morrow (Victoria
Day), but -the Senate will meet in order to
coumt an extra day.
Even at that the Senate will probably inst
.on Saturday, because only by so doing can it
get in its fiftieth day. If the worst comes to the
worst there witl be two sittings on a single day,
and each sitting will be called a day under the
act. At least that la how a resolution passed by
the Senate laet F'rlday La being Lnterpreted. It
proposed that. etarting on Saturday last, unless
differently ordered, tbere sbould be "«two distinct sittings of the Senate every day," one in
the morning and one In tbe afternooi.
In the debate that followed it was atated
thai the two sittings a day would not be beld
except "'in case of necessity'. That "case of
necessity" would be Lf Sir James Lougheed's
pronouiicement last FYtday ls realized, tbat
"there is flot only every.possibility, but every
probability of prorogation being reached next.
wek."

Then there are some particulars which
I do not think it necessary to read, and
at the end the article says:
If they meet only 49 days, they would get
a total of $106,575. Therefore one day will net
tbe Senate, the difterence, a total of $241,426.

Honourable gentlemen, I do not think
that membera of this House, as a rule, pay
rnuch attention to what is said, derogatory
of the Senate, in the newspapers-so accustomed' are we to newspaper articles
saying thinga about the Senate which SenIni this parators know are not; true.
ticular case, however, the correspondent
ia so wide of the mark, and has so 'little
understanding of the Act that was put

SENATE
through the House last Session, that I
tbought it wise to draw the attention of
the Senate ta the matter.
1 will read the clause 'which deals with
this question.
Section 32 of the Act,
chapter 69 of the statutes of 1920, says:
For every Session of Par]iament which extends beyond flfty clays there shall be payable
to each member of the Senate and House of
Gommons atteyiding at such session a sessional
allowance of fou,~ thousand dollars and -no more.

To-day, the 26th of May, Parliament is
in its 102nd day, so that it has extended
beyond the flfty days, with fifty-one days
more than are required under the Act for
Parliament ta be in session and for the full
indemnity ta be drawn. That is one point
,that I want ta make.
Another point is that the motion~ that
was moved by my bonourable friend the
leader of the Go7vernment the other day
has been made by the leader of the Government every Session sînce I have had
the honour of sitting in this Chamber.
That motion read as follows:
That, commencing to-morrow, unless difierently ordered, there shall be two distinct sittings of the Senate every day, the first sitting
ta commence at eleven o'clock arn. until one
o'clock p.m., and the second sitting 'ta commence
at three o'clock p.m., and that aIl Standing and
Select Committees of the Senate be permitted
,ta sit while the Senate is in session. notwithstanding anythtng contrary in Rule 86.

1 would like ta read fro'm the Journals
of the Senate a similar motion that bas
been miade in years gone by. Fromn the
Minutes of Proceedings of the Senate for
1894 1 read as fol]ows:
On motion of the Honourable Mr. Bowell.
seconded by the Honourable Mr. Angers, it was
Ordered, That when the Senate adjourns
to-day, at the second sitting thereof, it do stand
adjourned until to-morrow at eleven o'clock in
the morning, such sitting ta continue until one
o'clock in the afternoon, unless the Senate be
sooner adjourned, when the Senate shahl stand
adjourned until three o'clockç in the arfternoon,
such sittings ta continue until six o'clock in
the aflernoon, unless the Senate bie sooner adjourned, when the Senate slaîl stand adjourned
until eight o'clock in the evenin*g; and that
each of such sittings lie considered a distinct
sitting.

In the Session of 1897 the motion was
as follows:
The Honouraible Sir Oliver Mowat moved,
seeonded by the Honourahie Mr. Scott:
That on to-morrow and for the remainder of
the Session there be two distinct sittings of the
Senate upon each day of the Session, the firat
of such. sittings ta begin at eleven o'ctock in
the morning and to continue uîîtil one o'elock in
the afternoon, unless the Senate be sooner ad.lourned. the second of such sittings ta begin at
Hon. Mr. HSTOCK.

three o',clock in the afterncon and ta continua
until euch time as the Senate adJourns, and
that each such sitting be considered a separate

session.
I have taken the trouble ta read these
mations ta the House in order that it rnay
be impressed on the newspaper that that
motion is one that is regularly mnade every
Session for the purpose of faci]itating
public business, and it has nothing whatever ta do with the question of the indemnity paid to, Senators.
The other point made in this newspaper
article-that the Senate bas been discussing questions that were not necessary ta
be discussed in order that the Senate might
sit-is alsa an unfair statement of the
situation.
Any niember of the Press
Gallery who attends the meetings of this
Chamber must know that the discussions
carried on here are short and ta the point,
and that honourable gentlemen are not in
the habit of wasting the time of this
Chamber by talking about matters wbich
are unnecessary, or which have no bearing upon the question under discussion.
I tbink it may 'be said that in the Senate
honourable gentlemen speak ta the point,
make short 'speeches, and attend to the
business before thema with the abject of
bringing out the necessary facts and
arguments, and thus making legislation as
accurate and as useful ta the country as
possible.
The last statement made in this article,
about aur being so anxious ta bring in the
difference of $241,425 is quite disposed of,
I think, by the statement that 1 have mnade;
but I hope that in future this correspondent
of the Globe wîll be more careful in anything that be writes ta bis paper about tbe
Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon.. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, 1 fully concur in everytbing that has been said by my honaurable
friend. When it becames necessary at any
time ta correct or ta, crîticize the Toronto
Globe, notbing will give me greater
pleasure than to make way for my honourable friend.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whether I am in order, but with the acquiescence of the House I would like ta
add a few words, not on this incident, but
on the fact that in another Chamber the
usefulness of the Senate bas often been
questioned. Last year a member asked for
a return as ta the cost ta the country of

MAY 26, 1921
the Senate, and the return stated that for
the preceding year an expenditure had
been incurred *of some $300,000. It is, to
this query that I want to address myseif.
1 would like to refer bionourable gentlemen to a statement prepared by Sir Mackenzie Boweli, the esteemed leader of this
House for a number -of years, who was
cherished by ail the members on both sides.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That statenment was that during a certain number of
ye'ars, while the Conservatives had, held
the majority of the seats.in this Chamber,
a large amount, five or six times as much
as had been expended .for this branch of
Parliament, had been saved by -this
-Chamber in amendments made to House of
Commons Bils. I would like to add one
fact to* that statement made by Sir
Mackenzie Boweil, namely, that if thîs
Chamber had cost, since its inception in
1867,
$10,000,000-which
is a very
generous figure-yet it should be noted
that in 1913 we rejected the construction
of three dreadnoughts, and saved the
country $35,000,000 by that single act.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

premises. What wouid he do? Wbat would
-anyone -do? Why, get out bis revolver and
shoot them. There .should be some proteclion to the householder as weil as te the
general public, to, put down àay illicit

performance or anything of that kind.
The remedy is worse than the disease; and
therefore I support the opinion expressed
by niy friend from St. John-that this
measure is ill-timed and ill-conceived, and
that ample protection should always be
given to the householder in order that he
may defend bis family, bis property, apd
himseif from an attack by any one. Surely
the day is long enough to serve a writ
upon a man. Sureiy there are enough
worries in life without this additionai one.
Therefore, Sir, I am against this clause.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
striking out the words, "without the
authority of the prescribing physician,
veterinary surgeon or dentist," and are
iiisertîng in lieu thereof :* "except where
the preparation covered by the prescription
might have lawfully been sold in'ihe first
instance without a written order or prescription."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does that aliow
them to fili the prescription twice? That
is the point.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
That prevents
fiuhing it twice.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED':
The
expianation given is this. Under subsection 4 (a) of section 5A of chapter 31, 1920, in order to meet the need
of having certain non-patent preparations
that may te sold by druggists without a
physician's prescription, exception bas
been granted for such preparations as do
not contain more than 2 grains of opium,
or more than 1-4 grain of morphine, or
more than 1-8 grain of heroin, or more
than 1 grain of codeine, or any sait or
derivative of them, in one ounce, provided
the preparations are medicated otherwise
sullhciently to prevent their being used as
narcotics only.
1Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The prescription
can -be refilled?
,Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The expianation
of thai is that there is a habit of having
prescriptions refilied. A patient gets from
a physician a prescription and gives it to
a drug store, and druggists are in the habit
under ordinary circumstances of repeating
that prescription if the patientsý find that
it does them good. Under the Nareotic
Drug Act as we passed it hast year they
are prevented from filling any prescription
that contains more than a certain amount
of the derivatives ofoPium Or other nercotic druga which are deleterieus In effect;

SENATE
and this is only accentuating the law which
,we passed last year, and which was perfectly right and just.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They can use two
grains?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes; because the
ordinary patent medicines which people are
in the habit of buying contain that much.
Paragraph a was agreed to.
On paragraph b-physician not to prescribe drugs, etc., except for medicinal purposes:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the effeet of that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: After
the words "any physician," in the first
line, these words are added: "who prescribes, administers or gives to any person
any drug, or." In the administration of
the Act it has been found impossible under
the law as it stands to prosecute a physician who bas not signed an order or prescription for narcotics, and a number of
physicians who are commercializing in
these drugs, solely for the large profits
derived from illicit transactions, have in
some manner found that, if they obtain
supplies of narcoties from a wholesale
druggist and in turn furnish these drugs
direct to their patients, they cannot be
prosecuted under the Act, owing to the
fact that they have not signed any order
or prescription for the drug, as provided
in this section.
It might be explained
that there are a number of physicians
throughout the country who resort to this
practice. For this reason it is desirable
to make it an offence for a physician to
prescribe or administer narcotic drugs to
persons for other than medicinal purposes, as intended by the statute.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is all right.
Paragraph b was agreed to.
On paragraph c-any person may be
required to keep record of any drug mentioned in schedule of Act:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is there anything
particular about that amendment?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; it
is very largely a formality.
Paragraph e was agreed to.
On paragraph d-persons occupying
premises where drug is found and charged
with unlawful possession deemed to be in
possession of drug unless he proves drug
there without his knowledge, etc.:
Hon. Mr. MURPHY.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
the result of certain cases that have been
tried. In the enforcement of the Act it
has been found that magistrates in various
provinces have interpreted in many different ways the word "possession" mentioned
in this section. For instance, one magistrate
in the Province of British Columbia gave
as his opinion that the word "possession"
meant that a person must be the absolute
owner and be able to dispose of the property to the exclusion of all other persons; while, as a matter of fact, in most
cases persons found in possession of these
drugs are only the agents or intermediaries
for the real owner. The persons found in
actual possession of these drugs are, however, the ones who are of course responsible for the illegal carrying and distribution of the same.
It might be further explained that in
many cases where the police search the
premises and find in a room occupiea by
a.Chinaman or other person quantities of
opium, etc., and where the accused is
charged with having a drug in his possession, the defense offered is that the
drug is not the property of the accused,
having been left there by some unknown
person. It is important, therefore, that
the meaning of the word "possession," in
so far as it pertains to this section, should
be defined as clearly as possible for the
guidance of the magistrates who have to
deal with those cases.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What
is the meaning? Is. it sought to .make it
prima facie evidence?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
defines what constitutes "possession."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If the
drug is found in a man's bouse, that is
evidence that he is the owner of it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
They
are not going to put the onus on a man to
prove that he is not the owner? It is
simply prima facie evidence.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He may
shift the onus. It is provided in the last
three lines of the paragraph:
-unless he prove that the drug was there without his authority, knowledge or consent, or that
he was lawfully entitled to the possession
thereof.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That

Paragraph e was agreed to.
Paragraph f was agreed to.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Before we corne to
section 7 1 would like to point out that
there is a difficulty that has arisen in connection with the administration of this
Act, and that I wJuld like to see something
done to rectify. The actual case I have
in mind is this. A man gets a prescription fronm a doctor, and goes to a druggist
with it. It may not be for any.of these
drugs at a]l, but he gets knowledge of
the doctor's signature. He then forges
another order for a drug, and he does it so
cleverly that the ordinary man cannot tell
the difference between the forged order
and the genuine. In the particular case
that I have in view, when the doctor hiniself saw the signature first, he did not
know that it was not his. He was sure
only when he referred back to his books in
which he kept a check of ail prescriptions.
By referring to, his books he found that
lie had not given the prescription. The
man was fined something like $1,000. What
strikes me is that there ought to be some
provision that the trial judge, 'in a case
of that kind, should try the question
whether or not the druggist was guilty of
carelessness; because, as I see it now, if
you leave the law as it stands, the only safe
thing for the druggist to do is to go out
of that business altogether. That, I think,
would be inconvenient. I do not know what
is the opinion of the House.on this question.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, honourable members in
this section, of the Chamber cannot hear
very well, and 1 did not realize that paragraph f was passing. I would like to, have
that reconsidered.
On paragraph ýf--on-us o-f proM on charge
of manufacturing, selli-ng etc., wi'hout, lcense (recoi'sidered) :

60,

here added another clause which. deprivies
a man of any protection at ail. It says:
Wbere a charge ls laid un-der either paragraph (d) or (e) hereof the onus shall be upon
the accused to establlsh that he had lawful authority to comimit the act comnplained of or that
he had a license froin the Minister authorizing
such act.

That is a cla-ss uf legislation which in
mny opinion is eminently vicious. If a man
is charged with a crime, those .who charge
him should ho. bound to prove his guilt.
They should not say: "You have to prove
a negàtive in order to escape punishmýent."
Personally I arn very very strongly opposed to legislation of this kind. In this
country, and 1 believe in England, there is
such legislation inceluded iii the Customis
Ac; and sone, other statutes, froni long
habit. But this, is a clear departure froxu
ail our ideas od crirninal. law.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
It is copied
from the Ontario Temperance Act.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
And
that legisiation has caused widespread
discontent. The judges have expressed
Vhemselves against it; 'the public is against
it. It siniply gives officials a very irnproper and unfair advantage over a
prisoner. A man who is put into the position of being charged with a crime, and
whose life or 'liberty or hontùur is In danger, should get British justice. That meais,
that 1those who charge hini sihould be bound
to prove by fair evidtnce that he is guilty.
Under this measure a man may bein
dicted and may be fournd guilty u-nlese lie
can prove hinisoîf innocent. Why do we
not adopt that kind of legisiation for everything, and say that if a man is charged
with murder he shoulr; be presumed to, be
guilty until he pro'-es himelf innocent?
It is often impossible for a man to prove
a negative. 1 think we should ncot allow
this. to, pass. Up to the present time ît has
not been ctmnsidered necesgary; but now
sorne person comes along who is always
tryin-g to make -the law strifter, or to make
it more unfair by turning it into an engine

Quite
Hon. Mr. LNYCH-STAUNTON:
rigbt. That is wbat I wish to do.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: From " where" to,
act."
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would point out
to the bouourable gentleman that every
person who bas a right to supply tbose
na.rcotized drugs must have a license under
the authority of the law. If a person has
in bis possession drugs sucb as morpbinei
or opium or its derivatives, and bas not
a license, be bas no right to bave tbem in
bis possession. He .must be a legally qualified druggist or a legally qualified physiclan, and must make application to the
proper Department at Ottawa for a license
to enable him to keep drugs. Il be bas
any of those drugs in bis possession and
bas not that license, that f'act is prima
facie evidence that be bas tbem for unlawful purposes. TberefoTre he sbould be
required to prove by some means or other
that hie bas themn by some rigbt.
My
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
honourable friend might be rigbt if tbat
were the only tbing covered by this clause,
but there is in it tbis definite provision,
that he must establish eitber that l'e
is innocent or that be bas a license.
Now, if bie bas a license, it is issued
by the Government and there is a
record kept of it, and it is quite easy for
the informant or the prosecutor to show
to the tribunal that there bas been nu
license issued to the accused. To save hl
that trouble it is sought to put in ti3
clause. It is unnecessary, and, I subit
a cleaT infringement of the rigbt of the
citizens of this country. Wben they ae
put upon trial, their rigbt is to be prestyned innocent until tbey are proven
guilty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, that bas to be taken in
a very general sense. It bas long been the
policy of the law in regard to a certain
class of offences that the onus should be
upon the person cbarged. That applies
under most liquor Acts; it applies under
the Customs Act; I think it applies under
the Inland Revenue Act.
it
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
neyer applied under the Liquor Act before.
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
reason of it is this. If honourable gentlemen look at paragraph d, wbich is the one
deait witb, they will find these words:
Without flrst obtaining a license therefor
from the said Minister, imports into or exports
Mon. W, B. ROSS.

from Canada, or manufactures in Canada, any
prepared opium, that is to say, any product of
raw opium obtained by any series of special
operations, especially by dissolving, bolling,
roasting and feirnenti-ng, designed to transform
it into an extract suitable for consumption. and
including dross and ail other residues remaining
when opium is smoked;

The person charged is probably the only
person who would know that this was done;
and he is caught in the act. It seems to
me absurd to say that the Crown must
prove that he has committed an act or
that hie has done something which he has
been caught in the act of doing. It is an
easy matter for him to establish his innocence if hie is not guiity. If hie says, "Here
is my license," the case against him is dismissed. 'If he is found in possession, why
should not the «nus be upon him? If he is
caugbt red-handed in the act, whîch is a
most heinous one, it is practically necessary
for the protection of life and property that
he should be charged with the onus of
establishing his own innocence. Why shouid
hie not do so? It is not as if hie were
charged with doing something the evidence
of which is not in his own possession. This
is a case in which the evidence is clearly
in his possession, and ln which he bas been
caught in the very act.
Would not the
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
evidence be in the possession of the accused
in the case of murder?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would be an entirely different thing. In
this case the man has been caught in the
act, and the evidence is in bis own possession. As a matter of fair play, of British
justice-my honourable friend from Hamilton is very glad to cite the fairness of
British justice-if a man is caught redhanded in ýopenly violating a law of this
kind, the lives of individuals being involved,
is it a very serlous matter to say to him:
"We have caught you red-handed and you
must prove that you have not donc this
act?" I submit, bonourable gentlemen, that
in an important statute of this kind, which
de ais flot oinly with matters1 of moraiity, but
aiso with the questions of life anddeath, we
must safeguard tbe interest of the publicthe lives and tbe habits of the publicagaînst the incursions wbich are being made
daily and hourly by the illegal bandiing
,of drugs. Is it unreasonable to say that
those men wbo traffic in the lives of their
feilows, as they are doing to-day, sbould
establish their innocence before a court,
wben they have been caught red-handed
in the violation of the iaw?

If he aisfound in possession of the drug,
surely it je not a hardship to ask hinm hew
he came into possession of it. Immediately
he gives a proper explanatien the Crown
has to establish that it le illegally in his
possession It seems to me a most reasonable thing, and I fail to see how otherwise
you are going ta enferce an Act of this
kind againet this class of outlaws, the very
worst crinxinals in the community. I1 venture to say that there ie no class of criminais so heineus as the men who deal in the
illegal traffic in drugs, and I think this provision je highly in the public interest.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUN TON:
The
trouble je that we have flot got the Act
before us. We have to patch up these
matters piece by piece.
It seeins to me
from the little censideration I have been
able to give to this matter, that the only
authority a man can have for these acte
is a license. If it je intended to make hlm
produce hie lichènee, why flot leave juet the
laet haîf of the section? I agree with the
leader of the Government that it ie not imposing a hardship on a man to make hlm
produce hie license; but this section putting
the onus upon a ýnan-who may be sent to
prison for seven years-of preving hie innocence, unless the proof of hie innocence
may conelet in producing hie license, je unBritish, unfair, and unneceseary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUJGHEED: I do not
wish to interrupt my honourable friend;
but will he look at lines 24. and 25? The
onus is something that he can eaeily satisfy,
because the onus is to establish "Fthat he
had lawful authority to commit the act
complained of, or that he had a license."
Hie bas to, do one of two thinge.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
What
lawful authority can he have under the
Act unlees he has a licence?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
He
may have come into possession of it innocently.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
That
je not a lawful authority; that le simply
an excuse.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
show that there was ne criminal intent.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Paragraph e repeats that without making 'it

the Crown shows that it je in bis possession, then the onue might very well 'be on
him; but it seeme .to me thiat paragraph f9
goes further than that.
I quite agree
that he ehould be 'bound te produce a

reet of the paragraph? In the criminal
law we ehould know what we are aiming
at.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: In many cases
these men are narcoticed degeneratescocaine or morphine fiendc-and they will

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He has

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Crown

defence is the production of a license or
any other lawful authority he will be able
to establish his defence.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do
not agree at all. The leader of the Government spoke of this as provision dealing
with a man who is caught red-handed. If
you will look at it, you will see that that
is not the case at all. It says that when
a charge is laid, he shall be bound to prove
himself innocent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it
does not say that. The onus has reference
to two things; he shall establish either
that he has lawful authority to commit the
act, or that he has a license.
It
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
says, "where a charge is laid." What will
happen is this. Anybody can go before a
magistrate and lay a charge. The man
accused will say: "I didn't use it; I don't
know anything about it." Anybody can lay
a charge. He can say: "That fellow has
been roaming up and down here; let us
bring him up and ask him if he did this."
There is no necessity of proving anything;
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

all that has to be done is to lay a charge,
and the accused has to prove that he did
not import opium.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It does
not extend to importation at all.
A
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
charge might be laid in Ottawa against
any member of this House, and he would
have to go to the police court and prove
that he did not bring in opium here, and
the Crown would not have to prove that
anybody brought it in. The thing is
ridiculous.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I want to put myself right with the House, and I think I
will put the honourable gentleman from
Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
right at the same time. I thought that the
paragraph d referred to in subsection f of
the Bill was paragraph f of the Bill that is
before us; but I find that that is not the
case-that it is paragraph d of the Act
of 1920, which says:
Any person who without first obtaining a
license therefor from the said Minister, imports
into or exports from Canada, or manufactures
in Canada, any prepared opium, that is to say,
any product of raw opium obtained by any
series of special operations, espe-cially by dissolving, boiling, roasting and fermenting, designed to transform it into an extracit suitable for consumption, and including dross and
all other residues remaining when opium is
smoked.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Would my
honourable friend be good enough to read
paragraph e?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. It says:
-has in his possession without lawful authority,
or manufactures, sells, gives away or distributes
any drug without first obtaining a license from
the Mini.ster.

On finding my mistake, I do not know
that there is very much to complain of.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps I may
digress for a moment to say that this
shows how absolutely necessary it is that
the resolution proposed the other day
should be adopted. This, it seems to me, is
a clear illustration of the darkness in which
we are groping in dealing with many Bills
that come up to this House. It seems to
me that paragraphs e and e provide for
nothing but a license: you may have in
your possession or you may import, if you
have a license.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,
you may manufacture.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Whatever it is.
You may import or manufacture or have

MAY 26, 1921
in your possession if you have a license.
That is the only question. Nothing- else
can arise; so the onus of proof in this
section means that the accused has to produce his license. That is the whole case.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: If I understand the honourable gentleman from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) he
is referring to clauses d and e in the pre,ceding portion of the Bill. I do not understand that to be correct, because the beginning of this paragraph says:
Subsection 2 of section 5A is amended by
adding the following paragraphs at the end
thereof.

Now, what is subsection 2 of section 5A?
Yçu have to turn to the Act of 1920 for
that; and you will find that the subséection we are dealing with here is as follows:
-- without first
lbtaining a license therefor
from the said Minister, irmports ýi.nto or exports
from Canada, or manufactures in Canada, any
prepared opium, that is to say, any product of
raw opium, etc.

Paragraph e says:
has in hi.s possession without lawful authority, or manufactures, sells, gives away or distributes any drug without first obtaining a
license from the Minister.

I thought at first that the subsection my
honourable friend was objecting to referred
to the two paragraphs in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No. It
refers to the Act of 1920.
. Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I know it does,
but it did not strike me in that way until
I worked out the various clauses. I think
that shows, as was stated by my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), the importgnce of having the whole
of the Act before us when we are dealing
with it. Where a charge is laid under
either of these sections, I presume that a
man can relieve himself from the difficulty by proving that he has a licepse.
Hon. Mr. LYNCjI-STAUNTON: That
is all it ought to cover.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is all it
should cover. Is not that all it does cover?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No; it
says, "or that he had a license."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He
shall produce his license or his prescription.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:' Or, under

wrong.

Then it is aal

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Yes. I have always been opposed to the class of legislation which casts upon the accused the
onus of proving anything. I think a person accused should be treated as not gulilty
until his guilt is established. There are
cases coming up almost every day in connection with the Ontario Temperance Act
in which men are found guilty simply because they happen to have some hiquor in
their possession. They have no apportunity of defending themselves.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They should have

r It would still

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That would be a
good answer.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It would be
concealed. But it does not seem fair that
a man should be found guilty under the circumstances to which I have referred.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Supposing he had
the opium in his possession and swallowed
it, would he be prosecuted?-he probably
would not need to be.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not think
there would be any occasion for it. But I
an going to follow up with this statement:
when you place a law of this kind on the
statute book it means that a magistrate
may, without any evidente at all, reach
the conclusion that a man is guilty; and
there is no appeal; because the higher
courts, when the case is brought up,
say, "Well, the magistrate saw the witnesses and heard the evidence," and therefore they decline to interfere, and very
often a man is fiiied or sent to prison without an opportunity of properly defending
hinmself. My opinion ls, therefore, thiat
this class of legislation is vicious, and that
we should not place it on the statute book.
I heard the honourable leader of the House
not long ago say that we had too much

do this," and "You shall do that."

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton moves in amendment that
the following be substituted for paragraph f:
(f) Subsection two of section five A is
amended by adding the following paragraph at
the end thereof: Where a charge is laid under
either paragraph d or e hereof the onus shall
be upon the accused to establish that he had
a license from the Minister authorizing such act.

I do not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
understand at all the difficulty with which
my honourable friend from Hamilton is
wrestling. Does he claim that there is
a chance, under the clause which he attacks,
that the accused will be unable to plead
that he bas not committed the act at all?
If he bas not committed the act he need
not show a license; but if he admits having
committed the act, or is in possession of
the drug, then he falls under the Act, and
he bas violated the Act unless he establishes a justification.
A liHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
cense.
A license.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to
ask the honourable member from Hamilton
this question. If my honourable friend
bas a building two miles from his home,
and someone comes and commandeers it and
stores opium there, and then, taking advantage of the Act, starts action against
him, be cannot justify unless he can show
a license to have the drug in his building.
That is the way I read the clause.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Not at
all.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton was negatived.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would suggest
to the honourable leader of the House that
he correct the wording of the Bill, and
that it be made to read without the words:
"that he had lawful authority to commit
the act complained of."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should think
the better way to correct that would be to
provide that he had a lawful excuse to
do the act.
But that is
,Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
no excuse, if he had a right to do it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend bas put a case that I think ought
to be considered. He might put a stronger
case: for example, if rny butler chose to
bring opium into my bouse and put it in
his bedroom, surely I am not to be sent to
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

jail for his act. That ought to be provided for in some way. Even though I
have no license, I certainly should not be
convicted in such a case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What section
would you come under?.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The section we
are discussing, where a charge is laid under
d or e. What I would like to see is a provision which would enable an innocent
person to prove his innocence, such as in
the case I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But you have
not the drug in your possession.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes, he has charge
of his house, and the police come in and
take .possession of it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Paragraph d
says, " Any person who occupies, controls
or is in possession of."
Mr. DANDURAND: " Without
Hon.
lawful authority." The clause deals with
a person who has in his possession without authority, etc.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the
case I am putting. My butler is in my
house, and he has opium in his possession,
and constructively that might be said to
be in my possession.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not see
anything that makes that in your posession.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes, it
is, under paragraph d.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: All you
have to do is to say that the drug is there
without your authority, knowledge or consent.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He has to prove
that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, he
has not.
This
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
clause makes him prove it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
If my hon. friend were charged with having such a drug in his bouse, if he proved
that the drug was there without his authority, knowledge or consent, he would be absolved, and the onus would be upon the
Crown to prove to the contrary.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No; I
can bring you case after case in our courts

knowledge and consent-liquor-and the
magistrate has said: " I don't believe
you."
The accused has gone to the Court
of Appeal in Ontario, and the judges have
said: " The Act is most unfair, but the
magistrate found you guilty, and we have
ne power to reverse his findings."
In
Hamilton we had a case of an old man of
75 who was fined under the same conditions,
and there was no relief.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That does not apply
here. That applies oily te the Temperance Act-that they will not review the
evidence before the magistrate.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: And
they will not review it here.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Suppose some
woollen goods were found in the possession of ny honourable friend fron Hamilton, he would be charged with stealing, and
it would be up to him to prove that he
never stole them.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, it
would not.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Lynch-'Staunton was negatived.
Paragraphs f and g were agreed to.
On section 7-right of search by constable:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Hon. Mr.
Daniel move's tMs amendment:
That section 7 of the Bill be amended by
substituting the word "belleve" for "suspect"
In the second Une, and by striking out the word
dwelling-house In line 3 of said section, and
by addi.ng the words "and such constable or
police officer may enter any dwelling-house on
producing a search-warrant from a magistrate
having Jurisdiction in the matter."

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You would not need
that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I quite realize, as
has already been stated by the leader of
the Government in this House, that the offence with which this Bill deals is one that
must be treated with a great deal of severity, and in that respect I quite agree with
the principle of the Bill. At the same time,
I think section 7 goes too far in the power
it gives to peace officers to enter 'any
dwelling house, store, shop, warehouse, outbouse, garden, yard, vessel or other place,
either by night or by day, without any warrant for doing the same. Under these conditions, if a search is successful and opium
or other narcotie drug is found, then of
course there is nu complaint; but supposiig
a 'peace officer goes into a man's house,

digs up his yard, excavates his cellar, and
goes through his place generaily, and does
not find any drug at all? So far as I can
see, the unfortunate suspect has no reparation and no recourse. But, with regard to
the matter of giving a peace officer, on
mere suspicion, the power to enter anybody's home at any time of day or night,
without a warrant, I think that is going
much too fer in the duties imposed upon
peace officers. The original Act relating to
this matter made it necessary for the constable to obtain a search-warrant to do
any of the things mentioned; but that is
done away with by this section, and the
constable is even given authority to enter
any ian's private house at any time of
the day or night on a pretense, or otherwise, of searching for narcdtic drugs. I
therefore move the amendment which has
been read by the Chairman, that we change
the wordl "suspect" in the second line to
"believe."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the difference?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: "Believe" is a little
He must 'have
stronger than "suspect."
reasonable cause te believe that a drug is
kept or sold. Then my amendment takes
out the word "dwelling-house" in the third
lineDoes the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman believe that any
ordinary policeman makes a difference between suspecting and believing?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why strike out
"dkeilling-house"?
Hor. Mr. DANTEL: My amendinent provides thatSuch constable or police officer may enter any
dweltng-house on producing a search-warrant
from a magistrate having jurisdiction In the
matter.

That is, while (he is not allowed to enter
a dwelling-house on mere suspicion, with-

out a warrant, he can do se by getting a
warrant for that puripose.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
The general criminal law
unnecessary.
provides for that.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Confine your amendment to striking out "dwelling-house."
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Then I will confine
my amendment to changing the word "suspect" t» "believe" and striking out the word
"dwelling-house" in line three.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Before I vote for or
against the amendment I would like to
put a question to the honourable leader of
the House.
How can the owner of the
building which is entered know whether the
constable or police officer who enters is a
true detective, and how will he be able to
make a distinction between a detective and
a thief?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am opposed to
that amendment, because I do not feel that
it will effect the object aimed at. Substituting -the word "believe" for the word
"suspect" is a mere absurdity. I do not
see any necessity for any part of the
clause. Under the law as at present, if
goods that are contraband are kept by any
pers.on unlawfully, a search-warrant may
be obtained and the officer armed with that
search-warrant may go and make an examination. It is not necessary to have a
clause to that effect. I say that no person,
whether he be an officer or not, should be
permitted to go into a man's house and
make a search of this kind on a mere suspicion or even belief. Some people would
believe anything.
Take a fellow like
Spracklin, for instance. Just imagine that
man. How much evidence would it b necessary for him to have in order to believe
that somebody was committing this offence?
And there are many Spracklins engaged in
this warfare against evil, so cal'led. Many
of the same type would use this law as an
engine of oppression-would use it to get
even with somebody they had a spite
against. That is what it would be used
for, and it is contrary to all sense of
justice-contrary to that good old maxim
that a man's house is his eastle. You are
taking down the castle walls, throwing
open the door and letting any man who
may be clothed in a little brief authority
to go in and commit any depredation he
pleases, on a mere suspicion in this case,
or, even in the other case, on a mere belief.
Honourable gentlemen, it seems to me that
is contrary to all sense of right or decency.
The people of this country can be made to
respect the law very much better if we
rely upon the ordinary means by which
other laws are supported and sustained,
rather than use extraordinary means that
do violence to every instinct of right that
there is in the people; and I say that for
the sake of the very object that the gentlemen who are behind this legislation have,
or claim to have, they should not be given
these extraordinary and outrageous means
Hon. Mr. DANIEL.

of harassing and abusing people who are
suspected, either rightly or wrongly, of
having drugs in their possession.
I recognize, as every man must recognize,
how unfortunate it is for the country that
these drugs are used as indiscriminately
as they are. I recognize, as every other
decent man in the country should recognize,
how necessary it is to stamp out the drug
habit. I realize as well, honourable gentlemen, that prohibition, taking away the
moderate use of liquors, has to a« certain
extent increased the drug habit throughout
the country, and this drug habit, which is
infinitely worse than the liquor habit, must
be stamped out. But let us not break down
all the safeguards that the ages have raised
about mankind. The individual in this
country has some rights, and we ought to
respect those rights and not pass legislation which would destroy them.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I want to add just a
few words to what has been so forcefully
and so well said by the last speaker. Every
man in a British possession is brought up
with the idea and belief that his home is
his castle. A man believes that he has a
right to resist, even to the taking of life,
any man who enters his place without a
warrant from a magistrate. A few months
ago an officer of the law entered a hotel in
the western part of this province; he was
resisted; the encounter resulted in the
death of the proprietor of that place.
It
was found that there was no
breach of the law committed there.
Shortly afterwards that same man saw
a vessel going up the St. Clair river, and
without any warrant he went aboard the
vessel. He knew the proprietor was a
reputable gentleman, living in that part
of the country. He walked into the place
and went through everything. He produced
two guns and held them out, and, although
he knew the gentleman whose place it
was, he rifled it from end to end. That
Temperance law allows a man to do such
things, but the word "vessel" was not in
the Act. The case was tried before judge
Middleton. Judge Middleton gave a verdict
of $500 damages against him for violating
the rights of Mr. Flemming. The Court of
Appeal upheld and affirmed that decision
and declared that the act was a most
improper and offensive one, and that
people had the right not to be invaded
without a warrant.
There is a great public prejudice against
officers walking into anybody's premises,

MAY 26, 1921
by night or by day, unless they bave gone
before a magistrate, laid the facts before
him, and satisfied him, that in the interest
of justice they should invade the premises.
I arn not at ail satisfied with the amendment. I think the whole section should be
struck out and that we should not allow
any officer who is without any responsibility, no matter what indignity he may
commit, to, enter a place at bis own instance.
Suppose that h'alf a dozen
rough-necks
enter
a
man's
house,
rouse the whole family, and searclh
ail the beds. They may without license or
warrant turn young women, old women,
boys and girls out of their beds, and search
through everything, and then say, "Well,
there was nothing there,1 and go off. If
you make the law, as suggested by this
amendment, an officer can go right through
a dwelling-house at any time of night or
day; he can turn the family out of their
beds; he can do anything he chooses. If
it is a vessel there may be people living
in it. At a great many places along the
shores of rivers there are people, including women, living in vessels. To give to
officers the power of search is, it seems
to me, most unfair.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is a crime.
.Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
is no responsibility, no matter what
indignity they may put upon people. There
is a responsibility upon the inagistrate
who grants a warrant, and there is in that
case some evidence. The officer must lay
the facts before the magistrate and the
niagistrate must pass upon theni before
he says that thej officer is justified in entering a man's bouse, or bis ship, or bis
store. I move tbat tbe wbole clause be
struck out.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I want to read the
section -in tbe Act as it stands to-day:
(7) If It be proved upon oath before atiy

niagistrate that there ia reasonable cause to
suspect that any drug kept or concealed for any
purpose contrary to this Act In any dwelllng
house, etore, shop, warehouse, outhouse, garden,
yard, vessel, or other place such magistrate may
grant a warrant to search by day or night any
such. place for such -drug, and If such drug la
there found, to bring It before hlm.

Surely this gives absolutely ail the
authority tbat is necessary. Ail tbat the
officer has to do is to go before a magistrate and lay befôre him the evideace be
lias, and if the magistrate decides tbat tbat
is sufficient and shows tbat there la, proper
cause for real suspicion-not tbe suspicion
that xnight be formed in a prurient mind,

but reial suspicion-then he grants a
warrant and the officer goes and niakes a
searcb.
The Hon. tbe -CHAIRMAN: The Hon.
Mr. Daniel wisbes to change his amendment to read:

"suspect" Ini the second lane, and by striking

135, an Act to amend the Ottawa Improvement Commission Act, 1919. Hon.
Mr. Michener in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-power given to dispose
of real property:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What makes
that legislation necessary? I do not think
the Ottawa Improvement Commission bas
any property of its own.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
so. I think it bas expropriated considerable property.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In the name of
the Commission?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I thought, in
the name of the Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
think, in the name of the Commission.
However, if it bas no property, it cannot
sell any.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is so, but
why authorize it to sell. What properties
does it want to sell?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do
not know what particular property it has,
but I understand that for the purpose of
carrying out the scheme which it bas in
view, the Commission expropriated a large
section of the property upon which the
improvements have been made. It may be
that some of the property vested in the
Commission is not being used by it -and
is not to be embraced in the plan of improvement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It often happens that the party exercising the right
of expropriation is obliged to buyHon. Mr. BELCOURT: More than
enough?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -More than
is neededHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -- because it
is advantageous as a business proposition
to do so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It may be
advantageous to take a whole lot and then
to sell the part that is outside the line.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) that under section 8 of the
Act constituting the Commission, "the
Commission may purchase, acquire and
hold real property in the city of Ottawa
and in the vicinity thereof," etc. So the
property is vested in the Commission, not

HAY AND STRAW INSPECTION BILL
OONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE--PROGRESS
REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
159, an Act to amend the Inspection and
Sale Act (Hay and Straw Inspection).
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
On section 1-presser of baled hay or
straw instead of seller to tag same with
his name and address and weight of bale:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend gave us an explanation of this Bill
yesterday; but, upon looking into the Bill
again, the explanation that he - gave does
not exactly appeal to me. As I understood
him, he said it had been found well to
change the word "seller" to the word
"presser," because the presser was the man
who had to do with the baling of the hay,
and therefore was the one who ought to be
held responsible for the quality of the hay
put into the bale. But could not the farmer
be held to be the seller? And would not the
man purchasing the hay àfter it was baled
have a right of action against the seller
if he was putting into the bale hay that
was not as it was represented to be? I do
not see that we are making any improvement, because the presser is only a man who
is hired for the purpose of pressing the hay.
He runs a baling press and puts on a ticket
showing the actual number of pounds of
hay in the bale.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
bas to do with baled h'ay only. It bas been
pointed out that the presser-the man who
has assumed the responsibility of pressing
the hay, although he may not have actually
done the labour-puts this upon the market
as his product. It may pass through halfa-dozen hands, and the difficulty would be
to throw the responsibility of attaching a
tag upon the seller, who knew nothing about
the contents of the bale. It was pointed out
in the other Chamber that the contents of
some of these bales disclosed most astounding articles which could not come under
the head of baled hay; for instance, the
skull of an ox was found in one bale.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is something
-like Mark Twain's jumping frog.

SENATE

18

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
I have no doubt the same resourcefulness
was applied to the pressing of the hay in
The hay may pass through
question.
half-a-dozen hands, -and as the Act stands
at present, every seller would have to attach
a tag to it, whereas the man originally
responsibile for the baling of the hay wouid
assume no responsibility whatever.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is it not exactly
the same in the case of apples? The original seller of a box of apples is responsible
for seeing that the right class of apple
goes into the box. He has to see that they
are properly graded and marked. The man
who first sells that box of apples, that is,
the owner of the orchard as a rule, is responsible, unless he takes them to a packing
bouse, when it becomes responsible. In this
case the farmer calls in the presser.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
man who calls in the presser to have his
hay put up is the presser; the other man
simply does the mechanical work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend touches a very important point
when he says it is the owner, in other
words, that should be reached. Very often
the presser is not the owner. I intend to
move a slight amendment which I think
will be of some advantage to the country
and to the reputation of our Canadian hay
on foreign markets. It will be noticed that
the word "seller," which is used in section
340 f, is changed to "presser;" so the section will now read:
Every presser of baled hay or straw in Canada shall affix to ,every bale of hay or straw
sold or offered for sale, a tag baving thereon
plainly written and legible his name and business address, and the weight of the bale.

And there his responsibility ends. He
has seen the hay and bas done the pressing; all he has to do under this clause is
to state its weight. I move to add the
words "and grade" after the word
"weight." Then it will read: "The weight
and grade of the bale."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does
the Act make provision for the grade?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, under
section 340. The presser knows the business thoroughly well and will give the
grade. I have been told to-day by a colleague that the presser is often a man
who goes from one farm to another, and
offers his services to, and has to do the
bidding of, the farmer. The farner says:
"You press my hay according to my desires, or I will not employ you." Very
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

often the presser is simply doing manual
labour, and moves about from place to
place.
I wish also to move to add at the end of
the clause these words:
If the hay is pressed for another party the
presser shall add the name and address of the
owner on such tag.

Then we have got the name of*the person who is responsible for its quality. You
have the name of the presser; or, if the
presser is simply doing the work for another, you have the name of the owner.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I do not interpret the word "presser" as the leader of
the Government seems to do. I do not
know how you are to determine that it
means the owner. I take the presser to
be the man who presses the hay. I think
we should settle the question of whether
it is the man who does the actual work
or whether it is the owner. I would take
the presser to mean the man who does
the pressing; and I think it should mean
him, because he would know more about
it than the owner.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If there
is any doubt about it, we would have to
put an interDretation upon the word
''presser."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment covers that.

My amend-

It is
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
evident that it is the man who places the
hay on the market for sale. He would have
to be a party in some way to the sale of
the hay.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Although the
pressing of hay is not exactly in my line,
I have had a good deal of experience in
that regard. In the western portion of the
province of Ontario more than half the
hay is pressed, not by the farmer, but by
a presser w4ho goes around from one farm
to another. A hay dealer purchases practically all the hay in one section of the
country and sends around a man with a
pressing machine. This man presses the
hay, and the owner may have nothing whatever to do with the baling of it or with
putting a tag upon it. Possibly the farmer
sold the hay before it was cut, in much the
same way that apples are sold. I think the
only person who should be responsible for
the weight of the hay is the man who does
the pressing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The mechanic?

MAY 26, 1921
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: You can hardly
call him a mechanie. These men are supplied with machines and teams and so on,
which cost a good deal of money, and they
go around from place to place and db the
work. The work is carried on as a special
business in our section of the country; and
those carrying it on are responsible men.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: What d'es the
"presser" mean?
Hon. Mr, PROUDPOOT: I take it to
mean the man who actually does the work
of pressing the hay. A moment ago someone referred to the packing of apples,
and to the position of the owner
of the apples.
I will give you an
instance of how the law works out in that
case. A client of mnine, an apple dealer, purchased 1,000 barrels of apples, subject to
the stamp placed on each barrel, under the
Fruit Act, which stated that they were of
a certain grade. He never saw the apples,
but simply bought then on the representation that they were of grade so-and-so.
He shipped them to Regina, where they
were sold. The fruit inspector there made
an inspection of the apples and said that
they were not in accordance with the
grade stamped on the barrel. My client
was prosecuted for having sold apples
which were not in accordance with the
grade stamped on the barrel, and was fined.
He had really no defence to the action.
I thought it was a case of hardship, and
I appealed it to the higher court, which
held that he was responsible. We thus
see the responsibility that is placed on the
owner, and he was called owner simply
because he was the owner at the time that
he actually shipped. My impression is
that the proposed amendment will be of
very considerable service; but I am still
very strongly of the opinion that the word
" presser " as used in the Act takes the
place of "owner," and that the presser
is the man who will be responsible, and
the one who should be responsible.
Hon. Mr. RATZ: L fail to agree with
my honourable friend on that point. A
presser is siiply a man employed by the
fariner. He goes around his machine and
presses the hay, the fariner employing him
and paying him so much a ton for pressing. What difference does it make to the
presser whether the hay is good or bad?
I think the fariner should be responsible
for the grade of hay. It should be sold
as first, second, or third quality.
The

presser has nothing whatever to do with
it, so far as I understand, eicept to complete his job of work.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I would like
to get an interpretation,of the word "presser " in this partiular section, and to find
to whom it refers.
Hon. Mr. RATZ: It refers to the man
who goes out with the machine.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The word "presser"
can mean only one thing, that is, the man
who- owns a hay-pressing machine and does
the pressing. It could only be the owner
of the hay, or some man employed by that
owner who had the machine to do the
work. I believe that a word should be used
to signify the man who grew the hay in
the first place, in place of the word
" presser."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I nm providing for that.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In regard to the
suggested amendment of my honourable
friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), I would say that many farmers
of this country know nothing about the
grading of hay, and in certain localities
I am not aware that they have to grade
the hay; they simply put it up in bales
and §ell it for what it is worth.
Hon Mr. DANDURAND:
Does the
presser know?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Even the presser
might not know how to classify hay; and,
while I believe it would be a good thing
to have hay classified, particularly for export purposes, I think there are many cases
in which it would be a hardship to have
any person go to classify it.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly): With the permission of the
House I would like to say a word or two
with regard to %thissubject, coming as I
do from a section where considerable hay
is pressed. There are two different ways
of pressing hay. In the iajority of cases
the hay shipper, as he is called in the
country, bas a press, and sends out men in
whom he has confidence, to do the pressing.
The other case is that of a man who owns
a press and is hired either by the shipper
The
or by the fariner to press the hay.
construction I would be disposed to put
upon the word "presser" in this case is
not the man who actually shoves the hay
into the press, but the man iesponsible
for having it pressed.

620

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GORDON: The owner?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Not necessarily the owner. There must be a place to
have the hay inspected, ýand it is necessary
to have a man capable of inspecting the
hay. The suggestion has been made that
the grower should be responsible for the
hay; but experienced men know that hay in
different fields varies a great deal, depending on the weather and on the curing. The
presser should have knowledge how to put
up hay that is of the same grade. I think
the word "presser" is the proper word, and
the responsibility is on the presser, because he is the only man qualified to say
what is in the bundle, as he saw it going
in. One bundle might come out all right,
while another would be a bundle of
damaged hay that should be put to one
side. I think the meaning of the word
"presser" here is the man responsible for
having the hay pressed, and whose duty
it is to see that it is pressed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to ask my honourable friend if he thinks
that stating the grade of the hay on the
tag is a proper amendment to make?
Is
there any one better qualified to add the
grade than the presser, when he knows the
grade through and through?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: There are men who
own pressing machines but who do not
know much about the classification of hay;
they know enough to press the hay, and
that is all. Are you going to compel that
man to sell his machine, or to be taken as
a man who can grade hay?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Surely my
honourable friend will admit that the
presser, whose business is to deal with hay,
is able to say what is prime timothy, No.
1 timothy, No. 2 timothy, No. 3 timothy,
No. 1 clover, No. 1 clover mixed, or No.
2 clover. There are inspectors throughout
the land. If any one is obliged to send for
an inspector to satisfy a purchaser who
calls for inspection, then the inspector
comes in. On what does be judge that
bale of hay--on a theory, or on the contents of the bale? And where has he had
any experience? It seems to me that a
man who has been a few years pressing
hay would be a first-class inspector. Why
not tell the presser, whose business it is
to deal with hay exclusively, that he
should grade his bale?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The presser in
most cases has almost nothing to do except what he is told. He hauls the machine
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN.

around from one barn to another, and he
puts up whatever a farmer gives him,
whether hay, stray, weeds, or whatever it
is. We have suffered great disability from
hay coming to our province from the province to which the honourable gentleman
belongs, and we have probably sent out
hay from our own province that is not
what it ought to be. There are dishonest
people everywhere. This Act has only been
in operation a year or two, and it has
worked hardship in administration, because
a man will sometimes refuse to take hay,
saying it does not come up to No. 1, No. 2,
or whatever was sold. Now, the word
"presser" is interpreted to mean a man
who hauls a machine fron barn to barn.
The word is wrong, if applied to the man
who puts up the hay, and if he is required
to place his name on each tag and be responsible for the grade of hay which is
put up in his barn.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is why I
have moved one amendment which adds to
the section the obligation on that party,
whoever he is for the moment, not only
to state the number of pounds but to tell
the grade, and having done that, I will submit this second amendment:
If

the hay is pressed by another party the

presser shall add the name and address of the
owner on such tag.
The Act says that if be presses for himself, then the act is complete, and be does
not need to make that declaration.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY:

It would be a

great advantage to do that.

The hay is

gathered up through the country from different parties; one man will have ten
tons, another fifteen, another twenty, and

all these will be put together in carloads;
and if the name is not on the tag, how
can the hay be traced back to the man who
sold the stuff that was not No. 1, No. 2,

or No. 3,

as the purchaser bought it?

There should be some way of identifying
the hay and connecting with it the man
that put in the trash, instead of putting
him in the same class as the one who sold

good timothy hay.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH:

I do not think the

honourable member fron Prince Edward
Island (Hon. Mr. Murphy) bas the right
line on this. The farmers do not press
the bay for the market. The dealer goes
through the country and buys one man's
hay for $10 a ton, and another man's
for $12, another's for $15, and so on. He
bas his pressers; he sends the men there

and presses the hay; he is the dealer who

MAY 26, 1921
ships the hay all over the country to other
dealers. Why should the farmer be made
in any way responsible? He sells the hay
loose, at the press. The party buying it
fron him judges it when it is in the loose,
sees the quality when he is buying, and
pays whatever he thinks it is worth. It
is questionalble how far you may go in
this matter. You should be very careful
how you describe the presser, because the
presser, the man that actually does the
work, is a hired man. He may be with
one man to-day and with another to-morrow; he is just working for his day's
wages; he has nothing to do with the price
that is paid for the hay, or the quality
of it, or anything else. It is the dealer
who goes around and buys the hay and
then sells it to the retailers who is responsible.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Who must be
responsible for the hay, in your opinion?
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: I would say that the
dealer who buys the hay loose in the barn
and sends his presser there.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Who
should grade it?
Hon. Mr. McHUGH:
I do not know
who should grade it or inspect it; I think
you are going to have a good deal of difficulty in that.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I understand that
the Government appoints inspectors for
hay under the Inspection Act, and it seems
to me it would be a mistake to change the
law at all. The seller ought to be the man
responsible. It matters not who is the
packer or presser; the man who sells the
hay is the one you look to for the quality
of hay that you are buying. The Act will
be somewhat like mixed hay if you change
it. The man who sells ought to settle the
grade.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The practice in
Ontario is not the practice in my province,
where the men all get together and press
the hay, and you never see it until it is in
bales.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The man responsible would be the seller.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The farmer, yes,
but the hay all goes together into a carload;
how can you settle who sold it? It would
not do any man any harm to put his'tag
on.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
I introduced this Bill I had not the slightest
idea there was so much involved in the

621

baling of hay. I thought I was able to
grapple with this amendment, but I am
entirely overcome. I move that the Committee rise and report progress and ask
leave to sit again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I will
submit my amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
if my honourable friend will place his
amendment on the Minutes I will be very
glad to submit it to those who purport to
be authorities on this subject.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That is one reason
why there should be a Research Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Progress was reported.

with this classification or organization: is
there any appeal from this to the Board

arrangement whereby appeals can be made

there any appeal of that kind from the

. I presume tbey were attached to tbe report; but was it, tbougbt that tbey were
too voluminous to print in the Minutes?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The Cierk informs
me tbat the definitions, and so on, were sO
voluminous that tbey were not printed witb
the report. The compensations are sbown
here. The other particulars are on file if
any honourable gentleman wishes to consuit theni. I may also informn tbe Huse
that tbe Civil Service Commission is printing ail these qualifications in a volume
wbicb wili be obtainabie.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not quite understand this report. Tbe Chief Accountant is bere reported as receiving $2,700.' Is
that the amount bis saiary was finaiiy fixed
at? Where is it shown?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Tbe cbange made
with regard to our Accountant is tbis. He
himself wisbed, and the Committee recommended, that be be classified as Cbief Accountant. The Civil *Service Commission
ciassified. bim as Chief Accountant of tbeý
Senate, wbicb was an entirely new classification, and tbe saiary attached to the classification "Chief Accountant" was very much
bigher tban that attacbed to the classification "Cbief Accountant of the Senate."
So, in order to equalize things, and to do
justice toour Chief Accountant, the Conimit-tee reeommended tbat he be classifled
ns Chief Accotintant of the Senate under
the departmentai grade of '<Chief Parliamentary Accountant, grade 5," wbich carries with it a salary equal to the salary
whicb he is now gettin.g. Tbat is tbe reason
of the cbange witb regard to the Accountant.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is tbat satisfactory to the Chief Accountant?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Yes, quite. It was
done, in fact, at bis request.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Bec ause be is a
very competent officer, and tbe Civil Service Commission certainly did not classify
him. according to bis abiiity, nor according
to the services that he bas to perforn.
There is no more important officiai in tbe
service of the Senate tban the.Chief Accountant. There is anotber officer who is
somewbat dissatisfied witb the classification
wbich. he bas received, and that is'the
Cierk of tbe Englisb Minutes and Proceedings and Journals.
An Hon. SENATOR: Who is be?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Mnt Jones, a very
competent official. He is not oniy Chief.

Clerk of English Minutes of Proceedings
and Journals, but he, acts as Clerk of
Speciai Committees. He has a great deal
of work to performi ahd bas had a long
training for bis work; and it does seemi to
me tbat, compared to the salaries tbat
otber nmen receive for services which are
nlot nearly so onerous, 'and wbicb do not
require sO mucb skili as tbe service he perfornis, bis salary is low. I say it is low
in comparison with other salaries tbat are
paid by tbe Senate-salaries wbicb are
fairly generous çonsidering tbe amount of
service performed. I notice tbat the Curator of tbe Reading Rooni is anotber man
who gets pretty smali pay. He only receives, $80 a month. Does tbat mean only
during the Session, or is it an annual
salary?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
besides.

There is a bonus

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Tbe bonus only
lasts during the bigh cost of living, and
butter is down now to about 25 cents a
pound. Does be get this for tbe wbole
year9.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes. I presume
tbe Curator is tbe mnan in cbarge of the
Reading Room.
An Hon. SENATOR: No, he is the Assistant.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He gets that the
year round. That is not bad pay, with a
bonus.
Hon. Mr. S HARPE: He gets a bonus
of $300..
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I tbink that the
Cierk of English Minutes, Mr. Jdnes, bas
personaliy brougbt bis case to tbe attention of every member of tbe Committee,
and tbat tbe Committee are satisfied tbat
bis compensation is equal to tbe services
rendered.
W'itb regard to tbe Assistant Curator
of tbe Reading Room, we were ail satisfied
that he -is a very good officiai, and we
wouid have been' glad to bave seen his
saiary raised; but the Civil Service Commission came to tbe conclusion that they
couid not raise bis salary so as to make it
equal to tbe Curator's, as would be the
case if bis saiary were raised, so tbat the
Assistant Curator and the Cureter wouid
be on tbe samne -footing. At the sanie time,
wbiie we were sorry that it could not be
done, the Committee did aiýl tbey couid
to get it raised; but I cali attention to the

Room there as against our two.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think they are
about the same.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like to
ask the Chairman of tCe Committee in
regard to this question of compensation.
Under the heading of Sergeant at Arms
of the Senate I read, "The compensation
for this class, which is at present," etc.
What is the object of raising the salary
of the Sergeant at Arms in this case?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: That comes in the
ordinary way, I guess, according to classification.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I do not think the
classification has been changed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We have made a
change, have we not, by appointing an
Assistant Mace Bearer? Can the honourable gentleman tell me what are the duties
of the Sergeant at Arms now?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would ask if the
duties are not defined by the regulations
of the Senate, or by some statute or some
principle that we may go on? I think
when a -man is ill we should take no exception to anything that can be done to
relieve him.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The Sergeant at
Arms is, now drawing $2,800, and has $80
more before ho reaches his maximum.
We seem to be
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
getting along pretty weIl without the usual
services of the Sergeant at Arms. Why
raise his pay because he does not attend
the House? My honourable friend is very
generous in voting away the people's
money; perhaps he would not be so generous in voting away his own. I think that
when a man who is able to perform his
duties acceptably, and does so, is put off
with a salary of $2,280, while a man who
is not here at all gets a salary of $2,800
and has it raised, it certainly looks as if
an invidious distinction were being made
between the two, and I want to know the
reason why.

The motion for concurrence in the report was agreed to.
NATIONAL RESEARCH BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Comnittee
on Bill 116, an Act to amend the Research
Council Act and to establish a National
Research Institute.-Hon. Sir James Lougheed. Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
the House -was last in Committee on this
Bill there was an amendment moved by
my honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and the House was
about to consider that amendment to my
motion for the adoption of section 13.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: There is a
motion before the Committee to adopt section 13, and iný amendment to that it has
been moved by the honourable member from
De Lorimier that the whole of Part Il be
deferred, with the exception of section 20.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Without desiring to enter upon a fresh discussion of the subject-because I presented my views to the House I think on
three or four occasions-I might say that
the reservation of the last section would
not be of any particular advantage, because if it is the sense of the House thai
Part II should be stricken out, it seems to
me that I should have to ask the leave of
the House to withdraw the Bill, inasmuch
as we already have in the statutes of 1917,
chapter 20, what would practically be the
same as Part I.
HonourHon. JOHN S. MeLENNAN:
able gentlemen, before the motion is put I
would like to say something upon this
subject, which is perhaps as well fitted

have overlooked the amount of work that
has been done in another place on this
subject. It is my opinion that on a matter like this Which is novel, which is somewhat complicated, which differs from most

cupied either as Senators of 'Canada or in
our private affairs, it would have been
most desirable to have had the suxbject taken
up by a joint comxmittee of the two Houses.
Failing that, I think the duty falis on us
to consider very carefully the report of the
Committee appointed and working in another place. It is quite obvious that that
report goes very thoroughly into the ques..
tion.
Witnesses were examined, flot oniy
men representing the scientifie side of our
greatest educational interests in Canada,
but severai men who were 'brought from
the United States and gave testimony along
these lines. It is quite evident from that report that the Committee did not begin
its work, so far as ail its niembers were
concerned, 'with 'any bias in faviour of
establishing the Council; but it is quite
evident that ibefore ýtheir sittings were
completed they ail agreed as to the
establishment of the Institute proposed in
the second part of this Bill.
The Comnmittee made its report, which.
was exhaustive; it went before, and was
unanimously adopted in, another place; indeed, since I have been in the Senate, 1
have neyer known such unanimity as was
found in the remarks made in that other
place on this subi ect, except when the
Parliament of Canada was weicoming'some
distiniguished visitor from abroad such as
Monsieur Viviani or Mr. Balfour, or in
accepting the Speaker's Chair the other
day.
If honourable members will tura
to the Debates of the 7th of May of last
year, they will flnd that the report of that
Committee, on which the present Bill is
based,, was found acceptable to both sides
of the House, and was not criticised. This,
it seems to me, gives it such importance that
I think we should ibe very careful how we
deal with a Bill of this kind.
It seems to nme, also, that the great thing
*we need in this country at this thTke, with
the burdens we no-w have to bear, and wil
have to bear for generations, is increased
,production, not oniy in the priniary prodùucts of our fields and forests, 'but in
carrying that~production to the very highest stage of development, so that instead
,of selling raw 'materials to other countries for them to work up, in order to pay
our debts, we should increase the national
weaith by seling ail those products in
the very highest stage of development
that can possibly be reached in this
country. We require also the elimination
of waste, and the turning into riches of
material that is now burned up or is allowed to rot, or thàt runs to waste in our

S-40J

rivers. These are the directions in whieh
an enormously increased
amount of
wealth can 'be produced in Canada without exhausting any further our natural
resources. Such increase of wealth nieans
that we shahl have to invent and develop
new processes, and this can only be done
by devehoping research, Which is beyond
the capacities of industriai organizations,
and demands co-operation with someone in
the lead. We are aIl proud of those of
our forebears who were pioneers in the
deveiopmnent of this country, who miade
homes in~ the wihderness, and brought Canada to its present stage of deveiop-ment.
In the samne way, the man of science is
the pioneer of a settled aïnd industrial
life, who goes forward and brings
back riches by processes he has discovered.
For this reason he is a man of enormous
importance to the deveiopment of the country's riches, upon which so, much dependsupon which we rnay say everythink depends; because we not only 'have present
obligations, but we need as nnrch as we
can possilbhy get for the development of'
the country alon'g new lines as well as
old.
I think that what brings home the necessity for higher education is the fact that
in the 'United Kingdom, in Europe, and
in Canada to-day the universities and technical schools are crowded to their doors.
The great universities of England have
ne room «for the mnen who are coming.
That la one of the products of the war, in
which it was brought home to every man
who flred a shot, to every one who had to
suppiy instruments of precision, that m'uch
cf the scientific knowiedge which. in its
original form seems -far beyond practical applications, of w 'hich you will find
in this report many an example, was
absoluteiy necessary. They found in the
stress of war that they as individuals,'and
we as individuals, did not know enough.
The chief argument against this proposai, as I gather'from the debate in this
Huse, was that, whatever opinion the
blouse might have as to the desirability of
e.stablishiing this Institute, the present time
was inopportune on account of the expense. I hoh'd, as firmly as any man in this
bouse does, the opinion, that we as a
people, both through our Governinent and
individlually, are spending too inuch xnoney;
but it seems to me that it is undesirable
that we should begin retrenchment with
this thing, which promises a greater return than any other similar kind «f undertaking. We might have cut down on a

number of things. We do not need to dwell
in marble halls. However that may be,
the results that are promised, and the
results that have already been achieved,
ought to be borne in mind. Think, honourable gentlemen, of the fact, which seems
to be throughly established now, that the
lignites which underlie so large a part of
the Northwest Provinces, can by a process
worked out by men of science and by
.ndustrial engineers be made available as
a fuel which is perfectly satisfactory and
will be cheap. That is an enormous advantage. I am told that this Institute has
.n process, and very near completion, the
remedy for two things which seriously
affect our great seaport industry, fishing.
I refer to redrspot in cod and to what is
called black-spot in canned lobsters. Other
members of this House know better than
I do how vastly important the elimination
of those will be. I understand that the
investigations are nearing completion, if
they have not already been completed,
which will lead to a complete triumph
over those diseases, which to so great an
extent have lessened the value of our
fisheries. Similar processes will go on with
regard to other things, and for us to defer,
possibly for a year, or indefinitely, the
carrying on of such work as this-not
only the work that is actually going on,
but the work which will be developed, and
which has appealed not only to men of
science, but also to most of the organizations in the country, such as boards of
trade, Canadian clubs, Kiwanis clubs, etc.,
and has already secured the gratuitous
services of over one hundred Canadian men
cf science-is in my opinion a poor way
for us to begin our retrenchment. It is
not altogether fitting that we should overlook completely the work that has been
done, thoroughly and with entire utanimity, in another place. Therefore it
seems to me that, even if the proposed
expenditure were vastly larger than is
now intended, we would be perfectly
justified in carrying on this work. The
country needs it, and all those who have
given encouragement and thorough attention to it seem to think it is desirable.
We have done a good deal in the way of
training men for work of this kind. The

Britain during the war. They were called

tioned here. But the point to which I want
specially to draw your attention is that,
with this absolute certainly that we have
the right kind of men we want those men
to work, so far as possible, at home. Edison, who is one of the greatest inventors
that this continent has ever known, was
a Canadian.
And Bell, who has done
more than anyone else for the transmission of intelligence from one person
to another, spent all his early years in
Canada.
The great Mellon Institute in
Pittsburg, which is referred to over and
over again in this report, was organized
by a Canadian professor.
In the course of this investigation one
of the witnesses examined, whose whole
evidenee is extremely interesting, and who,
although a namesake of mine, is, I regret,
not Canadian-4born although living in
Canada, says this:
When you look over Canada you find you
have two great factors available. You have a
considerable amount of labeur here, and you
have intellect-none better in the world. I speak
of that from actual contact with it, and from
knowledge of it. You have a virility, a freshness of mind, a broad outlook, and a resourcefulness which ts not excelled in the whole world
to-day.
That is my deliberate opinion, based
on a consideration of actual results achieved.
But you are not utilizing both of these resources to the limit. Some years ago I had an
opportuni.ty of looking into this subject, and I
tabulated a list of the di.stinguished graduates
of the universities of this country who had left
Canada to go to the United States to occupy
academic and scientific positions, and that list
was published in one of the Toronto papers, one
name after another, and it flled the whole
page. There were hundreds of the brightest intellects this country has ever produced who had
to go to the United States to earn a livellihood,
and they are there still helping to staff the
universities and assisting in building up the
great industries of that country. You lost, in
my judgment, a considerable portion in that
way of the best and most vitalized product that
this country ever produced. That same movement is going on to-day and at an ever-increasing rate.

' This Bill, carefully thought out, based
on evidence, and as a result of that evidence satisfactory to the people who will
work out the scheme, and for the most part
work it out without a salary, is a sten
by which we can keep those men at home,
and I think, honourable gentlemen, that instead of waiting till some later time we
ought to make it now.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Did I understand
the honourable gentleman to say that the
men working in the Institute would work
without 'salary? I do not think that is
the case.

through the Director, or, in case of illness, suspension or absence of the Director, or in the
case of a vacancy in the office of Director,
through an acting Director temporarily appointed by the Council.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I for one would
certainly attach a great deal of importance ta what has been said ta the effect
that after the war, loaded down as we
are with a heavy debt, we cannot afford
ta spend lavishly the money belonmging ta
the country. I readily admit that. It seems
ta me, however, that the honourable gentlemen who have taken that position exclusively have not perhaps given te this
measure all the attention and study that it
really deserves. I should like ta amplify
briefly what bas been said by the honourable member for Cape Breton (Hon. Mr.
MpLennan).
This measure comes ta us
very highly recommended. It comes with
the recommendation, first of alli, of five
ministers of the Crown, who were members of the Honorary Advisory Council.
One of the Ministers we count amongst our
own members-one of ourselves. It comes
also with the recommendation of twelve
scientists whose names are widely and most
favourably known throughout the country.
These gentlemen have for four years devoted a large portion of their time ta pre'liminary work, which bas led ta the conclusions set forth in the Bill. I will name
these gentlemen. It is worth while, be-

SENATE
cause the fact that for four years they
have devoted the best of their time and
attention to the project which has now
taken the form of this proposed legislation may induce honourable members of
this House to consider it a little more
favourably and to bestow upon it some
measure of generosity, such as this Parliament should show to projects of this
kind. First of all, there is Dr. MacalIlum.
I do not need to say who he is; his name
is known from one ocean to the other, and
he now occupies a very high position. He
has been selected by the Rockefeller Institute to make an investigation in China.
Then there is Dr. Adams, who is Dean of
the faculty of Applied Science of McGill
University. And Sir George Garneau. To
the members from the Province of Quebec
it is sufficient to give his name. He is
one of the most d'istinguished chemists
that we have in this country. Then there
is Mr. W. L. Goodwin, of the faculty of
Applied Science of, Queen's University.
There are Mr. Lloyd Harris, a very well
known industrial man of this country; J.
C. McLennan, Professor of Physices and
director of physices laboratory, University
of Toronto; A. S. Mackenzie, President of
Dalhousie University; W. C. Murray,
President of the University of Saskatchewan; R. A. Ross, consulting engineer, and
very well and favourably known 'in the
City of Montreal; R. F. Ruttan, Professor
of Chemistry and director of chemical laboratories' of McGill University; Arthur
Surveyer, consulting engineer, of no small
repute, of the city of Montreal.
This Bill is the result of the painstaking
labour of these gentlemen, who for four
years have devoted theih time to the interests of this country without exacting
any compensation whatsoever.
The suggestion coming from this Advisory Council was referred to a Committee
of the House of Commons. I do not intend
to name the members of that committee;
but if my honourable friends on the other
side knew-I am somewhat under the impression that they do not know-who composed that House of Commons committee
which for two years studied this proposal
and unanimously recommended it to the
Commons, who in fact adopted it with the
greatest unanimity, they would change
their minds a little as to the usefulness,
timeliness, and urgency of this measure.
The committee of the House of Commons
did not proceed without all the information necessary for dealing with a project of
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

such great importance. What did they do?
They called in as advisers men of science
who are known from the Atlantic to the
Pacific-men not only from our own country,
but also from the great republic to the south.
Amongst the well-known men living outside our borders who appeared as witnesses
before the committee was Mr. Hamor, the
Assistant Director of the Mellon Institute
of Pittsburgh, an institute known the world
over for the excellent work it has performed in the past thirty years. The Committee also called in Dr. Stratton, Director
of the Bureau of Standards, of Washington, D.C., a very distinguished man. at the
head of a very important institution of the
same kind in the United States. What was
the report made by this committee? I beg
of my honourable colleagues a few minutes
of patience while I take the liberty of
reading a part of their report. It seems to
me this is the quickest and most adequate
w'ay to cover the ground. This is what the
report says in part:
Your Commtttee, the majority of whom
served in a similar capacity last year, having
further considered the whole matter in the
light of the evidence and material already adduced have no hesitation in stating that the
urgency of action to be taken to establish a
National Research Institute to promote scientific
and industrial research in Canada is patent to
ail who know what ts being done abroad in
this line.
There is in Canada no organization which
even distantly approaches the character of any
of the research institutes established abroad or
now being established.
Great Britain has the National Physical
Laboratory at Teddington, near London. Germany bas two research institutes, one physical
and the other chemical. In France and Italy
measures are being taken to organize research
institutes. The United States has a National
Bureau of Standards at Washington, to whi.ch
is also now attached a laboratory building of
exceedingly ample accommodation, to be devoted to industrial research. The amount spent
by the Bureau exceeds two million dollars a
year. The Commonwealth Government of Austraia is establishing an institute of science and
industry. An institute for research known as
the Cawthorn Institute is being established at
Nelson, New Zealand, by private benefaction.
Japan is foundi.ng a National Research Institute, for which already ample funds have been
obtained from the Emperor, the Government and
from private sources.
It is evident, therefore, that Canada, to meet
the international competition which the work of
these laboratories will serve to accentuate very
greatly, must have a National Research Institute,
which wil'l place at the command of the country ail the resources of science and further the
development of the natural wealth of the country to meet the huge burden of debt imposed
by the war. The developed wealth of Canada,
as compared with that of the United States, is
small. If the naturai resources of the Dominion, were appropri.ately utilized, its developed

MAY 27, 1921
weaith xnight readily be as much as ten times
what it is now. The conversion of our natural
resources into developed wealth, howe'ver, can
only be accomplished. through the application
to them of science of the inost hIghly advanced
type.
To take one Instance. enly, ta show howý vital
research is to Canada, it may be pointed out
that the high grade Iran ores of the world are
being exhausted, and, in consequence, the lower
grades must in the very near future be alone
avaliable. (if these Canada has an enormoue
suppiy in areas distributed from the Atlantic tc
the E"aciflc. We are to-day Importlng annuatly
at least $150,000,000 worth of are, iran, anÈ
steel, and their products.

I think last year it was very close tc
$200,000,000.
If research could show us how to utilize commercially aur own low-grade Iran ores in competition with forei.gn high-grade ores we would
nlot anly bu!ild up important mining and mTanufacturing industries throughout Canada, but as
well avoid remnitting vast sums aba'oad.
It may be pointed out also that in Great
Britain the industrial flrms Ln a large number
,of Uines of Industry are now being organized
under the auspices of the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research inta Trade
Associations for Research. The"e Industries ,wil
thereby be put in position of enormous advantage as regarde production. The National
Research Couneil of the United iStates is arganizing similar associations In the United States
ta meet competttion from abroad. In Canada
the organîzation of similar bodies, "Guilfis for
Research" must be encouraged by being associated with a National Rtesearch Institute.
Tour Committee believe the flrst step towards

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Will the honaurable gentleman say what report he is
reading £rom?
Hon. Mrt. BEAUBIEN: I arn reading
irom the report made by the Special Cammittee of the Hanse of Commons.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: What is the date
Of it?
Hon. Mr'. BEAUBIEN: The 27th of
April, 1920. This report was submitted
ta the Hanse of Commons last year, and
was unanimously approved; and the
measure came up again this year with the
resuit that it *as equally unanimously accepted and sent ta this Hanse. Therefore
I think I am right when I say that I
think this measure deserves from. us more
than passing attention. It comes ta us
backed by the best knowledge we have

bâ1

in the country; it cornes after two years
of study hy the three parties in the other
House; and it seems to me that if there
was any chance of waste or lass of money,
the measure, being a Government measure,
might have met very seriaus criticism, if
not from their direct opponents, fram
those situated diagonally from the Government.

Now, honourable gentlemen, the position
is simple. War has not only impoverished
every country in the world, but has rendered efficiency in every nation an absolute
We cannot waste
and urgent necessity.
as we have done in the past-and I do not
think any nation has wasted sa much as
our own in the last fifty years. Why, I
arn told that in two paper plants we are
still wasting enough woad alcohol ta provide ail that would be requi.red throughout
the country for our industrial needs. But
stili the loss continues.
The honourable gentleman who spoke a
moment ago in favour of this measure
The Advisory Council,
spoke of lignite.
without being paid one cent, experimentedwith lignite, and with 'what result? The
resuit is that now they are making
briquettes of lignite which are equal in'
value te anthracite, and much lower in
price. If that is the case, as 1 have no
doubt it is, it seems that the solution of
aur great problem, as ta the importation
of coal from. the United States bas been
found. Every year this country is im-

paverished ta the tune of $100,000,000

which we spend in the United States for
coal; and we could get an equivalent fuel,
and get it immediately, if- the process
which is now being applied with success
were applied throughout the West, where
there are enarmous quantities of lawgrade co'ai.
The same remark applies ta peat. I
see some doubt written on the faces af
gome of my honourable colleagues in this
Hanse. But what isthe fact? The men
who have given their time ta the country
for nothing for four years have made
enormous, strides in the development of
the process required. Last year they sold
na less than 5,000 ton-s of peat af excellent
quality.at $5 a ton; and they cauld have
sold much mare if they had been able ta
manufacture it. This year they are gaing
What
ta seli nlot iess than 10,000 tons.
does that mean? It means everything. We
have peat in enarmous quantities in al
parts of this country. Gentlemen belonging ta the Advisory Cauncil have made
three machiines-one for a small, one for

632

SENATE

a medium, and one for a large bog; and,
when that process is brought to perfection,
fuel can be taken from almost any part
of this country and made available at a
very low cost.
But there is more. If we must fully
develop our natural resources, and stop
absolutely the losses that we have been
incurring, there is something equally
pressing. Practically all the other countries of the world, taking example from
Germany which, after all, bas led in organization for many years, are bringing
together all the different industries to a
central focus of science. These industries
bring their problems to the Institute and
get them solved. In order to give you a
better idea of how this Institute works,
allow me to quote from a speech in another
place. I think the words used there will
show better than I can exactly what
benefit may be derived by industry from
such a Research Institute:
Some question was raised as to the exact
working of the institute, and I thought it would
perhaps make i.t more easily understandable
if I explained for a moment how that is done
in the neighbouring republic. Take, for instance,
the Mellon Institute, Pittsburg, which while its
overhead is paid by the munificence of two
prominent bankers-one of whom, if I am not
wrong, is now the Treasurer of the United
States-is otherwise managed on a commercial
basis. There you have a huge building, divided
into laboratories with a highly trained scientiflc
staff in charge, and the associations of industry
of the country are free to go there and, if there
be room, te either place their own scientist or
have the institute select a scientist to solve the
problem in which they are interested. They pay
the entire expense of the scientist and ln addition a share of the expense so -far as heat, light
and power are concerned. A significant thing,
which the minister bas touched on, is this: the
Mellon Institute will not take a research problem on for less than one year, and it strongly
advises a period of two or three years towards
an effort at solution. Well, an association appli.es-for instance the Laundry
Association
which contains some 1,800 members scattered
all over the Uni.ted States-and
secures
a
scientist to investigate its problems. What happens? If there be room this man will first confer with the beads of the insti-tute. Next he
will go to the well-equipped library with which
the institute is furnished, and for a week, or
two weeks, or three weeks will study the situation from the point of view of present knowledge. When everything in that respect has been
ascertained he will go to one of the -member
factories of the association so as to get a
practical knowledge of how the problem i.s
affected by every day working conditions. That
may take one or two weeks. Then back he will
come and establish himself in the laboratory
and with the advice and assistance of a wonderful band of young and energetic scientists he
will go to work and in the most extraordinary
fashion, solve what were at one time considered
insoluble problems.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

This is exactly what it is sought to do
now. I do not think it is at all the plan
of those who recommend this legislation
to set up an expensive laboratory and
machinery that would cost many millions. That is not the case. The purpose
is to erect a large and well-suited building,
divided into laboratories, and to have only
those utensils or machines whicb are absolutely necessary, and then to turn them
over to the use of private industries. Of
course, a staff will be required. No institute like that can get along without a very
competent staff. There will be a first-class
man at the head of it, who will surround
himself with young men who to-day, in
order to find some occupation after they
have acquired knowledge in the universities, are obliged to expatriate thenselves
and go to the United States.
What
was the
condition of things
four
years ago when the Advisory Council was asked by the Government
to try to form an association into which
could be brought all those who could
make an investigation for the Government?
They found that practically every man of
value in this country who had graduated
from our universities, which are excellent
in their teaching, had been obliged to go
and seek their occupation in another land.
But what can you do with these if you
have no workshop in which to set them
to work? Do you want them to build up
the industries of other countries, or do you
want them to build up your own industries?
-that is the question. Do you want your
men of brains to work with your neighbours
in competition against you? That is the
question, and it is a simple one. I know
that we have no money to spend uselessly;
but is there one need that is more pressing than that of research in our country,
where we have so much to develop, so much
loss, so much waste of material and where
our industries have been practically drifting because-let us admit it-they did
business too easily before the war? Our
industries need to be whipped into shape,
brought into line with the best possible
methods. In fact, there is not a country
in the world which so much requires and
deserves an institute of this kind as
Canada.
Gentlemen, I have the greatest respect
for some honourable members who have
spoken here, because I know they are honest, and although some of them are professional- men they are still directors of industrial life. But I put it up to them: is it
fair for them, after spending an hour or
two on this Bill, to set up their own judg-

ment and knowledge against that of those
twelve men who have been working for
four years on this idea, who are specialists
in what we want to accomplish? Let me
add this. The people of our country are
110w very easiiy educated;
newspapers
circulate everywhere, and publie opinion is
behind this measure. Therefore I ask you
to alldw me to make.another quotation in
reference to publie opinion on this proposal.
This is what was said by the chairman of
the Committee of the House of Commons
_when hie reported on the measure:

ment a proposition which ineant establisbing
as many research Institutes as there were uni-

Almost every board of trade in the country
and mnany other bodies besides have passed
resolutions of the etrongest cbaracter In favour
of the Institute.

-it w.as clear that it would be bad for the
univereities, and flot the best tblng for Industrial research. 1 feel that to saddle the
unIversities wLtb the probîsîn df carrying on
the industrial research of the country would
be subversive of the beet interests of the universities, and wd
lot be conducive to the
best kind of Industrial researcb, for this reason:
it bas already been brouglit out but 1 think it
needs emphasizing-the wbole strengtb of a
university's research lies In Ite perfect freedom,
in lis being absolutely untrammelled.

But, gentlemen, this measure is supported not mereiy by the most highly
educated class of the country. Let us go
to labour. The honourable Minister of
Labour is here, and I am sure he will bie
ready to subseribe to what is said as to the
approval given by labour to this measure:
Labour, too, has expreseed itef
In unmlstakable ternis, In favour of this Instituts. The

Congress of Labour and other labour bodles
have passed strong resolutions.

One objection bas been made which I
admit impressed me as being of great importance, and fora while I wavered over
it. The objection was this: "You have now
centres of learning-your universities; why
don.'t you contribute to their funds-it
would not cost as much-and you will have
an excellent result?" I will not give my
own answer to that objection; I prefer to
give the answer of a university president.
No man was more interested than he was
in urging the Government to make grants
every year, to give bursaries or scholarships, to bis own university. But what does
he say, gentlemen? This is what President
Mackenzie of Dalhousie University says:
That isa one point of vlew. I would like to lay
before the committee another point of view.
Suppose you selected three or four universities
throughout the country and saîd: we will subsidize these only. 1 arn assulning now that subsidizing research in universities ls a good thing
for industral research. Suppose youf did subsidIze them, what I want to bring out is that
every 005e of these universities would feel that
it ought t0 be able to take up any problem,
whether in rubber, in electrieity, or in blology
-make it as diverse as you like-and for them
to be satisfied or 10 bie effective they would
wish to be S0 organized and so staffed and
equipped that they could take care practIcally
of any Problein that mig!ht arrive, flot only in
their own neighbourhood, but throughou& the
country. That meant what? It nieant that You
would recluire to have flot one large central
inetitute, as we propose, but a central institute
at every university. The economtc signlicance
of this phase of the matter la so obvious that
we feit we couid flot lay before the Govern-

versities, and whlob would resuit in cont-inuous

insistent cails and diemande upon the Government.
There je one other phase of the question that
1 wish to biring out. It is flot oniy that this
would flot be a proper proposai flnancially to
lay before a governînent, but froîn the standpoint of the majorlty of the CouncII--I mnigbt

And I muet add that the majority 'are

if you do not confide to the univerthis work of iuduàtrial research,
is absoiutely necessary and urgent,
are'you going to do it? Assign it
industries of this country? They
are not strong enough, even in the repuhîle
to the south, where their capital is a hundred times what ours is. They are not
powerful enough in Great Britain, where
thiey are immenselly more wealthy than our
own. Why, in Great Britain, when industries f orým themeelves into guilds, the
Government grants to each of them. a very
large appropriation every year to, make
such researches. What wouid you do?wouid you adopt the same plan? Would you
get ail your firms whipped into line, get
them to join, and then give them a subsidy
which you could n "oteasiiy control? If so,
what would be the result? Then you wouid
have ten, fifteen or Vwenty centres of re-

search ail through the country, whereas you
could have had one with the beet possible
kn'owiedge at your disposai, with the beet
men in the country absoiutely under your
control; and there you could find the solution to many a problem urgently required,
flot' oniy in the development of the
country, but in niethods to stop waste, and

in perfecting and harmonizing our indus,
tries and making them more efficient
throughout the whoie Dominion.
For these reasons,*honourable gentlemen,
I hope that this measure will be allow*ed to
pass. If it is, not, I cannot but feel that
this Huse .is assuming a very serious
responsiýbility.

334

SENATE

Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, my honourable friend who bas just
spoken has given some very good reasons
for going on with this Bill; but still
I do not think they are sufficient to justify
the country at the present time in proceeding with this project. I am rather
inclined to be in sympathy with the amendment that will cut off the second part
of the Bill. My honourable friend quoted
very largely from a report made to the
House of Commons a year ago last April.
Well, the conditions have changed a good
deal since that time, for the Minis.ter of
Finance then stated that we were through
with adding to our debt, and that from
that time forward we would pay as we
went along, and would begin to reduce our
debt that had been piled up during the
war. But what bas been the result? We
are in a very different position to-day:

our debt is over $100,000,000 greater than
it was a year ago, with every prospect of
our finances going behind this year from
$120,000,000 to $150,000,000.
While this
report was made at that time in good faith,
present conditions are so different that it
is a serious question whether we are justified in going on and undertaking what is
bound to be a tremendous expense year
after year, and something about which
the Government is not able at the present
time to give us any definite information.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Would my honourable friend allow me? It is true that
the report was made last year, but it was
brought up again this year, and on the 28th
of April, 1921, it was submitted to the
House, debated, and accepted, unanimously.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That may be, but
at that time they possibly did not know
that we were going to lack so much in
revenue, or to go back further to the extent
of over $100,000,000 during the present
fiscal year. Therefore it seems to me it
would be a policy of wisdom to go easy
on this matter. There is no great rush
for it. My honourable friend pointed out
what may be done in. the way of treating
ion ore. Well, we now bring the ore from
Newfoundland to Nova Scotia, and we
have one of the best deposits of ore on
the face of the earth, and not low-grade
but high-grade ore. It is landed right
at the smelters, and the limestone is
landed right at the mouth of the coal
pit; and they claim, or at least they did
claim, that they could manufacture steel
cheaper than at any other place on earth.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

.

Hon. Mr. McLÈNNAN: They said pig
iron. They still make pig iron, but not
steel.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not want
to interrupt my honourable friend, but
I know he does not want to create a false
impression in this. House. Does he know
that practically 96 per cent of the iron
ore is imported into this country?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: From Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, I said the ore
The
was brought from Newfoundland.
ore is not Canadian ere, but it is landed
in Canada very cheaply, and it is manufactured in Canada, and they claimed they
could make the cheapest steel on earth.
My honourable friend says that they
manufacture pig iron. I was down there
and went through the mills, and I saw
them manufacturing ship-plates; they were
not manufacturing very cheaply though.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I said that the
claim was that they made pig iron cheaper
than any place on earth, but that the cost
of converting that pig iron into steel prevented them from saying that about steel.
They make excellent steel, however.
- Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
I accept my
honourable friend's correction. What is
this Research Council going to do with
iron and steel? If you cannot make cheap
steel where you are getting good ore
delivered very cheaply right at the smelters, which are right at the mouth of the
coal pits, with a mountain of limestone
right beside them, how are you going to
make cheap steel out of poor ore and
compete with the world? That is what
bothers me; and' I do not think we are
.ustified in going into greater expense in
order to test that out, at least at the
present time. As to wood alcohol, the
people of Canada do not want any information; they know that wood alcohol can be
saved, but why do they not save it? They
do not need any reports from the Research
Council as to that.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Because we have
not found a way of utilizing wood alcohol,
for instance, for>Ynotor or other purposes
for which petroleum is now used; that is
the reason. But we are coming to that,
and we shall reach that point sooner if
we have scientists working on the problem.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I have no doubt
that this Research Council would be a good
thing, and that those men who are re-

MAY 27, 1921
commending it are d'oing so in perfectly
good f aith, and that they are able men.
My honourable friend states that we are
educating young men in our different universities, and they cannot get any work ln
Canada, and have to go to another country,
nieaning the United States, to get employment.
In research
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
work, I say.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend did not put it that way. I know that
there are-many hundreds and thousands
of scientific Arnerican experts in various
lines who corne over frein the United
States and locate in Canada and get work
here. So that while we send men to the
United States, many of the saine class
-frm there corne and work in this country.
*My honourable friend refers to the work
these scientific men have done for nothing,
and says that now they corne asking that
this project be put through; but I wouid
point out that while those twelve good mer
niake recommendations, we have to pay the
piper. That is the whole question, to my
mind; and the ground on which 1 arn going
to vote in favour of the amendinent is
that, however good the idea rnay be, it is
nlot advisable to go on now, considering
the present financial condition of the country, when two or three years after war
has closed, we are going back hundreds
of millions of dollars every year. It seems
to me that this is a turne to practise
economy, and nlot go into an expenditure
of this nature, when we have no idea what
the end will be. Once you start and sink
a f ew millions, you must go on and keep
the institution toing, whether we get the
results or not. I think it wouid be very
.advisabie for the Senate to let the matter
wait for at least another year. There will
be no great loss, and we may save a good
deai of money.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: With reference
to the question of iron ore, I would like
to say that there are on the north shore
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence enormous
deposits of extraordinarily high-grade ore
that only require the sand to be dug out
in order to be utilized.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: 1 would join with
the honourabie gentleman froin Montarville
<Hon. Mr. Beaubien) in going into this
'project if we could commence by finding
out the amount of expense that will be
iiivolved; but I arn not willing to start out
-without being informed at ail, and it is
claimed that we are not. We shouid knov

fâ

the expense involved in erecting proper
buildings, in furnishing suitable laboratories, and in setting up an efficient

referred to matters which are not very
good examples, in order to establish the
point he wanted to make. He referred te
peat. Weil, that investigation was made in
this way. Officiais of one of the departnients went to Norway and Swedeni and
ascertained under what conditions peat
was treated, and by making experiments

obtained valuable resuits. The honourable

have two universities that are now

by them in the meantime.
Hlon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I want to add
just one word, perhaps te enlighten my
h-onourable friend, if he will allow me.
I know that this matter requires very
long study. 1 arn weli aware that I have

what amount wiil require to be voted, and
on what it wiil be spent. The total appropriation would be $650,000.

just a few words. When we reached Part

were dealing with a proposal which would
represent. a very large expenditure. We
did not know the figures; we now have

MAY 27, 1921
to do would be to withdraw the Bill entirely.
To begin with, it is a Bill which is very
badly drafted. It seems to contain conflicting provisions; at' all events, some of
its 'provisions are very difficult to explain.
I should think that the Government ought
simply to withdraw the Bill, with the understanding that this means, not that they
have given up the idea of establishing a
Research Institute, of this sort, but that
they have deferred ta the sentiment of
this House, as expressed by the vote which
bas just now been taken, that the expenditure is really more than the Government
ought to undertake at this juncture. We
are all apparently in favour of an Institute
of this kind being created at some time
or other.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
would you suggest that we should do it?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Next year, or
perhaps in two years-it is difficult to say;
but for my part I should be very sorry if
the impression were created, because of the
vote just now given, that this House is
against the proposition.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I know it does,
but let us not leave that impression. I do
not think it means that. I think many
honourable gentlemen who voted for the
amendment want ta see an Institute of this
sort established at some time or other, but
do not think this is the time for it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think I
could give the date when that Institute
should be started-and I would appeal ta
my honourable friend's judgment regarding his own private affairs: when we have
re-established equilibrium in our conditions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can
my honourable friend suggest when that
will be?

COPYRIGHT BILL

MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 12, an Act ta
amend and consolidate the Law relating
to Copyright.
He said: Honourable genitemen, in November, 1908, the Convention of Berne,
respecting copyright, was signed at Berlin.
This subject of copyright bas been discussed in Parliament on many occasions,
and it has always been difficult to arrive
at a conclusion as ta what our Copyright
Act should be.
Honourable gentlemen
will recalil that a few sessions ago a Copyright Bill was introduced in the Senate.
It was referred ta a special committee,
and two or three weeks were occupied in
considering and discussing it, without our
coming ta any satisfactory conclusion. On,
I think, two occasions since then the subject has been brought before Parliament;
during the present Session with apparently more success than at any previous
time. The Bill now before us, which bas
come from the Commons and bas, so far as
I can learn, received their unanimous
support, is one which will permit of Canada becoming a party ta the Berne Convention. There have been some contentious
features in the question, and we have been
able, I think, ta reconcile, ta a considerable
degree at any rate, the conflicting interests
that presented their views ta Parliament.
It would appear that there bas been more
or less conflict and contention between the
author and the publisher. This measure
very happily reconciles as nearly as possible their differences.
The Bill makes proper provision regarding the printing in Canada of such works
as come within its scope. Representations
have been made that certain interests have
not been protdcted, and in the discussion
of the Bill the views of those interests
that apparently are not satisfied will
doubtless be laid before us. Needless ta
say, it is often difficult, if not impossible,
ta reconcile conflicting interests, particuJarly where the question between
the
parties relates ta financial terms or conditions.
The Senate bas spent so much time upon
this particular subject that I do not intend dealing at length with the Bill. It is
a long one. It bas received mature consideration from the other branch of Parliament, and I fail ta see that we can
promote the interests of all the parties
concerned, or the public interest, by deal-

ing with this measure otherwise than
on the floor of this Chamber. It would
be unwise at this late stage of the Session
to refer the Bill to a special committee
and hear the parties who would insi.st
upon being heard before the committee. I
fancy that the views of the respective parties can be placed before this
Chamber by honourable gentlemen representing those views, without the Bill
being referred to a speciai committee.
It is very desirable that this Bill should
be passed this Session. It has become apparent, i fancy, to every honourable gentleman in this Chamber that it will be more
advantageous to deal with the Bill this
Session than to allow it to go over to a following Session, because it must be obvious
to all of us that the subject bas become
acute, and will be pressed upon Parliament
every Session until we place upon the statute book a Copyright Act that will be
acceptable to the authors and other interests and that will also be in the public interj
est.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, this is a very difficult Bill to
deal with. As my honourable friend bas
said, this question has been before ParliaOne point
ment on several occasions.
which my honourable friend made with regard to the Bill is, I think, somewhat wide
of the mark. If I understand the situation, Canada enjoys the benefits of the
Berne Convention through the English Act,
which practically governs the situation in
this country to-day. On looking at the Bill,
I find that clause 49 specifically provides
for the adherence of Canada to the Berne
Convention. The clause reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may take such
action as may be necessary to secure the adherence of Canada to the revised Convention of
Berne, signed the 13th day of November, 1908,
and the Additional Protocol thereto signed at
Berne the 20th day of March, 1914, set out in
the Second Schedule to this Act.

It would appear to me, therefore, that
this Bill is going to have the effect of
depriving us of any benefit which we may
derive at the present time from the Berne
Convention. Whether that is a good thing
or not is a question that we can discuss
later on.
I have always understood that one difficulty met with in regard to the question of
copyright in Canada wa because of our
close association with our neighbours to the
south of us, who have not taken advantage
of the Berne Convention, but have a copyright law of their own which provides that
works published in the United States must
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

also be printed in that country. This law
keeps authors and others from sharing in
the benefits to be obtained under the Berne
Convention unless they publish and print
their works in the United States.
Clauses 13, 14, and 15 of the Bill deal
with the printing of the work, and, as I
understand their effect, are likely to make
it very difficult for us to get the benefits
of the Berne Convention. If we pass this
Bill in its present form we shall have to
make arrangements with the United States,
because the United States is really the
most important country that we have to
deal with in this regard; and then we
shall have to make special arrangements
with Great Britain and the other British
Dominions, because we shall be in a different position from that which we occupy
at the present time, and it is possible that
we shall be altogether deprived of the
benefit of the Berne Convention.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
informed not. In fact, I am informed
to the contrary.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not wish uselessly to take up the time of the House
at this stage; but perhaps I may read
from some papers bearing on this matter
which were handed to me. This is from
the official organ of the International
Bureau of Berne, dated April 15, 1921.
It says:
Bill No. 12 makes a distincti.on between the
treatment accorded to Authors who are Canadians, British and Members of the Union
allowed to take advantage of the law of their
country, and the special treatment which may
possibly app4y to Non-Unionist i.e. American
Authors. However, the national treatment shall
be guaranteed to the Unionist Authors unless
subject to the provisions of this Act (article
3). Article 13 'provides a whole system of conditi.ons and formalities, the imposition of which
on Authors of the Union would be absolutely
prescriptions of the
contrary to the iformal
Revised Convention of Berne, which exempts
these Authors in their international relations
from every obligation of this nature. If certain
clauses of the Bill (13, 14, etc.) relative to compulsory licenses-they correspond in part to
those provided by the British Imperial Law of
1911, articles 3 and 4-can, by straining a
point, te reconciled with the regulations of the
Union, this is not so, as far as the formalities
of registering and of depositing copies in Canada, nor as far as the conditions of necessary
indication of t-he name of the author and of the
publication of any work in Canada are concerned.
These -formalities and conditions are wholly
incompatible wi-th the obligations incurred by a
State in virtue of the Revised Convention Of
1908, and moreover, already actually abandoned
by Canada as regards Authors belonging to the
Union, who are required merely to fulfill the
conditions and formalities eventually prescribed
in the country of origin. (See article 2 of the

MAY 27, 1921

Judgments by the 'Canadian Courts, "Le DLroit

section of the Bill <article 13) could only apply
to Canadian Authors and to, Authors flot belonging to the Union; it cannot affect in any
way the Authors protected by the Convention
of the Union; it je necessary to make thls
clearly evident in the discussions in order to
avoid any mieunderstanding.

I place this matter before the House,
because I think we should give very serieus
consideration ta it. I think that, in frarning a Copyright Bïlh, we should consider
the conditions under wbich Canadian
authars have to labour at the present time,
and sbould do eveiytbing passible to proEverybody -who bas given

thought to this inatter must reahize that
an author wbo brings out a ;vork in the
United States bas an ad'vantage from the
fact that'he appeals ta a very mucb larger
number of readers than be can if he brings
it out in Canada. If we are to insist on
clauses 13, 14 and 15, the dilllculty of
protecting the author will be very great,
because be wili be placed under the necessity of baving bis book publisbed in both
Canada and the United States. Further
than tbat, -as I bave already said, we shal
bave, to make soane arrangement witb
Great Britain and the other Dominions.
There are other clauses àn this Bill
whîcb we can discuss ta better advantage
in Cornmittee than at the present tirne.
The question of copyright bas been before
us rnany times, and I think thet we should
go into the 'whole question very carefully,
s0 that when this Bill is passed it will be
of advantage ta the country.
I notice that the last clause of the
Bill provides that tbe Aet shahl corne into
force by proclamation of the Governor in
Council. It is flot clear on the face of
the Bihl exactly why that should be so.
If the Bill is really going to 'be of ibenefit,
one would tbink it sbould go into force
at once. My honourable friend did not give
any eyplanation as to wby it shouhd be beld
back and brought into force in this way.
If it is behd back for the purpose of enabling the Government to try to bring about

It is Dlot m'y purpose to take up the tirne
of the House any further. I simiply wish
to say that 1 think we should diseuss this
Bill very carefully and thoroughly in Cornmittee.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen,,I had flot noticed that this Bili
was on the Order Paper until the leader
of the Governnment rose to move the second
reading. I intend ta address but a very
few remarks to it, because, as intirmated
by the leader of the House, we shall have
an opportunity to discuss the clauses of
the -Bill in 'Cornmittee, and perhaps we
shall have an opportunity of discussing
the principles underlying certain portions
of the Bill.
I had the honour of being a member
of the Special Committee of the Senate to

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Every class
that desired to be heard had a full opportunity of presenting their views. A further
opportunity was afforded ta them before
the Special Cornmittee of the Commons
this year. In niy humble judgrnent we are
lagging behind ail up-to-date nations in

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And we have an
Act of 1911.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I did flot
deal with that Act, because, as a matter
of fact, it is really the basis of the Bill
which is now before this House. We are
in the unfortunate position in this country
of having both English Acts in force; while

He said: Saine difficulty has arisen in
the administration of the Immigration
Act by-reason of certain privileges given
to Chinese merchants, in being allowed ta

head tax. The difficulties ta which I refer
have had ta do with the issuance of certificates. Very frequently these arc made
use of, not for the parties ta whom they
were originally issued, but da service for
others. The amendments in the Bill are
calculated ta harmonize the Chinese Immigration Act with aur awn Immigration
Act. They extend the powers of the Board
of Inquiry, particularly with regard ta, the
issuance of these certificates.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Two or three
questions arise in cannection with this Bill

it is that the Bill now under diseus sion

I shail not put forward niy individuel

by two important bodies-the Incorvorated
Society of Authors, Playwrights, and Comnposers of England, and the Canadian
Authors Association. Under the heading
of "The 'Canadian Copyright Bill, 1921,"
the formner's committee of manage-ment has
issued a report dated April 18, 1921, in
which 1 read the following lines:
The most serlous clauses affectlng the rights

of authors are thse compulsory llcenaing clauses
13, 14 andi 15.
It seems to me that these clauses are
the crucial points of the present Bull. I
amn sure that they are going to be discussed later on, and I hope that they will
be amended in Committee.
S-411

It has been the object of ail International
congresses deallng wlth the copyright question
to corne to an agreement by which copyright
shoul-d be the property of the author-

This is, I think, the view that should be
taken hy Parliament in discussing and
enacting a -copyright law-an agreement by which copyrighit should be
the property of the author without technicaiies
of any description, and in the revised Conven-

tion of Berne and the subsequent Protocol these
principlee have been strictly maintained. Under
clause 13 It would seem clear that Caniadian
authors wouid be deprived of the benefit of
the Convention of Berne, and therefore would
be deprived of the market which ls the privilege
of ail the clvîljzed nations of Europe.
I nmust say, honourable gentlemen, that
clause 13 as it was originally framed has
been re'modelled, or rather, suppressed, in
the lower House. So much the hetter.
But clauses 14 and 15 remain'in the Bill.
They provide for the emanation of licenses
to print .books in Canada by others than
the owner, without the consent of the
owner, and for the emanation of licenses
to publish books in Canada in -serial form.
by others than the owner, without the. consent of the owner. In both cases, of course,
royalties are stipulated in favour of the unwifling owner. These two clauses are deemed
arbitrary and unfair. The copyright conssnittee of the Canadian Authors' Association, in their report on the present Bill,
make the following comment:
Thse licensing clauses in this Blill depriye the
author of his right to make his own terme
with the Canadian iicensee, and hand over thet
right at an arbitrary figure unifier conditions
which woul permit the llceneee to garbie or
abbrerviate the work without the author's
consent, to publish It in a cheap edition wlthout
regard to appearance, and to prevent the production or Importation oif a correct or more
presenta«~e'editlon for a period of flfty years.
So far as serial1 rights are concernei, the
clauses are drawn up In evident ignorance of
the conditione governing 9erial publications today, woul-d produce disastrous confusion, andi
would infliot a great hardeship on a, very large

number of Canadian authors, without conferrlng
any benefit on Canadian

literature.

I have stated as briefly as possible the
main objections-there are others-to some
parts of this Bill. I ams speaking, as you

Canadian authors. I admît that there is
another point of view, and I am sure that
before -the end of this discussion you Will

In conclusion, I should say, using the

copyright conditions in Canada, one must

corne to the conclusion that this Bill in its
present form contains proposais which, if
carried out, would resuit in grave injustice
to the Canadian author, which are flot in
accordance with international comity, and
which do not conform to the recognized interpretation of copyright, namely: "In law,
the right, belonging exclusively to the
author or bis assignees, of multiplying for
sale copies of an original work or composition in literature and art."
0f course, we know perfectly well that
our views may not be wholly accepted by
the members of this bonourable House, as
they have not been wholly accepted by the
rnmbers of the other House, but we
earnestly hope that this House will grant
Canadian authors such amendments as will
prGtect their rights.

IN COMMITTEE
REPORTED

BILL
AND

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
146, an Act tro amend the Chinese Immigration Act. Hon. Mr. Mitcheiner in the
Chair.
On section i ahl immigrants must
establish identity Io satisfaction of Controller, subJeet to approva' of Minister:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
sîmphy extends the general Immigration
Act to persons of Chinese origin. Heretofore the Act did not extend to the Chinese.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What are the
other changes that are being made by this
Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Simply
that a different practice as to idetitity is
being establisbed, so as more clearly to
ide-atify those to whom certificates are
issued. As is well known, most Chinese
look alike to the European, and these provisions are made for the purpose of avoiding the confusion whieb arises in the
matter of identification.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Sections 2 and 3 were agreed to.
On section 4-refund of tax on return
within two years:
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Will not the extending of the time for refunding the
money from one year to two years, under
clause 4, have a tendency to make it more
difficult to identify the party?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUCHEED: I do not
know that it will. It is frequently difficult
for Chinese who have left Canada to
retura within a year. This gives them a
more reasonable period of absence froým
Canada than the present Act. I do not
think it is unreasonable to allow a Chinese
who bas paid bis head tax to absent himnself from Canada for two years.
Section 4 was agreed to.
Sections 5, 6 and '7 were agreed to.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 199, an Act to
amend the Customs Tariff, 1907.
He said: The object of this Bill is to
bring the customs tariff into line with the
Canada-West Indies Treaty, which was considered by this Chamber during the present Session. The only departure from that
particular object is the provision which has
been made in the Bill as to increased duties
on spirits. Honourable gentlemen who have
fillowed the Budget are familiar with the
increased duties which we have imposed on
spirits both by way of excise and of
customs.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
INLAND REVENUE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 200, an Act to
amend the Inland Revenue Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES

LOUGHEED.

He said: This Bill is to give effect to the
provision outlined in the Budget.for imposing an increased duty on spirits by way of
excise. There is' an exception made as to
hospitals and scientific purposes, so that
the duty can be remitted in special cases of
that character.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This Bill, if I
understand it rightly, very considerably
increases the duty on spirits coming to this
country. The effect of it, I presume, will
be very much to curtail the importation of
spirits, because it will very considerably
raise the cost to the consumer. I have not
had time to examine this Bill, but-I understand that it contains a provision which
enables the Government to collect the duty
in the case of any spirits brought in by a
Provincial Government or any other body.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
Bill deals simply with domestic spirits;
this is the excise. The other feature, as to
imports, is dealt with in the Customs Act.
This measure increases the excise duty to
39.00 a gallon.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 204, an Act to
amend the Special War Revenue Act, 1915.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the intention of this Bill is to increase the sales
utax. Where the manufacturer sells to the
wholesaler he accounts for là per cent; and
where the wholesaler sells to the retailer
or the consumer he accounts for another
11 per cent, making 3 per cent. That is in
regard to domestic goods. On imported
goods the tax is 21 per cent as between the
importer and the wholesaler, and 1i per
cent as between the wholesaler and the
retailer or consumer, making 4 per cent.
This increases the sales tax, as I undertand, by one per cent. That is the chief
purpose of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This sales tax will
he collected on imported goods as well as
on goods made in the country?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes;
the imported goods will pay 4 per cent;
domestic goods 3 per cent.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: And that 4 per
cent duty is collected, I presume, after the
customs duty is collected?

647

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: So the 4 per cent

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, as
it goes to the consumer. It is distributed
between the importer and those who handie
the goods at the various stages.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
Teas read the second time.
OLEOMARGARINE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 205, an Act to
airnend the Oleomargarine Act, 1919.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
proposes to amend the statute of 1920, and
ini fact whatever legislation there is as to
the importation of oleomargarine. It proposes to extend the time for the importation of oleomargarine into Canada until
August 31, 1922, and the sale of the same
until March 1, 1923.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This Bill is becoming a sort of annual thing: I think we have
had it up, now three or four times.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Don't
forget the hardy annual.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 do not understand why the Government should flot
nmake this a permanent measure, instead
of asking us every year to adopt this Bihl
and carry it on for another year. As far
as my experience goes, I do not think there
is a strong objection to oleomargarine
being used throughout the country. So
far as I know, its use bas not had any
effect on the sale or importation of butter
in the country, and it bas been an advantage to the consumers in cities and
towns. 1 think it would have been better
for the Government to have taken the
plunge on this occasion, and made this a
permanent matter instead of for one year
only. I suppose that next year we shaîl
have the same Bill again.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is the idea
of bringing in the Bill year after yéar
instead of making it permanent?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEfl: It is
difficult; to say at the moment, but I think
that public opinion bas to be eduacated
rather gradually to the general introduction of oleomargarine. There is a section
of people, particularly in the agricultural

districts, rath*er opposed to it to-day,
while the great mass of the people are in
favour of it. Therefore I think that by
being gradually introduced and established,
it may advantageously take the place of
butter, particularly amongst consumers
of limited financial resources. We shall
grow bolder as we grow older.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The leader of the
Government has stated that the opposition
cornes chiefly from agricultural districts.
I noticed, however, that in the Commons
the other day the Farmers' party voted
solid for the proposai to extend the time
for three years instead of one year; and
the agricultural party generally will vote
for making it absolutely permanent. So
that opposition does not corne from the
farmers; it cornes more particularly from
some of the dairy interests who may be
called farmers, but not from farmers
generally. Canada is the only civilized
country in the world that puts any
obstacle in the way of manufacturing or
selling oleomargaiine. I do not think it
affects the sale of butter to any great
oxtent. If it does affect the sale in Canada,
we just export that much more. When
butter was so high as it has been in the
last. few years, it was a great advantage
to the consumer to be able to get oleomargarine at half the price of butter, and
I think the Government should makè this
a permanent measure as soon as possible.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
The Senatý adjourned until 8 o'cloek

COPYRIGHT ÉILU
CONSIDEREID

IN COMM4ITTEE

On motion of Hon. Sir James LDugheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 12,
an Act to amend and consolidate the Law
relating to Copyright. Hon. Mr. Blain ia
the Chair.
Sections 1 tzo 12, both inclusive, were
agreed to.
On section 13, subsection 1, paragraph a
-application foi license to print book in
Canada by other than owner.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The clauses of the
Bihl with which we have been dealing so
far are, I think', practically the same as

648

SENATE

those contained in the Bill brought up in
the Senate in 1919; but section 13 deals
with a very different matter. This section
deals with the question of printing books in
Canada. I think it is going to impose a
great hardship on the authors of this
country in making them print their books
in Canada at the same time that they are
printed in the United States, because of the
limited number of readers they may have
in Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
may be the opinion of the authors, but apparently it is not the opinion of Parliament.
If an author who is protected by the Parliament of Canada for the period of his own
life and fifty years after should not choose
to comply with the conditions of the Bill and
publish his work within a partiedflar time,
it seems to me most reasonable that
a license to print and publish should issue.
I am not in sympathy with the unrestricted
protection which is sought by authors. The
public have some rights, and if an author
should publish his work elsewhere than in
Canada and not publish it in Canada, it
seems to me it is clearly a case in which
Parliament should intervene and say that a
license should issue for the publication.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It would put the
authors in Canada entirely outside the
Berne Convention.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand not. I am informed by the Minister
of Justice that this Bill is entirely within
the Convention. I know representations
have been made that it will not permit of
Canada becoming a party to the Convention
by reason of the introduction of certain
provisions; but the Minister of Justice informs me to the contrary.
These proviHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
sions contained in sections 13, 14, and 15
are provisions which are not to be found
anywhere in the British Copyright Act. I
was under the impression that when Parliament undertook to deal with the question of copyright, which I admit is a very
complicated one, the intention -was to deal
with it in Canada as it ýhad been dealt with
in Great Britain. The British Act does contain provisions which are to be found in
sections 3 and 4. I have a copy of that Act
before me, and those provisions are sections 3, 4, 5 and 12. The sections in our
Bill go the full length of the Imperial Act.
If the intention of Parliament is to recognize in Canada the same rights of authorship as are recognized to-day in the British
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

Isles, then I say that sections 13, 14, and
15 should not be passed, because they contain provisions far in excess of those in
the British Act with respect to the same
subject. I agree with my honourable friend
from Kamloops (Hon. Mr. Bostock) that
these sections 13, 14 and 15, constitute a
violation of the Berne Convention; and the
best proof that they do is that the Imperial
Parliament refused to adopt provisions of
this kind. I repeat that, unless we are to
go further than Great Britain thought it
wise to go, sections 13, 14 and 15 should
not be adopted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend be good enough to
state what is his -authority for saying that
they have been rejected by the Parliament
of Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I did not say
rejected. I say they were not adopted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, not
adopted.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And I say they
are not to be found in the British Act. I
do not suppose my honourable friend will
contradict that statement.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then we have
gone a great deal further than the British
Act goes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is admitted,
is it not? Does my honourable friend admit
that?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. We
are not prepared to give the protection
which the British Act does. I suppose that
in round terms that is what it amounts
to. This is an approximation, so to speak,
to what the House of Commons is prepared to give to authors which come within
the scope of this Bill. But I would again
say, particularly in view of my honourable friend's statement that this Bill is in
violation of the Berne Convention, that
such is not the case, but it is a Bill vithin
the terms. of the Convention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt very
much if my honourable friend bas any

data on which to base that assertion. He
seems to be far more certain of his ground
than does the Minister of Justice himself.
The Minister of Justice was asked a ques-

MAY 30, 1921
tian by Mr. Rinfret on the 25th of May
last. That is not very far away. Mr. Rinfret stated:
I still think it wrong to pass the Bill with
the clauses to which we object and I feel confident that the Minister will find out that they
are ln contravention of the Berne Convention,
and that lie will have to do away with them,
if we wish to adhere to that Convention.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Who
said that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Mr. Rinfret,
at page 3961 of the House of Commons
Hansard.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
not taking his opinion upon it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, but would
the honourable gentleman kindly wait and
take the opinion of the Minister, who an$wered:
If I find I have to do that, I will. In saying it was a compromise, I did not mean to
suggest that it was a compromise reached by
the authors and publishers after a conference.
So the Minister answered the member
for St. James that if he had to delete those
three clauses, after a conference with the
British authorities and the parties to the
Berne Convention, thein he 'wouldl drop
them. He admits that it is new and tentative legislation-that it is a compromise
arrived at, not by the parties themselves,
but by the committee who tried to render
a Solomon's judgment by adopting a middle
course. But the Minister of Justice admits
throughout his speech that this is a new
and unprecedented step that Canada is
taking, and reserves his right to negotiate
with the outside world. He will try to
square himself with the Berne Convention;
but if he does not succeed he will withdraw
these three clauses.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I doubt
very much if the Minister of Justice made
the statement that he would withdraw these
three clauses. Parliament bas something
to say about this. Further, it would be
impossible to put through a Copyright Bill
in the Parliament of Canada without those
three sections. As to the statement of the
Minister of Justice, it is this:
After the best exami.nation I have been able
to give to the matter myself I am disposed to
believe that there la nothing ineonsistent wlth
the Convention of Berne ln these sections.

That statement was nade on the 25th of
this month.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend speaks of the opinion of Parlia-

nient. Surely he will admit that the opinion
of Parliament bas not been given till this
Chamber bas spoken.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend is not prepared to accept the opinion
of Mr. Rinfret, nor even that of the Minister of Justice, as having any authority.
Perhaps be will accept his own.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do
not give any opinion upon the question. My
honourable friend bas more confidence in
his own opinion than I have in mine.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Possibly, but
the honourable gentleman's opinion was
given not so very long ago, and it is rather
emphatic. My honourable friend's memory
bas not served him so well on this occasion
as it usually does. In discussing the Copyright Bill, in answer to my honourable
friend from Kamloops (Hon. Mr. Bostock),
the honourable leader, in this House, on
June 5, 1919, said:
As my honourable friend is no doubt aware,

very strong repreeentations have been made to

the Government that a manufacturing clause
should be introduced into the Bill, and some
representative delegations have walted on the
committee and likewise have made representa2
tions to the Government to that effect. The
Department of Justce has given its opinion
that, if thia ls done, tt will practicaly nullify
the Bill and thua prevent us from adhering to
the Berne Convention.

Is that clear enough for my honourable
friend?
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
three years ago; but that does not prevent
the Department of Justice making further
investigation into the question; and, having had three years to reconsider it, they
have apparently come to the conclusion
to-day that it is all right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend has warned us that we are not to
pay very much attention to his opinion
wherever expressed. I would like to know
which ,opinion is the good one--the opinion
he expresses now, or that which he expressed two years ago; or are both not to
'be relied upon? In my opinion-and I
have his own authority for the statement
-neither of them is worth anything. If
the honourable gentleman will read the
sections carefully, he will return to the
inevitable conclusion, which he reached
previously, that they are Absolutely contrary to the Berne Convention. It is fallacious to contend that in adopting this'
measure we are adhering to the Berne
Convention, for that is absolutely con-

SENATE
trary to the fact. I submit that« by these
sections you are violating the very purpose
of the Berne Convention with regard to
the right of authorship.
It is needless to labour the point. If
anyone will take the trouble to read these
sections he will see that they are absolutely
incompatible with the Berne Convention
and are a direct violation of it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is another aspect which has occurred to mu,
though not particularly as a lawyer, and
which I have never heard discussed
publicly. What advantage is Canada actually going to derive from adherence to the
Berne Convention? I know that there is
a feeling amongst authors and literary
men throughout the world that the Berne
Convention should be adhered to. In the
past it was necessary for us in this matter to be guided by the legislation of England; but at present by virtue of the British
Act, we are placed in a position to legislate on copyright as we see fit, and we arc
free to make such arrangements as we
please with any country in the world, inWe have been
cluding Great Britain.
placed in exactly the same position as the
United States, and may make any convention or reciprocal agreement we desire
with any other country. However, I am
not going to urge that point now, ibecause
it is understood that the present Bill is
to come within the terms of the Berne
Convention.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend if it is his opinion that,
with these clauses 13, 14 and 15, we woul:
be better off than with the legislation we

opinion?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No. I was
only stating that the coypright question
might be regarded in an altogether different aspect namely, with relation to our
right, in view of Imperial legislation, to
pass such copyright laws as the Dominion
Parliament see fit, even if we went absolutely outside the terms of the Berne
Convention.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

You are doing

it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There may
be in adherence to the Berne Convention
some advantage which is not apparent to
me; but I rather think that we in Canada,
a country that has not a great many authors or a large reading public, overrate
the advantages to ourselves of adherence
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

to the Berne Convention. The position of
Great Bitain is entirely different. There
are a very large number of distinguished
authors, composers, sculptors, and artists
in Britain at all times. 'iteir market is
not only the British Dominions, but the
whole wor-id. The works of English writers are reproduced by translation in all
the leading countries of Europe. And the
United States is independent; it is so
large, its market is so big, that its authors
have an assured market at home. We in
Canada, w;ith a limited population and a
comparatively limited number of producers
-if I may apply such a term to the writer,
the aritist, the sculptor, etc.-are in an entirely ditferent position. Our books, I am
sorry to say, do not find a very ready market anywhere except perhaps in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. There
is a very limited number of Canadian authors who find their works sold in the other
British Dominions, or whose works are
sufficiently popular or well-known to be
translated into foreign languages. However, that is rather digressing. Coming
back to this question, I am afraid that the
statement of the honourable leader of the
Government can be absolutely borne out,
that no Copyright Act could have got the
approval of the Parliament of Canada
without these clauses.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; that is not
what the honourable leader said.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Yes.

Hon, Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me to remind him:
"The Department of Justice bas given its
opinion L1at, if this is done, it will practically nullify the Bill, and thus prevent
us from adhering to the Berne Convention."
That is what the honourable leader said.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not
know what the honourable leader of the
Government may have said on a former
occasion, but I understood the honourable
member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
to ask my opinion on this matter. I do
not feel competent at the moment to express an opinion whether this Bill is within
the ternis of the Berne Convention or not.
But at the second reading of the Bill I
pointed out wherein we protect ourselves.
I want to protect the authors of Canada
by having it provided that this measure
shall not come into effect until it bas the
approval of the Berne Convention. When
we have obtained a certificate to the effect
that this Bill does not substantially differ
from the terms of the English Copyright

Act, we ehaîl be in a position to apply for
recognition. by the Berne Convention.
While we are getting it we can apply to
the United States and cee if we oaa make
a reciproi-ity arrangement with thern. 1
do not know what are the advantages to
Canada oý adhering to the Convention; but,
seeing that the Bill is based on the supposition that we are going to corne within
the terme of that Convention, a subsequent
clause in this Bill can be enlarged from, the
formi la xhich it le aow drafted so as to
provide t.hat it shall not become operative
uiitil we have a certificate f ro-m the Ianperil Secretary of State that it le within

think we shahl be fully protected.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I was trying to
draft a clause la exaotly the came sense.
I think t.ha't a provision rnight well be
added as the iast clause of the Bill, to this'
effect:
No provision contained in this Act shail be
taken, interpreted, or applied contrary to, or
in violati-on of, the revised Berne Convention.

It rnight be enfer to provide in th'at way
rather than to wait for the certificate to
which the honourable gentleman has referred. I confese that I arn not at present
sufficiently inforrned as to the issue of the
certîficate which hie bas mentiopedHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It would be
a certificate frorn the huperial ýSecretary of
State to the effect that thie Bill does not
depart frorn the: termes of the Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It seerne to me that
we have the right to legielate independently
of the Imperial Act. I think that the beet
legielation would be legielation that ie
independent of that.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Honourable geatlimen, whether the clauses la question constitute a violation of the Berne Convention
or not is a question Il do aot desire to discues; but I contend that they are a violation of the author's right of property. If
-there'le anythiag that le sacred it le the
right of property. Who would deny to a
man the right to dispose of hie property,

authore of that right? le it because they

Ie it because iatellectual productions are

desire to give to ail kinds of industrial
I think that the honourable
products?
members of this House who, like nmyself,
are partizans of the national policy, should
take into consideration the Canad-ian
author's right of property. Those poor
Ganadian authors are miserabie enough,
and I think we should not make them
worse. I know a littie about what it is
to be an author. I remember that thirty
or forty years ago the Canadian author
who couid pay for the printing of his works
was very fortunate. Even now, what do
they get after years and years of very
hard labour? What is it, compared to
what other'people get for works which,
after ail, have not the sarne value. It
seems to me that the Ieast we snight do is,
at any rate, to give themn the consolation of
remaining masters of their own productions--of retaining their right of property
in their own works. There may be go3d
reasons why an author would not consent
to a second edition. of bis work being
printed. You are well aware that an
author may often desire to revise and correct hisfirst edition, and before doing sD
hie rnay await the passing of certain events
or the occurrence of certain circumstances.
It is well known that great writers have la
their memoirs stated the conditions under
which their work should not be printed for
perhaps 25 or 50 years after their death.
Therefore, if the clauses la question are
adopted, authors would he deprived of that
right of retaining control of their works. 1
find in the Montreal Gazette an article part
of which deserves to be coneidered:
The contention that this Inva.sion of the
author's rights Is compatible with the Berne
Convention Je only rendered possible by a
most curicus omission in the text of the convention ltself. The whole spirit of the convention le to the effect that the author, or his
afflignee, shall enjoy complete contrai of hie
inteliectual property during his lifetime and for
flfty years following. In the case of certain
specific rights, se-condary in their nature to the
right cf controiling the physical production of
the book itseolf. it je most expressly stated that
these shall be exciusively andý completely held
by the author. Thus it le expressly statedi that
authors shall have the exclusive right of making
or authorizing translation, of authorizing serial
publication, of controlling public performance of
dramatic and musical works, of controlling al
adaptations or changes of literary or musical
form, of controlling mechanical reproduction of
musical works, and of controlling cînernatographic reproduction of literary, scientific or
artistic works. Probably It neyer entered the
heade of thé drafters of this convention that
any-b&dy could dreamr of taking away from the
author the right to control the printing cf the
works which hie had wrLtten. while yet purporting to recognize hies property rights In those
words.

SENATE

I think that these remarks deserve consideration, and that honourable gentlemen
who have observed the progress of literature in this country will vote against those
three clauses.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I did not quite
catch the argument that was made a
moment ago by the honourable member for
Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), unless
it was this, that, as we have as yet very few
authors in our country, we ought to be glad
to have the benefit of authors outside of
the country, without paying anything at all
for their works. That is the only way in
which, to my mind, his argument in favour
of the clause in question could be interpreted.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It was not
my meaning, at any rate.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Then I am very
glad to find that I made a mistake. There
is no doubt in my mind that section 13 is a
violation of the revised Convention of
Berne; but if I had any doubt, the official
organ of that Convention, Le Droit d'Auteur, clearly states it; and I would ask
permission to read to this honourable House
a short extract from an article on the subject published on the 15th of April last.
This is what it says:
If certain clauses of the 'Bill (12, 14, etc.)
relative to compulsory licenses-they correspond
in part to those provided by ýthe British Imperial Law of 1911, articles 3 and 4--can, by
straining a point, be reconciled with the regulations of the Union, this is not so as far as the
formalities of registering and of depositing
copies in Canada, nor as far as the conditions
of necessary indication of the name of the
author and of the publication of any work in
Canada are concerned. These formalities and
conditions are wholly incompatible with the
obligations incurred .by the state in virtue of the
Revised Convention of 1908, and moreover,
already actually abandoned by Canada as regards Authors belonging to the Union, who are
required merely to fulfil the conditions an d
formalities eventually prescribed in the country
of origin.

Now, if I understand the position rightly,
we are still under the Convention, by virtue
of the law of 1886. We have been allowed
by the subsequent legislation of England to
go outside the jurisdiction of that law if we
choose; but so long as we do not leave the
jurisdiction of the law of 1886Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: By legislation
here?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: By this or any
other legislation we still remain governed
by it; and under it the authors of foreign
countries belonging to the Union are perfectly protected. If I understand the matHon.

Mr.

DAVID.

ter rightly, this legislation will make us
one of the important countries in the world
that will be beyond the pale of that lawthe pale of the Union. Are we willing to
be in that position? For my part I would
be very sorry. Is Canada going to 'be a piffiing country, able to steal from any author
in the w'hole world who may have a work
of value? I do not think so. I do not think
that is the consensus of opinion of this
House. I hope- it is not. As bas been so
well said by the member from Mille Iles
(Hon. Mr. David), why not respect the
property of the intellectuals? Is it not the
most respectable property that exists in
the world? Does not all the other property
flow from it? Is it not true that all other
property is worth nothing without it?
What, after all, is the value of any material
property to a man if he bas not enough
intelligence, enough education, to enjoy it?
Where can he get that education and
training if not through the property of
the intellectuals? For my part I would be
very sorry to see Canada one of the only
two countries in the world where that property is not considered absolutely sacred.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: Honourable gentlemen, I do not want to repeat what I
said this morning, but I should like to put
before this Committee an appreciation of
the clauses of the Bill now under discussion
that was made by a very competent body
-the
Incorporated Society of Authors,
Playwrights, and Composers, of London.
England. Here is that appreciation:
The Canadian proposal is, in effect, to divest

the owner of the copyright in his work. It is
not really a compulsory license. It is a compulsory purchase for a price to be paid by
way of royalty. It is submitted that this is a
violation of one of the first principles of the
Revised Convention of Berne. Copyright is 'to
be the property of the author and his assigns
and he or they cannot, if the Convention is to
be observed, he wholly deprived of 'their p;roperty in this way.
Apart from the objectiýon that what is proposed here is a wholesale confiscation of literary
property without even adequate compensation
the whole scheme seems to be most unjust,
more particularly to the English author and
publisher.

This is a very strong statement, and as
I deem it to be absolutely sound I thought
itright that this Committee should be aware
of that appreciation by such an important
and intelligent body.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: As the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) has referred to myself
I would like to say one word. He
stated that the argument that I had

MAY 30, 1921
adduced, if logically followed, would be
attaching littie importance to the authors
of Canada. I wish to say that I yield to
no one in my desire for Canadian literature
to flourish, or my admiration of those w'ho
are supporting it intelligently.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, the Government leader has
stated that not only had the authors rights
in connection with the publication of their
books, but that the public was to be considered. 1 do not understand exactly what
my honourable friend meant by that word,
the public.
Did he mean the readers
at large throughout the land? Or did that
expression èover simply the publisher or
printer? If he meant the public at large,
I do flot see that the public needs any protection in this connection.
Suppose a
Canadian author has written a book; he
goes to a Canadian publisher, who refuses
to publish it;-he crosses the lime, goes
to New York or Boston, and obtains a
contract, favourable to bimself and quite
satisfactory, for the printing of the
book, and he gives the right to the pub-.
lisher to sell that book througbout. the
United States and Canada. This is a right
which, up to this moment, ýeems to violate
no principle, if this law does flot intervene; but, if this law should intervene,
then that contract which the author had
made or would make, he may not be able
to rnake. The Boston or New York publisher may say: "I have a considerable
clientele among the reading public in
Canada, and I will make for you certain
favourable conditions if you give me the
right to extend my sales to your country."
But the author wil.l be hampered in dispbsing of his rights and entering into a
coptract
for
the
publication
of
his book in the United States, which is the
,large constituency, representing a market
of 110,000,000 people as against 7,000,000
or 8,000,000 Canadian peuple ;-because
under this legisiation any publisher may
immediately give notice to the Minister of
Justice that he intends to, daim, a license
and publish that book in Canada. If the
American publisher has consented to enter
in-to that contract, and is hampered in
regard to entering the Canadian market
through that demand for a license the
contract may be set at nought; difficuities
may appear; and the author may -be
involved in lawsuits and in loss-all because a Canadian publisher, who may have
refused the risk of publishing that book
when it was first offered to bim, feeling

65,Q

assured now that it la a success, will pounce
upon it and say, "Now I will print it ini
Canada"-in violation of a contract that
may have been entered into with the
American house by the author. This is
the step we are about to take in putting
into this Act these sections 13, 14, and 15.
For my part I ar nmot disposed thus to
hamper the Canadian author.
He has
produced his book, he is a free man, he
can offer it to a Camadian publishing
bouse; that house may accept or refuse
it; or he may, without offering it, decide
that it can be laumched on the American
market, and he may cross over to theother side and publish it.
Now, why shouid this Parliament interfere by saying: "You shahl be limited in
the right of disposing of your own property; you will be limited because if you
go across the border to print your book
you may to-morrow have a demand fromn
a publisher to print a Canadian edition."
There is no use hlinking the fact that these
clauses are incorporated in thîs Act to allow the Canadian printer or publisher a
right to publish a book of a Canadian author
which has achieved some success on the
other side. If it were a failure, I suppose
there would be no difliculty. But by what
right should this Parliament hamper and
restrict the liberty of the author in favour
of the publisher and printer? I arn in
favour of giving Canadian printer and
publisher ail the possible advantages that
may accrue to him regularly under our
laws; but flot at the expense of bis neighbour. I do not see that the Canadian publisher or printer bas any rigbt to a mortgage of any kind upon the property of
bis meighbour; yet this is what we are
giving him by these sections 13, 14, and 15.
I want the Canadian author to go absolutely unbampered, and I want tbis Parliarnent, if I can do it by my vote, to accept
the principle of the Berne Convention,
wbich deelares tbat wben a state ehters
that convention, any one of its nationals
-to use an expression we discussed lately,
and to wbich we gave
tbe
legal
sense-is to be allowed to' publisb bis
book, and to bave the belp of that
constituency represemted by the countries
that accept
the ,Berne
Convention.
For that reason I think clauses 13, 14, and
15 contain a vicieus principle. Tbe Minister of Jusice bas expresaed the hope that
be rnay successfully nègotiate Canada into
the Berne Convention, and have the United
States accept tbese as Teciprocal clauses.
I amn onvinced that if 'we adopt that prin-

SENATE
ciple the Minister of Justice will coine
next Session and declare his utter failure.
But, as I cannot admit the principle on
which he wants to rest, I am not ready to
vote for these clauses.
The

friend from Delorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) would probably be unanswerable if

authors of Canada as well as the authors
under the Berne Convention, or those who
can take advantage of the Berne Convention, corne to the Parliament of Canada
"Gentlemen, we want you to
and say:
build safeguards around our works, not
only for our lifetime but for fifty years
afterwards." The Parliament of Canadla
very naturally says: "Yes, we are willing
to do that, but it will be on terms." And the
terms are those embodied in or imported
into sections 13, 14, and 15. Is Parliament
to yield to the demand of the authors that
they should have unlimited rights, entirely
irrespective of the public, in the protection
with which this legislation will surround
My honourable friend overlooks
them?
that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my honourable friend contend that if we strike out
these clauses the authors will not be enjoying the very same advantages that we
enjoy with respect to our movable property
and our real estate?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. My
honourable friend speaks of his movable
property and real estate. Every province
of Canada makes most drastic provisions
as to what shall be done in the way of
registration in regard to movables and
real estate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They do not
limit'our right to dispose of them.
This
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
does not do that. Why should the authors
of Canada be permitted to play dog in
the manger? Why should they be permitted to publish works in a country foreign to the country in which they get
their rights? A Canadian author could go
to the United States or to Europe and
use the printing presses there, and at the
saine time say, "I look to Canada to protect my work."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is what
my honourable friend calls the public?
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
the public is interested. The printers and
publishers and workmen of this country
constitute the public, and the reading public are interested to the extent of seeing
that that work is produced in Canada,
printed in Canada, and circulated in Canada. Is an author to be permitted to say:
"I am going absolutely to ignore Canada,
and print this work in a foreign country,
and snap my fingers at the Parliament
that gives me i'he protection I demand." It
seems to me that there is a simplicity
about that which would do credit only to
a schoolboy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the printing of that book has been refused by any
publisher in Canada, can that publisher,
with good grace come in, after it bas been
published on the other side and has become a success, and try to lay his hands
on it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Another
publisher might. Furthermore, this is a
My honourable
question of compromise.
friend knows that a Copyright Bill came
before the Senate, I think three years ago,
and that we spent some three weeks in
giving it the closest possible attention. We
approached it with the idea of being able
to pass a Bill similar to that passed by
Great Britain; but we found it impossible.
My honourable friend knows that it would
be impossible to pass in this Parliament
such a Bill as he bas outlined.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend knows that on that occasion
it was impossible to pass the Bill, and that
from Confederation down it has been found
impossible. Although this subject has been
before Parliament on many occasions, it
has been a'bsolutely impossible to get such
a Bill as the authors demanded, and if they
do not take this they will get none.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to protest against my honourable friend's definition of property. A man who writes a book
is as much the owner of the manuscript as
niy honourable friend is of his beautiful
home in Calgary, which is his in just
exactly the same way, in virtue of the
same principle, and to the same extent. I
should like to know how my honourable
friend would be placed if he closed his
home in Calgary, which is capable of lodging ten or twelve families, and kept it closed
for four or five years, and said, "It is my

parallel and on all fours.

MAY 30, 1921
My honourable friend speaks very eloauently about the public. The public is as
much interested, perhaps more interested
than anybody else, in seeing that the author
is properly recognized, and that his rights
are protected. iBut who are the public that
these clauses endeavour to protect? They
are the men who publish; the publishers,
the printers, the men who, deal in phonograplis, and ail that sort of thi-ng. That
is the public my honourable friend is talking about so eloquently. And what is the
difference between our buying books ini the
United States and buying them in Canada? This country buys a tremendous lot
of goods in the United States.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: -There is one thing
in the argument of my honourable friend
from Ottawýa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that I
do not understand. 1 have always ýunderstood that when an authar composes a book
and wighc',- to have it published, lie wants,
as many ediitions as possible, because tbe
mare books that are printed the greater
are the royalties that hie gets. It puzzles
me why he shouid object to having bis book
published ~n the United States, or why h.e
should aobject to having it published in
Canada s;, long as the publisher obtaining
a license to do so pays him a royalty of
10 per cent an every book that is published
in Canada.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Which it ought
not to do.

H.on. 1Ir. BELCOURT: There i s just
the saine objection as there would be if
someone chose to impose upon xny bonourable friend the price at which hie would
have to sell anytbing that lie owned.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:- That may bie so.
Blut what is the difference? Why make
flesh of one and fish of another? The same
argument applies here. Ail this, grand
talk about the public is, if 1 may make use
of a street terni, simply rot. It is not the
public that is in view at ail; it is the manufacturer, who, in aine cases out of ten,
steals the sangs, and the works of Canadians, as bias been done repeatedly and
on many occasions. I need not mention the
cases-they are very recent-ýin which we
have had Canadians coming and complaining most bitterly that because there was no
copyright law in Canada acts of piracy
could be committed day in and day out.
1 stand for the author; I think he should
be protected above alI-above the publisher,
ahove the printer, above the dealer in phonographs, and sa on. My honourable
friend's distinctions have no application
wbatever. The right of property is the
samne in one case as in another.
Take section 14. IV says:
If the publication of a book is lawfully begun
as a serial else-where than in Fils Majesty's
DomInions or a foreign count-ry to which section 4 »f this Act applues, and the owner of the
copyrigliht has refused to grant a license ta any
perison in Canada, being a publiher of a
periodir-al, ta publish such book in serial form,
a license may, in the discretion of the Minister,
be granted to any person In Canada, belng the
publisher of a perlodical.

And sa on. It may be that at the very
moment when this application is, made for
a license the Canadian author may have
bis manuscript in the hands of the printers,
in order to publish it himself in book form;
and yet it would be within the power of a
Canadian printerto get a license to publiali
it in serial forpl in a periodical.

Hon. Mvr. BEAUBIEN: There is more.
There is a very etriking case that I think
would an-wer my honourable frlend. There
is in my province a very distingui-shed
historian who, years aga, wben lie was beginning lis career, published 1,500. copies
of a very remarkable book. T.hey were
taken up immediately. Later on, alter
pursuing bis historical studies lie found
that hie had made some very seriaus mistakes-that lie had stated tbings wbich
hie discovered later were not exactly correct. There were faults of omission and
commissien, and lie thought that hie owed
it to hintielf to correct them. The time lias
came for the corrections to be made. He
desires to niake ithe corrections. The book
is bis child, and lie feels that it is his duty
and certainly bis xight, noti Vo bave the
book publishied as it was whén it came
£rom bis pen as a young author. Under
tbe provision in this Bill, whether,' lie
wanted to or not, bie would be obliged to
publish that book witbout corrections and
as an imperfeet work; tlie errors would be
continued, appearing ta came from him as
a mature autbor, when lie would noý have
tbe excuse which bie bad when lie wrote the
book as a young author.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: How about subsection 12?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If I may be permÏtted to finish. If it were not for the
fact ithat it would be personal, I could
name the honourable gentleman; lie sits
in this Hnuse.
Now, may I ask just one thing more?
The leader of the Government lias selected
on~e exaniple to uphold this Bill; and. I

SENATE
think I can say that if it had not been for
his extraordinary ability and skill, he
would have hesitated to make use of such
an example. Remember, honourable gentlemen, the entire argument rests upon
that example. What is it?
He takes
the case of a native of this country who goes to the United States
or somewhere outside of Canada and
gets his work published, and then turns
against bis own country and refuses to
give it the benefit of his work. I ask you,
honourable gentlemen, is that very probable? Do you -think that the authors who
go to other markets to have their books
printed do so because they want to deprive
their own country of the benefit of their
works, or because they feel that they need
a wider market? They go to the United
States because they must have a larger
field. If they could at the same time publish in both miarkets-and sometimes they
do-they would be only too glad to do so;
and it seems to me that the argument of
my honourable friend surely cannot be invoked. If there are any such cases as my
honourable friend referred to, they are very
rare exceptions, and it seems to me that
no general conclusion can be drawn from
them upon which to base this law.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would like to
draw the attention of the honourable
gentleman to subsection 12 of section 18.
Of course, I am not a lawyer, but to my
mind it provides for the case the honourable gentleman has referred to. It says:
Provided that nothing in this section shall
authorise the granting without the consent of
the author, of a license to publish a second
or succeeding edition of any work whereof
such author has published one or more editions
in Canada.

The first part of the same subsection

says:
If a book for which a license has been issued
is suppressed by the owner of the copyright-

If the author should become imbued with
the idea that he should make some changes
in his book because of recent developments,
te bas the power to suppress it, and under
those circumstances no license would be
given. It appears to me that subsection
12 of the section looks after what the honcurable gentleman has referred to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
By making
that citation, the honourable gentleman
knows that this Bill, though a compromise
in the Special Committee of the Commons,
was not absolutely infallible, because the
section which be bas read was added in
Committee of the Whole in the other
Hon. Mr. BEAUBINN.

Chamber at the request of Sir Robert
Borden. That simply shows that nothing
is perfect, and that we may succeed in
making the Bill more perfect by striking
cut sections 13, 14, and 15.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: All I have said
still stands good. My first answer is.that
if a man has an edition published outside
of Canada, he is absolutely without protection, because anyone in Canada may say
to him, "Publish, or, if you don't, I wilL
publish in your stead." My second answer
is that a man does not want to withdraw
his book; be wants to perfect it. He does
not want to cancel it; he wants to improve
it.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I think that when authors come to
Parliament and ask for privileges, there
is no question that Parliament is entitled
to dictate the terms and conditions on
which the privileges will be granted. So
far I side with the leader of the Government. But the question is as to whether
the conditions prescribed are fair conditions. For my part, I think the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) bas made a very strong
case, an unanswerable case, in showing
that Canadian authors may be very seriously affected if they cannot deal with a
publisher on the other side of the line
without that publisher the next day being
exoosed to the competition of a Canadian
publisher in selling an inferior edition of
the same hook.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
is to prevent the publisher in a foreign
country, with whom such a contract is
tnade, from- pudblishing in Canadia? He
gets over the difficulty by doing that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Of course, he may
not be willing to de that, because our
market is too smail. I am proceeding, in
no excited way, to express the opinion
that occurs to me after hearing both
sides. I have not the authority to say,
like the honourable leader of the Government, that if Canadian authors do not
accept this Bih they will have no Bill at
all; but I think we should be rendering a
service to Canadian authors if we endeavoured to arrive at some compromise,
as the House of Commons have done. I
am under the impression that section 13,
14, and 15 of this Bill may be improved,
by further safeguarding the interests of
Canadian authors, and it is to that purpose that our efforts should be directed. This
Bill, in one form or another, bas been

MAY 30, 1921
before Parliament for five or six years.
A great deal of work has been done, not
on this very Bill, 'but on a Bill covering
the saine matter; yet no 1'aw bas been
placéd on the statute bo'ok. I amn afraid, if
*we do not pay greater attention to this
feature in order to improve so far as possible the position of Canadian authors, but
on the other band inake concessions, to
Canadian publishers, that there will stili
ho 1no law and the matter will remain as
it bas stood for some years past.
The honourable leader of the Government
will admit that the action Parliament
would be taking in enacting these clauses
13, 14, and 15 i~ould, ho such as to place
Canadian authors in a position different
froin that of the authors of any country
governed by the Berne Convention. Therefore it seenis to me that we are not 6ealing as generously with Canadiaii authors
as France, England, or any other country
under the Berne Convention is dealing
with its, authors; and for my part I dislike that feature of the Bill. On the other
hand, there is this other point which we
must bear in mind, that we may ho dTiven
to that position to somne extent because of
our situation alongside the United States,
a country very much larger than ours, having a much larger reading public, and
therefore giving considerable ad'vantage to
publishers on the other side. The question
arises whether under these circumstances
it is not fair to grant some protection to
Canadian pùblishers. For mny part, I would
like to try to reconcile the grantin-g of
some concessions to the publishers with
the further safeguarding of the interests
oif Caxnadian authors. Having seen the Bill
only to-day, I have mot been able to give
it mature conisideration; but 1 am under the
impression that the Bill might provide
further protection, for instance, by guarding against book& published or printed in
Canada being printed on, Inferior paper
and soUd at a price much lower than that
at which the book is published, under a
contract mnade by the owner of the copyright ýhimself. I entreat honourable gentlemen on both aides ta consider whether ît
would not ho better to, apply our faculties
in an attempt. to, improve the Bill instead of coming into conflict with the House
of Gommons and perhalys e'ndngerixg the
passage of this legislation.
Paragrapli a of sxmbsection 1 of section
13 was agre*d to on the following division:
Contents, 26; non-oontents, 20.
On paragrapb b of subsection 1:
S-42

651

Hon. Mrà BEAUBIEN: .I think this
clause is flot very clear. Paragraph a ays
that the authors shail be obliged to print
in Canada, and paragraph b says exactly
the saine thing-that they must provide
the Canadian market with copies printed
in Canada. That is repeating the saine
obligation. I submit that paragraph b
should be amend¶ed to read:
SOr to supply by means of a sulffcient nuinber of copies the reasonable demande of the
Canadian market for such book.
In other words, if an author refuses to
print in Canada, then we say to hîm: "You
have no right to deprive our public of the
benefit of your book; give us the number
of copies required by our market." That,
to my nxind, is a logical position. I do not
approve of the clause, but if i is Vo be
passed it should be corrected so as to
require publication in. Canad-a, or, in the
alternative, the furnishing of the nuinher
of copies necessary to, satisfy the needs of
the home market. I therefore propose this
amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
My
honourable friend apparently does noV read
paragraph b as I do. I was going to say
that my honourable friend does not fully
grasp the application of paragraph b.
Paragraph a makes provision for the printing of the book, aird paragraph b makes
provision for the keeping up of the supply.
That is to say, an author who bas printed
bis book cannot say, "There, I have coffnplied with the law"; he must keep printing
it as long as there is a demand for the
book.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My amendment
%overs that exactly.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But if
the present paragra-ph does so, why accept
an amendinent?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Only for this
reason, that in1 one case you will noV allow
in this country a single copy of any book
worth having, unless it is printed in Canada. That is the point. The book *must
be "80 printed."
If, for instance, an
author has his book published eisewhere,
but is ready t-o supply us with alil the copies
we require, they are refused at the border,
because the printers will not shlow theni to
come through. It may noV pay the author
to have an edition of his book publishied
in this country. Under the amendment as
I have moved it, the author will have the
alternative of either printing in Canada or
bringing over here tbe number of copies
called for by our market, even if they have
been printed aýbroad.

14. No one will be entitled to a license as
provided under this clause who has previous]y
refused a proposai by the author to print or
publish his work.i

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 cannot
see the reason for that.
.Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The reason is
this. The author is desirous of finding a
ptwblisher. The author first looks for one
near his home or in bis own country. The
publisher examines the work, but it does
not appeal to, him, and he feels that be
sbould not take the risk of printing it. The
author finds the doors closed wherever he
applies in Canada to bave bis book publisbed; and, as be bas not the money Vo

book, and it bas a cènsiderable sale. Should

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As between him and other publishers, yes. 1 do

since we are giving a privilege to the

mit that in that case the license should
not be granted. I want my amendment
as a necessary incident to the granting of

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me to be mandatory, because it says
that the owner of the copyright shall be
entitled to being fully heard.

Hon. S:r JAMES LOUGHEED: What
does my honourable friend seek to gain
by that?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Why does it
not provide that he should be notified?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would gain
this, that I would prevent a publisher of
the United States, say, from coming to the
Minister of Justice at Ottawa and securing a license, when in fact the Canadian
author may be making arrangementà himself for publication in Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: All that
the author has to do is to notify the Minister who issues the license, of his intentions.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But he may not
know that there is an application pending
for a license; it is done behind his back;
he does not know anything about it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let us
see. In the first place, the licensee must
make the application, and make it on
grounds or reasons, the chief reason being
that publication is not being made in Canada. Presumably the author will be familiar with this Bill, or this Act as it
will then be, and he can surely notify the
Miniýster who issues the license that lie is
about to riake publication in Canada.

copyright shall be entitled to being fully heard

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does that imply
an obligation on the part of the Minister
to notify the owner?

the author.

On subsection 2-rates of royalties:
lon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want ta draw
my honourable friend's attention ta the
fact that the English Act provides for
rates considerably in excess of those we
are providing for. I want ta propose the
following amendment:
That clause 18, subsection 2, be amended by

substitutlng therefor the following:
2. That the rates at whlch such. royalties as
aforesald are to be ca]culated »hal(a) In the case of contrivances sold within
two years after the commencement of this Act
by the person making the sanie, be. 2J per
cent for each playlng surface; and
(b) In the case of contrivances sold as aforeaald after the expiration 6f the laet mentIoned
period, 5 per cent for each playing surface;
-n the ordînary retail selllng price of the contrivance calculated In the prescribed manner,
sc. heweve-r, that the royalty payable In respect
of a contrivance shaîl in no case be less than
1 per cent for each separate musical work In
which copyright subeists reproduced thereon,
and, where the royalty calcuiated as aforesaid
Includes a fraction of a cent of ene-haîf or
more, such fraction ehaîl be reckoned as one
cent.

The abject of my amendment is to
adopt the saine rates as prevail in Great
Britain. It seems ta me that there are
reasans which ought ta make the rates in
Canada at least as high as those in Great
Britain.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: When this matter
was up in 1919 there was a conference
between the men who were handling the
records and the sang writers whose sangs
were being recorded on the records, and
it was agreed at that time ta make a fiat
price of 2 cents for each. That is the price
put in this, Bill, and it seems to me
reasonable. I think we should hold to that.

from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcaurt) proposes
ta ada.pt instead of the fiat rate the British
rate, which would have the effect of increasing the royalty. I have yet ta hear
from the honaurable gentleman frem
Taronto (Hon. Mr. Proudfeot), whether
he joins hands with the honourable gentlemnan fram Ottawa in raising the royalty,
or if his amendment is ta the contrary
effect.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My amendment
is copied verbatim from the English section.
It is word for word with subsection 3 of
section 19.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The amiendment I prapose te mave is:
That in subsection 2, where the words
"two cents" appear, in lines 1 and 2, they
be changed to "one cent".
Han. Mr. FOWLER: You are geing te
help the auther out.
Hion. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 1 arn glad ta
hear that.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And ta keep him
out.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
There are
several reasons why the royalty should net
be fixed at too high a figure. It is quite
true that some years ago, when the question was first spoken of, the rate of 2 cents
was mentioned; but the Bill did net go
through, and in the meantime the matter
bas been fully considered. The trade bas
developed very considerably in Canada, and
they are satisfied that a 2 cent rate for
each playing surface would put a number
of the factories out of business.
It may be interesting te honoura:ble gelitiemen te knew how far we have proceeded
in Canadia in the manufacture of records.
In Toronte we have the Columbia cernpany, with an investynent of $3,000,000

popular forms of roll put on the market
is a medley composed of popular selections
from several songs or compositions, and ho
has suggested that instead of "two cents
for e'ach playing surface," or each dise,
or roll, it should be two cents for each
composition. That is not a very unreasonable suggestion either, for a popular air,
or refrain, or chorus from each of half-adozen songs might be included ii one
medley, and you would pay only two cents
to use that in a roll. If that is divided
among two, three, four, or five composers,
it means that they get virtually nothing.
Although that suggestion appealed to me,
I am not going to move to change this
clause, because I think the figure of two
cents per roll, or per playing surface, was
in reality a compromise, and was, at the
time it was first suggested, a compromise
agreeable to all the parties affected. The
authors wanted more, and the composers
certainly wanted more. The manufacturers
were fully represented before the Committee of this House, and I am informed
that they were fairly well represented before the special committee of the House of
Commons. I think that at this stage of
the Bill it would be inadvisable to deprive
the author of that very small royalty on
the reproduction of his work.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
Belcourt moves that clause 18-

Hon. Mr.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I just want to
refer to one matter spoken of one moment
ago. We say that authors will suffer no
injury through the granting of the request
that I make. A double-faced record listed
at one dollar sells wholesale at fifty cents.
Under this Bill it is apparently intended to
make the royalty on that record four cents;
and because the wholesale price for the
record that I have mentioned is only fifty
cents, you are really making the royalty
eight per cent. I do not think it is a fair
comparison to place us on the same basis as
either Great Britain or the United States,
because each of those countries bas such a
large population as compared with ours.
Our population is as one to thirteen, conpared to the population of the United
States; and compared to that of Great
Britain it is as one to six or seven. The
possibilities in those countries are very
great. In this country, if the man who
produces a record is not able to sell at least
5,000 copies of it, it is a complete loss to
him. He has to take all that risk, and you
are going to make it worse for him.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

In giving a royalty, we are giving something that was never given before. Why
not start at a small sum, and if you find
that it is going to work injuriously there
will be an opportunity of increasing the
rate. If the rate is fixed at two cents, it
would be very much harder to reduce it to
one cent than to increase it from one to two
cents.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is easier to reduce a rate than to raise it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Oh, no.

Always.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, it would be
very much harder to make the reduction
from two cents to one cent than to increase
from one to two cents.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We can reduce it
as soon as we see those companies of yours
fail.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not want
them to be placed in that position. Speaking of companies failing, during the war the
French company, Pathé Frères, were put
out of business by the luxury tax of five
cents apiece placed on their records. They
simply had to go out of business. But my
honourable friend from Ottawa states that
the rate should be the saine as in Great
Britain. It would simply mean ruin to
these eompanies at once.

countries. If you pass the Bill as it stands
you are not going to place our manufacturers in as good a position as the German
people occupy. No matter what happens to
the other branch of my motions, I say this
is one that should commend itself to the
good sense of the honourable gentlemen
who compose this House.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If the amendment
is carried would it not have the following
result. An Italian -sends dises over here,
after getting 2 cents in his country, and he
gets 2 cents in Canada. Practically all
foreign authors or composers would be
treated in like manner; they would have
their own amount at home, and an equal
amount, or the amount stipulated, in the
land to which they send their discs; while,
if this law is passed, the Canadian author
will be placed on a footing of inferiority; he
will get nothing at home, and only whatever
is coming to him in foreign lands. It seems
to me that that should suffice to show that
any such legislation should only be ad'opted
if we had reciprocity.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But my honourable friend overlooks this fact that our
people are not exporting records to countries where they have to pay double royalties and the authors are not losing anything, because unless the records are exported they do not receive anything on
them. Why should we curb our manufacturers in order to assist authors when as
a matter of fact we are not going to assist
them? This matter seems to me so plain
that it is only capable of one argument,
that is, that o'ur record manufacturers
should be placed in a position to be able
to do business. If you -are going to adopt
the dog-in-the-manger policy of preventing
the manufacturer from exporting, you are
not going to help the authors, and you will
injure not only the manufacturers, but
the people who are earning their livelihood in this country in assisting in that
production.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I wonder if
the House would be willing to let that
subsection stand?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
we had better dispose of it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think there
is a great deal in the argument of the
honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot). The object of copyright

Mr. PROUDFOOT.

our authors and works spread abroad;
but this is really a phase of protection,
and I think there is a good deal to support the honourable gentleman's argument. The Bill, on the whole, as a compromise Bill, is so acceptable to me that
I would not like to say anything in derogation of the Bill generally; but I do think
it is a hardship to the exporter of records
if an author is going to get an equivalent
royalty from the importing country,
though it should be an equivalent, in any
by the
event, to the royalty received
Canadian author for the record sold in
Canada; but how work it out?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the
honourable gentleman explain to me how
the matter works out? I understand that
it is the manufacturer of the disc who
pays the royalty. Now, if he, the Canadian
manufacturer, pays to the, Canadian
author that royalty, how can he be made
to pay a double royalty to that author,
who is privileged to the extent of the
amount mentioned in this Act? Will the
manufacturer, after having paid to the
Canadian author a royalty of 2 cents say,
or 4 cents, be obliged to turn around to
the author and say, "I have sold in
Australia, and I am commanded to pay
vou another royalty from Australia"? I
cannot understand how this is worked.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The effect of
my amendment would be this-that the
record manufacturer would not pay- a
royalty to the author in Canada at all if
he is shipping to a foreign country where
he is bound to pay a royalty on the goods
shipped there. If, however, he is shipping
to places such as Mexico or Peru, where
they do not charge a royalty, then he
would expect to pay the royalty.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Suppose a dise
made in England pays a royalty there and
one here, is it not a fact that ultimately
the man who buys the dise pays both royalties?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Possibly, but
my honourable friend overlooks the fact
that we are competing with the world. It
is because of that competition and the
other nations not paying the royalty, that
we are placed at a disadvantage, and therefore cannot sell in the same market if we
have to pay 8 cents on those records,
which we would have to pay, assuming
that the royalty in this country is 4 cents,
and in the other country 4 cents.

MAY 30, 1921
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Who would get.
that double royalty-the author?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The author
wouid get the royalty in Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Whe would get it
in the other place?.
,Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 1 do flot know.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It could not be a

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would be

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It wouid be

thing.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then you make the

pay the tax and that would cause hlm to
suifer.
Hon Mr. PROUDFOOT: There is a
great deal in this matter, and I do not
know that it should be rushed through without a good deal of consideration, simply
because it le getting somewhat late in the
evening. I think we should deai with this
point in what would seem te me te be a
fair and reasonable manner. It is the
moet important amendinent which. I have
bronght up in connection with the Bill, and
I wouid like to have it fuily and fairiy coneidered. The House lias not had an opportunity of dealing with this Bill. This
is what we cali eleventh-hour legislation.
The Bill ie rushed down here from the
Gommons; we, have had -no opportunity
unti¶ within the iast few heurs of considering this Bill, and I say that that is
net a fair way of treating the Senate
or of treating legisiation which is trought
be-fore this House, and which 'we are sending out to the country at large. This
Bill was before the Commene very earhy
in the Session; it was sent to a speciai
Commîttee, which heid meetings and heard
etatements fromn various p3eophe; then a
Committee of the whole House deait with
it. 1 arn toid that, aithough a large cernmittee in the GCommons was suppoeed te
deai 'with this particular Bill, dnring the
greater portion of the time that Committee
was in session oniy two members of the
Coxnmittee were present, and 'at one stage
there was only one member present.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That couid
not be a quorum.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Welh, they
went on with the work jusit the same.
That being se, 1 say that this House should

tf

give fuil consideration and effect to the
representations which are brought before
it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do flot know why
this lecture should be read to us by the
honourable gentleman at this time. This
matter of copyright has, been before the
Parliament of Canada for some years, and
everybody is more or less familiar with
it. The present Bill is very much the
same as the one that was before the Seniate in 1919. 0f course, the honourable
gentleman was not a member of the Senate at that time, but there was a speciai
committee of the Senate appointed, and
it heard both sides for days and weeks,
and the matter was threshed out thoroughiy,
and I do not see why there should be an'.
delay about this matter now. So far as
my honourable friend's argument is concerned with regard te this export businesc,
he speaks of some sort of tax. It is flot
the 2 cents, or whatever royalty should
be paid to the author of the work, but
some sort of a tax which in certain courtries is, put upon records brought in. He
proposes-or rather, his friends the
mnanufacturers propose through him-that
the author shahl pay that tax; that is,
he shall lose (his royalty to the amount
of the tax that is put upon him in the
foreign country. Well, that is worse than
robbing Peter to pay Paul, I think.
Hon. Mr. PRO UDFOOT: I should net
think so.
Hon. Mr. POWLER: I should think so,
simpiy because they are exporting to a
foreign country the product of this man's
brains, the product of his thouglit; and
because they are sending it to a foreign
country they say they shall net pay him
anything for it. That would be extremely
uni ust to the author. After ail, we shouid
protect hlm as well as protect the manufacturer. Hehlas suifered for years, while
the manufacturers have grown rieli upon
the profit that they have made eut of the
author's work, for which they paid nothing.
If they had been the generous, decent men
they should have been, they would have
paid a royalty, even though there wi,
not a royalty demanded, as was often
done by leading boekselle-rs and publishers in the United States when the+e
was no copyright between the United States
and Engiand. In niany cases those reputable firms paid to British authors, although
they were not obliged by law se to do,
cons'iderable sums by way of royalty which
was not exacted of them.

titibSENATE
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The Supreme
Court of the United States held that they
were flot bound to pay.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
I say, notwithstanding that, they did pay in the case of
the publishers. I think that a 2-cent rate
is a low enough rate; it was agreed upon
by ail parties, and I do flot see why we
should flot stand by it.
Hon. Mr. Proudfoot's amendment was
negatived.
Progress was reported.
JUDGES BILL
REPORT 0F CONFERENCE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Before
we adjourn I should Iike to present the
report of what is known as the Conference
on the Judges Act. As it is very desirable
to get this down to the House of Commnons,
I take the liberty of rea ding it:
The managers on the part off the Senate have
the honour to report that they met the managers
on the part off the House off Commons, which,
on their part, was managed by the Honourable
Mr. Doherty and others, for the purpose off
ffurther considering the amendments to Bill 60,
intituled, an Act to amend the Judges Act.
The managers on the part off the Senate
agreed that the following be added as section
4.
,,4. The Judges Act, chapter
13,8 of the
Revi,,ed ýStatutes, 1906, is hereby amended bY
adding thereto the following section:
"35. That, unIess nominated by the <lovernor
in Council, no judge mentioned in this Act
shall act as connnissioner or arbitrator on any
commission or inqutry: provided that this enactmont shall not interfere with judges who are
at present acting as commissioners or arbitrators, completing the work on which they are
engaged."
The managers on the part off the Senate did
not insist on the Senate amendments numbers
2 and 3.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is the old
clause.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIIEED: That is
the old clause. That, 1 may say, to the
House is the on]y compromise we cou]d
brin- about. It was feit on the part of
those who represented the Commons that
it rested with each province to amend its
Judicature Act or its Court Act so as to
make the work of conducting arbitrations
or commissions a judicial duty of any of
the judges, and in that way to continue to
exercise the right of appointîng judges for
the purpose of acting as commissioners or
a rbitr a tors.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
That siïnply
means that we have receded entirely from

Mr.

the position that we took in this House,
and have accepted the position insisted
upon by the Commons.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
No,
rather the contrary. The Commons would
accept this as a compromise, in view of the
amendments to the Bill carried in this
Chamber. It is needless to say that the
Commons will flot acceptHon. Mr. BELCOURT: The result ia

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

That

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then, that is,
the position the Commons takes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
My
honourable friend forgets that this amendment was suggested in this Chamber as a
compromise, but that it was rejected.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We decided by a
majority of one that the law should contain some provision by which the Governor
in Council would be prevented from appointing judges to sit as commissioners or
arbitrators. That was the sense of this
Hou se.
Ho.n, W. B. ROSS: We did two thi'ngs.
Under the law as it stood the Lieutenant
Gxovernorsý and the Governor General ýhad
the power to appoint judges. The resuit
of the amendment mentioned in the report
is that the Lieutenant Governors will not
be able to -appoint judges, but the Governor
General may. You get haif of what you
were asking for. You get what was pro>posed by the amendment which 1 moved
in this House, but which was superseded
by the ame'ndment of the honourable gentleman fror Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton). I may say to the honourable
gentleman that it is well to t-ake what is
offered, for the reason that Mr. Lapointe
made a .,uggestion in regard to the selection of .judges by the Governor General,
whieh I think would have a good chance
of carrying in this House, and which, he
says, would carry in the other bouse. If
it did, it would remove my -objection to
the Governor General dealing with appointments.
bon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not follow
my honou"able friend at ail. If I arn right,
and I think I arn, what this bouse did
was to amend the Act so that the appoint-

MAY 30, 1921
ment of judges to act as commissioners or
arbitra-toms, could flot be made, either by
the Governor in Gouncil or the Lieutenant
Governor.. in Council.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. Now, we have
haif of that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It seems to me
that thé rosition is flot changed. The resuit is that the judges rnay be appointed
as arbitrators or commissioners by the
Governor in Council or the Lieutenant Governor in Cauncil.
H-on. Mr. BEIQUE: Only -by the Governor in Gouncil.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If that is the
case, it is worse stili. We do not get haif;
we do no-, get anything.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
honourable gentleman f rom Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) moved in amendment
to the Bill that the power of the Lieutenant Governors to appoit jud'ges be
striken out, having in view the authority
of the provinces to -amend their own acts
so that by the rota a judge could be appointed a commissioner or arbitrator.
Then the honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) moved
to strike out the power of both the Lieutenant Governors and the Goavernor in
Council. That amendmnent was carrjed. I~n
going into the Conférence the Gommons
practically said, "We will accept the first
amendment proposed to the Bill, naniely,
the amen dment moved by the honourable
gentiemar, from Middleton." Is it not better to take that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it was
an amendmnent which had been rejected by
this Chamber.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 'Oh, yes,
it was a compromise. If that is not; accepted the Bill simply falis to the ground.
Hon. Mr.. DANDURAND: *My honourable friend is reporting from the conference ta the Senate?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED: Yes.
Hon. Mr,. DANDURAND: Was tihat the
decision of the representatives of the Senate before they entered the conference or
after?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, during the conference. The Ministe:r of Justice acted as Chairman oi the Conférence,
and said he would recommend to the Commans that this proposai ho accepted.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Has n-ot my honourable friend acted a littie hastily in this
matter? After we met the Gommons this
morning at half-past 10, I thought we were
going ta meet again ta consider the question before it was reported to the Senate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
did not so understand. The question came
up; what will the Senate accept and what
will the House of Commons accept? The
amendment is ours, and we have to indicate
to the Commons that we willl accept it;
otherwise there will. be an impasse.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think I pointed
out that the amendment which was proposed had airêady been voted down in this
Chamber.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
That
did not preclude us froin suggesting that
it should be a comnpromise.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 'I do not care
whether you call it a compromnise or not.
What is the effect of it going ta be? Is it
not that the Act remains as it was?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is, that the
Lieutenant Governor in Conneil or the Gavernor in Council may appoint judgës as
commiesioners or arbitrators.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
both have a right to make appointments
as the law stands at present. Now, we cut
off the Lieutenant Governor and leave the
appointuxent to the Goyvernor in Gouncil.
Hlon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: What lias became of the second amendment? We had
two amenchuents, one to strike out a certain portion of the sections passed hast
year.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
I
thaught I made it clear that the amendment
which was carried would nat be accepted
by the Gommons, and that consequently,
unhless it was accepted by the Gommons,
the Bill would fali to the ground. They say
they will nat 4ccept that, but that they
wilh accept this.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Then we are
in a warse position than we were wheni we
had the first conference; because at the firgt

what is there now.

the act of last Session was to stand.
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: How
could that stand? It is the very tbing they
objeet to.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, excuse me.
What we were striking out was a portion
of section 35, which appeared in the Act
of 1920.
Would the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman tell me what will
be before us when we take this question
up again to-morrow? Will it be a motion
moved by himself?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
law will stand in this way:
Unless nominiated by the Governor ini Council no judge mentioned in this Act-

That will be the amendment to 35act as commissioner or arbitrator en
-9hall
any commission or inquiry; provided that this
enactment shall fot interfere wi-th judges who
are at present acting as commissioners or arbitrators completlng the work on which they are
engaged.

If I am not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mistaken, this is word for word -with the
motion which was rejected by this Chamber.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

And my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend intends, if 1 understand
him, to propose to-morrow that we adopt
this amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

How can he
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
do so under the rules? The Senate 'bas
clearly expressed its -opinion that this
amendment should not be accepted. We
have voted upon it. How can my honourable friend come back with it? 1 am not
asking him 110w unless he is ready to
answer, as he is simply giving notice of
motion; but it occurs to me that he will
have some difficulty in reconciling such
procedure with the motion which. bas already been accepted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
not an amendment to the Act. It is simply
a report from the Conference that the Commons will accept this in lieu of the aiv-cndment which this Chamber passed. It is
the outcome of a conference.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The position will
be that the amendment passed by this House
wjll not be,insisted upon.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUTGH1-EED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
it be not insisted upon-that this be

INTERNATIONAL UNIONS AND

MOTION

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN moved:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the presence in the Couneil Chamber of a Minister
affiliated to an international union is a menace
to Canada.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I want
to state right at the outset that this is a
question of principle and policy. It has
nothing to do with members of the Government as individuals. It alludes to, any
Minister of the Crown. I desire also to
say at once that I have absolutely no quarrel, as some honoùrable members were inclined to believe I had, with the Minister

very strongly advocated the same thing,
and was even successful in putting through
a Bill which I had been advocating in
this House, and which the Hon. Méderic
Martin, mayor of Montreal, for many
years, had been advocating in the other
House. I may say we had been working
on that Bill for about ten years, and it
was only through the persistent efforts df
the Minister of Labour, the Hon. Méderic
Martin and myseif that that measure,

MAY 31, 1921
which we believed ta be just and in the
interest of the workingxnan, was enacted.
Sa that may dispel any idea that we were
at cross purposes.,
I desire also to dispel the idea of my
being hostile ta international or national
unions. That is not my purpose at aIl.
I may say that the Hon. Méderic M4artin
bas been a member of the international
unions for thirty years. Lately we had a
great election in Montreal on the referendum.
The great population of 800,000
people had been disfranchised. I was on
the side of the Hon. Méderic Martin, the
mayor, and, in order ta show that 1 have
nothing against labour, I may mention
that at a mass meeting that was being held
in Montreal, Mr. Martin, after -I had
spoken and taken my seat an the platform, pointed ta me and said ta that immense audience comprising thousands of
people: "There sits the best frîend that
.labour bas in Montreal, the best friend
that labour ever had in the Senate; and if
1 have any reputation in the city of
Montreal, if 1 to-day occupy the highest
position in the gift of the citizens of
Montreal, I owe it ta the good advice that
on many occasions I received fromn Senator
Casgrain." Therefore it will be seen that
I arn not hostile ta labour; far from it.
This was said in the presence of the leaders of the trade union organizatians. I could
naine them.
They were headed by a
foreign-born gentleman, Gustav Francq,
a Belgian; and there were other leaders
present-I do not know where they were
born. Those statements of Mayor Martin
were made in their 'preseince. Then, turning ta the crowd, hie 'went on ta say:
"There hie sits, and does not remember
what good hie bas done. Does hie remember when I went to the Senate one day
and asked him, 'Will you help me, Senator,
ta do something for the workingmen of
Montreal'?' Yau don't remember the answer
that you gave me. 1 remember it, and I
shafl neyer forget it, and the working men
You
jof Montreal will neyer forget it.
answered at once, 'Sans doute-certainly.'
Ever 'since then the workingmen of Montreal know where their friends are."
The bi-monthly payment of the railway
employees had also the sympathy of the
present Minister of Justice. 9'he Grand
Trunk shops were situated within his division, and he knew haw unjust it was ta
require men ta work for six or seven weeks,
before they got one day's pay. The aider
mnembers of this, House remember ail of
that. I might mention, that fromn 1900 ta
1910, when on behaîf of the English bond-

671

helders, I operated the railway called -the
Quebec Oriental, my workmen were paid
weekly, and they said that te be paid
weekly was worth'more than twenty per
cent more ta them than if they received
their pay at the end of a month or longer.
Now that we have so many railways, it
might be well if we also, paid the men
weekly; we might get them more cheaply,
as you can aiways obtain more for cash
than you can on credit.
For a long time before the Minister of
Labour entered this House we had had the
eight-hour day debate. Who was the first
Senator who introduced the question of the
eight-hour day in this Chamber? It was
your humble servant, and my speech on
that question, which. will be found in Han-.
sard, was very înueh along the lines of
the speech made by the present leader of
the Opposition in another place. But I
advocated the eight-hour day, mind you,
honourable gentlemen, an Government contracts only. We dlaim that Parliament is
the representative of the people, and the
people have an absalute right, in mnaking a
contract, ta determine under what conditions it shahl be awarded to the contractor,
and he may accept it or not just as lie
pleases. The contract is entered into
voluntarily between the Government on one
part and the contractor on the other, and
any conditions that the Government desires
to impose can be accepted orý declined by
the contractor, just as he pleasês, and if hie
accepts the conditions lie may shape his
prices accordingly. That is a voluntary
arrangement. But I was very careful to
say that in private contracts the people
should be absolutely free ta make any
covenant or arrangement they desired. The
undeniable right of individual liberty must
always be respected. I want individual
liberty for the workingman just as much
as for the contractaer, and I say that if a
workingman wishes to work so many heurs
in the 24 hours, hie is entitled to do so, and
no persan should prevent that or interfere
with bis individual liberty. If, I were
giving a contract I would include as a condition of it that there should be no Sunday
work. I ama entitled ta make that condition. 1 may mention here that in the
Marbridge apartment, at Montreal, when I
saw a contractaer working an Sunday, I
told him that was the last time hie would
work for me-that lie would neyer have
another chance ta work for me on Sunday
or an any other day. I think any citizen
should he free ta make contracts with union
labour or with the immense majority of the

372

SENATE

workingmen who do not belong to any
union. It may be a surprise to many honourable members of this House-it was
certainly a great surprise to me-to learn
how small a proportion of workers are
members of labour unions. If the honourable Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) does me the honour of answering me
he can corroborate this statement or contradict it. I am informed on very good
authority that in the United States of
America only from ten to fifteen per cent
of the workingmen are members of labour
unions. Even during the war, when men
were so scarce, and labour was so high,

when it was easy for workmen to pay their
union dues, only from ten to fifteen per
cent of the total were members. In the
steel industry, it appears, there is only one
union member in every ten werkers. I
assure you that in making that statement I
have the authority of no less a person than
Judge Gary, the president of the United
States Steel Corporation, the biggest ihdustrial corporation on earth. Judge Gary
says, and he should know, that in the steel
industry of the. United States only one
workman in ten is a labour unionist. I must
confess that was a revelation to me. I
thought, after all the work that had been
done by the walking delegates, and so on,
that there would have been more.
Now, as to the Minister of Labour, I
really believe, ahd sincerely say, that he
is a great credit to labour. He is eloquent;
he is able; and what, possibly, is more
important, he is a self-made man. Much
as I admire the man with a college training and with the advantage of a university
course, coached by the best professors, why
should I deny that my heart goes out to
the self-made man. He must be made of
superior stuff; he must have a greater
intellect; he must be one, who will, by
his own force and ability, without the help
of professors, rise above his comrades. I
was going to say-if time permitted; anl
Parliament can sit well into next week, so
we have plenty of time. No one need
think I am interfering with the progress
of Parliament, because it appears that the
workers in Yamaska are going to keep
Parliament sitting. We sat here last week,
and it is going to be tit for tatHon. Mr. BENNETT: How would it be
if the honourable gentleman's friends were
rewarded with a subscription, so that we
could go home?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps they
have been.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my honourable friend to my right is joking when
he makes that statement. I do not want
to defend the honourable gentleman from
Yamaska; the Postmaster General should
do that.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I have nothing to
do with that. I will pay the compliment
to my honourable friend, Senator Casgrain,
of saying that I believe he is in earnest
and is speaking the truth; but I have no
share in what the House of Commons has
decided to do. I am willing to lose what
I may be losing.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: To continue the
eulogy of the Minister of Labour. I believe that when he was a young man he
was, like Edison, a telegraph operator.
From a telegraph operator he rose and
became a Senator, having been chosen by
this Government-or the preceding one,
which is very much the same thing. Then
he became a Privy Councillor; then a
Cabinet Minister-a full-fledged Cabinet
Minister with a portfolio. We have three
of them in this House now.

The task of the Minister of Labour is a
very difficult one. He bas to try to please
both sides, and one would think he would
lose patience; but he is always dignified and
calm. Like the great captains of industry,
and perhaps I may be permitted to say
like myself, he started in life a poor man.
Carnegie himself once worked for $2 a
week. But, after all the good things I
have said about the Minister, I say that he
is human, and therefore liable to make
mistakes. And I believe he 'did make t
very serious mistake when he did not invite
the National Catholic Union to the Labour
Conference that was held here. What difference does it make whether a Labour
Union is Catholic or Methodist, provided
that it is neither socialistic nor Bolshevik?
I think we should encourage religious labour
unions, because good church-going people
do not disturb the peace; they respect the
law and see that it is obeyed. I do not
see any objection to mixing religion with
labour unions; on the contrary, I believe
it would be a good thing. The Church always respects the law.
Just at present-perhaps it is due to hard
times-a change seems to have come over

their individuality and to get promotion.
They do not want to be looked upon as so
mnany machines, each one costing the same
price and doing exactly the saine work.
They want to, be differentiated. According
to, the rules which prevail now-and I do
flot believe this House knows very much
about these rulës, and perhaps it would be
a good thing if it did-it rnight have more
admiration for the unions-I arn informed
that a -workman can only be promoted by
seniority. If there are two or three not
very good workers ahead of a man, is hie
to remain at his machine or at his lathe
until the other two die and pass away?
Hle may be a man of superior ability; but
under thfat system a good man cannot be
promoted. There are* rnany men who are
anxious to do more work to get more compensation, -but under prevailing conditions
that does not appear to be possible. If
we turn to the Gospel, what do we find?
We ail k.now the Gospel a-bout the men of
the eleventh bour. A man went out into
the market place to hire labourers. He
went out at ail hours of the day and
found men idle, and hie hired tbemn; and at
eleventh hour-the Bible teaches us that
they worked twelve hours-he went out
again and hired mxore labourers. When
nigbt came the master said, "Let them
corne, and give tbemn their pay." And
they were paid the agreed price, and those
who came, at the eleventh hour were paid
as rnuch as those who had corne earlier.
T1he ones who came earlier grumbled, and
said: "We have stood the burden and the
beat of the day, and you do not give us
any more than these others." What was
the answer? "Is it not lawful for me to,
do what I wiIl? ls thine eye evil because
I arn good'?" Under prevailing conditions
that master could not have done as hie did;
under existing conditions, as I understand
themn, no master has a right to, differentiate
and to pay more to one man than to another. Christ said, "Love one another;"
but where is Christianity when, if there is
no card, there is no love, and whefl a man
who has not a card js not allowed to,
work? I tbink one man sbould be allowed
the sarne li'berty asanother. So far as I
know, the open £bop does not discriminate
against a inan who belongs -to a labour
union. Why should a union discriminate
against the open shop? These tbings will
'be explained by the Minister of Labour,
but I cannot exPlain tbemn.
Lord Shaughnessy the other day in a
speech in the city of Quebec said:

A moment ago I was alluding to, religious

The Methodists, or the

inembers of the Salvation Arrny, van have

That ail churches should be specially 'lnterested In the workman la easy to understand.

Lord and Master wa-s Hirnself a workingman. .Surely hie who says the Church looks
askance at the working classes must know
very little of hier early history.
Now, as to churches. and unions. Union
is 'strength, and you find union in the
Bible. The brother that is helped by bis
brother is like a strong city. Some thirty
years ago, Leo XIII, the Workman's Friend,
issued an encyclical or message to, the
world on "The Condition of the Working
Classes," which. bas been rigbtly called the
Workingmnan's Charter. For just as, in
the middle ages, Magna Charta was the
declaration of the rights of the people, so,
in our own tirnes, Leo XIII's message was
the declaration of the rights of the workifigman.
How adinirably the learned
Pontiff lays down the rules governing the
labour question rnay be judged by a few
quotations. In expounding the duties of
the State towards the worker, hie says in
part:
Justice demands that his Interests be carefully watched over, so that he who contrtbutes
sa, largely to Public welfare may share In it';
that being housed, clothed, and enabled to suipport life, bis existence may be more endurable.

family were relaxed ; if religion were found to
suffer through lack of time and opportunity to
practise it; if in workshops and factories morals
were endangered through the mngling of sexes
or other occasions of evil; of if employers laid
unjust burdens upon the workmen, or degraded
them wth conditions repugnant to their dignity
as h'uman beings; finally, if health were endangered by excessive labour, or by work unsuited to sex or age-it would then be right,
within certain l'imits, to call in the help and
authority of the law.

Further on he sheds a new light on two

most intricate questions-that of saving
labour from speculators and that of child
labour:
s

Saving labour from speculators: The first
concern of all is to save the poor workers from
grasping speculators, who use human beings
as mere instruments for making money. It is
neither justice nor humanity so to grind men
down as to stupefy their minds and wear out
their bodies .

work suitable for a strong man eonnot reasonaibly be required from a woman or a ch'ild.
Employers'
moral obligation to pay fair
wages: Grant that workmen and employer make
free agreements, especially as to wages ; nevertheless, it is a dictate of nature more imperious
and more ancient than any bargain between
man and man, that the remuneration must be
enough to support the wage earner in reasonable comfort. If, through necessity or fear of
worse, the workman is compelled to accept
harder conditions, he is the victi-m of force or
injustice.

Lastly, Leo XIII advocates Workmen's
Associations as the best means of affording
assistance to those in need, and of drawing

the two orders closely together:
Most important of all are Workmen's Associations, for these virtually include all the rest.
But he lays down as a general and perpetual
law that religion and morality must be a prime
considera.tion with these associations and govern
their internai discipline. . . . What advantage
can it be to a poor workman to obtain by means
of *a society all that he requires, and to endanger his soul for want of spiritual food? What
doth it profit a man to gain the whole world and
suffer the loss of his own soul?. . . .
If ei-ther ain employer or a workman deems
himself injured, a committee of honest and
capable men should be appointed to decide the
dispute by the laws of the association. One
of the purposes of a society should be to
arrange for continuous work, and to create a
fund to help members in their necessities, in
case of accident, as well as in sickness, old age,
and misfortun-e.

It is too late in the Session, and I do
not pretend to know enough about the matter to make any long speech on the emancipation of labour from the domination of
the drones in the human hive of industry.
It is only a question of principle of which
I am speaking to-day, and in this I think
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

the minister of Labour will agree with me.
It is contrary to international etiquette for
a high official, a Minister of the Crown,
to transact business with Nationals of a
foreign country. Some say that Canada is
a nation. She is trying to be a nation.
Well, if Canada is trying to be a nation,
it is high time that she should Iearn the
rules of international etiquette, and that
the fundamental principles of diplomatie
intercourse should be respected. If a body
of men iñ one country want to have intercourse with a body of men in another on a
question of public order-labour certainly
comes within that definition-there is a
service for that purpose. This service is
composed of men of the highest qualifications, men who have had a special training,
men who are called plenipotentiaries,
attachés, or ambassadors. They are the
only channels through which the Minister
of one State may properly deal with the
Nationals of another State. Supposing one
of His Majesty's Privy Councillors should
go to a foreign land and sit around a council
board to decide a policy, and supposing
honourable gentlemen, a decision having
been arrived at and made known, that for
some reason, rightly or wrongly, it was
not considered to be in the public interest
by the Government at Washington, in what
position would we be? Reverse the position, and suppose that we were deciding
a question here, and that one of the secretaries of President Harding came to Canada
and sat with our men and dictated a policy,
would we not resent it? Why expose ourselves to the resentment of the people on
the other side of the line? The labour
policy is a most important one. Because
it was said that Mr. Gompers was consulted in regard to the strike in Winnipeg,
objection was raised to such action in this
House. If a Minister goes to another country, he should not go without a mandate
from both Houses of Parliament-and in
this I do not mean one Minister more than
another. I say that no Cabinet Minister
should of his own accord go and deal with
the Nationals of a foreign country. That
is my opinion; I do not know whether anyone agrees with me; but nevertheless I am
convinced that I am right, and I never
asked any one to agree with me. The Parliament of Canada is the representative of
the Canadian people, and the Ministers are
the servants of Parliament, and Parliament is responsible for its servants. "Quid
fecit per alium fecit per se'-what you do
by another you do for yourself. I would
like to know what was done in that con-

MAY 31, 1921
ference, which lasted some days. We ought
to know. Perhaps the rank and file of
labour do not know, and they xnight be
glad to hear it through this House.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
May I ask
niy honourable friend to what conference hie
refers?
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: I say that if a
Minister goes down to the United States
and sits in conferenceHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Has it ever
been done?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Very well, I arn
very glad if it has not. It shows that the
principle which I arn advocating is already
in force, but this is the first time that we
have heard of it. I arn very glad that it
has flot been decided that Ministers of the
Government should go to the Stateý, unless
for social intercourse and to have a good
time. I object to anything in the way
of directing the policy of labour in a
foreign land. I arn glad of that declaration.
There is no denying that some of the Ministers went. Now we find in another place
a 'great deal of fault-finding because one
poor Minister, new at the job, wrote a letter
and said, as a recommendation to get some
business, "I have just been taken into the
Government," and that was supposed to say,
"Here, I arn a good honest manl; I have
some position." I do flot blame him so
much: it wouid have been rnuch worse if
that Minister had gone himself and looked
for business.
Another thing I would like to know, and
perhaps will be told. I arn informed that,
if a strike is to take place in Canada, after
they have decided on the strike here, they
cannot go out until somebody in a foreign
land says whether or not they may go on
strike. It appears that it is flot decided
here at ail; that is my information. I may
be wrong; I was wrong on another point
just now, but that is what 1 arn informed
-that strikes are decided and agreed upon
in a foreign land, flot in our own land. Then,
if a strike is recognized and ordered after
being carefully looked into in that foreign
land, strike money is sent over. We had an
instance of that in Monreal-a good many
years ago, it is true; it was a strike among
the Cigarmakers Union, and it lasted 18
months, but it would not have lasted that
long unless they got strike money from the
other side, because the local union would
not have been capable of keeping up the
fight. I do not remember the resuit of
that sttike, but I think the strikers were
S-43à

675

finally beaten. I know that the man who
fought that strike was named Grote, and
the Liberal party will neyer forget it, because we took him and ran him in a work-ingmen's division, not knowing that hie had
defeated the union of cigarmakers and hie
was hirnself hopelessly defeated, and our
friend Alphonse Verville was elected, and
has been ýsitting in Parliament ever since.
That is the only defeat the Laurier Administration had on the island of Montréal
or in Quebec. I was ili at the time, but if
1 had known that that man had crushed
the strikers I would have been against
him as a candidate, because we lost the
seat on account of him.
Now, the excuse for joining the United
States is to have more powerful unions, on
the principle that the more numerous you
are the stronger you are. That is quite
right, and 1 do flot know that the samne
thing could not be accornplished right here
in Canada. I arn not in favour of the
O.B.U.-the One Big Union-because that
means the union of labour ail over the
world; but it has been suggested, and I
have been asked to put it before this honourable House whether it would not be well
to have 'a Canadian Confederation of
Labour,. so that, in Canada, as in other
countries, the weaker unions could apply
to the others for support, and they would
not have to go to a foreign land for strike
money. That is a thing that I do not pretend to know about, but perhaps the Minister of Labour might inform the House why
we could not have such a Canadian Confederation of Labour, that would have the
strength that is claimed to be needed to
keep up strikes in smaller unions.
Now, MT. Speaker,, as there is -noseconçer

hope that it was in jest and nat in earnest
that he suggested that there was nothing

had been speaking on a motion that was nat

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You can second
it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I cannot conceive that he meant that seriously. My
honourable friend bas seen fit to introduce
a question into this House and ta submit
a motion which, upon the face of it, was
one not proper ta 'be submitted or discussed
here. The thought occurred ta me the
other day that I might point that out to
the House, but I decided nat ta do sa, lest
my honourabie friend and other gentlemen
might feel that in so doing I did not desire
ta face the issue or discuss the question
which he had submitted.
I am sorry that my honourable friend
in his remarks this morning bas spent his
time in discussing incidents and details,
but has refrained from speaking upon the
main statement made in this motion. In
order that he may appreciate why I feel
this way, may I just read the motion:
That. in the opinion of the Senate, the presence in the Council Chamber of a minister
aftliated to an international union is a menace
ta Canada.

Now, honourable gentlemen, I am not
going ta take up the time of the House in
defending any of my personal actions in
the past, or my connection with the Labour
movement, or with the Government of
Canada. I am willing ta leave that ta
the judgment of this House and of the
people of Canada, as to whether or not my
services ta the country in a public capacity
have been a menace or otherwise. But I
am bound to take cognizance of the words
contained in the motion of my honourable
friend, because it does cast an aspersion on
approximately 300,000 good citizens of this
country who are members of various international trade unions, any one of whom
may in the future be selected ta act as a
Minister of the Crown. I therefore feel
that it is a public duty that I should reply
ta the remarks of my honourable friend in
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

order, if possible, ta clear up in the minds
of honourable gentlemen present the point
as to whether or not being a member of
or affiliated with an -International Trade
Union renders a man a menace to society
and to the state. My honourable friend has
not gone into details, but has suggested
that had he the information he would have
been glad to have laid it before the House.
I propose briefly to quote from the constitutions of one or two international organizations, in order to give honourable gentlemen an idea of what they stand for. I
might with propriety deal with what is
perhaps the oldest, or almost the oldest,
international organization in existence, and
one which I think is generally respected,
and whose members are regarded as being
good citizens and reliable men. I refer to
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,
the preamble of whose constitution reads
as follows:
The purpose of thlis organi-zation shall be to
combine the int>erests of locomotive engineers,
elevate their social, moral and intellectual
standing, guard their financial interests, and
promote their general welfare, its cardinal pri.nciples being sobriety, truth, j-ustice and morality.

I am going to quote some other constitutions a little later on, and I would be
glad if honourable gentlemen would note
the resemblance or the contrast, whichever they may consider it to be:
The interests of the employer and employee
being co-ordinate.d, the aim of the organization
will be co-operation, and the cultivation of
amicable relations with the employer, and to
guarantee the fulfilment of every contract
made in its n.ame by the use of every power
vested in it.

That means that that international
labour union regards the employer's interests as its own, and holds that if the
administration or operation of a railroad
is ta be successful it must have the cooperation of the engineers and every other
class of men employed on that. railroad;
so that when that organization makes a
contract with an employer it proposes ta
use every means within its power to see
that that contract is carried out ta the
letter.
The true principles of the brotherhood of man
are the fundamental principles of thqs order"Do unto others as you would that they should
do unto you, and so fulfil the law ;" and in harmony with thiýs divine admoni-tion and command the policy is to hold out to the brother
such help as he may need. Sympathy and helpfulness are extended to the widow and orphan,
and the opportunity given to every brother to
provide for the future of his family through the
insurance department created for the purpose
of protecting the welfare of all members and
their dependents.

MAY,31, 1921
I think, honourable gentlemen, that
nobody could possibly take any exception
to these basic principles, upon which ail
of the work of that organization over a
period of more than forty years has been
founded.
May I just briefiy refer to another o7ne,
which happens to be the organization of
wýhich I have been a member for over thirty
years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What is the
Order?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Order of
Railroad Teiegraphers. This is an institution organized for the purpose of promoting the interest of telegraphers, train
despatchers, and agents, for the benefit of
their interest, to promote the general welfare of its membership, to establish a protective fund, and to. promote and encourage
a mutual benefit department for the aid
and comfort of the -beneficiaries of deceased
members. It may be of interest to touch
upon one special clause in that constitution, because I have at times been charged
with exercising discrimination as between
labour unions. That clause is this:

inimediately after the 'Civil War, began to
organize themselves into trade unions to
do two things-to protect the legitimate
interests of the wage earner, and at the
samne time to co-operate with the authorities and stand for law and order against
the revolutionary elernent that sought
then to destroy society, as it seeks to do
now.
Honourable gentlemen, inasmuch as the
international organizations came into being
for a laudable purpose, and inasmnuch as
those constitutions have shown to 'you
that one of their principal purposes was
to provide for the dependents of deceased
members, there have grown up in almost
alI of them insurance departments.
In
the organization of which I arn a member
the fund in that department is $1,800,000,
and there are approximately 8,000 rnembers in Canada; and I submit to you,
honourable gentlemen, that it is unfair
that those men should, forfeit aIl that
they have paid into that insurance fund,
some of them for a period of 20 years, for
the sake of subrnitting to a little sentiment
-that they ought not to belong tio an International Union. Let me tell you what

out that those international organizations,
notwithstanding the fact that the United
States was not in the war for more than
three years after we entered it, paid the
death cTaims of every man in Canada who
was a member of an international organization and lost his life in the war. And the
money did not corne out of Canadian funds
at all: it came out of the general pocket.
I happened the other day to run across the
record of one of those organizations, which
happens to be the Brotherhood of Firemen
and Enginemen-the boys who put the coal
into the engines on our railroads. It may
be of interest to honourable gentlemen to
know that the international organization to
which those boys in Canada belonged paid
out in death claims to Canadian members
$240,000, being the cTaims of men who were
killed or who died as a result of war service,
and $89,000 of that amount had been paid
out before the United States itself came
into the war at all. The death rate in all
our army was approximately one to ten,
but there were 206 deaths from the Canadian members of that organization alone,
indicating that, out of a membership of approximately 8,000, 2,000, or 25 per cent,
had given their service to their country.
Gentlemen, it is almost more than one
can at times bear to find the best class of
our working community, who have been
staunch, loyal, true citizens to the state in
peace and in war, attacked on the one hand
by the red revolutionist who desires to
destroy society and all things as they now
are, and on the other hand by a so-called
National Union which my honourable friend
to-day commendsHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

No.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -that, on the
other hand, is endeavouring to bring about
the same result, and assisting in its own
way to bring about the destruction of the
trade union movement that bas been built
up in this country and in the United States
during the past 40 years.
And now I am going to refer, just
hriefly, to the constitution of the so-called
National Unions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

National?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: National, yes.
I assume that when my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) states that any person affiliated with an International Union
is a menace to the state if he is a member
of the Government, the honourable gentleman does not apply that same criticism
to members of a National Union. In fact,
44ah.

Mr.

ROBnRTSON.

in speaking with him personally the other
day he expressed that view-that there
was no objection to a man being a member
of the Government and at the same time
Now. I
a member of a National Union.
am going to read to you one or two
constitutions of so-called National Unions.
One of them I know something about. I
had some dealings with it when it tried to
upset law and order in 1919. It professes
to be a national union; but, nevertheless,
there is an international feature connected
with it, because the centre of the ultimate
control which they all look for is in Moscow, Russia. Nevertheless the union is at
present entirely national. May I again,
before reading that constitution, refer to
one paragraph that I read from the
Engineers'?
That, the interests of the employer and employee being co-ordinate, the aim cf the organization will be to cultivate amicable relations
with the employer, and to guarantee fulrfillment
of every contract made in the name of the
organization by the use of every power vested
in ILt.

Now note what the National organization
does. Its policy is stated in the preamble
of its constitution:
Modern industrial society is divided into two
classes-those who possess and do not produce,
and those who produce and do not possess.
Alongside this main division all other classifications fade into insignificance.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
name of that association?

What is the

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am reading
from the Constitution and Laws of the
One Big Union, as amended in the Winnipeg Convention, January, 1920.
Between these two classes a continual struggle takes place. As with buyers and sellers
of any commodity, there exists a struggle on
the one hand of the buyer to buy as cheaply as
possible, and, on the other, of the seller to sell
for as much as possible, so with the buyers
and sellers of labor power. In the struggle
over the purchase and sale of labour power the
buyers are always masters, the sellers always
workers. From this fact arises the inevitable
class struggle.
As industry develops and ownership becomes
concentrated more and more into fewer hands;
as the control of the economic forces of soci.ety
become more and more the sole property of imperialistic finance, it becomes apparent that the
workers, in order to sell their labour power
with any, degree of success, must extend their
with
in accordance
forms of organization
changing industrial methods. Compelled to organi.ze for self-defence, they are further compelled to educate themselves in preparation for
the social change which economic developments
-IIll produce, whether they seek it or not.
The One Big Union, therefore, seeks to organize the wage worker, not according to craft,
but according to industry; according to class
and class needs, and calls upon all workers to

MAY 31, 1921
organize
rrespective of nationality, set, or
craft into a workers' organization, so that they
may be enabled to more success'fully carry on
the every-day fight over wages, hours of work,
etc., and prepare themselves for the day when
production for profit shall be replaced by production for use.

My honourable friend intimates that,
that being a national organization, he has
no objection to any member of it sitting as
a member' of the Government and promulgating those principles.
There is, on the other hand, another socalled national organization-the National
Catholie Union. Whatever I may say with
regard to these various organizations today, I say entirely without malice, entirely
with the desire to do what my honourable
friend the mover of this motion suggested
he wished to accomplish-to bring out the
facts before this honourable House. You
have heard the constitution of one or two
of the oldest of the international unions.
You hava heard the preamble of the constitution of one of our national organizations
read. I will now read to you another. This
is from the constitution and by-laws of the
Catholic Union of the Quebec Printing and
Bookbinding Workers. There is an international union, almost the oldest in existence, namely, The International Typographical Union of America, which bas for
many years carried on its work peaceably
and in a proper way, and which bas in the
State of Colorado, for its retired and pensioned meinbers, one of the finest homes
which will be found anywhere in the world.
It looks after its members when they are
no longer able to take care of themselves,
and it is an organization which is a credit
to the country of its birth.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why are they
called international?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Because they
have members in both the United States
and Canada, just as the railway organizations have.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But not in
Europe?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Simply in
North America?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Simply in the
United States and in Canada. Now, the
Catholic Union of the Quebec Printing and
Bookbinding Workers, while it is called a
national organization, exists only in one
province, and I think that the terni "national organization" is rather misleading.

679

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does the One
Big Union exist in Quebec?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Where?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In the city of
Montreal. If my honourable friend would
be interested I couldHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has it not
its main support in the West?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: "WeH, yes: it
has not much strength anywhere just now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Happily.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) is inquiring whether or not there is any senblance or trace of the One Big Union in
the East.
IIon. Mr. BELCOURT: I said Quebec.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, in Quebec.
A week ago last Sunday a gentleman who
spoke in public in the city of Montreal
made this statement:
That he would like to see all the factories In
Montreal being closed down thus putting a large
nunber of people out of employment who would
not therefore be able to pay for their rente.
When people are facing such a crisis they are
easi-ly organized into a revolutionary organization and they are automatically taking action
against the state then a revolution takes place
in a few days.
In view of the fact that the factories In
Montreal are not tlkely to be closed down,
speaker suggested that a Committee Ïbe appointed to Interview the executive of the French
and English radical organizations for the purpose of organizing the present unemployed In
Montreal, in their respective locale, and start a
revolution.

These words were s.poken in the city of
Montreal about two weeks ago.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: By whom?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not prepared to go into detail at the moment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But by whom?
We want to know. It may have beeli by
a walking delegate from the States.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend claim that the One Big
Union bas any sort of foothold in the
Province of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The gentleman
who made those utterances is a spokesman
of the One Big Union.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does the honourable gentleman mean to imply that the

One Big Union bas any sort of foothold
in the Province of Quebec? Is that what
he says?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:

Or in Winnipeg

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We shall hear
about this again.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I desire to say
this for the information of the House,
that since the power and influence of the
One Big Union in Western Canada have
waned, their leading men have sought new
fields, they have come to Eastern Canada,
particularly to Toronto, Hamilton and
Montreal, and have sought to carry on
their work there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Quite true, but
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
asked about Montreal. Now I would like
to get back to this other national union
and deal with it for just a few moments.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They were not
born in the Province of Quebec. They are
Russians.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There is a
national labour union that is confined
entirely to the province from which my
honourable friend comes. Article 1 of
that constitution reads:
There is founded in the city of Quebec
between the Catholic workers following the
printing and bookbinding trades, an organization which shall be designated as follows: "The
Catholic Union of the Quebec Printing and
Bookbinding Workers."
Art. 2.-The Union has for its immediate object the study, protection and development of
the professional interests of i.ts members; but
it subordinates this proximate object to the
exigencies of the superior interests of souls,
society and religion.
Art. 3.-Because it is a "Cathollic" labour
organization, The Catholic Union of the Quebec
Printing and 'Bookbinding Workers:
(a) Shall affiliate with the Action Sociale
Catholique. It shall secure fron it, after filling
the usual conditions and upon presentation of
its statutes and by-laws, a special diploma
which shall be the warranty of the catholicism
of the Union.
Said diploma may be cancelled or revoked in
case the Union should cease to fulfil the conditions required for its affiliation;
shall admit among its members
(b) It
Catholic workers only;
(c) It shall have a chaplain;
(d) It shal remember
1. That all human acts, those of groups as
well as those of individuals, are subjected to the
tribunal of conscience;
Hon. Mr. BEICOURT.

2. rhat justice and Christian charity are the
two supreme mandatory rules of relations between employers and workmen.
(e) Recognizing that the Church alone has
the right and is qualified to say where, in the
so-called labour questions, is the true and the
false, the just and the unjust, the good and the
bad, what is permissible and what is not, the
C. U. of P. & B. W. will comply entirely and
conscientiously, in the pursuit of its object, with
the teachings and instructions of the religious
authority.

The constitution runs over a number of
pages, and I shall refer to only one or two
other features which may be relevant to
this discussion. One section of Article 3
reads as follows:
(f) In order to still show its character as a
Catholic Union, the C. U. of P. & B. W.:
(a) Puts itself under the protection of St.
Joseph.
(b) It shall cause to be celebrated every year,
on the Feast Day of its holy patron saint, a
solemn mass with a sermon, all members endeavour.ng to attend and receive holy communion.
(c) When a member dies, the Union shall
cause to be celebrated, in the church where the
funeral takes place, a high mass for the repose
of the brother's soul and shall be represented at
said mass by at least two of its members.

The other feature to which I desire to
draw particular attention is the authority

You have
and power of the chaplain.
noticed that in one of the articles I have
read it is provided that there shall be a
chaplain:
The Chaplai.n is appointed by Ris Grace the
Archbishop of Quebec. He is a memiber of the
Executive Committee, Council, and General
Assembly.
He takes part in all debates but does not
vote. He may, however, require that a resolution be submitted to the Archbishop of Quebec
and approved by him before taking effect, and
any resolution adopted during his absence muet
be communi.cated to him before being carried
out.

I desire to say, first, honourable gentlemen, that I am in hearty accord with
the opinion expressed there, that to workingmen as well as to all other citizensI do not care of what church they may be
adherents-it can do no harm to consider
the advice of spiritual advisers.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But I do say
further that in this country, where we
have people of different nationalities and
varying religions, every workman, as well
as every citizen, should have the right of
free choice, and that it is improper and
not in the interest of the State and of
harmony as between people of different
races and different religions, to set up
divisions in the industrial field and to
have a Catholic and a Protestant labour

could demonstrate te honourable gentlemen
present that that opinion is borne out and
endorsed by many proniinent clergymen in
the Catholie Church, some of whomn have
corne to nme personally, and some of whom
have written to me. Among the te]egrams
and letters that poured into the Department of Labour, congratulating the Minister upon the stand he took recently in
connection with the question that my
honourable friend raised, namely, the conference held here not long agcr, there were
some from French Canadians of the Roman
Catholic faith in the Province of Quebec,
and they demonstratied to me beyond ail
doubt that there had been no mistake miade.
It might be interesting in this connection to read to the House the opinion of
one of the most prominent labour leaders
iniCanada, who is himself not a inember of
-an international unit, and is a devout
Roman Catholic. This gentleman entered
into a debate in Loyola College in Montreal not long ago on this question, and it

says:
I arn oppoeed to thoir formation:

That is, the formation of national Cathx)lic unionsfirst, because they will be injuulous te Catholic

in trade union piovements in Great Britain.
Ireland, the Brlitish dominions, and the United
States, and with the exception ef the province
of Quebec, they are organized in coromon with
their non-Cathollo fellow wQrkers. Even in
Quebec, a large number are organized in the
independent and internauional trade unions and
there is no proof that they suifer as Catholios
by being so organized. In Ireiand where Cathelles are in the majorIty they axe in affiliation with the British trade union movenient on
the basis of industrial and craft organisation.
Wherever the workers, Catholiec or non-Catholic

In the United States, large menibers of

movement, and are very often elected ta office'

'woTkers.

May I say just in passing that the

I could go on at length, but I do not
want ta delay the House by reading ail
this statement. If bonourable gentlemen
desire ta read it, they will find this letter

Canada. I arn free ta .saY 'ta you. that if

682

SENATE

there were to-day no organized unions in
Canada there could be no objection to
building up Canadian organizations only;
but inasmuch as the major part of the
300,000 members of the international organization are in exactly the same position
as I myself occupy, of having held an insurance polièy for twenty-four years, they
do not wish to throw away the benefits they
have paid for when they are arriving at
the time when their dependents are going to rely upon the relief that will come
from the protection that they have accorded
to themselves. There is nothing in connection with the international union that can
be regarded as detrimental to the interests
of the State. For a considerable number
of years I was the vice president of one
of the International Unions-the Order
of Railroad Telegraphers.
The territory
assigned te me was all the railroads in
Canada and five railroad systems in the
United States. From time to time I was
sent te other railroads in the United
States; and never once during all those
years did I ever hear a word of criticism
or comment because a Canadian official
came to the United States to handle a wage
controversy on behalf of the union. Mr.
Frank Morrison, Secretary of the American Federation of Labour, comes regularly
te Franktown to visit his dear old mother.
He is a Canadian by birth, and to say that
the United States regards him 'as a menace is to state something that no man in
the United States would confirm.
Therefore I 'have laid before you as
frankly as I could the policies of the three
separate and distinct labour inovements
in Canada; and I propose to leave it to
this House te judge for itself and to come
to its own conclusions as to whether or
not the words of the motion which my
honourable friend has placed on record,
even though he withdraws it, does not
leave a reflection on the 300,000 men in
Canada who are members of international
trades unions. [I hope that in the future,
when any question of this sort arises in
the mind of any honourable gentleman, he
will seriously consider the effect that it will
have on the public mind, and whether or
net it tends te promote harmony between
capital and labour or between the varying
labour organizations in the country, before
he makes it a subject of discussion on the
floor of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. ROB[EIRTSON.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: May I ask the honourable gentleman whether sympathetic
strikes are part of the policy of the International Union?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I simply say
this in answer that when a strike was called
in Winnipeg in. 1919 the International
officers of various unions, especially in the
railroad crafts, came to Winnipeg and did
everything they could to break the strike;
and one railroad union expelled 257 men,
showing that they are absolutely opposed
te sympathetic strikes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Am I to take it
that the answer is in the negative?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I. have not made any
preparation for the discussion of this question. Unfortunately my hearing at the
present time is se defective that I have
not been able te follow the Minister of
Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) through the
long speech which he has made. I regret
to say that I do not agree with the honourable gentleman at my right (Hon. Mr.
Bostock). I do net think that this is a subject which we should net discuss.
The
motion of the honourable gentleman from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has
brought the question up in a square and
emphatic way, and it does seem to me it
has cast upon us the duty of expressing our
opinions on the subject.
As I said, I am not prepared te say
much, and have net been able to follow
the honourable gentleman opposite; but
there are one or two points that I think
the House should consider. The relations
between organized Labour and the rest of
the community are very important, they
involve some of the most important questions which are considered by Parliament.
As I understand it, the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière thinks that in
a case where there are opposing or differing interests the authority having the
right te decide should net be one of the two
contending parties. I feel this way about
it: that the party of organized Labour
should net have the final say, should net
have any advantage over the general
public outside, and therefore that the
criticism which the honourable gentleman
from De Lanaudière makes of the appointment of the honourable gentleman who now
coming up in which organized Labour
is justified. Every few days we find cases
coming up in ivhich organied Labour
comes into conflict with the rest of the

MAY .31, 1921
community. That bein.g the case, it seems
to me that our object ýshould be to find
some intelligent and impartial judgo. I
do nlot say anything against the intelligence of organ*ized labo~ur, but I say
that a member of an -nternational Trades
Union, no matter how much disposed he
may be to do what is fair and right, cannlot in a case of that kind avoid being
influenced by bis position in the Labour
party. .I have nothing to say against
Labour as a whole. I have nothing to say
against organized Labour; but 1 do feel
that it is questionable that organizod
Labour should be represented in the Cabinet. If the portfolio held by the honourable gentleman were different fromn the one
which ho 110w hoids, and would not bring
him inito continuial conflict with the rest of
the community, perhaps I should noV object
toýit; but the point is this, that ho, who is
to ait as judge betwoen organized Labour
and the rest o*f the community, cannQt be
impartial. He is a member of a Labour
organization, and that organization is one
of the parties to the dispute. What would
you think if one of the parties to a lawsuit
wero to undortake te ho appointed as
judge and to act as judge? That is just
the situation of the Minister of Labour
bhere. He bas beon appointed Minister of
Labour, and ho acts as sucb. If he bad
been appointed Minister of Marine and
Fisberies, or somothing of that kind, I
should nlot bave feit very strongly about
it; but I bave felt, and I amn satisfied that
overy honourablo gentleman in this chamber, as well as people outside, bave foît
satisfied tbat tbere was so'mething that
was not quite in accord with our views of
what is proper in having a Minister of
Labour who is a membor of a labour
organization.
Hon. J. MILNE: I wish Vo say a few
words in regard to tbe Minister of Labour.
The facts, are not just exactly as the
Minister of Labour would bave you believo them to be. It is ail right enougb
to talk about the international unions and
the code thoy bave; but they do not carry
it out. You bave to take drastic measures
to got tbem Vo do anytbihg. I belonged to
a union, and I know what unions are. In
the unions tbe will of the majority carnies,
and if tbey say strike, thoy ail go on
strike. The minonity are the intelligent
men.
Another tbing. Tbe unions do noV produce, and wby? Because a good man is not
paid any more tban a poor mnan. The
union bolds wagos to a particular scale,

and the mnen will not produce. The men
that I have under me say, "We will do as
littie as we can, and get as much as we
can for it." That is .what they bave doue
ahl the time. According -to the Ministor of
Labour, it is ail rigbt if the men would
abide by the rules laid down; but tbey do
not do anytbing of the kind. They may
go to the International Union and got their
sanction, and if they do not got their sanction they will not get the pay. There are
a great mnany paid agitators who go
around'agitating these men Vo striko, and
thoy make representations to the International Union, and tbey are told to
strike. What does it mean?
I often get reports from tbe United
States, and I find that there they are going
in for the open shop: tbey will not stand
any longer for dictation by the Labour
olement. We bave open shops in Canada.
Tbe McClary Manufacturing Company, of
London, and D. Moore' and Company bave
open sbops; and nearly ail tbe industries in
Hamilton are going in for the open sbop.
Ours is .a closed sbop. But we bave had
to resort to drastic measures. For six
woeks. our men were out, and tbey. would
not do anything. Finally I said VhaV if
they would not do anytbing we would declare an open sbop.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Joint stock companies are govorned by the will of the
majority of the shareholders. Why deprive
labour of the samne priviloge? We bave
unions, and they are scattered aIl over the
world, and thoy are goingto romain, no
matter what the Sonate may say.
Hon. Mn. MILNE: The honourable gentleman knows that it would not do for us
to compote with a firmn that was able to get
wages down 10 per cent lower than wbat
wo pay. The Labour problem is not the
same in Ontario as in the province of
Quebec. It is a different tbing altogether.
Mon in Quebec work for less wages and
are botter satisfied tban the mon in Ontario. Thore doos, not seem to be as much
fixing and agitating going on. We are
divided against oursolves, like the two
political parties.
I ýdid not intend to speak to-day, but
when I beard tbe Minister I feIt that I
should let bim know about these things.

SENATE

do not want to take up the time of the
House, but I want to let the Minister of
Labour know, so far as I am conceried,
what the actual conditions are to-day, and
that is the best argument of all. It is very
well to talk about what the unions are
doing. They do not live up to their promises. You have to force them to get them
to do so. The men will not do anything.
They want 25 per cent more than they are
getting, and they are making $8 or $9 a
day now, and only working eight hours a
day to get it, coming in at 8 o'clock and
going out at 5 o'clock. That was more
than we could pay. We had to do away
with the furnace men. They would run up
a bill for the work, and when it would be
sent to the people they would kick and
grumble about it, and so we had to do away
with furnace work, although we still sell
furnaces wholesale.
I will not take up any more time. I
simply wanted to tell the honourable gentleman of the condition of affairs that
existed.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: As this bas
broadened into a general discussion, there
are one or two things which I think should
be said.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
order.

It is all out of

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will be very
brief. The Minister of Labour has presented a pathetic tableau of the International Unions practically crucified between
two thieves-on one side Bolshevism, and
on the other side Catholic unions. That is
exactly the situation as it was placed before this House.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And the fact.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: As to Bolshevism, he has mentioned an extract from a
speech made in Montreal. I may say that
in the metropolis unhappily it is sometimes the case that evangelists come f rom
the West-and I am sorry to say they are
not repressed by the Government-hold
meetings on Saturday or Sunday afternoons, and preach what is practically the
destruction of the rig'hts of property.
But I leave that aside. I think it is my
duty to state here that the Catholic Unions
do not attack, have not attacked, and do
not desire to attack, International Unions.
Indeed, the reverse is true: you never hear,
at a meeting held by a Catholic Union,
of any attack against the international
unions unless it has been provoked.
Hon. Mr. MILNE.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But when the
international unions hold their meetings,
as they do sometimes at Montreal, you
find men of great importance getting up
and saying "The real enemies in this part
of the country are the catholic Unions."
Why should that be? Have the Catholics
not the right to unite, being of the same
faith? Please bear in mind that in my
Province we have eighty or ninety per
cent, sometimes even more, of the workmen who belong to the Catholic faith; and
why should they not unite as Catholics
I think the honourable
and workmen?
Minister of Labour will agree that they
have a perfect right and perfect freedom
to unite, and I can invoke in this respect
the authority of his own chief, when defending my honourable friend's policy
in the House of Commons some time ago.
No doubt the honourable Minister knows
to what I refer. In that case the Prime
Minister recognized perfectly the propriety
of such a union.
Now, gentlemen, the Catholics of my
Province have a right to unite as Catholics
and workmen if they are not aggressive
and they are not; if they mind their own
business, and they do; if they are not a
menace to order, and they are not. Many
men who listen to me to-day, who are controlling large industrial interests all over
this country, know very well that the influence that drives and controls those
unions is not to be dispensed with at the
present time; they know that there is nothing so sacred and so precious at present
as that influence; and for my part I shall
not allow it to be said or insinuated in this
House that it constitutes a great danger. If
my honourable friend wants to find where
labour is honest, law-abiding and effective,
let him ask those who employ labour, and
they will refer him to the Province of
Quebec. Although my auditors may, in
their opinions, be divided between the two
sorts of labour unions, the International
and the National, I think my honourable
friend will find it pretty hard to bolster up
any accusation against the National Unions
to the effect that they are a danger to order
and to the respect of law in my Province.
The honourable Minister certainly did not
say that, but what he did say was that the
best system, the best co-ordination of all
those unions, was the International one,
and he made a very clever plea for it, for
which I present him my compliments. I
am not going to discuss that point; but be
said this also, that the international system

MAY 31, 1921
was menaced on one side by Bolshevism
and on the other side by the Catholie
-Union. I say to him that he is wrung
there.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not desire
to interrupt my honourable friend, but I
am afraid he is not entirely conversant
with the facts; and, just in order that he
may appreciate that the National Catholic
Unions are not altogether sitting dormant,
taking no interest in things, may I point
out. to him that during the little struggle
that is going on right here in the city of
Ottawa, National Catholic Union workmen
have been coming daily from Montreal to
take the situations of men right here, thus
creating the friction and the feeling between classes that is not conducive to
harmony in a community.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am very glad
my honourable friend bas referred tu that.
I have had some little experience in industrial life myself, and I have seen such
things occur. My honourable friend is
not very serious, I suppose, when he cites
examples of individuals. Surely the fact
of workmen from one union taking the
place of workmen from another union does
not bind the administration as a whole.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It indicates it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But my question
to him had reference to this-that the
international Unions, at their annual meet
ing in Montreal, speaking through the
men who direct them, said that their chief
menace-that which they would have to
destroy, that was their expression-was
the Catholie Unions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is my
authority, and I think it is somewhat
better than my honourable friend's. But
I do not want to change my honourable
frie'nd's mentality as to that: I do not
think it can be done. I do not blame him;
he bas been brought up in the atmosphere
of internationalisrn; he bas breathed that
air constantly until he is permeated with
it; his constitution, so to speak, bas been
built up on it. I do not complain as to
that, but I would say that as Minister of
Labour he is Minister of all the labour
unions through this country, and he bas
not the right to come here and say that
the Catholic Unions of my Province are a
menace to the good direction of labour
through this country, which he personifies
I think he is
as international unions.
wrong there, and I take the liberty of

showing it to him. I do so with perhaps
a little heat, but not with any rancor at
all; it is a question of temperament, not of
bad personal disposition. But thete is one
thing that it seems to me must be known:
although I am not over-zealous in my own
religion, I am proud to say, and it must
be acknowledged, for it is recognized aH
through the country, and by people of
other faiths, and not merely by Catholics,
that the direction that bas been given to
the labour people by the clergy of my-province bas been a good, sound, and indeed a
great benefit to us. I hope this wise direction will last, and, if it lasts, it will be of
immense advantage, not only to my province, but to the whole of this Dominion;
and, Sir, you, who are at the head of this
very important Department of Labour,
may perhaps be the first man to be thankful for it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: lHonourable
gentlemen, I know it is out of order for me
to say anything again, and I propose only
to say a word in reply, in order that there
may be no misunderstanding as to my
attitude. I desire to call the attention of
the House to the fact that I did not utter
the words for which my honourable friend
gives me credit.
I simply quoted the
constitutions of the three different and
distinct trade union movements in Canada,
and said that I would leave it to this House
to jcudge which were on a sound and broad
basis. I went on, further, to point out
that it is not true, as my honourable friend
intimates-although he was careful not
exactly to charge me with it, or to say so
definitely-that the Department of Labour,
since I have been administering it, bas
discriminated against any labour organizatiton which was carrying on lpwfully. The
organization to which he refers, and for
which he pleads, bas received recognition
from the. Department of Labour, and bas
from year to year discussed labour problems and labour difficulties with the just
the same as other organizations have done.
But may I point out this, that on the
occasion of their visit this year they
brought a newspaper reporter from the
city of Montreal about whom I did not
know anything, and I did not even say a
word about the delegation having visited
Ottawa; but they went into the press themselves and started a row, and now my
honourable friend comes into this House
with another attack on the International
Union.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no.

COPYRIGHT BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
AND REPORTED

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 12, an Act to amend and consolidate
the law relating to copyright.-Hon. Sir
James Lougheed. Hon. Mr. Blain in the
Chair.
Subsections 3 and 4 of section 18 were
agreed to.
On subsection 5 of section 18-regulations and notices by Governor in Council:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Why is it necessary to give the Governor in Council power
to make regulations here, when my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed), in
answer to me last night, said that there
was another clause in the Bill deýaling with
the matter generally. Is this not a duplication?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
expressly for the purpose of this section.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But is it necessary to give the Governor General in Council power to make regulations?
The

other would be for general regulations, but
this could be done either through the

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

general regulations not particularly affecting this question. This is a question involving very special administration, so to
speak; consequently the regulations will be
applicable only to this section.
Subsection 5 was agreed to.
On subsection 6-provision as to musical
works heretofore published:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Paragraph b says:
No royalties shall be payable in respect of
contrivances lawfully made, before the commencement of this Act.

As I understand that paragraph,
it
means that after this Act is passed-•
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
royalties shall be regulated by this Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:-there will be no
royalties paid after this Act comes into
force, on any contrivances that were manufactured before the Act came into force.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. Any
contract made before this Act came into
force, touching the question of royalties,
must necessarily yield to the provisions in
this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Any contract?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
any contract as to royalties.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What I mean is,
there have been a number of cases in which
no royalty at all has been paid.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
provision is not made retroactive:
No royalties shall be payable in respect of
contrivances lawfully made, before

the

com-

mencement of this Act.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Of course, I can
understand that if there has been a contract made between the manufacturer of
the contrivance and the composer of the
song or music, or whatever it is, settling this question of royalties, that is a
different matter; but where no arrangement bas been made and no royalty paid,
as is true in a great many cases, I understand, when this Act comes into force all
these contrivances that have been manufactured previous to the Act can still be
manufactured without the payment of any
royalty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
No,
that is not the case. Royalties have not
been collected upon contrivances beore
the passage of this Act. The impression
seems to prevail in the minds of some honourable gentlemen that royalties that

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman does not even state the
situation to be as bad for the author as it
appears to be.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am always
moderate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, my
honourable friend has not examined the
text. I would favour the drafting of a
clause such as my honourable friend bas
described, providing that once the disc has
been sold by the manufacturer and bas
left his hands, it should be subject to the
royalty. I think that would be fair. It
seems to me that, if he still bas the discs
in his possession, every future sale should
be subject to the royalty; but it would not
be under this clause.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It will not be?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: "No royalties
shall be payable in respect of contrivances
lawfully made, before the commencement
of this Act."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: " Lawfully made."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So all that
the manufacturer has in stock is free from
the royalties. That is why I say that my
honourable friend fron Kings and Albert
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) has not even noticed
that the manufacturer is protected to a
.greater degree; that, as I read this paragraph, the manufacturer will be able to
dispose of anything he bas in stock. So
I think my honourable friend from Huron
(Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) bas a very weak
case.
He
Hon. Sir' JAMES LOUGHEED:
should be satisfied with this paragraph.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I quite agree
with the views of the honourable gentleman who bas just spoken (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). I do not think that the section, as a matter lof fact, goes quite far
enough in protecting the author. A very
large proportion of the standard music
is already set up; the plates are made;
and if this paragraph is left as it is, there
will be no protection in the future to the
author for the selling of those rolls. That
is my construction of the paragraph. We
are all aware that a large amount of
classical music of the better class, which
might be called standard music, is already
set up-already put on plates or rolls,
which are in the manufacturers' hands.
On those there is no protection at all.
Hon. 1Mr. FOWLER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend the
leader of the Government to the very
great difficulty the Government will have
in applying this law if this paragraph is
left as it is. The Act will be proclaimed
on a certain day, and the manufacturer
will have piled up in his warehouse, or
store, or factory, a large number of dises.
He kno*s what is impending, and I wonder
if we are enacting a provision which will
simply be laughed at by the manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I must confess
that I had-not'seen the section, but I was
only replying to the awful argument made
by my honourable friend from Huron
(Hon. Mr. Proudfoot).
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.
awful as it seemed.

It was not so

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But I find his
argument is still worse, now that I look
at the section, because the section gives
the manufacturer a great deal more than
he ought to have. I think that the section. should be changed so that it will
provide, as I thought it did, that the manufacturer shall pay on every record that
he sells, whether be had manufactured it
before the passage of this Act, or subsequent to it.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It seems to
me that would be fair. Of course, after
he has sold the record, we cannot tax
him a royalty which be will not be able
to collect from the purchaser.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: How can we tell
when the manufacturer made the record?
There is no check upon him. The honourable gentleman from Huron (Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot) would say that the manufacturers are such a high-class type of men
that they would not lie about these things.
But they might. iUy honourable friend
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton),
coming from a manufacturing town,knows
the manufacturers better, and he says they
might. I take the word of my honourable
friend from Hamilton, and we ought to
avoid the danger of that by our legislation.
This section should be so amended as to
provide that from the time of the passing
of this Act all records sold, by manufacturers shoûld be subject to a royalty.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is rather
illuminating to hear my honourable friend

that damages whîch may have been caused

1 do not think it is fair to say that the
only remedy he will have will be an injunction to prevent further damage being

caused.
Why deprive him of damages
simply because the other man may have
been acting in good faith? Damages are
not altogether dependent on good faith. It
is true that where there hashbeen bad faith
the courts are inclined to make the damages heavier; but good faith and liability
to damages are quite consistent. I propose
therefore to add after the words "the
plaintiff shail not be entitied Vo any remedy
other than an injunction," the words,
" besides such damages as he rnay have
suffered?"
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has my
honourabie friend iooked at the provîso in
th'is section? It says:
Provided that if ai the date of the infringement ýthe copyright in the work was
duly registered under ibis Act, the defendant
shall be deemed to have had reasonable ground
for suspecting that copyright subsisted in the
work.

No damages should arise in favour of
the plaintiff if he has neglected to register
his copyright. Under section 36 he can
secure himself by registering his copyright. The registration is not made compulsory; but if he chooses to remain passive, and not to take advantage of the protection afforded hy the act of regîstering
the copyright, why should we protect bim
further?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn not sure
that section 36 does give him protection.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is an
exact reproduction of section 8 of the
Engiish Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Very weIl, I

The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Belcourt was witbdrawn, and section 21
was agreed to.

On section 36, subsection 1-registration:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable
friend say why this method of registration

from what is done under the Engiish Act.
What is the reason for this registration?
If I understand the method of registration

has Vo be registered in Canada in order to

seems to me it is going Vo be a very

registry. I understand that at present we
have registration under the Trade Marks
and Patent Acts, but I think there had
been considerable difficulty in dealing with
that registry and keeping it up to date,
and it seems we are going to create an
enormous amount of work, and I am not
satisfied that the registration is going to
prove satisfactory.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
cases of copyright and patent are not at
all parallel. Of course, a patent must be
registered for its protection, otherwise it
could be made use of by any person; but
there is a difference in regard to copyright.
It is optional with the author; if he does
not choose to take advantage of the safeguard which registration provides, he is
thrown back upon establishing by evidence
in a court that he is the owner of the
copyright. Under the system of optional
registration which we have here, if he
registers he is prima facie the owner of
the copyright, and it is simply to facilitate
his evidence of title or ownership.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am afraid
that my honourable friend, who is speaking
for the Minister of Justice, has made considerable trouble for himself in putting in
these sections on registratioù, which form
*a departure from the Berne Convention,
as there is no registration required under
that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is no compulsory registration under the
Berne Convention yet this is manifestly a
very great advantage.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not
gone seriously into the matter; it may be
-an advantage for Canadian authors.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Or for
foreign authors.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But the
Nationals of the other countries that have
accepted the Berne Convention, what will
they have?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What objection can
they have?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They will have
to stand the registration which any country
may decree.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No, they do not
have to; it is optional.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: All they
have to do is to come in and register; it
S-44à

691

is purely optional. My honourable friend
must not overlook the fact that this right
to obtain copyright is for foreigr, authors
just as well as for Canadian authors. Honourable gentlemen, in dealing with this subject, must keep this in view, and possibly
not be too sympathetic in that regard, remembering that we are protecting the
foreign author as well as the Canadian
author, and what enures to the benefit of
the Canadian aùthor would likewise benefit
the foreign author who comes into Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: In other words, we
are doing equal justice to aIl, and this
registration benefits the author if somebody
infringes on his work, or takes his work
and turns it into a disc for a phonograph.
He has only to show his registration; otherwise he would have to prove that he was
the author of the work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But- there
would be this disadvantage to the foreign
author whose work would be infringed
upon, that under section 21 he would only
be able to recover damages if he had registered.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
same with the Canadian author.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is true that
under the Berne Convention there is no
registration required, and I take for
granted that wherever sôme one has infringed upon the right of an author belonging to the Convention, damages would
ensue; but here we cut him off from damages unless he goes to the expense and
labour of registering in Canada, and perhaps in other countries.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No; there is
an answer to that in section 8 of the English Act, which deals with the right for
damages. The only remedy that he ever
had when a copyright under the English
Act was infringed was an injunction, which
would be what you- are invoking now. Section 8 of the English Act is the same as
the one we have passed as section 21 of this
Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Without the proviso.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Without the
proviso; so we are not making it a bit
worse than it is under the English Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
This
is a great improvement on the Berne Convention. They will probably copy this at
the next convention.
Section 36 was agreed to.
Sections 37 and 38 were agreed to.

SENATE
On section 39, subsection 2-when grant
is void:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
I have an
amendment which I shall move there. I
want to add at the foot of that subsection
the following words:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose I
am reading section 49 correctly when I
say that it means that the Governor in
Council bas the obligation to secure the
adherence of Canada to the revised Convention of Berne?

And no grantee shall maintain any action
under this Act unless his and each such prior
grant has been registered.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That word

That is only a matter of detail for the
proper working out of the Act, and does
not make any very great change; but it
places the person who bas to pay in the
position that the assignments must all be
registered before the action can be brought
against him.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would say,
in connection with this proposed amendment, that I had the opportunity of discussing this and several others with the
honourable member who dealt with this
Bill in another place, and so far as I can
see this particular, amendment is not ohjectionable here, and I do not think it
would be anywhere else, and so far as I
am concerned I will be glad to endorse it.

" may " means " shall."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And if
it secures the adherence, the Act is in conformity with the Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And if ýt
does secure the adherence, will my hcnourable friend from De Salaberry explain
to nie the purport of his amendment, because if we do secure the acceptance of
our Act, then our Act stands with all its

The amendment was agreed to.
Section 39 as amended was agreed to.
Sections 40 to 48 inclusive were agreed
to.
On section 49-adherence to Convention
of Berne:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I move that section 49 be amended by adding'the following
words thereto:
and on such adherence being secured nothing
in this Act shall be taken, interpreted or applied as being contrary to or in violation of
the revised Berne Convention.

Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: What is the
meaning of that amendment?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is to make sure
that nothing will be taken in this Act as
interfering with the Berne. Convention.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend be good enough to enlighten us as to how this is to be determined? If there be a conflict of opinion
between what our Act means and what
the Berne Convention means, will the
words of the amendment settle the matter?
It seems to me that my honourable friend
is importing words into this Bill, and particularly into this section, which will create conflict. My honourable friend is seeking by this language to determine what
the interpretation is to be, but it certainly will not succeed in doing it.
Hon. Sir JAMFS LOUGHEED.

clauses.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understand
that the only way the question would arise
would be before our own courts.
The
question might be whether some provision
of this Act were quite in accordance with
the Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But there are
some of them that are absolutely against
the spirit and the letter of the Berne Co.vention.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The effect of
the amendment would be that if there is
any conflict between the Act and the Berne
Convention, the very fact that we are adhering to the Berne Convention by this
Act will not be sufficient to make a provision prevail which is contrary to the Berne
Convention. On the other hand, it will be
the Berne Convention that will prevail, if
there is nothing in our Act contrary to the'
Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I prepared this
amendment because I thought there was
a general expression of opinion that this
Act was not to interfere with the Berne
Convention, and it was even stated that the
Minister of Justice had expressed his opinion that there was nothing to interfere with
the Berne Convention.
My amendment
merely intended that it should be so. The
language is used in other cases-that
nothing mentioned in the different clauses
shall be interpreted as being contrary. This
Act is to be governed by the Berne Convention, and that is the desire of bonourable members of this House as well as
members in the other House, and I thought

MAY 31, 1921 '
the amendment would tend ta secure a certain fixity ta this, and, as the honourable
member has said, it may have ta be decided
by the courts if the question is raised.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But I
would like ta point out ta my honourablefriend the difficulty that would be encountered, in this. The Berne Convention does
not lay down a model Act; it lays down
certain fundamental principles. The different countries that adhere ta that Convention will probably pass different Acts; but
se long as they embody the fundamental
principles of the Berne Convention they can
become parties thereto. Now, the question
will be ta determine what is essential.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would my honourable friend not rather say: "provided
they are not in conflict with the Berne
Convention"? I should think that is the
way to put it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
It
seems ta me, as my honourable friend from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has
pointed out, if we become parties ta the
Berne Convention, that will be sufficient.
I do not see how you can apply ta a statute
a canon of construction that may possibly
be repugnant ta the language itself; and it
may have relation ta non-essentials. It
seems ta me that if a non-essential be regarded as not conforming ta the Berne
Convention, it would be very unwise ta
ap.ply an arbitrary canon of construction
and seek te reconcile the Act ta a Convention which is net framed in express language at all, but simply lays down certain
principles.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am afraid
that does not solve the difficulty-for me,
at all events. Either there are in this
Act one or more provisions which are in
conflict with the Berne Convention, or there
are none at al. in conflict with it. If there
is nothing in this measure which would
conflict with the Berne Convention, then I
think my honourable friend's amendment
is unnecessary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
who is goiing ta determine that question?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But there are
two things in this Bill. The principal thing
is that we adhere ta the Convention, but
my honourable friend must remember that
then, if we are doing something which is
in conflict with the Berne Convention, the
two things cannot go together.

693

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then
we cannot become parties ta it. Sa the
question could not arise.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, we would
be parties ta it; but we would nat be parties
ta it in regard ta any particular provision
which would'itself be in conflict with the
Berne Convention. We would be bound by
the Berne Convention in every other respect, because we formally accept it and
adhere te it. But if, while adhering ta it,
we have by mistake made some provision
which is in absolute conflict with the Convention itself, then I think my honourable
friend's amendment ought ta go, because
we cannot be both in the Convention and
out of it. If we have adopted any provision which would, with regard ta that provision, put us out, then my honourable
friend's amendmnent ought to go, because
the main thing we want- is ta adhere ta
that Convention.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Would my honourable friend allow me a question? I4
there is in the sections of the Bill-in any
section except the last-a provision in
violation of the Convention, it must be
read concurrently with the last clause,
which deêlares that niothing in the law
shall' conflict with the Convention. Suppose my honourable friend is the judge.
Which section would he take?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If the amendment of my honourable friend carries, there
I would sày that the
will be no difficulty.
provision which is in conflict with the
Berne Convention should not apply.
But
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
who is going ta determine what the Convention means?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The judge before whom the question is raised.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEI): Judges
will differ.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It can come up
only before a court of justice, and it will
be the duty of the judge ta give his interpretation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out ta my honourable friend that,
notwithstanding the interpretation that may
be placed by a court of justice upon this,
yet a country might become an adherent
ta the Berne Convention. A judicial act,
sa as ta speak, will nat permit of any éountry becoming a party ta the Berne Convention.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do net claim
that at all. What I claim is this-and my
honourable friend will agree with me: if
any question is raised in regard to the
compatibility of any provision of this Bill,
it will have te be raised before one of our
own courts, and it is the duty of our own
court to interpret our own laws. It will
be for the court te say whether the provision under discussion is or-is not in conflict with the principles of the Berne Convention; and if it is, and if my honourable
friend's amendment carries, then there will
be no difficulty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
not the judge have to interpret first of all
what the Berne Convention is?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It would be the
duty of the judge to determine what the
Berne Convention is.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would have no effect upon the Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do net claim
for one moment that it would. It would
net affect the Berne Convention at all, but
it would affect our legislation, and that is
all we are discussing. We are not discussing, for the moment, the principles of
the Berne Convention, nor am I saying that
the Berne Convention is this, ithat, or the
I am discussing this -Bill
other thing.
which will shortly become law. If any
question arises under that, it will be the
duty of the court, as it is whenever any
Canadian law is under discussion, te decide
what it means. Should it be found by
the courts that we have adopted a provision
in conflict with the Convention, I repeat,
if my honourable friend's amendment carries, the court will have no difficulty, but
will say that the Act is valid and binding
except for this particular provision which
is in conflict with the Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If I understand
my honourable friend rightly, then the last
clause as amended would simply iron out,
item by item, as we have placed them
in the law, all the departures from the
Berne Convention that might exist. That
is the honourable gentleman's interpretatien. Now, what would be the result? If
this Act is te be interpreted by our courts,
and if a judge finds that there are ten or
fifteen discrepancies between it and the
Berne Convention, then, according te my
honourable friend when the judge comes
te read the last section, with this proposed
amendment, he says: "Oh, all these disHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEIED.

crepancies now disappear, because, although
the legislators inserted, one after the
other, fifteen or twenty provisions conflicting with the Berne Convention, they
have wiped them all out by the- last clause."
I respectfully submit te my honourable
friend that he has very seldom seen legislation containing such a sweeping clause
as that, the effect of which would be that
practically the whole Convention of Berne
would have te be used as a magnifying
glass through which te examine every one
of the articles of this Bill. In other words,
a judge taking up, say, clause 10 of this
measure, could net read it as it stood
on the statute book, but would have te
consider it with reference te the whole
Convention of Berne, in order ta determine
whether this clause is in harmony with
the Berne Convention or net. If it is net,
if it differs in the slightest degree, he must
correct our own legislation; for we
give him power te do se by the last clause
of this Bill. I do net think that has ever
been done. Such a provision is all right
for the interpretation of words, but te
modify the interpretation of fifty sections
by declaring that they must be in accordance with the rules laid down by a Convention se wide as the Convention of
Berne, is in my opinion net practicable
at all.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do net object
te my honourable friend's argument, but
I do object te his putting into my mouth
words which I did net use at all-attributing ta me an argument which I did net
make. I took good care in my observations te say I did net know what I was
going te do; that I had net made up my
mind whether te vote for my honourable
friend's amendment or net. I was simply
trying te point out what it meant and
what was the effect of it. Se my honourable friend's argument is net at all -an
answer te what I said.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I apologize for
my honourable friend stating that he was
in faveur of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, I did net
say that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do net agree with
what the honourable member from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) has said as te
the purport of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And its effect.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And its effect; but,
as I said a few minutes ago, my reason

MAY 31, "921
for presenting the amendment was merely
that I thought it expressed the opinion
of honourable members of this House. If
there is a danger that it may go too far,
I will not insist on the amendnuent.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Béiqiýe was
withdrawn.
On section 50--commencement of Act:
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: I would like to
move an amendment:
That clause 50 be amended by addlni at the
end thereof the following:
But such procla.mation shall lort be !made
unless for until the Minister shall have certili-ed by notice published in the Canada Gazette
that no existlng legal right of citizens of Canada to copyright protection in any country
other than Canada will In consequence of the
passing of this Act be terminated or lmpalred.

There are, I think, good reasons in support of that amendment, and there is in it
a legal point which I tbink should have
some weight before this Committeq. As
this Bill, which is now almost passed, will
repeal both the international and local
copyright statutes without making any provision for the protection of our authors'
rights outside Canada, it is vitally important that the Bill should not bie proclaimed
until negotiations have been completed with
Great Britain, the other British Dominions
and the United States, securing to our
authors copyright protection in these countries similar to what they now enjoy.
The Imperial Copyright Acts of 1842 and
1886, are the basic copyright law of Canada
and confer copyright on Canadian authors
both in Canada and throughout the British
Dominions by first publication in Canada or
other British dominion.
Canada also enjoys the benefit of the
original Berne Convention (1886) througb
Great Brîtain's adherence thereto on bier
bebaîf.
Canada also enjoys the benefit of ý lie
Convention 1891 regarding literary copyright between Great Britain and the United
States.
Consequently as regards literary copyright, Canadian authors now enjoy protection, one migbt say, tbroughout the world.
This Bill by its repeal clause No. 47, w.ill
destroy this international copyright and
thereafter the Canadian Governiment wilh
have to negotiate anew, not only çýith the
United States, but also with Great Britain
and*the other self-governing dominions for
protection for Canadian authors in these
English-speaking countries, and wilh also

695

have to obtain Great Britain's certification
of Canada's adherence to the Revised Convention of Berne, 1906.
It is most important therefore that the
Copyright Act should not be proclaimed
until the continuance of this international
protection is assured.
It is respectfully suggested, therefore,
and I think it will be agreed by this Coinmittee, that Clause 50 of the Bill should
have a proviso added to it to the effect that
the Act shall fot be proclaimed until the
Minister certifies thiat international protection for Canadian authors throughout ahi
English speaking countries bas been definitely assured. 1 therefore move that the
proviso which I have rend bie inserted in
this clause.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Wilh my honourable friend read it again?
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: Clause 50 now
reads:
This Act shali corne into force on a day to, be
fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council.

Here is the amendment:
But such proclamation shali not be made unless nor until the Minister shall have certlfied
by notice published in the Canada Gazette that
no existing legal right of citizens of Canada to
Copyright protection in any country other than
Canada will in consequence of the passlng of
this Act be termjnated or irnpaired.

I think it is only right that this proviso
should be added to the final clause of the
Bll, because, as 1 think I have demonstrated to this Committee, if it is not added,
the copyright -enactments now in existence
in favour of Canadian authors wilh be destroyed and nothing will be left iu their
place.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: I think it is
absolutely necessaxy that some proviso
such as that which bas been moved by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mt~. Chapais)
should be inserted. I would assume froin
the report which 1 have read of the discussion which has taken place elsewhere
that something of this kind was conteinplated. A copy of the proposed amendment
has, I dare say, been received by many
honourable members of the House. I know
that one of the persons acting on behaîf of
the authors, sent me, through the mail, a

MAY 31, 1921
I am trying
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to find the countries to which the Minister
of Justice intends to apply it. In running
through his speech, I cannot find them.
Can the honourable gentleman tell me what
they are?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Presumably, the United States, Great Britain
and all the Dominions that make up the
Empire, and Switzerland.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And France?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
One only needs to ment'ion it to show how
impracticable and unwise it would be to
tie the Government down in that way.
In the next place, such a thing implies
a want of confidence in the Government
to properly negotiate arrangements with
the different countries that I have mentioned. We have to assume that, if the
Government is charged with this responsibility, section 50 would impose upon it the
respons'ibility of preparing the ground before the proclamation is issued, bringing
the Act into operation. Thesq two considerations should be present in the minds
of honourable gentlemen in considering the
applicability of section 50.
Under section 47 of the Act, which my
honourable friend from Ottawa proposes
to amend, no repeal takes place until the
proclamation is made; consequently, nothing happens until that is done. This Bill
ren3ains upon the statute book, and does
not come into force, but is a dead letter
until that time; therefore it is not necessary to make provision for an immediate
repeal..
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The amendment of
the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) would not add anything to the Bill-·
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: -Becauge the repeal will take place only when the Act
comes into force.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend named the countries that the Minister of Justice in another pliace said he was
going to apply to before this Act was
brought into effect. If I understand thie
amendment, according to the remarks made
by the honourable gentleman from Moosejaw , (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), it wIll not
cover any more countries than, those mentioned by the Minister of Justice. It seems
to me that this amendmnent is simply putting into words the intention of the Minister of Justice.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Precisely.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: For that reason
I cannot see that it is going to do any
harm at all, and I certainly think the
amendment is a good one.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend does not appreciate the
point. The amendment puts an obligation
on the Minister of Justice, and it is an invitation to the other nations to impose any
conditions they wish. They say, "You cannot issue the proclamation until you make
an arrangement with us."
I am disHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
posed to trust the Government, and when
I say the Government I mean the Minister of Justice, who will have charge of
the negotiations with the other countries
before this Act comes into force. I am disposed to trust the Government not to issue
the proclamation which would bring this
Act into effect until all the conditions that
vould accrue to Canada under the Berne
Convention have been obtained. It is obvious, from the statement made by the
Minister of Justice in another place, in
answer to a remark by the member for
St. James, that the Government is taking
this Act with the expectation that it will
succeed in carrying through the Act and
having it accepted by the principal countries that have joined the Convention. If
it fails, the proclamation will not be issued,
and the Government will have to come
back to Parliament to amend the Act which
is now passing through this Chamber.
I have expressed a doubt as to the possibility of obtaining the adherence of the
other countries that have come under the
Berne Convention to this Act of ours; but
tine aIone will tell; and I think that we
are sufficiently protected by the fact that
the Government declares that it will not
proclaim this Act until it bas obtained the
consent of the principal countries to our
coming under the Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: After the declarations that have been made by the leader of
the House, I do not think I should insist
on the amendment, and I ask permission to
withdraw it.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Chapais was withdrawn, and section 50 was
agreed to.
Schedules 1 and 2 were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported as amended.

JUDGES BILL
REPORT OF CONFERENCE CONCURRED IN

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
concurrence in the report of the managers
on the part of the Senate at the free Conference called for the purpose of further
considering the amendments to Bill 60, intituled An Act to amend the Judges Act.
He said:
Honourable gentlemen, last
night I mentioned the purport of this report, and it is not necessary to go into it
again.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
HAY AND STRAW INSPECTION BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEEPROGRESSI REPORTED.

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bih 159, an Act to amend the Inspection and Sale Act (Hay and Straw Inspection).-Hon. Sir James Lougheed. Hon.
Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, when this Chamber
considered this important question a few
days ago and concentrated all its attention
upon the subject, there seemed to be quite
a difference of opinion as to who the
"presser" was and who the "seller"
was.
I have received a communication from the
Department of Trade and Commerce which
may possibly throw some light upon the
subject. With the leave of the House I
shall read it:
The inspection of hay is net compulsory.
To
require bales of hay to bear a tag indicating
the grade would be a change in policy
which
requires much consideration.
While the present law has stood for two
years, it is only within the past two weeks that
representations were made te the Department
that owing to the word "seller" appearing
in
the law as it does at present, prosecutions had
been entered into. and parties were fined in
Montreal-merely because they sold a bale of
hay which had been sold several times prier te
their receiving it-who had not attached their
tag te it. The law as it stands requires every
person who sells a bale of hay, no matter
whether the bale be sold half a dozen times
over, te attach his tag te the bale.
When the law cf 1918 was put through, we
introduced the word "presser," but this was
changed in the Senate te "seller," which has
led te much confusion.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

I do not know which honourable member is responsible for all this confusion. It
is some honourable gentleman in this
CharAber.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
propose to do to him?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
he is first.

What do you
Find out who

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
should be impeached probably.

He

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Make him eat
the bale of hay.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
an agricultural subject, and no doubt some
of our resourceful lawyers suggested that
the word "seller" should take the place
of the word " presser." (Reading) :
While the Act may net be perfect, we had
hoped te get a brief amendment through Parliament te hold the "presser" only, that is te
say, the man who actually presses the bale,
whether on his own account or for a farmer,
responsible that no foreign matter be introduced inte the bale. Heavy fines are imposed
upon anyone under this Act, who violates this
provision.
The owner of the hay, of course, escapes, but
the man responsible for the pressing of the hay,
we thought, weuld take care that foreign matter
is net introduced into the bales. Should subsequently foreign matter be found in the bale,
the man who actually did the baling, be he a
presser by trade, or the farmer who presses
his own hay for sale, would be responsible
and liable te penalty.
It bas been suggested te us that the presser
and producer both be made responsible, but that
apparently wou.ld divide the responsibility, and
the producer might disclaim responsibility for
work done for him by the presser. Hence we
thought that at this late date of the session the
best thing te be done would be nerely to fasten
the responsibility upon the man who actually
does the baling rather than leave the present
law as it stands, which requires another tag te
be attached te the bale every time It is sold.

One thing will be conceded, it seems to
me, and that is that it is impossible to administer the law where you provide that
the seller shall attach his tag to the bale,
because the bale may pass through half-adozen hands, and the seller may know nothing about the contents of it. While there

may be numerous sellers, there is only one
presser. Consequently it seems to me that
if anyone is to be held responsible for the
contents of the bale, it 'should be the man
who baled the hay and knows what the
contents are.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He is paid?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
and therefore it was suggested that the

MAY 31, 1921
ameadmnent, which is very simple, should
be passed, and the word 1'presser " supercede the word "sellér."
Objection
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bas been made to limiting the amendinent
to changing the word "seller" to the word
"presser," because very often the presser
happens to be a man who passes through
the rural parts with a press and horses,
gaing from one farm. te another; aud,
though of course he« sees the hay that
passes through his press, very often bie
is somnewhat under the direction of the
owner of the hay. It has been suggested
that in order that the respensibility may
fnl! upon the cuiprit if anything wrong
is done in the pràssing of the hay, the
owner, who was interested iu that wrong
doing, should be known. It -bas ase, ben
suggested to me that a further amenment be made, because the presser is very
often the owniqr, and lu that case there
would be ne need te, make alteratioTi,
because yen then have the man who should
suifer fer acting illegally towards the
ultimate purchaser of bis hay. But when
the presser is only a mechanic or an
employee who hasi passed, thi.iug« and
dune work for which he should be condemned, but has d'eue it for the real
owner, it is suggested that this amendment
be added:
If the hay Is pressed for anotfler party, the
presser shail add the namne and address of the
owner on sald tag.

Lt seenis te me that this is a double
protection, and 1 subinit it te the judgment
of this Chainber. I *may add that I had
given notice of another amendinent, which
nxay be tee far-reaching, and 1 will not
press it. I was thinkingithat the presser or
owner sheuld state ou the tag the grade of
hay: but I do net insist on thiat, s0 that
my sole amendinent is the one I have just
read. Ia withdrawing the amendinent as
te the grade being stated on the-tag, I
arn not withdrawing the suggestion that
the mouth and year of the pressing be
stated on the tag, because I have been teld
that it makes ail the difference in the
world whether the hay is pressedl dnring
summer or during winter, as ýhay presoed
in winter may heat ou its way te, a
fereign country, and people are very chary
about; buying hay that is pressd in winter,
though they have ne special means of
knowing when it was pressed. It seems
fron this that we would protect the purchaser by forcing the presser te state on
the tag the month and year la which the
bey was pressed. Besides, those who know

9

more about the hay trade than I do may
be able te say whether hay of 1917 is
worth as much as that of 1919, 1920 or
1921.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why sheuld 'hay
pressed in winter not keep as well as hay
pressed in sumimer? 1 think it is the ether
way round-that bhay pressed in the
followin-g winter woul be better cured,
because it would be barn-cured, and therefore less liable to turn ont badly than hay
pressed during the summer wbile the juice
was stilli in it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to ask Hon. MT. Donnelly, or some one who
knows about it; but the statement made te
me was that hay pressed in winter carried
with it a far greater danger than hay
pressqd during the summner.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is not possible.
Hon. Mre DONNELLY: I do not; prefeas
to be an expert. 1 do -not know that l ever
pressed any hay, but 1 have bought considerable preýssed hay in the neighbourhood,
f roin which 1 cerne. One objection to the
amendinent would be to putting two narnes
on the ticket, and thus dividing the responsibility. Another objection would be that it
would make the trade rather cumbersome,
causing too many tags to be attachedl to
every individual bundie of hay. I think the
word "presser"' will perhaps work ont al
ri-ght, although some objection might be
*taken to it, beoause the presser niay be an
irresponsible person with no monetary interest in the hay, and the fact that you got
bis naine on a bundle would not -give you
any persen yen could corne on for darnages.
In place of using the word "presser" 1 think
it would be better te use the words "the
owner under whose direction the hay or
straw is pressed." He is the rnan who is
really responsible. If you empley a man to
do a certain set you are responsible for
what hie dues, and I think if you used the
teris I suggest you co'uld attain your object. In regard to the point about the season of the year when hay is pressed, I do
not think it is so much a matter of the season. There is a liability of hay being damaged where it is in stacks, iand where a
certain amount of snow is likely te get inte,
the bundle. If hay is pressed in winter it
is lhable to be damaged in that way; but
priessing it in a barn is the ides! rnethod of
pressing. There is sornething te be said in
faveur of the amendmenlt requiring the
date of the pressing to be put on the
bundie. Hay that bas been pressed in winter and left over summer is very hiable te

700

SENATE

heat in moist or warm weather, so that purchasers Svould rather buy hay that has been
pressed in winter than hay that is left under poor conditions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman suggests that the word
"presser" be eliminated, and the word
"owner" inserted?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He says
presser or owner.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I suggest the
words, "the owner under whose direction
the hay or straw is pressed." The original
grower should not be held responsible, because he would simply grow the hay and
sell it to the dealer, and at the time the hay
was pressed somebody might have an idea
to ship the hay, and that party is really the
owner at the time, and if he bas not a press
of his own he employs somebody else to
press it, so that the words I suggest would
cover him.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I would suggest the
word "grower" instead of "presser."
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Why should we be
so solicitous about maternal legislation in
this matter at al? What complaints have
we?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
were not in when I read that letter?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: No, I was not in. I
have known of hay being pressed, and I
know th'at people who got it pressed stipulated that it should be stacked for a certain
time so as to become seasoned. Hay that
is properly stacked and pressed is in much
better condition than hay that is stacked
early in the season before all the moisture
is dried out. I do not know why you should
insist that the man who presses the hay
should be responsible for any grading at
all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is not
grading; it is simply marking the contents.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: You need not make
him responsible for anything under this
Bill at all. The hay dealer goes around and
buys the hay in bulk from the farmers, and
then he brings along a man with whom he
has a contract for pressing. The man who
presses the hay would be the presser. Let
the matter be settled between the buyer and
the seller. If it is not properly graded, the
man who buys it has his recourse.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What are the causes
that led up to this Act?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

Hon. Mr. WATSON: I do not know.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
One
cause, for instance, is that in Montreal
some sellers have been fined for not having
a tag on a bale of hay. They point out that
a bale of hay may pass through the hands
of half a dozen different sellers, and it
means that each seller bas to put his tag
on the bale.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But what is wrong
with the hay?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
contents. It is has been found that bales of
hay contain a great many foreign substances-stone, and all that sort of thingfor the purpose of adding weight to the
hay.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: When this Act was
framed the word "seller" was used advisedly, but no doubt it was intended to
be the first seller, and this confusion has
arisen because that word "first" was not
inserted so that every seller, as the hay
passes from one to another, is liable to
a fine. If the words "first seller" were
put in, this whole difficulty would be obviated.
It seems to me that the first
seller is the man who is responsible; he
bas sold the hay, and as such ought to be
responsible for its quality.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Suppose the man that
sold the hay first sold it loose, then the insertion of those words would not help
you at all. You have also to look out for
another thing; it has been pointed out
that bales may be changed from time to
time. If you require the man who makes
the first move to put a tag on, then the
bale may travel a thousand miles and go
through the hands of six persons, and the
poor devil that sold it would be punished.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will move
my amendnent, and we will dispose of that.
I have two amendments. I think the first
one will meet with the general approval
of the Senate.
Section 340 F reads as follows:
Every seller of both hay or straw in Canada
shall affix on every bale of hay or straw sold
or offered for sale a tag having written thereon
plainly and legibly his name and address apd
the weight of the bale.

I move to strike out the word "and"
before the word "weight" and to add after
the word "weight" the following words:
"and the month and year of the pressing
of the bale," so as to include in the Act the
obligation on the presser to put on his tag

MAY 31, 1921
the rnonth and year in which hie bas done the
pressing. Then if that is carried or rejected, I will move another amendrnent.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I want to point ont
to the honourable member that in those
words, putting on the month the hay is
pressed really does not arnount to anything.
In one part of Ontario-here, for instance
-I suppose hay is matured within a fortnight, while there are other places where
it will not mature for six weeks yet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What objection is there to putting on the date?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Then there iB another
thing about the hqy. Your hay rnay be
pure tirnothy, or hall tirnothy and half
clover and other grasses. There is no gain
frorn that because it does not mean anything. If a man had to certify that it
contained cprtain water contents, it would
mean something.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My arnendment sirnply is to force the presser to put
on the date at which hie presses.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: But what do you gain
frorn that?
Hon. Mr. DUJNDURAND:
When the
seller presents hirnself the purchaser wil
know hie is buying hay of 1919 or 1921.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: It is ail right as to
the year, but you ask for the month; what
bas the nionth to do with it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn told it
makes ail thle difference in the world
whetber'it is in summer or in winter.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:. No, it does not
make any difference whether it is in summer
or in winter. It ail depends on whether the
hay. is cured or not.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: 1 believe this matter of baling hay and selling to the dealers
and the consumers afterwards must be
left hetween the parties to settie. This
eternal legislation you are trying to pass
is altogether out of place, I think. It is
just as the honourable leader of the House
said the other evening, in connection with
some Bill we were dealing with: there is
a craze to get sornething on the statute
book.' It would be far better to leave this
matter between the people who are dealing
in the transaction. One honourable genfe-'
man suggested that it should be the grower
who would be held responsible; but the
grower bas no more to do witb the pressing of the hay than the man who ia perhap3

701

in bis law office in Montreal wben tbe bay
cornes to be pressed. A mnan cornes to tbe
farmer's barn and buys bis barn of bay,
hie does flot say wbether hie is going to
press it, or seli it loose, or any other way.
The buyer brings the press and presse; the
hay and takes it away. Wbat does the
grower know as to wbat is going to be
done witb that? It is sofd in tbe loose.
The rnan wbo buys it is not deceived, because hoe sees exactly wbat bie is buying.
The buyer sends the presser there, a hired
man, instructed to press wbat hay is in
that barn; it does not matter what mixture tbere is in it. He doos the pressing
and marks tbe weight of the bales on them,
not the quality at ail. He is a bired man;
there is one man to-day and anotber
man the next week. What respon3ibility
has he but to carry out the instructions hie receives fromn his employer?
1 bave listened to ail this discussion. I
have seen a good deal of hay pressed, and
know bow it is done, and I do not feel tbat
you can improve matters by any legislation
you may enact bere. Let the man who is
buying hay frorn tbe dealer ask about its
quality, and if it is not up to tbe quality
that he agrees to buy, tben hie bas bis recourse in the courts. I feel that by keeping
this matter off the statute book and leaving it between tbe buyer and the seller you
are advancing the interests of ail parties
and are not putting anyone into trouble
by requiring bim to mark the day, tbe montb
and the year tbe hay was pressed. 'Going
down to Montreal, I bave seen bay that
perhaps had left tbe presser's hands or the
barns in good condition, but it was fying
alongside the railway track, either piled up
or strung along in the ditches and on tbe
roadside for a quarter of a 'mile, and exposed to the rain That hay would alterwards be taken into sème warebouse wet,
and naturally, wben bay that is wet is piled
together in large quantities, it will must
and come out in a condition altogether ditferent frorn what it was when it left tbe
hands of the grower, the presser, or perbaps the dealer. You have all these tbings
to take into consideration, and tbe best way,
in my opinion, is to leave tbe matter
between the seller and the buyer of tbe
hay-between John Jones and Tom Smitb.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN:
mon sense.

That la good com-

Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Honourable
gen-tlemen, it is a well-known tact tbat the
record of the Canadian hay that was
shipped overseas during the war period was

SENATE
nothing to the advantage of Canada. It
was of very inferior quality, I regret to
say. The simplest way that I could suggest as a remedy for this evil would be to
issue to each presser a license, giving him
a particular number, and to require him
to put a lead tag on every bale of hay that
he pressed, with his number upon it, and
also the grade, and the year in which the
hay was pressed. That would be, in my
opinion, the simplest remedy. If I am a
retailer, I may give an order for a car of
horse hay. When it arrives at my station
I may. find it inferior in quality, possibiy
one-third clover, another third wild grass
and the remaining third timothy. What am
I going to do with it? I have immediately
to reject the whole thing. I have to send
for an inspector, and it may take a week
or ten days to get him. My customers may
be in the meantime in need of the article,
and the result is that finally the hay is
shipped away and I have to buy a carload
from somebody else. As the honourable
gentleman bas just said, the owner of the
hay does not see it in one case out of ten.
He may be a practical farmer; perhaps
he may be running a large farm somewhere
in the outskirts of the city, and this hay
is in the hands of hired help. But if you
make the presser responsible for his license,
and require him to place his number on a
lead tag attached to each bale of hay, with
the weight and the quality marked on itwhether it is No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3-and the
year in which it was pressed, that is al
the guarantee that any dealer should require.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You would make
of each presser, then, an expert in hay.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER:

They are expert.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Not necessarily at
all.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: I would like to
ask the honourable gentleman from Brockville what is meant by a presser. What is
the man who actualfy presses the hay?
He is simply a man who knows how to put
hay into the machine, and he may be no
judge of the quality of hay at all. I have
seen hundreds of such men at work. They
are able to run the machine, and they
wire up the bales, put tags on them, and
throw them to one side. The man who does
that work is a hired man. He may be working for one presser this week and for
another the next week. He is not a hay
expert.
lon. JOHN WEBSTER.

Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: In reply to the
honourable gentleman, I may say they are
all practical men. The farmers themselves
have not much to do in the winter time,
and some of them own presses.
Hon. Mr. McCALL:.Honourable gentlemen, after listening to all the discussion,
I have come to this conclusion, that you
cannot fasten any responsibility on the
mechanic who runs the pressing machine.
He is a common working man. He may be
called from the foundry, or from the
machine shop, or maybe from the lumber
woods. He knows nothing about hay at all,
but he can run a pressing machine. Now,
if you make him responsible by compelling
him to get a license and to put tags on
the bales, and do that sort of thing, you
will never get a man to take charge of a
hay presser and run it. The man who runs
the hay presser has nothing at stake except
his wage. The responsibility must be fastened upon the owner in the first instance. I know communities in which a
group of farmers, perhaps half-a-dozen,
will have a thrashing machine, and a hay
presser, owning them together, and when
the packing season arrives some one of their
hired men, or one of themselves, take the
hay-presser and go from barn to barn
amongst themselves doing the meehanical
work. The owner of the hay knows what
he has, and what be has packed, and the
responsibility must be fastened upon him.
As to the grading and all that sort of
thing, the ordinary hay-presser could not
find the grades of his hay. There are halla-dozen or a dozen dîfferent grades. The
hay must be sold on its appearance.
I
have not much faith in the stories that all
sorts of stuff can be put into a hay-presser.
Any of you honourable gentlemen who have
ever seen the process of hay pressing
know that in the summer season the hay
has been put in the barn, or in the stack,
and a man or two men are in the mow
throwing itb down, and it goes into the
mouth, the business end, of the machine.
It is shoved in there and the packer, the
man in charge, puts it through. When it
comes out be attaches his bills to it, or
marks it. I hope saome honourable gentleman who can frame an amendment will
frame one that will place the responsibility
upon the first owner of the hay. Then, if
the quality is not good, the responsibility
must be traced back to him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not want to bore the House
on this question, but I would point out

MAY 31, 1921
that it is of considerable importance to
Canada. We have farmns that can produce
perbaps the best bey to be bad in North
America.
Hon. JOHN-WEBSTER: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We have
first class land for bay production, and
last year tbe production was 1,200,000 baies
of hay, exclusive of the bay that was sold
loose. Tbat is considerable business for
Canada. Nothwitbstanding aur advantages,
our bay on the Boston markcet is classed as
second grade--mediocre. I tbink there was
considerable reason for the Governinent interfering and endeavouring to raise the
quality of our hay. Its value rejpresents
millions of dollars; therefore I feel that
this question sboutd noV be treated lightly.
The reason for miy lending a willing ear
to tbe secretary of tbe Hay Traders' Association of my province is this. About
twenty-five yeat-s ago, wben I wa-s practismng at tbe Bar, Mny firm bad to liquidate the
estate of a 'bayd<ealer of considerable standing In Montreal, who had died suddely.
His books were in a very difficult state.
Tbey had not been kept by a first-class
accountant, and we bad to, locate thousands
of dealers witb wbom he -seemred to -have
credits'amounting to tens of tbousands of
dollars. His widow was trying to unravel
the mystery. Hay bad been bougbt by him
ftoni farmers* here and there and had been
shipped to London, England. We found the
naines of the parties Vo w'bor he bad shi-p-,
ped tbat bay, but tben we 'struck the snag.
Most of the people had put in complaints
about tbe quality of the bay. One of thean
I rerneiber. I became an intiinate friend
of bis. His ancestors came from Nova
Scotia. He ba*d relatives in tbe States, and
he camne bere quite often.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We can understand
it ail now.
Hon. Mi. DAN DURAND: He was doing
a world-wide business. He had a num-ber
of sbips, and was sending sbips to New
York or Boston. Wben he needed a return
cargo 'which he could not get at the coast,
be would cable to, Montreal Vo see if 'be
could not geV sonie hay. When the price
and quality were quoted he would turn to
sobne traction conpany, -in London, for instance, and place a few tbousand tons of
hay with tbem, and Vbat was the end of
bis bargain. Everything had to be done
on the good faitb and honesty of tbe men
witb whozn he was dealing. That bay was
distri<buted, and it was found by the pur-

chasers that- instead of being of the quality
quoted it was inferior.
As a resuit of
such experiences our hay is classed as second quality, mediocre, in Boston.
The
Governiment have tried to rernedy that by
endeavouring to put the owner on his good
behaviour, by requiring him to affix a tag
bearing bis naine on the bale. Tbey started
by holding the presser responsible as the
man who sees the quality of the hay and.
knows what is going into tbebales. I learn
now from rny honourable friend that it was
the Senate that substituted the seller for the
presser; an*d now the Government cornes
back and says: "The seller may have
bought that bay after it bas passed Vbrough
tbe bands of two or tbree persons, and we
want to corne back to the real owner, or tbe
party who is maily responsible, namely,
the presser." Now we are told that in certain parts of the country the presser is
sirnply a meicbanic, who bas no responsibility. I thougbt that we might add, then,
that if the presser is not the owner of the
hay, he shall put on bis tag the naine of
the owner; tbat is ail. 1 proposed that
the month and the year in whicb
tbe pressing was done sbould be added.
It seerns to me that thalt with the namne on
the tag there is a responsibility attaching
to tbe presser, if he is tbe owner, or, if be
is noV, to the owner foxr wborn be presses,
and tbe dealer in Montreal, Toronto, or
elsewbere, wbo buys that hay in good faitb,
will not be deceived as to its quality. I
arn trying to improve a littie uýpon the
Bill. My bonourable friend froni Lindsay
(Hon. Mr. Mdflugh) is about to asic that
tbe Committee rise. In that way he would
get rid of this Bill, but he would flot get
rid of the Act. If tbe Comrnittee rises,
the word "seller" will remain in the Act
and the seller will be obliged to affix bis
tag. So I would draw the honourable
gentlemnan's attention to the fact tbat we
are dealing witb the question of tbe responsible party, and if we do, fot accept
this Bill, tbe seller will remain responsible.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Can
you sborten the amendment?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My arnendnment is simply this: I have mnoved that
tbe words "and the rnonth and year of
the pressing"-for instance, May,
1921be added. That is one arnendment; and the
second one, of wbich I have given notice,
is tbat if tbe hay is pressed for another
party, the presser shahf add the naine ani
address of the owner on the said tag.

SENATE

Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: In reply to
the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier I might say that the reason why
Canadian hay is placed in second grade in
Boston is that if the hay contains one-tenth
clover, whether it be alsike or red clover,
it cannot be put in first grade. Now, onetenth is a very small proportion of lover,
but it is sufficient to lower the grade from
number 1 to number 2. That is the reason
why our hay is graded number 2; it is not
all timothy, and advantage is taken of
that fact.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Mr. Dandurand) what could happen
under his amendment if a man bought a
bale of hay and found there was something
wrong with it. Whom would he go after?
The presser, or the owner, or both? There
has been only one rational proposal, and
it is that made by the honourable gentleman who says, "Let the buyer beware."
That is the old common law 'principle. Ask
for a guarantee of what you are getting,
and if you do not get what is agreed upon,
sue the seller for damages.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: I would like to see
the first party who handles the hay when
it is sold held responsible. There should
be no chance for fraud on the part of the
farmer in selling the hay. If the dealer
who sends in his press sells hay to some
one else, let him be responsible; and if
the person buying the hay re-sells it, let
him in his turn be responsible. But do not
make legislation that will cause an innoDo not make the
cent man to suffer.
presser suffer, because he has no interest
in it.
With regard to foreign materials in
hay, I know the difficulty of judging hay
when it is baled up. I know that 'a person
can often be deceived, and that there may
be disappointment when the hay is opened
up. But the person doing the pressing
would lose a great deal of time in trying
to put foreign substances into the bales of
hay. He would lose a good deal more than
if he filled up the space with hay out of the
barn.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think my honourable friend has the Act of 1918 before
him. I would ask him to look at section
340F, which reads:
Every seller of baled hay or straw in Canada
shall, etc.
Hon. Mr. DANDIRAND.

It seems to me that the word "every"
is the cause of the trouble. Would it not
be better to put in the words, "original
seller?"
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Here is the thing
that puzzles me. One bale of hay looks
as much like another as one pea resembles
another. Farmer A may be honest, and
may have baled a quantity of good hay,
which goes on to the market. Farmer B
may have baled a lot of bad hay, and put
some foreign materials into it. What protection is there for Farmer A against the
tags being changed? That is what I want
to know. I think it is an atrocious thing
to ask a man to put a tag on a 'bale of
hay, or on a box, or a basket, and then,
after the goods have passed through the
hands of a hundred persons, to come back
from number 100 to number 1, who has
had no protection with regard to the persons through whose hands .the goods have
passed in the meantime. I do not believe
there is anything more in this matter than
what the honourable gentleman from Lindsay (Hon. Mr. McHugh) has pointed out.
That is one simple way. You can go into
the market to buy hay. You know what
you want, and you ask for that. Let the
man who is selling say, " I will sell you
that hay, and I will give you my warranty."
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: And if he does not
furnish that, the buyer can take action.
That is the only remedy.
Hon. Mr. ROSS:
If you are going
to ship hay abroad, there is only one way
of dealing with that-the way in which
the Army people deal with it. You may
have a carload of hay, and may be asked
what is in it, and you say it is of a certain class. Then three or four bales are
taken out of a carload and are split in
two, and if they come up to the quality
specified, the hay is accepted; if they do
not, the whole carload is condemned or is
classed in a lower grade.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I would be disposed to agree with the honourable gentleman from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) if
we were dealing with new legisiation; but
we already have an Act on the statute
book, and it is for the purpose of making
it workable that the amendment is proposed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No.; we are ripping it up.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Are the amendments to the Customs tariff in this clause

On section 5-imported goods to be

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I should like to
ask the leader of the Government to explain how this section is going to work
out. It seems to me that it is going to be
very difficult to enforce. It says:
That all goods imported into Canada which
are capable of being marked, stamped, branded
or labelled, without injury, shah be marked,
or laibelled in English
branded
stamped,
or French words, in a conspicuous place that
shah not be covered or obscured by any subsequent attachments or arrangements, so as
to indicate the country of origin.
Hon. Mr. WATSON.

That seems to be a very drastic law.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: All customs regulations are drastic.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But this is somewhat new, and I think it is going to be difficult to, carry out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
always found that, if Customs duties are
to be collected, the Customs authorities
are equal to making the collection from
the public. If there is any government institution which it is difficult to escape
from, it is the Customs authorities.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I quite agree with
my honourable friend in regard to that.
But the point is that the fixing of these
marks on the goods is going to interfere
with the trade of the country.

1919. Hoiý. Mr. Barnard in the chair.
On section 1-manufacture, importatin
In
and sale parmitted:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have no objection
ta, this Bill, but it was suggerited to, me that
some asnendment should be made after the

SENATE

708

word "permitted," in the twelfth line,
though I observed that the word occurs
also in the sixteenth line. The object of
the suggestion was that, inasmuch as
oleomargarine is sold considerably at the
present time, it should be in a shape so
that it would not be confused with butter;
that is to say, that a person who has oleomargarine put before him would know that
he is eating oleomargarine and not butter.
It bas been pointed out that under the Act
at present it is marked in some kind of a
way, so that the person who buys it knoWs
that he is buying oleomargarine, but if he
goes where it is used in small quantities,
as in a hotel, the person who is actually
eating it as it is made up now does not
know what he is eating, and therefore it
would be advisable that the colour should
show what it is. I understand that the
manufacturers of oleomargarine in Canada
to-day, and the people who ship it into this
country, send it in a condition which shows
the difference-that the colour is usually
white, and therefore the consumer can tell
from its appearance that it is oleomargarine and not butter. It has been found
that the oleomargarine supply has filled
a want in this country, and the dairy
people, who are interested in the matter,
and who are not in any way trying to
oppose this Act, think that the public generally should know what they are getting,
and not be left in the position of being
liable to have oleomargarine passed off on
them in place of butter. I was asked to
place this matter before the members of
the Senate in order that they might realize
the situation; and in order to accomplisai
that purpose the suggestion is to add to
this section:
And no oleomargarine shall be imported into
Canada, manufact'ured in, offered for sale, or
had in possession for sale in Canada, which is
not of a standard colour other than the colour
of butter, such standard colour to be prescribed
by regulation to be made by the Governor in
C.ouncil.

I think this would not in any way interfera
with the sale of oleomargarine in the country, but it would be a protection to the
manufacturers of butter, as they would
then know that the people who were using
and eating oleomargarine in public places
would be informed that it was oleomargarine and not butter, and that it would
not be passed off on them as being butter.
I therefore suggest that this amendment
should 'be made to new section 3 of the
Bill before us.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: How
would you colour it-green?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: As I said before,
my information is that the natural colour of
the oleomargarine is white, quite distinct
from the colour of butter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
I would
seen butter white-very pale.
point out to my honourable friend that in
the statutes of 1919 it is made obl'igatory
upon all importers or sellers of oleomargarine to have it distinctly labelled oleomargarine, and it seems to me that that is
sufficient. This suggestion is evidently inspired for the purpose of rendering the
trade in oleomargarine as difficult and expensive as possible. It is meant to restrain
the trade in oleomargarine, and I think
the policy of our legislation in the past
has been to assist it all we can. There is
no doubt that when this period of time
expires oleomargarine must necessarily be
treated as freely as any other trade coinmodity in the market. That time will come.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Government
have done everything to prevent the manufacture of oleomargarine by amending the
Act in another place and restricting it to
twelve months only. Now, if it is good food,
as the Government say it is, why restrict
it to twelve months? Who is going to build
a factory, and start a trade under such
conditions? This Bill was all right, but the
Government amended it and defeated the
Bill, and it is absolutely useless in the
shape it is in to-day, because no one will
spend money putting up a factory, finding customers, and establishing a business.
If the Government are sincere, let them
take off their limitation of twelve months
and make it permissible without putting a
time limit on it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
must eventually come.

Hon. Mr. POWER: One point which
has occurred to me with respect to this
clause is this. However it may be in the

have been for over one hundred years
carrying guns-fowling pieces, as a rule.
One finds, in going through New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and, I fancy, a
great part of Quebec, that in nearly every
household there is a fowling piece. As J
understand it, under the clause now under
consideration the people who own thesa
guns will be obliged to take out a license-

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is only in the

have 'been doing for the last thirty or

Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 1 (reconsidered):
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Mr. Chairman, I
asked that section 1 should stand over and
be considered along with sections 5 and
7. I think that in order to explain section 5 it would perhaps be well to read one
or two sections of the Criminal Code.
I do not want to enter into any exposition
of the Criminal Code-at all events, not to
any extent that is not strictly necessary
to explain these sections and the views
that I have with regard to them. I dealt
with the matter, I think, pretty fully before the House on at least one occasion,
and perhaps a second time, and I do not
desire to inflict any legal argument upon
this House.
However, speaking without
the book, in order that everyone may
understand the matter, our Criminal Code
at one time made what I think was admitted to be a pretty wise provision, namely,
that in dealing with assaults on children
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

there should be a very heavy punishment.
In order to define what was a child the age
of fourteen years was fixed, and, as I say,
there was a severe penalty for an indecent
assault on a girl under fourteen. No conplaint, I think, was made with regard to
that section.
A few years ago-at all events, shortly
after I came into this Chamber-some
person, who has been tampering with the
Criminal Code every year, took it upon himself to deal with this clause with regard to
assaults on children, but apparently was
ignorant of the fundamental subject w'th
The old law, of
which he was dealing
which I have spoken, deals with assaults
on children, and not with a sexual offence
at all. It purports to deal with an unBut when you come to
natural offence.
deal with the subject of girls beyond the
age of puberty you are dealing with a
new subject; you are dealing, not with an
unnatural offence, but with a sexual
offence. Now, this is the complaint I hava
to make with regard to this new legislation-that,, by simply taking pen and
ink and changing 14 to 16, or 16 to 18
that man has made a new law, absolutel3
ignoring the fact that he has passed fron
one subject-matter to another that is en
tirely different.
Section 301 of the Criminal Code reads
as follows:
Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence and

liable

to

imprisonment for

life and

to be

whipped who carnally knows any girl under
the age of fourteen years, not being his wife,
whether he believes ber to be of or above that
age or not.

That is the law to which I have been
referring. Last year we changed that
section 301. The effect of the change is to
raise this age from 14 to 16. This is the
Act as it stands now:
8. Section 301 of the said Act is amended by
adding thereto the following subsection:"(2) Everyone is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for five years
who carnally knows any girl of previous chaste
character under the age of sixteen and above
the age of fourteen, not being his wife, and
whether lie believes lier to be above the age

of sixteen years or not. No person accused of

any offence under thi.s subsection shall be convicted upon the evidence of one witness, unless such wtness is corroborated in some
material particular by evidence implieating the
accused."

That last clause is not very material. It
is inserted there to cover this new section,
although it is in the existing Criminal Code
and covers the section that I read a minute
ago.

71.1

JUNE 1, 1921
Yau will see that the amendment we
passed last year raises the age from 14 to,
16; but it has this qualification, that if
the indecent assault is to be considered a
crime in the case of a girl between 14 and
16, she must be of previous chaste character; and there is in the Criminal Code a
clause that says that she is to be taken as
that unless the accused proves the contrary. The onle difference between that
and the old Act that I read to, you, ie that
assault on a child-that ie, on a girl under
14-is flot qualified by those words, "of
previous chaste character." Her previous
chaste character has nothing to do with it:
it is deemed to be an unnatural offence. But
this new section recognizes the tact that
you are dealing with a different subject,
and it provides that the accused shall not
be held guilty unless the girl was of previons chaste character. This House bas
given a great deal of consideration to the
question, but it revives year after year.
There ie another section that ie relevant
to this samne eubject, that ie, section 294 of
the Criminal Code:
It
any
the
she

la nlo defence to a charge or Indlctment for
Indecent assault on a young person under
age of fourteen yeara to prove that lie or
consented to the act of indecency.

That is one of the provisos contained in
the oid section of which I spoke, with reference to a child, or a girl under 14.
The firet proposition that we have in
section 5 of the present Bill is thiat section
294 be enlarged so as to make it apply to
the new section that was passed laet year.
The section that you passed last year provided:
Every one la gullty cf an Indictable offeuce
and lisile to imprl8sonmelit for five years who
carnally knowe anY girl of prevlous chaste
cbaracter under the age of' sixteen and above
the age oif fourteen, flot belng hie wlfe, and
whether he belleves her to be above the age
of sixteen years or flot.
That section ie to be modified by changing section 294, and if the propoeed amendment is made section 294 'wiil read in this
way:
It
any
the
aie

la no defence to a charge or lndietmnent for
Indecent assault on a young perso>n iuder
age of sixteen yeare to prove that lie or
consented to the act of Indeconcy.

You can see what the effect of that is.
And to show you that the person dealing
with this matter misunderstands hie whoie
subject:- if you were to change the age from
14 to 16 in section 294, then section 7 of the
presenit Bill, and the section that I have
read from the Act, would not require it at
all.

'The particular point thýat I make is this,
that you are dealing with two, différenlt
thinge when you are dealing wit~h a girl
who je a chiid, taking 14 as the approximate
age at which to fi puberty, jand with a
girl aboive that age. In the latter case you
are ýpresumably dëaling with a woman.
There je no quarrel with the law with regard. to the evidence, the trial, or the punisihment in connection with offences against
girls under 14. In the Act that you pased
hast year you miade provision for dealing
with girls between 14 and 16; you made
the Act -an offence provided the girl between
14 and 16 was cf previous chaste character.
I submit that there is no occasion for
departing from the position that we took
with regard to, this matter hast year. I
do not know that I am xnaking myseif
very clear upon this, matter. It cannot be
donc without reading the sections. Section
1, with which we have been dealing along
with sections 5 and 7, provided for another thing, that qualified ail these sections
exceipt that old iaw, namely, that on'the
trial of these offences the trial judge might
inetruct the jury that if they were of
opinion that the evideuce shoywed tlhat the
man was not wholly or chiefly to bMamne,
the jury might find a verdict of acquittai.

That je being struck out. I have had expressions of opinion froni jud'ges and lawyers, and fromn laymen f00, with regard to
that amendment, which we made after a
Ail the comgreat deal of consideration.
mente that I have heard on it -have been
favourable. For thie reason I think we nxay
safely leave the haw as it ie, and strike ouf
sections 1, 5 and 7 of this Bill. TIhe law as
it now stands is that , in the case of a girl
under 14, proof of indecent assault is sutficient, and there je a very severe punishment; Ibètween 14 and 16 proof that there
was an assault on the girl resuite in a conviction unlese the do-fendant pi-oves that
she was not of previoue chaste character,
and there is the further qualification thaf

the judge may fell the jury that if in their
opinion the evidence does not show that
the nman was whoihy or chiefiy f0 tblame,
they may find a verdict of acquittai.
I take it that honourabie members of
this House are as conversant with this
subi ect as I anm. I move to strike ouf sections 1, 5 and 7.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: We.have heard
considerable argument from my honourable friend from Middleton as to why this
clause as sent down by the Commons
should not be passed. We dealt with this
question once 1efore, and it seems to me
that the Commons, and the Minister of
Justice having charge of the Criminal
Law, have for very good reasons seen fit
to change the age of consent to 16.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, that is not in
dispute.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It is not consent
at a-il.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What business has
the House of Commons to change the age
of consent àny more than the Senate has?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Only in this
respect, that the administration of law is
given to the Department and' the Minister
cf Justice. We have the making of the
law, and he has the administration of it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The same as the
House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: As I said, the
Minister of Justice and his Department,
having the administration of the law,
deemed it advisable to make this change,
increasing the age from 14 to 16.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is not in dispute at all to-day. We are not dealing
with the age ibetween 14 and 16. That is
not challenged. It is the striking out of
the words "of previous chaste character."
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I understood
you ta move a moment ago that section 5
be struck out?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: You are dealing
with 5?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You are on the
wrong train.
H[on. Mr. LYNCII-STAUNTON.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I thought I
vas on the right train.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Well,
you have no ticket.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Like the honourable gentlemen of the Senate who
travel on trains.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would like to
put the honourable gentleman right. It
is the provincial government, and not the
Minister of Justice, who has charge of
the administration of the law.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The Departnient of the Minister of Justice is the department which has the carrying out, to
a very large extent, of the criminal law.
It is true that in the arrangement of the
work of the courts and what is done there
the Attorney General's department takes
charge, ýbut my honourable friend will
hardly deny the statement that the Department of Justice has a great deal more
to do with the administration of the law
than, we have in this Chamber. All we
have to do is to provide the law, and then
between the two departments of the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General
the law is carried out. Now, in the working out of that law it is found-as I have
no doubt it has been stated to the Justice
Department by the various Attorneys
General throughout the Dominion of Canada-that it will be very much better in
the interest of justice to have the age increased to 16. I do not know why honourable gentlemen should object to such a
change. We all know that a girl 16 years
of age is still a mere child, and, if it is
necessary to protect a girl of 14 years,
should not that protection be extended to
a girl of 16? There is sa very little difference between the two periods that if they
are entitled to protection at 14 they should
be entitled ta some protection at the age

of 16. You are protecting children, that
is what you are asked to do, and I do not
know of any good reason why that protection should not be extended. I listened
with a good deal of attention ta what the
honourable member for Middleton stated;
but he did not advance an argument which
appealed to me as a reason why the term
should not be extended. I think the fact that
a girl is still a child at the age of 16 is in
itself a very much stronger argument in
favour of the extension of the period than
anything that can be said to have the law
remain as it is. We all know that the
social workers, in carrying out the law

JUNE 1, 1921
throughout this Dominion, particularly in
the larger cities, find it important, in the
interest of their 'work, that girls of 16
s'hould receive protection. I have no doubt
the niajority of 'the honourable gentlemen
in this House have received* information
of one irind or another from those social
workers, and they know that they take the
position that the age should be 16; in faet,
many of them eay it should be as high as
18 years of age.

On section 7-provision respecting carnally knowing girl between 14 and 16:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
object of this section is to strike out the
words wbicb were added in the Senate last
Session when the Bill was before us, namely,
the words, "of previous chaste character."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Wby should those
words be struck out? It seems to me tbey
are a very necessary protection. A girl of
14 to 16 might be of very unchaste cbaracter, and I do not see why any protection
should be tbrown around her that would
affect the party of tbe other part.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I desire to cali
tbe attention of the House to tbis fact that
last Session the Bill came before this House
and we added those words, "of previous
chaste character."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They are important words, too.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 0f course they
are very important words. They are so
impportant that the Department of Justice
now thinks they sbould be removed. Why
should it be necessary to prove that a girl
under the age of 16 and above the age of 14
was of previous chaste character? The law
is that if a girl is 14 years or under, a man
who bas intercourse with her, or carnally
knows ber, as stated in the Act here, is
guilty of an offence. But if a girl over 14
and under 16 is carnally know it must be
proved tbat she was of previous chaste character. Tben it says here:
Every one Is guilty of an indictable offence
and Ilable to lmprisonment for five years who
carnal]y knows any girl of previous chaste
character under the age of 16.

That is, you bave to prove that she was
of previous chaste character.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I ratber think it
is tbe otber way.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: She is presumed to
be tbat, but it leaves it open to the accused
to show tbat sbe was flot of chaste character. There is another section in the chapter
wbich puts the whole onus on the accused.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Wbere is the
balance of tbat section?-because tbis section seemns to be complete in itsehf. As I
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

read tbe amendment, tbe prosecution requires to prove the girl is of previous chaste
character.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Not at ahi.
Hýon. Mr. ýPROUDFOOT: Wby, certainly,
that is what it stateswho carnally knows any girl of previous chaste
character.

But tbey must prove that.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No. If you strike
those words out the eff ect will be to put a
man cbarged with assault upon a girl of
16 on the same footing as be wouhd he if
the girl were 14.
Hopn. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Certainly.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: And it wouhd not be
open to him to show, by way of defence, that
she was not of previous chaste character.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is what
I say; it bas to be established by tbe prosecution.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No; the defenda nt
bas to prove that she was not.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Welh, I do not
read it that way.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: You have to read
the rest*of tbe Code.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Because the
words seem to me to be perfecthy clear. Tc
render the person hiable it must be established tbat the girl was of previous chaste
character.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
How would
you prove that?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is one of
tbe dîfficulties, and that is one reason, and
the main reason, why those very words have
been taken out, as the prosecution thereby
are bound to establîsh something whicb it
is practicalhy impossible to establisb.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- I tbink there
is a rigbt of defence on the part of the
accused which sbouhd be maintained so long
as we maintain the age of consent at 16,
because if some girls are to be found in
public bouses at an age less than 16, I
would take f or granted that it would be a
legitimate defence for the accused to show
that sbe was in a bouse of prostitution.
But witb regard to the preceding section
294, I confess that I was inchined to support raising the age to 16. It is an arbitrary rule, and the question is, to what age
will you extend protection to the child? My
inclination wouhd stronghy be to extend

JUNE 1, 1921
protection up to 16;; but since we hava the
age of consent fixed at 16 I think that the
section before us should not ha amended.
As I arn aware of the fact, through officiai
statistics, that young girls under 16 are
found in houses of prostitution, it is not
repugnant to me to allow the defenca. te
allege that sha was a prostitute.
The motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed
to adopt section 7 was, negatived.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I would
like ta go back, if I may ha allowed, to section 2. This section is, te my mind, very
badly drawn:
114a. Every one la gulty of an Indictable
offence and liable to seven years' imprisonmnent
who wlthout lawful excuse. the burden of proof
whereof shahl lie upon the accused, han lu hds
possession any bonib, grekade or other device or
contrivazice muade or dntended for a stmilar use
or purpose.
What they wish to say there is that the
possession of any of these devices shaîl be
prima facie evidance of guilt; but the

the honour to introduce in this House nome
time ago was considered hy the Department of Justice in connection with this
clause.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Immediately my honourable friend introduced
his measure into this Chamber, I took up
the matter with the Minister of Justice,
and he informed me that this Bill had been
before the Commons, and that he was very
doiibtful about being able to give any consideration in *the present Session to the
Bill of my honouraible friend, on account
of the radical character of the legisiation
proposed. Consequently, I cannot hold' out
any hope to niy honourable friend that the,
matter will be deait wîth at the pre.sent

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I shall reintroduce the Bill next Session.
Sections 8, 9, 10 and il were agreed to.

recohlection is -right, the offence of destroying property of small value is triable by
summary conviction. Under this section,
if a man spills some oil on an old overcoat
and, burns it, he might hae sent down for
fourteen years.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say to my honouraible friand that this section has 'been asked for by the Attorney
General of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Strike it out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What

the section says: "for any fraudulent or
unlawful purpose." If a man kicks in a
door in a passion, it is unlawful.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He must
burn it up.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Then I
would move that the words "or unlawfui"
be struck out.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Twenty-five d
lars is too small an amount.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I think a.
honourable friend has overlooked the pr
ceding words, "who wilfully and for an.
fraudulent or unlawful purpose burns
any chattel."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I say
that a man may deliberately smash a piece
of property worth $25; he may do it for
spite; but he should not go down for fourteen years.
If he is defrauding someone
it is different. I move to strike out the
words " or unlawful " and substitute "$200"
for " $25."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It would 'be unlawful if the burning were the result of
some other act. I would strike it out altogether.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Section 510 of the
Criminal Code describes very fully the
penalty for certain acts in connecfion with
burning or destroying.
The last subsection says:
To two , years

imprisonment

if the object

damaged is any property, real or peronal, corporeal or incorporeal, for damage to which no
special punishment is by law prescribed damaged
to the value of twenty dollars.

For destroying propefty to the extent
of $20 the extreme penalty is two years;
but for destroying it to the value of $25
the penalty is fourteen years-the difference is twelve years for $5. I would like
to know on what grounds the Attorney
General of Ontario has asked for this.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I submit that
this is wholly unnecessary. I move that
clause be stricken out.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The law
adviser thinks it is necessary in some form.
I move that it 'be allowed to stand.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Do I understand that the honourable gentleman is
willing to condemn a man to fourteen
years imprisdnment for destroying property
worth $200?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If it'

Hon. Mr. LYNCH--STAUNTON.

Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I think the
penalty is too great.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: You might as

Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: If ycu

Section 12 stands.
Section 13 was agreed to.
On section 14-docking animals forbidden:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I move that this
clause be struck out. It is a very unnecessary clause, and on the face of it is
absurd. It says: "The present amendnent
shall not apply to dogs." Why should a
dog's tail or ears be cut off, and not a
horse's tail? The 'Clydes, Hackneys, and
other Canadian herses, would be absolutely
shut out frorn the show ring in the United
States, if this Bill were to pass. There is
a feeling abroad in the country among a
certain class of people, represented to sorne
extent by the honourable gentleman from
Huron (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot), that they
should change everything. Why do they
net object to the castration of animals?
That is quite as painful to them as cutting
off their tails. That will be the next thing.
I think these busybodies ought to be taught
a lesson, and shown that the Senate is here
to protect the common-sense people of this
country from the attacks of a lot of
lunatics. I move that the section be struck
out.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: This legislation is very innocent looking, but I am sure
that those from whorn it comes are net
familiar with the situation on the farm today. Take the case of a farmer who bas

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn afraid niy
honourable friend bas not carefully considered that provision with -regard to the
conveying or carrying, or causing or procuring or permitting to be conveyed, etc.
You can hardiy conve'y a wiId animal that
is in captivity.
Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It might
be in *a cage.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But while it is
in captivity it is not in a cage. What I
arn pointing out is this. The section says:
ahall convey or carry or cause or procure or,
belng the owner, permit to be conveyed or carried any cattle, domestic animal or bird or
any other animal of whatsoever kind or specles.
I do notsee how you can carry it if it is
i captivity.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
only be in a cage; that is the oniy way you
could carry a wiid animal.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But you have
flot caught him.
Hon. iSir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
you can carry hlm. The effect of this would
be, in the event of a wiid animal being in
captivity, that. is, in a cage, being transferred, say, uion a railway, that animal
shall be carried without the exercise of
any unnecessary cruelty.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before this section is adopted, may I point out that
it is going to lead to a great deal of trouble.
The section provides against cruelty
in kiliing or siaughtering ail sorts of domestic animais. That applies to aIl the
animais on the farm. I amn speaking of
par.agraph a. Now, what is the meaning
of "crueiiy kiliing" a hen? This clause
might enabie a magistrate or justice of
the peace to exercise almost absolute discretion in determining what is cruelty. in
the kiiling of a hen. That has not been
defined. I do not myseif know what might
ho determined to be crueity in the killing
of a hen.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Cut its head off.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is cutting its
head off killing it cruelly?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot think
of any way of killing a hen that is flot
cruel. là not cutting its head off the only
way to kili it? What could be more cruel
than' to eut off the head?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
clause is the law as it stands to-day.

719
This

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That does flot
make it any better.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The clause as it
is to-day, section 542, says: "wantonly,
crueily, or unnecessarily beats." It leaves
out the word- "kilîs" or "siaughter." That
makes, I think, a good deal of difference.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: One
wouid think the greater iicluded the less.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not quite see.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: la it considered
cruel to cut off the head of an animal, such
as a bull or a cow or a sheep? What is
the meaning of "cruelly killing"? I do
not know.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There are cruel
methods of killing. For instance, calves
have their throats cut s0 that they will
bieed slowly, because it makes the veal
whiter. They are hung up by the hind
legs and allowed to bieed slowly. That, in
my opinion, is a cruel way.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: The most humane
way of killing a hen, for instance, is to
cut the jugular vein, and then it bleeds to
death and does not suifer at ail. Animais
that bleed to deatli do not suifer a bit, and
that is the humane way of killing them.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It does flot seem
very humane tio hang a creature up 'by
its hind legs and let the biood ebb slowiy
away. It has seemed to me very cruel.
To separate them suddenly from lie seems
to me very much the more humane way.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The oniy two
gentlemen who have spoken on the subject
disagree* as to what is cruel and what is
nèot. Now, you are going to leave this to,
a magistrate in the country, who may have
an entireiy different opinion from anybody else, and who, may say that a certain
way of kiiling a hen is a- cruel way.
Hon. Mr: FOWLER: But the magistrate
in 'the country mig'ht be intelligent, like
me.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This is the best
illustration of my argument-that here we
have two gentlemen with large experience,
of the worid, who cannot agree as to how
to, kili a chicken.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: It le not a questilon of chicken.

SENATE

720

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You are going
to leave it to the opinion of all the cranks
in the community, and you are fining a
man $200 for killing a hen in that way.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It should be worded
so that the people will understand it and
conform to the law.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I do not think
the first part of paragraph a, is the only
part that is open to abuse or censure.
The honourable member for Ottawa suggests that it is left to every magistrate
to put his own construction on the Act.
The latter part of this section says:
Any animal to be subjected to any operation
which is performed without due care and
humanity, or, being the operator, does not
when practicable and possible use some general
or local anesthetic of sufficient power to prevent such animal from feeling pain when so
operating.

This introduces rather a new principleto give an animal an anesthetic. It is a
very common practice in the country to
dehorn cattle; it is actually necessary. It
may cause some pain, but it saves a great
deal of pain later on, because it enables
you to put a large number in an enclosure
and winter them without harm, whereas
if they had their horns on they would

magistrate might raise the point that it
would be illegal to dehorn cattle without
giving them some local anesthetic, which
I think is absurd.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I move
that this whole section be struck out.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton was agreed to.
Sections 16, 17, and 18 were agreed to.
On section 19-reading deposition on
preliminary enquiry:
What is the
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
change in that? I would like to understand the difference between the old provision and the new one.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Sections
682 and 683 provide that evidence of witnesses shall be read over to them in the
presence of the accused and signed by
them, unless the evidence is taken in shorthand. The amendment is to make section
684 agree with those foregoing sections.
It simply reconciles section 684 with the
others.
Section 19 was agreed to.
Sections 20 and 21 were agreed to.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

On section 22-conviction of keeper
prima facie evidence of premises being a
disorderly house:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What is the change
there?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is to
avoid the necessity of proving that a house
is a disorderly house where a keeper and
a number of frequenters have been arrested together, and the keeper has been
convicted; all you have to do is to establish
that the keeper has been convicted of
keeping a disorderly house, and it establishes the other.
I do not know
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
about that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It only
means prima facie proof.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The keeper ought
to be permitted to reform, but this would
seem to indicate that he could not reform.
He might be having a prayer meeting there
that night.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
he could prove that he only had a prayer
meeting.
Section 22 was agreed to.
Section 23 was agreed to.
On section 24-offender under suspended
sentence may be placed on probation:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It is moved
that the following be inserted after section
24, as 24A:
Paragraph a of section 1140 of the Act la
amended by adding thereto the following subparagraph:
(iv) any offence relating to or arising out of
the location of land which was paid for in
whole or in part by script, or was granted upon
certificates issued to half-breeds in connection
with the extinguishment of Indian titles.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
does all that mean?

What

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The intention is that if a prosecution for an
offence is not brought within three years
of the date of its commission, then it is
proscribed. There is no provision for that
in the Code at present.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: From the reading
of the clause I did not grasp what the
offence really is.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
brings it into section 1140 in the Code,
which deals with the limitation of actions.
There have been one or two cases brought,

JUNE 1, 1921
going back twenty years, claiming that
fraud was committed. Of course, the
evidence in connection with them would
have disappeared long ago.
Section 24A was agreed to.
Section 25 was agreed to.
On section 26-chapter amending section
118 re having firearms, etc.:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would like to
know what this is. Are we repealing an
amendment we passed in 1919 to section
118?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that was repealed by implication.
This is a substantive repeal, so that there
will be no doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have not found
the reference.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It is in the second
Session of 1919, chapter 12.
Section 26 was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Going
back to section 12, I move that the section
be made to read as follows:
.Evereyone 1s guilty of an Indictable offence
and liable to two years' Imprisornment who wilfully and for any fraudulent purpose burns any
chattel having a greater value than twenty-five
dollars.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would move
in amendment that the clause be stricken
out altogether.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Oh, no,
we do not want that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is section 510
of the Code. My amendment is moved on
the ground that there is already a provision in the Code covering this-section
510E, as follows:
E. To two years imprisonment. if the object
damaged is any property, real or personal,
corporeal or incorporeal, for damage to which
no special punishment le by law prescribed,
damaged to the value of twenty dollars.

Exactly this case, except that the amount
is $20 instead of $25. I submit that there
is absolutely no ;necessity for this amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:.
I
would point out to my honourable friend the
peculiar drafting of section 511 in the
Criminal Code dealing with arson. I doubt
if one could establish an offence without
this. Section 511 is:
Everyone l guilty of the >ndIctable offence
of arean and Ehable to imipriaontent for M@fe
whot wlltuly selts fire to any building or stutiure, etc.

Now, if a man wilfully . sets fire to a
building which he may not want, and it
would not endanger property, it seems to
me that he would come within this section. My honouraible friend will see that
the offence dealt with in section 12 must
be fraudulent.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Then it would be
better, to amend sedtion 511 of the Code,
because the offence is wilfully burning anything. I might own a building and might
wilfully burn it, and yet I might be brought
under this definition of arson.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
construction of it comes up in this way,
that it has been suggested that we strike
out the word "unlàwful," because my honourable friend from Hamilton has pointed
out that to do a thing unlawfully is rpot
necessarily a criminal offence.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not think we
should make any change at all, because
if it is fraudulent and damaging, surely
that is sufficienit; it 1s already in the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But under the language of the Code it need not
be done fraudulently.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
my honourable friend quite gathers what

Why they put in the word "mischief" I
do not know. There is nothing said about
automobiles, and I suppose it was to deal
with then.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, we
are not specially legislating as to automobiles.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But you have a
clause that covers any case that is not
otherwise provided for, so it must cover
this.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
my honourable friend will find that "mischief" has a peculiar signification in law.
If it were not so there would be no necessity for section 511. The Code specifically
calls it mischief. Now, the diesire is to
amend the arson clause, which ls 511. If
you burn a building down you are liable
to life tnprisonment, and they say that if
you should burn a property with the same
intention, te get insurance, you are liable

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is far more

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If the
honourable gentleman will look at the Code,
he will see that section 510 says: "Everyone is guilty of the indictable ofi'ence of
mischief," and that section 511 says,
"Everyone is guilty of the indictable
offence of arson." If I had "Russell on
Crimes" I think I coulýd show the honourable gentleman the distinction.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It might
not be a more serious offence; but the
penalty is life imprisonment.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The
Attorney General is apparently of the
opinion that these people cannot be indicted under the mischief clause; and to
provîde a penalty under the arson clause
cannot do any harm.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In this Bill you
are imposing a penalty of fourteen years.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Two years.

amended by inserting therein the provisions contained in Bill B of the Senate,
an Act to amend the Crimingl Code, so as
to provide for the revision of excessive or
inadequate punishments.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: This is in accordance with a Bill which, after f ull
consideration, was passed by this House on
three separate occasions. The Bill was
sent to the House of Commons. The first
time I think they did not reach it; this
Session, the first reading was moved, and
the Minister of Justice said he desired to
consult with the Attorneys General of the
different provinces. I am now moving an
addition to the Criminal Code which, in
effect, is the samne as the Bill passed by
this House. I do not think there is any
objection to it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What particular
part of the Code would it come under? Its
position in the Code may be important.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Mr.
Gisborne will see that it is put in its

IMMIGRATION

BILL

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
139, an Act to amend the Immigration Act.
Hon. Mr. Thompson in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
ask permission to bring within the Bar
Mr. Blair, of the Immigration Department.

JUNE 1, 1921
On section 1-port of entry, etc.:
Hion. Mr. BOSTOCX: Are these just
âmendments to the definition clause of the
Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, to
the interpretation clause.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-board of inquiry:
Han. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend, I think, was going to, give us some
information as to the neýcessity of establishing these boards of inquiry.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As the
law stands at present, only one board of
inquiry is authorlzed at any port. With
the more rigid examination now being followed, one board will flot; be sufficient
promptly and, expedîtiously to handie ail
cases, and honourable gentlemen wiql appreciate the necessity of speedily sending
immigrants forward to their destinations.
The amendment provides authority for the
creation of any numiber of boards that
xnay, be necessary to carry on the work.
The amendànents to sections 15 and 16 are
grammatical changes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Referring to
paragraph 4 of clause 1, defining "immigrant station." Is it the intention of
the Department to, create stations at the
ports of departure,. or are they to be

it stands at present. It 'says:
in ail such cass such board of inquiry may

Section 5 was agreed ta.,
On section 6-costs of appeal ta be paid
by unsuccessful appellant:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I object ta this clause. It is a well-recognized
principle that the Crown neither takes
nor gives costs; -and unless the Crown is
liable for costs the appellant should flot
be nmade hiable for them.
Why should
a poor man, because he is put out of the
country, be Hiable? I do not think that
the Crown should take costs. I move that
the clause he struck out.
Hlon. iSu JAMES LOUGHEED: As the
section stood, the Department was unable
ta charge ta the passenger the cost of
telegranis, telephone messages, special investigations, etc., growing out of the appeals.
Very often the appeals incur- a
considerable telegraphic correspondence- in
order ta reach a prompt decision. Relatives or friends living in variaus parts of
Canada have at times ta be communicated
with.
There seems ta, be na good
reason 'why the Department should have
ta pay such costs for a class of peopla
whose ability ta comply with the immigration regulations is in doubt. Why
should the Government have ta pay the
expense of people whose coming inta Canada is cantestedi. It is apparent that the
Gavernnient has been under considerable
expense in enforcing the Act against them,
and that they are in a position ta pay.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH--STAUNTON4:
Then
why should it nat be reciprocal? If the
mnan succeeds in bis appeal, why, shauld he
nat be paid bis costs? If a persan
properly cornes into Canada and, is harassed
by the ýGovernment of Canada, and put ta
a great deal of expense, but succeeds in the
appeal, why should he bear bis own expenses? And if the Crown succeeds, why
should it get costs out of hlm?

officer in charge, or the officer in whose custody
the appellant may be, and shall at the same
time deposit with such officer the sum of twenty
dollars for himself and ten dollars for each
chiid or other person dependent upon such appellant and detailed with him. such sum to be
used for the purpose of defray.ng the cost of
maintaining the appellant and those dependent
upon him, pending the decision of the Minister

on such appeal.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is what we
are adding now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes"and the cost of such appeal." Let me
complete it:
In case of the appeal being allowed by the
Minister or by the Board of Inquiry on a rehearing, then the said sum shall be returned
to the appellant; and in case of the appeal being
disallowed by the Minister or by the Board of
Inquiry on a re-hearing, then the balance of
suot sum, if any, after deduction of regular
detention charges for board, shall be returned to
the appellant, and the appellant shall forthwith be deported. The cost of appeal means the
cost of such appeal to His Majesty, and in case
of dispute the decision of the Minister fixing
the amount thereof shall be final and conclusive,

It is not a court appeal. The costs are
simply the costs that the Crown will have
paid out in the matter, and we do not
exact any costs from the immigrant, except our actual disbursements in keeping
him. Why should he not pay those?
That
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
is all right, but you will notice that the
section provides that the man shall deposit
$20 for himself and $10 for each child,
and out of the $20 and the $10 the costs
may be taken.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No, it is only
the cost of maintaining him under the Act.
But
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
wait. He is liable for no more than the
amount he bas deposited. But under this
provision he is liable to an unlimited
amount, which is at the discretion of the
Minister. The Minister may make him pay
more costs than the amount be bas put
up; or the section is not necessary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Because bis board and that of bis family may
considerably exceed that.
If you
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
strike. out the words, "the cost of such
appeal," that is quite correct. And why
should there not be a reciprocal clause
there? This section is not inserted there
for nothing. It is to make him liable for
any more money that can be got from him
than the $20. If that provision is made,
certainly a man liable to pay costs should
receive costs.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUYGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wil*
the honourable gentleman tell me what costE
he should receive?
WhatHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Bless
my soul!
My
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
honourable friend knows that if the Crown
has costs of an appeal the defendant may
have costs of the appeal.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is it not an appeal
to the Minister?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
it is an appeal to the Minister. It seems
to me that my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) is confusing this
with the appeals which are usually made
to a court and which are taxed by a court.
But this is an appeal simply involving the
actual disbursements paid out by the Crown
on account of the contestation, the man
invoking his rights, under the Immigration
Act. Those .costs may involve a considerable outlay for board for himself and bis
family, for telegrams, and all that kind of
thing. The Crown could not pay to him
any costs. I do not know what costs the
Crown could pay to him.
He is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
entitled to counsel under the Act. It is
an appeal to His Majesty in Council, not
to the Minister. If the costs exclude legal
fees, I quite agree with the honourable
leader; but if they include legal fees, I
suggest to him that it is not fair.
They might
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
include the money expended.

two or three occasions, this Senate tfhrew

Immigration Act. I move thet we strike
out the clause.
Hono>urable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, having had some interest in
the Bill which was presented to this House
hast year, I wish to Trcali to the minds of
some honourable gentlemen that it was
suggested in the House last Session that
the speciýal Bill was brought; in rather because of nxy personal desire te see It .carried than because of its repreaenting a
policy of the Immigration Department;
although I said to the House at the time
that it was initiated, here because of pressure of business in another place. The
passing of this section would have the
same effeet as if the special Bill inteoduced
hast year had been enacted. The basic
principle is that a British- subjoot is entitled to a trial in accurdance with Brïtish
larw anmd justice ini any part of the British
Empire. I stand by that prinoiple, and
I hope that the Senate of Canada will not
do as it did last year-will not say In that
connection that a British subject is not
ontitled to a trial under the haws tihat

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: How does the
law stand to-dey?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That is right.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) has pointed out that, although
a British subject may emigrate to Canada
from England and become naturalized
here, yet if he commits some act which is
questionable or thought to be improper,
his naturalization papers may be withdrawn. I say, honourable gentlemen, that
is a very strange situation-that a man
who has been made a naturalized citizen
of Canada may have his papers cancelled,

in this country, surely, in the event of his
being charged with an offence, he ought

should not have his naturalization papers
withdrawn and be kicked out without a
trial.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: A British
subject does not have to be naturalized.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.

CAUSES

OF UNEMPLOYMENT

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. J. A. McDONALD moved concurrence in the second report of the Special
Committee of the Senate appointed to inquire into the causes of unemployment in
Canada. He said:
Honourable gentlemen, on the 4th of Ma3
last I moved:
That a Special Committee of the Senate bc
appointed to inquire into the causes of unemployment in Canada and to report to the Senatc
before the close of this Session with regart
thereto ; that such Committee shall have powel
to cali for persons and papers and that such
Committee do consist of the Honourable Messrs.
Blain, Bostock, Casgrain, Dandurand, Girroir,
Harmer, L'Esperance, McCall, Mitchell, Murphy,
Michener, Planta, Pope, Tanner, Turriff and
the mover.

The Committee considered, as the time
was short and the House would be rising
within the next few days, that they would
not submit any regular report, but would
file the facts of the investigation; but I
intend to present to the honourable gentlemen of this House a brief summary of what
the witnesses brought forth.
Our Committee had several meetings, and
great interest was taken, some of these
meetings running well after midnight. In
all, five witnesses were examined, from
whom much valuable information was obtained.
The three most important factors who
can make for the solution of this problem
of unemployment-the Banker, the Manufacturer, and the Workingman--were represented before the Committee by those who
could best speak with authority. The General Secretary of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, Mr. J. E. Walsh, spoke
from the point of view of the Manufacturer. Mr. Arthur Martel, the Vice-President of the Trades and Labour Congress of
Canada, expressed the views and feelings of
the Workingmen. Mr. Henry, T. Ross, the
Secretary of the Canadian Bankers' Association, threw much light on the general
situation of unemployment and made several timely suggestions.
Most useful and instructive statistics
were supplied and commented upon by the
well-posted Deputy Minister of Labour,
who, together with his Assistant, Mr. Odam,
attended all our meetings.

SENATE
2. As given by Mr. J. F, Walsh:
The rapid rise in all classes of manufacturing costs, which commenced with the
outbreak of the war, may be said to have
reached its apex in March, 1920. The result was a cessation of purchasing by the
public, naturally followed by a cessation
of purchases by the retailer and wholesaler. While the manufacturer was thus
without a demand in his home market,
conditions prevailing in foreign countries
left him without any possible export trade.
Such portion of the home market as remained was lost to the Canadian manufacturer through the dumping in this country of foreign goods, foreign manufacturers
preferring to sacrifice their goods in other
countries rather than disorganize the
markets of their own countries. This was
detrimental not only to Canadian manufacturers, but to all employees in our basic
industries and occupations which supply
our industrial concerns with their raw
materials.
A manufacturer bas no means of purchasing raw materials and of paying
wages except out of the sale of his goods.
If no sale is taking place his ability to pay
wages soon ceases, as the banks would not
advance him money to continue making
goods which would merely swell the accumulation already on hand.
The marked increase which has taken
place in freight rates is a most serious and
important factor in the stagnation of
business and the consequent unemployment.
If freight rates are heavy on tbe raw
material taken to the factory and on the
shipment of goods to the consumer, the
ultimate consumer will have to pay more
and will buy less.
Manufacturers cannot provide employment for more workers than are necessary
to make the goods for which they can find
sale.
There is no question that unemployment in the large centres, such as in the
whitewear manufacturing, bas been due
to the dumping of foreign goods in this
country.
If the difference between the cost of
manufacture and the cost of the manufactured article to the final consumer is so
great, a great deal of it is due to our present method of distribution.
The general impression both in Canada
and the United States seems to be that
there is at present a regular buying strike;
that is, people are waiting for a drop in
prices.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD.

Speaking ýbroadly, Canadian manufacturers at present are not making profit.
They have to take their losses, and they
are taking them as quickly as possible.
Some hands have to be laid off, but many
manufacturers are running half time and

3. As given by Mr. Arthur Martel:
There is no doubt that the cause of unemployment is the appeal of large cities to
farm labour during the last six years.
They were attracted by the high wages
paid in various places and in munition factories. Such strenuous appeals were made
to the patriotism of the people during this
awful struggle that all those who had any
feelings responded and went to work in
the munition factories. They got a taste
for amusement in the large centers, and it
Is quite a job to get them back to the
farms. Some of those men would rather
remain in large centers where they can
get only one meal a day than work in the
country, where they could get three2 meals
a day.
Many factors contribute to prev7ent men
returning to the farms. The farmer ha,l
the reputation in the past of not feedirg
and lodging his employees as he should,
and this reputation is still hanging over
him. Although conditions have been bettered in recent years, men will do almost
anything before they will take a job on
the farm.
Lack of work is chiefly caused by shortage of money. There is vlentv of money in
Canada, but it is not being circulated.
The workingmen of this country have
come to the conclusion that the reason why
people are not buying as much as usual is
due to the publicity campaign through
which all were made to believe that everything was going to come down and had to
come down. They are now waiting for
prices to come down before they will buy.
Under such conditions, firms cannot heln

should be brought to bear on the large
financial interests of this country, and
make them release capital which they are
holding back.
The arbitrary and unconciliatory attitude taken by a large number of employers
in refusing to deal collectively with their
employees in regard to adjustment of
wages and working conditions is another
cause of unemployment.

JUNE 1, 1921
4. As given by Mr. Henry T. Ross:
The causes of unemployment are outside
of Canada. The real source is in Europe.
Under the present conditions in Europe,
Engiand, our chief market perhaps, is not
able to carry on its usual commercial
transactions and pay us as when England
haed the trade of all Europe right at its
doors+. Thiis is what is behind the unemployment in Canada, the United States,
1
and England itself.
The high cost of materials, the high cost
of labour, the former being due in large
part to the high freiglht rates, are the
immediate causes of a great deal of the
stagnation at present existing.
It is a common report, and he believed
there is no doubt it is founded on fact, thai
the manufacturers have taken their loss,
and soid to the whoiesalers at low prices,
and that the wholesaler hbas lowered bis
prices to the retailer, but the. retailer is
still keeping up the price.
Railway rates are affected by wage
rates, and wage rates are caus'ing stagnation.
Now we will take up the remedies as
suggested by the Hon. Senator Robertson,
Minister of Labour. Hie suggests that we
should (a) endeavour to antteipate periods
of unemployment; (b) induce ail the
spending departments of the Government
to create employment at periods when it is

views of ail our returned men actually unempioyed when he said in bis letter of last
December to Mr. Rollo o! the Ontq;rio
Government: "The situation should be met
by the provision of work instead of the,
provision of relief." Our returned soldiers
are'not men to live at the soup kitchens;
they want work.
Remedies suggested by Mr. Aoland:
The Dominion Statistician receives returns frosn practicaily ail the leading
grocers in each city from a seiected list
as te the seiiing prices on the first of each
maonth. At one time he used te get the
cost ef production as well as the retail
prices, but the retailers proîtested and
raised se much commnotion. that this had
to, be abandioned. It is consequently very
bard te say whether the retailer is lowering bie prices in proportion to the reductien of prices charged te hian by the manufacturer and wholesaler.
Resuedies suggested by Mr. J. 19. Walsh:
It is aileged by somne that, if the proper
effort were made, exiport mnarkets could be

secured. But tihose who have investigated
the subject carefully hold out little hope of
any such change in the iminediate future.
The Canadian Manufacturers' Association did everything they could to absorb
the retunned soldiere as f'ast as possible,
but with no market for liheir goods they
can no longer give them employment.
It wouild be quite easy to investigate
whether or flot stagnation bas been caused
by excessive prices charged to, the consumer. An excessive profit from the wholesaler to the retailer, or from the retailer
to the consumxer would no doubt affect the
general question of unemployment.
Certain lines have came down se far as
the produter and manufacturer are concerned; stili they have net coame down very
much for the consumer. This remark spplies especially to the packing industry.
As to the reduction of labour and of
wages, it is a question of the ernployers
and enLployees comaing together and agreeing on a reduction and changes.
Reniedies suggested by Mr. Arthur Martel:
The slackness in the building trades cannot be attributed to high wages, because
the high cost of material is really responsible for this eiackness.
The rate of wages muet corne dow'n when
tihe cost of living has came ba>ck to normal
figures, but it should not corne down te the
level of rwages in 1918. Canadian workingmen were not receiving in 1913 the wages
that should have been paid them in order
that they m'ight maintain a Canadian
standard of living.
To start by reducing wages woiuld mean
starting the wrong way. The purchasing
power of the waige-earners would be reduced, and it would have the effect of kiliing business, instead of helping it.
W'ages were neyer increased, Senerally
speaking, more than 100 per cent, while
the price of commedities increased fromn
200 te, 300 per cent.
Although the wholesale, prices are coining down, the retail prices do not; seSm
to be reduced in the samne proportion.
The reduction of expense in maintaiiig
a family bas been absorbed by the increjased
rente.
If someone miuet make a sacrifice te,
stabilize conditions in our country, it should
be t2he one who bas something to Jose. If
you ask the labourer, who -bas hardly
enough to- live on, to tighten bis beît a
little more, yuu are asking 1,dm to do the
impossible. Hie ie not in a position te make
any sacrifice. It is those who have caipi-

tai that sh*ould make that sacrifice, because they can do it without affecting the
lives of their wives and children.
Private e4mployinent offices shou(Id be
aboliàhed and ail einployment offices coordinated under the Employment Service
of Canada. Labour could thus be systematîýcally distributed and reguýlated, whîle
the Canadian Goverument would at al
times be in possession of exact information as to the employment situation in
Canada.
Employment agencies in this country
should be under provincial governnient control, co-ordinated under the Canadian Government, so that there would be a clearing house to distribute labour Wfhere it is
wanted, and taken away frSm where there
is a surplus. There would be no compulsory feature about this. Ail that is
needed is more education and understanding, and mere common sense.
Instead of letting ail contracts at the
opening of the busy season, some system
should be devised whereby tenders would
be called for and contracts awarded in the
fali of the year, instead of the spring. This
woulld greatly relieve the situation during
the winter months.
With an efficient organization, public
undertakings could be regulated so as to
absorb many of the unemployed during
slack periods or periods when private
corporations and individuals are not in a
position to proceed with work.
A fair-wage clause should be insertod
in ail contracta awarded for supplies and
public works which are dîrectly or indirectly under government control. This
would prevent unfair employers from paying inadequate wages, thereby causing unemploynient by workers refusing to work
under those conditions.
Nine-tenths of the public works actually done in summer could be carried on
in winter.
A shorter work-day shoulýd be instituted
throughout Canada, in order to offer an opportunity for empioyment to a greater nuniber of workingmen. It would be better to
reduce the number of working hours, and
employ a greater number of men.
Some men get eîght hours a day of
work and others cannot get an hour. It
would 'be better tu have ail men workin
six hours a day, and no one depending on
public charity. This inight afford a means
of preventing unrest and tbe sowing of
radical ideas.
Collective hargaining should be înstituted
throughout Canada, with a view to cultilion. Mrr. MeDONALD.

vating better understanding between employers and employees. Much unemploy.
ment could be eliminated in this manner.
It is too early to ask labour to, agree to
a reduction of wages. when there has been
only a slîght reduction in the price of
commodities, practically offset by an additional increase in rents.
Workingmen do not like to create a prccedent in accepting a reduction of wages.
Once you start on that line, you neyer
know where it will end. If there was more
justice and conscience in business, the
proposai migbt be considered differently.
As it is, an employer may use this to try
to lower further the wages of bis employees. If one employer gets labour 10
to 15 per cent cheaper than anotber, the
others wiIl seek to reduce wages to the
same level. Workingmen are bound to resist any reduction in wages which will
affect their standard of living as Canadians.
Remedies suggested by Mr. Henry T.
Rosa:
If a manufacturer, or anybody else, ii
able to satisfy the bank that be can turnr
over bis product in a short tiWe and pay
back bis loan, the bank la ready to nieeL
him.
With regard to building operations, it
is not for bankers to finance permanent
buildings or tie up capital in perman-int
buildings. If builders cannot obtain mon -y
from the boan companies with which Fo
erect buildings, of course tbe bankers
will not make the interim advance.
Anything which lowers the cost of production will improve tbe situation, because
it will enable a better distribution of
money.
Retail merchants are facinýg a fal'ling
market.
They may be selling at prices
which the public think high, but they are
selling at a present bass in many instances.
From the bankers' point of view, it 13
of the utmost importance that the coat

should be a reduction in wages, in freight
rates, and in the cost of raw materials.

Our railroad system. I have no brief te

length on the railway situation, but I understand there is a strong committee from
the Maritime provinces now in Ottawa te

I would like te say this, however. When

why there appears te be a kind cf maudlin
worshipping bel ore the throne cf the
Canadian Pacific Railway. I do net understand why we cannot get behind our
own railway systems, and have more confidence in them. I have ne doubt there
are many difficulties connected with the
management; but while we own these
railways-and these liues are the greatest
assets we have in Cauada-why does there
appear te be ail ever the country a gejieral

have as goed railway men in this country
as 'can be fouud anywhere. Is there any
business in the country that could have

reconstruction and expect in a few months
to make a decent showing? The cry is,
"Give the railways back to private control." I believe in public ownership, .and
the condition of these privately-owned
roads shows that they are not aiways successful. I do net believe it needs a superman to conduct the Canadien Government
railways. I believe there are many business men in this country who are well able
to fill that position. It je, a question of
business-a question of big business. -If
we had confidence in our inanufacturers,
Our business men and our producers, and
perhaps a littie botter systemi of distribution, and weuld get behind our railways,

SENATE
SIR JOSEPH FLAVELLE

HIS NOMINATION AS PRESIDENT OF TH.E
GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS DIRECTORATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. C. EDWARDS: Honourable
gentlemen, what I am about to do is, I
know, entirely out of order; but I will
not proceed without the consent of the
House. The statement which I desire to
make is one which I consider of very great
importance to Canada. The urgent importance of it is my excuse for asking the
indulgence of this honourable House. I
have been thirty-five years in Parliament.
This is my thirty-eighth or thirty-ninth
Session. Never before have I asked the
privilege of making reference to any
rumors or to articles appearing in newspapers, or to matters of that kind; but
on this occasion, as I have said, the matter is of such urgent importance to Canada that I think a statement is desirable. My statement is suggested by two
newspaper reports-one appearing in the
Ottawa Citizen on Tuesday last, and the
other yesterday morning, and both referring to Sir Joseph Flavelle.
I noticed a few days ago that Sir Joseph
Flavelle had been nominated as a director
and president of the coming Grand Trunk
organization. Personally I was delighted
to see it, because I am aware of the capacity of Sir Joseph Flavelle. There are
those in various parts of Canada who have
rdiculed him because of the allegation,
which has been very improperly made, that
during the war period he was a profiteer.
Honourable gentlemen, I am in a position
to say that such is not the case: Sir Joseph
Flavelle did not profit to the extent of one
dollar because of his chairmanship of the
Imperial Munitions Board. It bas been
further suggested that he made an enormous fortune in his business during the war.
I am in a position to know differently. I
know that such is not the case. It is true
that his firm did a large volume of business, and on a small margin of profit did
at that time make an exceptionail amount,
as did al institutions of the same kind in
Canada and in other parts of the world;
but that the fortune which he possesses
was made during the war period is not
true. I may say here that his fortune is
not the enormous fortune that so many
Canadians suppose it to be. He is well off,
I admit, but that is due to the fact that for
many years he applied himself industriously and assiduously to the business which
he managed, and, like many other men in
Canada and other countries, he does enjoy
Kon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the results of hard labour and close application. But he should not be singled out;
he is not one of the toppers in Canada in
so far as wealth is concerned-nothing of
the kind. I could name, if I were perritted to do it, at least two gentlemen on
the opposite of the House whose wealth is
greater than that of Sir Joseph Flavelle's.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Name them, so
that we may know them. Monsieur Blondin?
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: I am in a position
to make the, statement here, honourable
gentlemen, that I know what the annual
profits of Sir Joseph Flavelle are, and that
only a small portion of that which he
possesses was made during the war period.
I am, further, in a position to state that
his old company, like many other companies
that were supposed to be making enormous
profits then, are losing money nowHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: -and that his
company lost heavily last year, and will
lose heavily this year. So that no reflection
in that respect can be made, and no reflection will be made by those who do know
the actual facts. It is easy to make irresponsible statements. It is a fact, honourable gentlemen, and you all know it, that
the successful man is looked upon reproachfully by many of his n'er-do-well friends,
men who do not apply themselves. The
wealth of this world is in the possession,
largely and almost wholly, of industrious
men, men who have applied themselves industriously all their lives; it is not in the
possession of speculators or any such class.
I think I have said enough on that subject. But I want to refer for one moment
to the question of qualification. Some may
say that Sir Joseph Flavelle, not being a
railway man, is not qualified for the situation. I think it will be agreed, honourable
gentlemen, that I myself, having spent
fifty-five years in actual industrial life in
the Dominion of Cariada, in a comparatively
large way, know something of the industrial conditions of Canada and of the
business men of this country, and I do not
hesitate for one moment to say this. He has
not had the training in that direction, and
I would not place him alongside of one
gentleman in Canada whom we know, who
climbed the ladder from the lowest rung to
the top because of his ability and experience; but the first qualifications are executive ability, industry, and application, and
I know of no man in Canada, nor have I

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, the report of this Committee, as
brougbt down yesterday, enumerated a
great many opinions that were advanced by
different gentlemen representing different
intereste as to the causes of unemployment,
and suggested remedies therefor. It je not
niy purpose -to go into the details 'of the
report, except, perhaps, to add one or two,
thouglits that I do not think were contained
in it, so that in considering the report the
House may have in mind one, or two other
features.
It was my misfortune ta have to be away
from Ottawa during the time the Committee
was taking evidence, and therefore 1 am
not wholly familiar witb it. But, having
had somne opportunity of being intimately
connected with unemployment and the
causes thereof during the past two or three
months, I felt conetrained to say a few
worde to the House upon this subject.
During the war period there was no
unemploymient in Canada; every man who
was willing to work had several opportunities to do so. But since about last October
the situation has been reversed, and we
are looking about and inquiring as to wbat
bas caused the changed conditions. 1
submit, honourable gentlemen, that there
is no one cingle cause for it ail; but there
are a variety of causes. First, nrny 'I
mention what I regard as the most important one? When prices are ascending,
whether prices of goods that people purchase generally, or prices on the stock
market or where you- will, everybody is
out to buy for fear prices will go stili
higher.
This wae the case up to last
July, when the top of the hili was reached.
When prices began to decline there was
almost immediately a slackening off in
purchasing of almost every commodity
that enters into the use of mankind in this
country, on the part of the public, because of the idea that prices were going
to go lower.
There je one commodity that
I may take as an example. People were
buying and hoarding sugar, at 25 cents
a pound,; but when it dropped to 12 cents
they would not buy a pound. That condition refiected itself on the unemployment
situation, and helped to create unemployCAUSES 0F UNEMPLOYMENT

as soon put at the head of the entire railway systemi owned by the Government, as
Sir Joseph Flavelle.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: Do nlot be
alarmed. Here is a point that I wish to
make, and thlsiis ew'hat I loo~k upon as serious. The present ie not a tinle to reflect
upqn that gentleman. What is the position

crùcial position? Is not Canada, in. fact,
in a serions position so far as her raihNiays
are concerned, as well as perhaps other
things? Ie it net desirable that in the circumetances, we should have the very best
man that je available in Canada for that
position?
Soine may criticise me for this statement.
In the situation in which Canada is to-day
it should not be a question of partyism or
politics; it should be a question of qualificati on; and I say again that lie has the
quality, and it je desirable, in the interest
of Canada to-day, that those speaking reflectively should do what they can to induce

finally deterniined, that he will accept the
position permahently; lie has only accepted
it conditionally. He je under a promise

if Canada succeeds in getting him to
accept the obligation, it will be againet
bis own will and against the will
of bhis family. When I said a moment

believe I am doing the strongeet thing that
I can possibly do to promote the interest
of Canada.

SENATP,

At a time when we have between 100,000
and 200,000 men in the country out of employment during the winter, why is it necessary for Canada to purchase from our
neighbours to the south $1,000,000 Worth
a day more than she seils to that country?
During the past year Canada purchased
in the neighbourhood of $900,000,000 worth
of goods from the United States, and paid
thereon in exehange alone more than $1,000,000. I submit that if ail the articles
which we can produce in Canada and
which we purchased in the United States
had been supplied by our own home manufacturers, our unemployed would have
been largely absorbed.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: Te what extent
was that quantity manufactured goods and
te what extent other articles?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 have not the
figures before me in detail, but there are
three main articles which we must necessarily ýbuy from our neighbours, namely,
steel, coal, and cotton.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
and cotton.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL:
obliged to buy $200,000,000

Not steel.
Iron ore, coal

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Why does not the
Government set us an example? Many of
the things the Government buys are Amenican-made.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not know
of any single instance in which during the
iast two years the Government has bought
an Ame-rican article when the made-inCanada article could have been obtained;
and I shouid be glad to have my honourable friend point out an instance.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The other day in
the House of Commons one of the memb-ers
pointed out that several of the articles distributed among the members were bought
in the United States.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Oniy lead-pencils.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Why is the
Grand Trunk railway buying American
coal?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Because the
Grand Trunk raiiway, cf which the State
is now the owner, possesses one cf the
iargest coal areas in the United States,
and is able to produce ceai at niuch less
than it weuid cost to produce it eisewhere.

Why were we

Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Why did the Gevernrnent raiiway raise the rate for hauiing
coal from the lower provinces te Quebec
city $3.80, and aiiow American coal te
corne in here te the extent of $200,000,000
in one year?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assume it
was because it was economical to do so by
reason of our supplies being so f ar away
from the centres of consumption. I am flot
finding fauit with the purchase of those
articles which we do flot produce in this
country; but when an ordinary Canadian
citizen goes into a retail establishment in
this country and asks for an article, the
dealer wiIl lay upon the counter an Amenican-made article. and it wili be purchased
in preference to a Canadian-made one. Go
into any drug store in this city and see
what wilI be handed out to you. I have
been looking into this question, and I know
that Canadians shouÏd ask for Canadianmade goods if the article desired is on
the market and is equal to the imported
one, but the people seem to be possessed
of the idea that an imported foreign-made
article is superior to the home-made one.
If that idea can be got out of their heads,
it seems to me it wiil do a great deai to
relieve the unempîcyment situation in this
country, and to enable our manufacturers
to produce and market their goods at iower
unit prices.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable friend will have te make inquiry of
the Board of Raiiway Commissioners for
that information. I am afraid, honourable
gentlemen, I shall fot be able to conclude
within the ten minutes allotted te me unless I arn permitted te proceed.
One other point net referred to in the
report, and which has a beaning on the
unemployrnent situation in Canada, is the
poiicy respecting labour which basheretofore been adopted by the agricultural interests of Canada. Our farmers generally
and airnest universally-and naturally
enough-think only ef their requirernent
for the season when they need heip. The
resuit is that every spring men are engaged
for a few rnonths for farm work, and when
the fali seasen cernes, and the summer 's
work on the farm is done, the stock is
put in the stable and comfortably housed
and fed for the winter, while the hired man
is turned eut te shift for himseif, and naturaily drifts te the cities, which find themselves burdened with the task of taking
care of hundreds of thousands of unern-

ployed who are asking for relief which
they should not require to obtain. That
situation is gradualiy remedying itself as
dairying and mixed farming are more and
more practised. Our farmers are finding it
rnecessary to provide reasonably comfortable house accommodation and to pay their
men for the entire year. If this is done universdlly At will relieve the situation during
the winter months. I may point to one province-it is nlot necessary to namne it-in
which during the past winter there were
more than 60,000 unemployed men, and
which. at the samne time had agents overseas to solicit and 'bring to this country
several thousand to place on the farma.
Those immiigrants will work for probably
$25 or $35 a month until next October, and
then will find themselves out of employment, and wili drift into the cities to be
maintained by the municipalities. That is
one cause of unempioyment, and the
remedy, perhaps, is obvious.
Another cause of unemployment nlot mnentioned in the report refera to the immediate situation. We have a greater unemployment problem to-day and more unempioyed men than perhaps ever 'before at
this season of the year. One of the reasons
for the situation is this. Last December,
when it was obvious that we were going
ta be confronted with considerable stagnation in business and unemployment, our
manufacturers kept employed as many men
as possible, at least part time, if they were
flot able to keep them working ail the time,
so that the men would at leaat be able to
supply themselves with the necessaries of
life. One industry employing 2,000 men,
which proposed to close down on the lst
of December, and to remain closed until
March 15th, because of the representations
made, realized that if everybody were to
do the samne thing we would have a terrible
situation on our hands. What happened?
That industry continued to manufacture
and to put the stock on the shelves, and it
worked the entire 'staff four days a week
ail winter. Hundreds of other employers
did the samne thing, ail hoping that with
the opening of spring a demand would
ari'se and that they would ho able to dispose of their g*ods, and they feit that they
had done good service to the country by
carrying on. But what occurred? Business
did not pick up in March and April, as
was anticipated, and many of those employers who made considerable sacrifices
te carry on their manufacturing industries during the winter montha, and kept

their men employed as far as possible,
found themselves unable to dispose of their
goods and unable to get extensions of
credita, because of having reached the maximum of thei r ability to borrow; and we
find them in April and May laying off men
who otherwise wouid have been laid off in
December,
January,
and
February.
I think it would have been better to have
had themn employed du-ring the winter and
laid off for a month or two than have had
the whole army laid off the entire season.
But that is one of the contri'buting causes
to the unemployment situation, and I submit that neither labour nor the employers
are responsible for it; it is a general situation that is far wider than the confines
of our own country. I think the econosnic
aspect of the causes of unemployment was
quite adequately deait with by Mr. Ross,
the secretary of the Bankers' Association,
in bis evidence before the Committee, and
I will flot dwell upon it; but the points
that I have tried to bring out briefiy were
not deait with in the Committee's report,
and I thought it proper to bring them to
the attention of the honourable members
of this House, so that in giving consideration to the Committee's report they might
consider also the points which I think
might have been properly included. in the
report, but were nlot.
lion. N. CURRY:
Honourable gentlemen, petiods of prosperity and periods of
depreasion have followed each other for
centuries, and probably will do so for centuries to come; and so far there has been
no man and no body of men with vision
enough, wisdom enough, or power enough
to prevIent those periods of depression.
A fter such a period has been upon us
for a length of time we can form a pretty
good idea of its main causes. The present
depression, I suppose we could say broadly,
is the resuit of the war. That 1 think is
actually the tru-th as far -as Europe is concerned, but I do not thînk that is the main
cause of the depression on this continent.
We ail know that the United States and
Canada during the war supplied enormous
quantities of raw materials and coinmodities of every kind to the Allies on thé
other aide of the water, and received for
them enormous sums of money, and no
doubt to-day both Canada and 'the United
States are richer *by far than they were
before the war. That being the case, it
would seemi that we ought not to have this
depression. In my opinion we would not
have had it if the United Statua Govern-

ment had not taken the railroads out of
the hands of their owners, who understood
them, knew how to manage them and did
manage them well, and were carrying both
freight and passengers at lower rates than
were obtainable in Europe, notwithstanding that they were paying higher wages.
Although the United States Government
had previously refused even small additions to the freight and passenger
tariffs of the roads-which additions were
absolutely necessary, and had been so for
some years-they no sooner had taken the
roads over than they gave enormous inFollowing this, they

had to increase very largely the freight
and passenger rates. Not satisfied with
that, before many months had elapsed,
owing to the clamouring from the various
labour unions connected with the railways,
an additional and very large increase wasgiven, and was made retroactive-a very

instance, in the terminals of the big railways, and also in towns of any considerable size, they have yard-limits and yardIf
masters and shunting engine crews.
those crews go outside of their yards even
for half an hour they get a full extra day.
A shunting crew might start in Montreal
to-day with a yard-limit of such and such
dimensions. In a rush somebody might want
a car or two or three cars placed at a factory outside of the limits. The yard-master,
wishing to help his train crew, would send
them off to do that shunting. If the crew
were gone only half an hour, it counted as
an extra day. In the afternoon they might
be sent off for another half hour or hour,
and that counted as another day; so that
in many cases men who worked twenty-four
or twenty-five days a month, and did not
work hard, were able, through this abuse
of overtime and.yardage, to earn anywhere
from thirty to forty days in a month instead
of twenty-four or twenty-five days. The
same thing applied, perhaps to a less degree, in the case of the regular trains.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Where did that
occur?
Hon. Mr. CURRY: I can get you the
particularà.
Hon. Mr. CURRY.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
where.

It occurred every-

Hon. Mr. CURRY: On the special freight
trains that abuse crept in to a very large
extent, because they could dawdle along
and come in a few hours later than they
were expected, and get extra time. To
some extent it applied also on the regular
freight and passenger trains; if they arrive
beyond a certain time they get extra time.
When all this came about, it simply meant
that all other classes of labour, both manual
and clerical, set that up as a standard.
The McAdoo wage scale was talked of
everywhere, and if a man was a carpenter
or a mason or a plumber, or whatever he
might be, he wanted wages that would
measure up to the McAdoo wage scale for
railway men; and to a very large extent
they carried their 'point. That even went
farther than this continent; it was applied
more or less on the other side of the water.
That, of course, meant that the wage bill of
our' Canadian railways was increased
enormously, and, owing to the increase of
wages in the allied trades, everything the
railways bought-the rolling stock, the
steel, the coal, everything into which labour
enters-went up in like proportion, and
it was simply impossible for them to make
both ends meet, notwithstanding that they
got large increases in their freight rates.
Those conditions are operating to-day. It
is supposed that on the lst of July the
American railway wages will be reduced 12
per cent, which is very little, and we do not
know that they are going to do away with
those other abuses of overtime, yard limits,
etc. But even the reductions they propose,
meaning $400,000,000 to the United States,
will probably mean $40,000,000 to Canada,
which will be a very great help; but it is
really not enough. I say that that position taken by the American Government in
handling the railway situation is the real
cause of the period of depression that we
are now passing through. But, even with
the higher prices, the labour unions are
calling for further strikes, and I might say
that to-day, when I went down to the hotel
to get my luncheon, there was a big delegation there, with Mackenzie King at its head,
ready to go in, but the waiters and cooks
had walked out of the hotel in a body, so
that I do not know whether the guests would
get any lunch or not. But that incident
shows the unfairness of these labour organizations, for I do not think there is a good

CANADIAN

NATIONAL RAILWAYS

TIHIE PROPOSAL OF LORD SHAUGHNESSY

The Senate resumed from May 11 the
adjourned debate on the notice of Hon. Mr.
David:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the letter of Lord Siaughnessy re solution
off the Canadian National Railway difficulties
and inquire whether the Governinent intend to
take action in regard thereto.

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I hesitate to take the time of this
honourable House in the closing days of
the Session further to discuss the railway
transporation problem.
I am afraid that we have not yet sufficiently recovered from our war-time mentality to be able to appreciate how
nuch the future of this country may
depend upon the solution of that problem. As was very properly said by His
Excellency the Governor General, the other
Hon. Mr. CURRY.

day at Toronto, this country bas been lulled
into a sense of security financially which
is not at al1 justified. Who of us, for
instance, has stopped for a moment to
realize what portion of the tax he pays,
directly or indirectly, on everything we buy,
or, which should be much more striking,
what portion of our individual income,
varying from four per cent to 75 per cent.
which we pay yearly into the Government
exchequer, goes to fill up the gap which is
made by losses in Government railway
operation? If we do not stop to realize
the situation, I am very much afraid, for
my part, that before long not only the income will be required, but the principal
itself will have to be mobilized: if the
rate at which the hundreds of millions of
dollars are voted by this Parliament and
spent from the commencement of the year
to the end is continued, I am very much
afraid that the country will be unable to
stand it much longer.
At page 1 of Lord Shaughnessy's memorandum, which was placed before Parliament, he says:
Canada has now about 40,000 miles of railway lines. Of the lines included in this mileage
approximately 37 per cent earn annually sufficient money to pay ail interest charges and
to give a return on the share capital ; 54 per
cent fail to earn enough to pay their working
expenses and are consequently operated at a
loss; and 9 per cent earn interest on some of
their major securities but have nothing to apply
as dividend on the share capital. Included in the
last mentioned is the Grand Trunk Railway
System.

Further on he says:
With the ownership or control of the Intercolonial, National Transcontinental, Canadian
Northern, and Grand Trunk Pacific lines vested
in the Dominion Government, the Canadian
people are now the proprietors of about 17,000
miles of railway, with a capital investment of
say $850,000,000, and an annual interest charge
of something like $34,000,000.
in the annual
interest charges nothing is included for the
Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island Railways, because these have been wi.th us for so
long a period as unproductive and expensive
property, nor for the National Transcontinental
absorbed in the Consolidated Fund.
There is no roUling stock equipment nor are
there terminal yards, freight faciliti.es, repair
shops or other requirements commensurate witb
a system of this magnitude, and the cost of
providing them will be very great indeed.

Then he goes on:
According to the brief return submi-tted to
Parliament a few days ago the operating revenue of the Canadian National Railways, including the Grand Trunk Pacifie, for the year
1920 was as foilows: from passengers, $23,71.,834 ; from freight, $90,982,832. The train
mileage required to earn this money was as
follows: passenger
trains, 13,322,587
miles;
freight trains, 24,485,286 miles. In the same
period Canadian Pacifie earned from passengers

JUNE 2,.1921
$49,125,738 ; and from carrnage of freight, $145,308,399, with passenger train mileage 20,538,038, and frei.ght train mileage 26,281,627.
It will be gathered from these figures that
the train mileage on "the Canadian National
System 4is out of ail proportion to the revenue,
taking the Canadian PacLflc as a standard.
Were It possible to effeet a reduction In train
mileage on the National System to make the
ratio of train miles to earnings same as that
on the Canadian Pacific, the, saving in transportation alon-e would represent upwards of
$22,000,000 per annum. This, however, is out of
the question because, whlle there might be a
substantial shrinkage of train mileage without
senlous public inconvenience, the great mlleage
of the National Systein to be served and the
limited trafflc available prevent a proper relation between traffic and train miles.
It is to be observed, however, that the Canadian Pacific handle-d traffic representing revenue
71 per cent in excess of the Canadian National,
with an additional cost cf transportation of
only 13 per cent. This Ls accounted for to saine
extent by the greater expense per train mile
for transport on the National System. In this
unit of operating expenses there would bave
been a saving of about $6,500,000 if the Canadian Pacifie basis had been reached.

I cite that portion of the memorandum
to serve as a basis of some arguments
which I propose to offer to this h.onourable
buse. 1 take these statements not as implying a criticismn on the part of Lord
Shaughnessy of the Canadian Northern
Railway system or the way the Government railways are operated, but merely as
pointing out the inevitable resuit of the
conditions in which the system bas to be
operated.
I obtaijed from the Government on the
l7th of May a statement which throws a
good deal of light on this matter. My
motion was for a statement showing:

As regards the Canadian Northern Railway system, the deficit on operation for the

$24,319,956; the total deficit being $40,043,830.
The total indebtedness of the

$233,800,738 is to the Dominion, on which
no interest was ever paid, and $392,324,02-5 to outsiders.
As regards the Canadian Government
railways, the deficit for the samne year
was $9,778,070. The Government is out
of pocket $446,111,945 for these Government railways.
As regards the Grand Trunk Pacific railway, the deficit for the saine year was
$5,555,518; the fixed charges $8,524,424,
making a total deficit of $14,079,942, with
an indebtedness to the Government of $137,251,732. These figures give for the year

been unable to make up the actual present
indebtedness of the Grand Trunk Railway
Company; but I find, from the figures given
by the Company at the time of the acquisition by the Government, that the indebtedness as of the 3lst of December, 1917,
amounted to the sum I have just mentioned and exclusive of $216,253,111 owing
by the Grand Trunk Pacific and including
the $137,251,738 already mentioned.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Does not that amount
include the common stock of the Grand

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
No. It includes
the debenture stock which carried a fixed
dividend, but it does not incl'ude the comnmon stock.

as $16,258,579. The deficit on the Canadian Government railways in 1919 was $7,548,824, and in 1920 it had risen to $10,449,876. The deficit of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie in 1919 amounted to $6,292,949, and
in 1920 it rose to $10,134,513. The total
deficit for 1919 was $20,313,620, and in
1920 $36,842,970.
The Minister of Railways and Canafs said:
That was just the operating deficit, and ta
that you have ta add the fixed charges on the
Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, totalling in 1920 $33,488,764.71, and ln
1919, $27,928,925. Now, If you add the operating dedIcit and fixed charges-and ail this
information will be found on page 1052 of
Hansard-for the three systems; the Canadian
Northern system,
the Ganadian Government
and the Grand Trunk Pacifie, the total for 1920
amounts to $70,331,734.88, as against $48,242,536.65 in 1919.

Mr. Fielding: That, 1 suppose, would include everything except interest on the original
Intercolonial capital?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, and on the Transcontinental.
Mr. Sinclair (Guysborough) : When you speak
of the Canadian Goverament systein, do you
mean the Intercolonial
and th4e Transcontinental?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Tes, and the branch lunes
that are attached to the Intem-olonlal.
Mr. Fielding: Including the Prtnce Edward
Island Railway?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Tes.

In the saine n-umiber of Hansard, on
'page 4443, you will find that the House
of Commons voted an additional amount
of $89,687,633, and on page 4464 that they
voted another amount of $26,000,000.
If
everything was taken into consideration
the total figure wou*ld represent much more
than two billion dollars.
In the face of the magnitude of the interest at stake it is no wonder that a man
like Lord Shaughnessy, who is the best
qaalified to judge of the situation, felt it
bis duty to give the benefit of bis advice
to the Government and to the country.
After saying at the bottom of page 7 of
bis printed memorandum:
The situation is a serions one and almost
hopeless unless some plan can be devised tliat
will promptlY and effectively bring to thia
National Railway System additjons.l financi
slrength and sustenance.

-His Lordship calîs attention on the following page to the fact that with but
one set of shareholders the Canadiail
'Pacific Company forms really two separate
'entities, one constituting its railway
'system of over 14,000 miles, with lake,
river and Pacifie coast steamship lines, express and other accessories, and the other
made. up of its ownership in railway companies in the United States, its ocean
steamship lines, lands, mining and other
interests. An'd he proceeds:
If by some arrangement with the Company
these assets could be segregated and the railway property added to the Government Systemn
that I have Just described, the Systeni would
comprise 31,000 miles of railway with a considerahie number of parallel Uines unimportant
or useless.
The consideration. to be given the shareholders of the Canadian Pacific Company in
exehange for the properties above defIned
would, I imagine, be in the nature of an undertaking by the Goyernment of Canada to pay to
the shareholders in perpetuity a fIxed annual
divi.dend on the share capital, te be supplemented by a further Iaymnent when the whoie
property was yleldlng a specîfied return.
There would be no motive for selfishness, if
such a thin-g were possible ln the circumstances.
The income on t-heir shares being fixed and unchangeable, excepting as above provlded, the
Canadian Pacoific shareholdere could receive
ne advantage from prerferential treatment given
to any particular portion of the Railway System. The Directorate wotkld have every incentive
for wise, prudent and business-ilke administration.
0f course there are many details that would
have te be worked out, but it is not; necessary
to refer ta them here.

It will be noticed that Lord Shaughnessy's suggestion is based on the necessity of avoiding duplication, of saving a
very large amount of expenditure in the
purchase of rolling stock equipment, in
acquiring and building up terminal and
other facilities already possessed by the
C.P.R. Company, reducing the cost of
operation; having in effect Governient
ownership without Governmeunt operation
and thereby ýelimin.ating the -danger of
political in-terference, and extendingl to
the whole railway system of Canada the
benefit of the management of the C.P.R.
It is obvious that a very large saving
;would be effected.
There is another point to, which I wish
to caîl your speci!al attention: -the demoralization of labour which is inevitably
the result of Governiment operation. Experience in every country has shown, that
Governments will flot receive fromn their
employees the same service as private individuals or private companies will receive. I find f rom the railway etatisties
that in 1919 there were no less than

SENATE

742

158,777 railway employees in Canada. If
the larger portion of those employees are
to be Government employees, not only will
the efficiency of these be impaired, but it
will tend to affect also the efficiency of
like employees on the C.P.R.
Another important consideration which
must not be lost sight of is the settlement
of future labour troubles. The Government must be maintained in a position to
intervene between capital and labour when
necessary. How will it be able to do so
with the necessary influence and authority
when the strike is directed against the
Government itself?
As to the advantage to be derived from
the association of the C.P.R. management
and staff, I submit that the advantage lies
not so much in the fact that such or such
persons may be members of the Board of
management, but rather in the value of
the staff, of the experience acquired and
built up during the past thirty or forty
years, and the incentive which will naturally remain in both the Board of
management and the staff to maintain in
the future the same standard' of efficiency.
Of course, the larger the enterprise, the
greater is the importance of having at
its head the very best man 'that 'can be
found. But in this instance, whatever may
be the qualification of the person in charge
or of the members of his Board, failure
will be inevitable unless capital expenditure and cost of maintenance and operation are reduced to the minimum, which
in the opinion of Lord Shaughnessy cannot
be done if the Government railways are not
merged with those of the C.P.R. and Government operation avoided.
One of the main objections which has
been raised is that it would be creating
a monopoly. My answer, for what it may
be worth, is that it would be a monopoly
in which the public would be the party
mainly if not the only party interested;
that the main danger of monopoly, the
unduly raising of rates, would be prevented
by the Board of Railway Commissioners
of Canada. I may add that in public
utilities -experience has proved that after
all monopoly, coupled with proper control
by a Public Utility Commission, is better
than competition. Competition may bring
lower rates for a time, but if it involves
as in this case an unnecessary duplication
of plant, waste of capital and increased cost
of operation, lower rates will not endure.
The final result is always the disappearance of one of the competitors, or an
amalgamation followed by an increase of
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

rates to cover the losses suffered in the past.
I could ci-te, if it were necessary, a number
of striking experiences which we have had
in Montreal, such as that of the tramways,
the gas, and the power and light companies.
A second objection is entrusting the
nomination of the board of management to
the shareholders of the C.P.R. Companynot necessarily in perpetuity, but at least
for a reasonably long period. This I
understand is necessary mainily in order to
ensure Government ownership without Government operation, also to give to the shareholders of the C.P.R. Company, who under
the proposed scheme may be entitled to
some share in the profits, a better guarantee of good management. Of course, if the
management failed to properly carry out
its public trust Parliament would be there
to bring it to an end.
A third objection is the creation of an
interest of such magnitude that it might
become a menace to Pariliament. For my
part I would not apprehend any danger of
that kind. I am satisfied that the management would realize that any abuse of
power on its part or political interference
would be sure to arouse the country and
bring the trust to an end.
A fourth objection is the danger that the
majori-ty of the shares in the C.P.R. stock
may pass into the hands of foreigners.
That danger, it seems to me, could be removed either by entrusting the nomination
of a majority of the board to the Canadian shareholders, or by providing that, if
the majority of the shares were to pass into
the hands of foreigners, Parliament would
be at liberty to provide for another mode
of election. These are of course matters
deserving *consideration and for which I do
not attempt to offer a solution.
A fifth objection is the payment of a
fixed dividend to the C.P.R. shareholders.
The C.P.R. is in such condition of prosperity, and the association which it would
be invited to accept is on the contrary so
unprofitable, that the country can hardly
expect that any other basis of arrangement would be acceptable. Let us suppose
for a moment that the Governnent railway interest was owned iby a private company instead of being owned by the state,
could you imagine that the shareholders
of that private company would hesitate to
accept the association on the basis sugzested? It is too obvious to need elaborating. The same benefit will accrue to the
Governnent, with the additional advantage
of having Parliament as a guarantee

JUNE 2, 1921
against any abuse of trust. You have on
the one hand a gigantic enterprise which,
if opera-ted independently of the C.P.R.,
will require a very large amount of neNw
capital with the sure prospect of very large
annual deficits for an indefinite period.
You have on the other hand the C.P.R.
Company with its past brifliant record and
its equally brilliant future prospect; can
there be any serious doubt as to the advantage of the former in bein-g associated
with the latter?
As an exampile of what benefit that
Company may yet be to the country, let me
refer to what I may cail the valedictory
address of Lord Shaughnesày te the shareholders of the Company at the atnnval
meeting of May, 1918. He said in part:
After 1899 the oompany's traffic commenced
to show considera-ble growth, and the necessity

facilities and improvements of every possible

with the great expansion of business throughout the country; the demand for adequate facilitles became more pressing, and the records
show that in the years 1902-1914 inclusive the
Company expended for second tracks, reduction
of gradients, terminais, freight yards and facilities, workshops. machinery, and improvements
of every character chargeable to capital. $206,300,000, and for cars, locomoti-ves and other

Ilhat is a total of
equl¶,ment, $130,000,000.
$336, 300,000 for thirteen thousand miles.
If the 'railway system is 'to be kept
separate, with a mileage of seime 17,000
mile, what amount would be required in
terminal facilities and equipnient to answer
the purpose? Lt would not be $300,000,000,
but it would be more like $500,000,000 or
$600,000,000.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: 1 understand that
the Government state that if they take
over the Grand Trunk railway they will
have the necessary terminal facilities, and
thus obviate the necessity of going to any
expenditure in building terminal facilities
if they retained the Canadian Northern
systemi alone.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In Chicago, not
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: No, in Canada.
Hon. Mr. MEIQUE: I have nlot seen
such a statement, and if 1 saw it 1 would
not believe it. The Grand Trunk has facilities of a certain kind, to a certain extent, in certain places, but 1 know that the
facilities of the Grand Trunk are nlot equal
to the requirements of a systemi of such
magnitude. Lord S haughnessy's suggestion
is based on the necessity of reducing the
future capital expenditure, and of saving

743

in operation bY operating the two systems

as one. From Montreal to Québec or Ottawa
or Toronto or any other place, they would
run only such number of cars as would
bie necessary to accommodate the people
who must be carried.
It was stated by the honourable member
froni Brome (Hon. Mr. Foster) that if
Lord Shaughnessy were a young man it
would be wise to put him in charge. Today we have the honourable member for
Rideau (Hon. Mr. Edwards) submîtting
the namne of Sir Joseph Flavelle. Ail that
I know of Sir Joseph Flavelle is what I
have seen of hlm when hie appeared on two
or three occasions before the Senate, and
I must confess that I formed a very high
opinion of the ability of the man, and 1
have nothing to say against the praise of
that gentleman given by the honourable
member for Rideau. But to my mind this
is not -a question of one man. The conditions are such that I believe that no one
man can carry out the enterprise successfully if it is to be operated separately from
the C.P.U. The main advantage that would
be gained if -Lord Shaughnessy's suggestion were acted upon would be securing
the benefit of the efficiency of the staff
which has been built up in the course of
some twenty or twenty-five years-a staff
which is unique.
Hfon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the honourable gentleman discussed the advantage
that would accrue te Canada if there were
flot two companies formed-if the outside
holdings of the C.P.R. in the United States,
and the land, and the steamship companies,
wire aIl kept and operated for the advantage of the country? Would therè not
be a larger dividend paid?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 0f course, that is
merely a matter of detail. I do not intend
te enter into that question, because it does
not really form part of Lord Shaughnessy's
suggestion. Lord Shaughnessy's proposal is
stated on broad lines. He did nlot state
what would be a fair amounit to be paid to
the shareholders of the C.P.R. He did not
Iay it down as &~
necessary condition that
part of the assets of the C.P.R. should be
segregated. He suggested two things. He
suggested that it would be better policy for
the country and for il -parties conerned
to keep the Grand Trunk separate; andi le
was logical in suggesting at the saine time
that the railway lines owned or controlled
by the C.P.R. in the United States should
not come into the system. I know Lord
Shaughnessy holds most strongly the cou-

SENATE

744

viction that from all points of view it
would be very bad policy for the Government to own and operate railways situatedHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In foreign lands.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:- in the United
States; so he made that suggestion. But
he stated that his plan was laid down
merely on broad lines, the details being
left to be worked out.
I was dealing with the question of the
staff. I stated that it would be of great
advantage to the country to have the association of the C.P.R. with its staff. Now,
I would like again to refer to the same
address by Lord Shaughnessy, on May 1,
1918, in order to show what benefits may
be derived from the association of the C.
P.R. Several years ago the Canadian
Pacific had to accept, as part of the land
granted to the company, 3,000,000 acres
along the line west of Medicine Hat, in
what was then known as the semi-arid
district, where there was little or no water,
a very uncertain rainfall, and other conditions that made the land practically valueless. To recover this tract it was decided to adopt a plan of irrigation, and an
expenditure of over $15,000,000 was made
in the construction of the requisite works
and ditches in the eastern and western
blocks, comprising about 2,240,000 acres.
These lands, which were valueless, are today selling at over $50 an acre; therefore
their value to the country is over $150,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Ten to one. They
spent $15,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I say, these lands
are worth to-day $51, $53, or $55 an acre,
and, as there are 3,000,000 acres, they represent a national value of $150,000,000,
an amount much greater than the Canadian Pacific ever got from the country. It
received in railway works $62,000,000; then
it received $35,000,000 in cash, and 18,700,000 acres of land, including these 3,000,000
acres, the land being worth at the time $1
or $1.50 an acre. In that operation alone
the C.P.R. saved the country much more
than it ever received from it.
The company has done splendid work
in other respects as well. It has spent many
millions of dollars in research work, a
good part of which had little practical
result; in demonstration farms for the
benefit of settlers on the company's lands,
and others; in the introduction of better
strains of cattle, hogs, etc., and in other
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

works of a similar character. An outstanding accomplishment- was the rehabilitation
of the mining and smelting industry in
southern British Columbia, at a time when
the patience of the original investors had
become exhausted and the mining industry
was at a very low ebb. With its command
of capital the company was able to step
ii-to re-open abandoned mines; to acquire

and develop others; to enlarge enormously
the facilities for the treatment of ores;
and to inspire new life into communities
like those of Rossland, Trail and other
places in British Columbia. Of course, the
C.P.R., in making those expenditures, was
promoting its own interest; but the company felt also that its interest was common
tW that of the province, and when the company saw the crisis which had occurred
in the mining camps, it stepped in, and,
with its capital and influence, made a
success of the undertakings of several
companies that had come to grief.
Honourable gentlemen, in concluding
these.observations, which I am afraid have
been too lengthy, I desire to say this. My
suggestion is not that the proposal of Lord
Shaughnessy be accepted or that Sir
Joseph Flavelle's or anybody else's services
be retained or not. The interest at stake
is too great. What the country should do
now is what it should have done years ago
-get the best railway experts, from the
States or from European countries, or
wherever they can be found, place the
whole -situation before them, and ask them
to make a thorough study of it, and report.
Only then would the Government and
the country be able to judge as to what is
the best policy to adopt-Lord Shaughnessy's proposal or some other. It seems
to me that Sir Joseph Flavelle-if, as I
believe, he possesses
the qualifications
mentioned to-day-would not be disposed
te take the responsibility of operating a
system of that kind until what I have
suggested had first been done. Before the
final step is taken the country is entitled to
obtain the best advice that is available.
Hon. W. C. EDWARDS: Honourable
gentlemen, I thoroughly agree with the
views of my honourable friend as to the
desirability of carefully considering the
Shaughnessy proposal. To my mind it presents the most feasible and very best plan,
so far as Canada is concerned. I am firmly
of the conviction, however, that if that suggestion is not carried out-and I fear it will
not be carried out-and if Sir Joseph
Flavelle can be influenced to take the posi-

JUNE 2, 1921
tion, he will da exactly what my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Béique) bas suggested;
and I am convinced he will take the position
on no other consideration.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) if he has taken into
consideration the fact that the two systems,
Government ownership and private ownership, cannot exist simultaneously for very
long ini any country.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Il I understand the
question, it is whether or flot the C.P.R.
can be continued separately frorn Government operation?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Independentlywhether the two systems, Government
operation and private ownership, can exist
simultaneously in the samne country for
very long?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would not say
that it could not be done. As I have
already stated, I amn inclined to think it
would affect the interests of the C.P.R. sc
far as the question of labour is concerned.
However, I arn quite gatisfied that the
C.P.R. can continue its operation profitably,
even with Government operation of the
other systemn. As a shareholder or as a
director of the C.P.R. I arn not at ail afraid;
I amn satisfied thht the C.P.R. will continue
to operate its system of railways profitably.
Hon. F. L. SCHAFFNER: Honourable
gentlemen, I had not the slightest intention
of making any remarks in connection with
this great subjeet so late in the Session.
However, I rend over with great interest
the inquiries made by the honourable gentleman from De Salaberry with reference
to railway matters, and I have watched day
after day for the answers. I have been
exceedingly interested to-day in learning
the answers which the honourable gentleman has obtained and has this afternoon
placed on Hansard. I was interested because of the personality of the man by
whom the inquiries were made. I look upon
him as a business man who has had a great
deal to do with what is perhaps the most
successful railway corporation that bas ever
been in this country.
I ar n ot going to enter into a discussion
of the question. As I said before, it is 'toc
late in the Session. But I would like te
say right here that I do not know of any
better way in which the experienced business men of this honourable House could be

741

occupied next Session than in trying to
solve this most important question that we
have in Canada to-day.
The honourable gentleman said in his
address that he was impressed last n;ght,
when listening to the discussion in another
place, with the light-hearted manner in
which millions were voted. It dloes Qtrike
any mnan, not only the member of Parliament, but the man on the street, that as
the Session draws to a close vast amounts
of money are voted withoût much discussion. I have had a number of years'
experience, and have noticed in how short
a time millions have been voted for publie
works in this country.
If 1 understood the answer which lie
honourable gentleman gave me when 1
asked him the date from which he was g%
ing the expenditures in connection with
our railways, he said 1911. As I have said,
I do not intend to make any extende~d
remarks, but I desire to point out that if
we are to locate the responsibility for our
railway problem and the difficuit financial
position. in whîch we are to-day, we must
go back a long way beyond 1911. There
is an old "saying that there is no use in
crying over spilled milk, and it is true.
It serves no good purpose to hark back to
years gone by. Nevertheless, the responsibility dates away back beyond 1911.
The honourable gentleman from Rideau
(Hon. Mr. Edwards) made another statement with which -I absolutely agree-that
this problem should be solved entirely outside of party politics.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I agree with
that. But let me remind honourable genitlemen opposite, and honourable gentlemen
of this side of the House, that it is because of party politics that we are in.our
present position in connection with our railways; there is no question about that. Anf
I may tell my honourable friends opposÈtthat, however great the sinners have been

The men in another place passed those
votes. I understand that something like
$185,00,000 went through last night. That
is a great deal of money, I admit; but what
are they to do? The Government of the
day, or the new Government. if the Government changed to-morrow, would be
.obliged, to assume the responsibility, and it
is a tremendous responsibility. We must

746

SENATE

not too severely condemn the men in another place because they vote large sums
of money to meet the expenses in connection with the railroads. Canada is face to
face with a great problem, but Canada can
and will grapple with it. Let us do what
bas been suggested by the honourable gentleman who has just taken his seat (Hon.
Mr. Béique)-get the very best experts in
the worïd to help us, and lay this matter
before them and see if they cannot solve
the difficulty. I thoroughly agree with that
suggestion. I admit that I am no authority; that I speak as the man on the street;
but I have given this question some thought,
and it seems to me that if it were possible
to link up all the railways in this country
under one management and under one control of Parliament, it would effect a very
great saving. I will give just one instance
of a saving that could be effected. Between
this city and the city of Montreal sixteen
trains run each way every day. Everybody knows that such a practice is a waste
of energy and a waste of money. I heard
a gentleman the other day suggest that the
powers of the Railway Commission should
be so extended that it could control the
number of trains running. The Railway
Commission is an institution for which I
have the very highest respect. It was established by Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Government; but, in my opinion, if any body
bas given good and satisfactory service to
the country, that body bas been the Railway Commission. I do not know whether
it is within the power of Parliament to
carry out the suggestion of this gentlenan, but if it could be carried out I think
it would help to do away with the present
deficits, which I am convinced are caused
by the running of too many trains. I could
give other cases in which there are too
many trains for the business that is to be
done. I believe the number could very well
be cut down. That is one point that might
be taken up and considered.
In closing, I just wish to say that I have
listened with a great deal of interest to the
remarks of my honourabIe friend (Hon.
Mr. Béique). I wish to thank him for the
material that he bas put before the House
and before the country, and I hope that
this matter will be taken up in this Chamber at the beginning of next Session so that
we may get down to business immediately
and solve the problem in a businesslike and
proper manner.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What was the
population per mile of railways in 1911?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
I cannot
answer that question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The DraytonAcworth report, with which we are all
familiar, contains the information. I only
want my honourable friend to admit it.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
I cannot
answer the question, and I do not know
what good it would do if I could.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will tell the
honourable gentleman, because this harking
back is out of place. In 1896 the population was 300 persons per mile, and in 1911
it was 284-onfy sixteen less per mile.
What is it to-day? It is only 180 persons
per mile.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Is that any
excuse for the building of thousands of
miles of unnecessary railways?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly. Up
to a certain time the railways did not increase any faster than the population.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN:
Honourable
gentlemen, the honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) bas put
so many facts before us, and put them
before us so clearly, that there is very
little occasion for me to deal with any
phase of the subject which e bas touched.
The country is prepared to consider any
remedy for the problem which is so seriously embarrassing Canada, not only in its
finances, but also in that it is curtailing
the amount of money the country bas to
spend in the development of its resources
in the future.
The proposition which we are considering is, as far as my knowledge goes, unprecedented. In effect it is this: that it is
suggested to trustees that they should
divest themselves of the property forming
the trust and place it, substantially without reserve, in the hands of a corporation,
under circumstances the nature of which
makes it impossible for that corporation to
give adequate guarantees for proper care
in administration.
It is further suggested that this should
be done in the face of the fact that the
cestui qui trust bas become habituated to
various collateral advantages from the
administration of the property by the
trustees-advantagcs personal, incidental,
local, but all hurtful; and in the aggregate
so detrimental to the effective administration of the property by the trustees that
it is at present crippling the other activities of the trustees and threatens to
become a burden too great to be borne.

JUNE 2, 1921
Such proposition could only be made in the
face of grave difficulty, and made to a corporation to which the good will, the capacity and the integrity of its guiding spirits
had been completely proved. This, I think,
is not an unfair statement of the present
condition.
The Government of Canada is the trustee
of the people of Canada for the railways

demand of the people of Canada on the
Government for extension of these railways, for rates which are unprofitable, for
appointments on other grounds than those
of fitness for the position, have made it
impossible for untrained men holding their
positions by successes in elections, with
the constant fear of the molehill of tomorrow, which obscures the mountain of
next year, to so manage the railways of
this country that these railways are not
the gravest of menaces to the financial
stability and the economie well-being of the
Dominion.
It is not necessary at this stage of the
debate to go into details as to the unsatisfactory condition with which the Parliament of Canada has to deal. The income
tax depletes to its full extent the reservoir
of savings from which is to be drawn all
the Canadian money which can extend
existing industries and establish those new
ones for which there are so many opportunities, and yet all of the income tax and
more goes to make up in part the deficit
in the annual operation of these national
roads. It is not only annual deficits, but
the large sums required-150 millions
on the Grand Trunk in last year and this.
There are hopes, scarcely so flamboyantly expressed as when was debated in
these Houses the purchase of the Grand
Trunk, that an increase of population
would so greatly lighten the burden on
Canada that it would become negligible,
and the day does not seem near at hand
when the hope of the leader of this Hôuse
that we would soon have a completed railway system which would so attract the
financial magnates of the world that they
would make the Government of Canada a
handsome offer for it and so relieve us of
Meantime
the burden, will materialize.
all the revenues which Canada can raise
are needed to meet the obligations of the
country, and any surplus should be devoted
to aid in its development.
It does not seem an overstatement to say
that this problem of establishing the transportation system of the country on a sound

747.

basis is pressing for solution; and that
solution, if it is to be a permanent one,
must be based on sound principles. The.
sound principles I take to be that thosé, who
use the railroads should pay for their use
an adequate amount, and that amount
should be lessened, not by subsidies or deficits which are the equivalent of subsidies,
but by such effective management that the
economie prosperity of the country can be
heightened by giving the utmost value for
every dollar the people of the country pay
for transportation.' The proposition, again,
is unprecedented by the fact that, as far
as I know, no other corporation of a similar
kind could be taken as seriously worthy
of consideration as the agent of the people
of Canada, in such a task as is suggested
should be handed over to it.
In this I do not speak of the administrative succèss of the C.P.R. It is an extraordinarily well-managed road, but its reputation which would justify seriously
considering such a proposition as that of
Lord Shaughnessy is based on other qualities which its management possesses.
Those qualities are moral ones. One must
remember that the C.P.R. was a pioneer
among the railroads of this continent in
honest management, that is, in the fact
that fron its inception the interest of the
shareholder was paramount. It came into
existence at a time when many of the subsidiary operations of the railroad-its elevators, the express company, the teleand the steamships
graph company,
the property, not of the Rail-were
way Company, but of insiders connected
with the Company; when it was considered legitimate to take railway lands
and make money out of them. Nothing of
this kind ever occurred with the C.P.R.
A friend of his told me that when Sir
William Van Horne was a young man in
another railway he said that if he ever had
charge of a road there would be no sideshows. When he came to manage the
C.P.R. 'he found in his chiefs, Lord Mountstephen, Lord Strathcona, and Mr. Angus,
men who gave him free rein in carrying
out this object. He had then as his purchasing agent Lord Shaughnessy, and, if
the gossip of forty years ago be true, the
first resignation of a Director was because
Mr. Shaughnessy, as he then was, insisted,
and was supported by his superior officers,
that all purchases must be made solely for
the benefit of the Company. Lord Shaughnessy succeeded Sir William Van Horne,
Mr. Beattie has succeeded Lord Shaugh-

SENATE
nessy, and this sound principle has remained stable, and is now buttressed by the
-traditions of 40 years.
Hon Mr. CASGRAIN: It is not forty
years; they only got their charter in 1882.
Hon, Mr. McLENNAN: I do not consider myself under examination; however, I will say two score years. I think
the charter was granted in 1881.
It is well to pause and remember that it
is to this railway, a Canadian one, that
there bas come about a reform in the practice of the railways of this continent.
The management of the road has also
been able to inspire its employees with an
esprit de corps which is one of that road's
greatest assets. It was said that Napoleon
placed the baton of a marshal in the knapsack of every French soldier. The system
of the C.P.R. is such that everyone in its
service may feel that his success, with
reasonable good fortune, is entirely in proportioh to the ability and industry he displays.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And honesty.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: And honesty.
'The Canadian Pacific railway
has also
teen able to create a degree of loyalty
among its clients. I have been struck
over and over again ýby the way in which
people will go to considerable trouble to
travel on the Canadian Pacific railway or
to send a telegram over its line, when it
does not seem absolutely worth while.
The service must be good, or the people
would not do it; and they do it to an ex-traordinary extent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it not a fact
that on the old Grand Trunk railway
freight was handled better than on the
Canadian Pacific railway.
lon. Mr. McLENNAN: I do not know
enough about that to be able to answer.
A third and equally important factor
in the history of that Company is that
it bas shown restraint in its relations to
the public and in the returns to its shareholders. Lord Shaughnessy said in 1918
that from premiums on stock, from the
turning of earnings into equipment, and
into extensions, $143 in money was represented by every $100 in capital stock of
the Company. And, again, with relation to
the public, both freight and passenger
rates are lower than on any transcontinental system in the United States.
Again, having regard to the public
spirit displayed by the
railroad,
Sir
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN.

Thomas White, in speaking of the war
efforts of Canada from the financial standpoint, said that from first to last, through
the entire war period, the Canadian Pacific railway, to the limit of its great financial power, aided the British Government
and the Canadian Government in finding
money for the vast purchases made by the
Munitions Board.
Therefore one is justified in saying that
the C.P.R. is so skilfully managed that, if
any arrangement were made with them,
the highest degree of technical skill and
administrative ability could be placed at
the disposal of the new system; that it
is honestly managed; that it has been able
to imbue all the men it keeps in its employment with loyal devotion to the efficiency of the road, and to its reputation.
'Again, that ýit has not been avaricious;
that it continues to have in a needed
degree, but that degree less than when it
created traffic from a wilderness, the
creative ability to reach out for new business, a valuable quality with any body of
men undertaking to overcome the difficulties which face the successful solution of
the Canadian railway problem.
This sounds like the language of panegyric. It is a restrained statement. It is
borne out by current happenings. Proof
is given in the markets of the world. You
know how overflowing are the financial resources of New York. Honourable gentlemen know how severe is the strain on the
financial resources of London; how flotations have sunk to the vanishing point;
how industry is -disturbed in the United
Kingdom by the restrictions on industrial
credits; how great is the necessity for
Lombard Street to husband its resources.
Yet, if what I hear in the last few days be
true, the C. P. R. bas ibeen 'able to sell in
London a large amount of its 4 per cent
debenture stock-not only to sell it, but,
mark you, to sell it to give a better yieild
than a premier American raiway could
obtain for a recent loan on the New York
market.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
obtain?

What did they

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I hear about
6.40 as against 7.50. It was about one per
cent better than was obtained by the
American system to which I referred; also,
I am given to understand, with this difference, that a large part of the American
loan was a refunding, which therefore
made it more favourable than the proposition of the Canadian Pacific, which re-

JUNE 2, 1921
quired their money for future extensions.
As a shareholder of the C, P. R., I
certainly amrn ot anxious to have
the management of the road take on
any more problems than those which
arise !from the nmanagemenit and development of its own property. As a citizen of
Canada 1 would be glad if some arrangement could be miade 'by .which that organization, with its fine ideals, its esprit de
corps, its technical abi'lity, its genius for
discovering
and developing profitable
avenues -of expansion, could be placed at
the disposai of the people of Canada.
Two questions arise in connection with
this. One is: would those qualities and
capabilities stand dilution?
In other
words, could they be spread over the
14,000 miles belon-ging to the C.P.,R. and
the 17,000 miles belonging to the people of
Canada? I think 1 have used a wrong terin.
There would not be any dilution, but I
think there would be an accretion. The
men taken over from the other roads, having new scope for their ambitions, knowing
thiàt they belonged to a successful and not
an unsuccessful corporation, would measure up to the associates they joined. I
amn more confirmed ia this by having, since
1881, constantly travelled over the Intercolonial raîlway. In that time I have
neyer known a train hand otherwise thaii
courteous and helpful to passengers. I
have known splendid -men in every department of that railroad.
I believe there
would be no danger froni this source. Tht
difference which men of this class have
found between working for an enterprising
road like the C.P.R. and the Gover.nment
road, seems to be this: that the first consideration with the man of the enterprising
private corporation is to do the best possible for the road, with the assurance that
bis action will be commended.
Let me give a couple of samples of what
I mean. There is a junction point in Nova
Scotia, with Halifax sixty miles away, with
the Sydneys over two hundred, and, beyond the Sydneys, Newfoundland with a
considerable, population, a very considerable power of producing wealth, and
a population which it is extremely desirable to bind closely in the ordinary
affairs of daily life with the people of
Canada. It would seem obvious that no
successful private corporation would take
any other view than to encourage, by making convenient, trafic over the longer part
of the road rather than over the shorter,
particularly as the volume of the traffle
over the longer road is, I believe, much the

74ý

greater. This bas not been done by tha
management of the Intercolonial. I need
not weary the House with specific details.
Take another example.
Sydney is thc
third largest distributing- centre of the
Maritime Provinces. The number and
importance of its wholesale houses are very
considerable. A-large part of their trade
is import by rail, export by water; and
yet for years the Intercolonial railroad,
which is the highway between the whole
of this continent and that district, has
been wîthout a wharf at which vessels
could load.
Tiat wharf is abojut to be
built after many years of waiting, andi
built in response to the applications of
the public of Sydney,
One cannot imagine such a condition oi.
the line of a prosperous railroad.
The
District Superintendent would have pointcd
out the opportunity for increasing traffic
over the road if certain facilities, in this
case a wharf and warehouse, were provided. He would have kept this before bis
superiors; and, on the other hand, as soon
as bis superiors had given him the faciliities for which he had asked, he would be
told implicitly, if not in actual words, that
he wits bound to keep vessels at that wharf
and those warehouses filled. Successes of
this kind are found over -and over again
in the life history of the successful railroad- man, and I believe that a large part
of the personnel on the Government railroads would display this same resourcefulness and this same enterprise, if they
had the stimulus of working for s successfuI instead of for an unsuccessful organization, and the opportunîty to show what
was in them.
The only danger that I tan see, providecl
reasonable terms were made, is whether the
high standards of a system which gives
scope to the able and thp ambitious can
continue to endure; that spirit and that
scope in every walk of life is what bas
made 'Canada the country she is.
This is not a matter wbich must be
hastily decided; and in this connection I
may point out that the project of the one
extremely euccessful oeailway venture of
Canada, the C.P.R., was considered for a
long time by the people of Canada before
thecompany which carried it out was organized, and that all our failures have beeA.
rushed through.
There is, it seems to me, a parallel to
the present situation in the history of
Canada. In 1865 old Canada was face to
face with a political crisis of surpassing
importance. The whole of British North

SENATE
America saw before them difficulties :t,
carrying on as they were. The leaders of
all parties, political antagonists, typified by
Sir John A. Macdonald and Mr. Geore?
Brown, met together, and, sinking all local
and all partizan experiences between thein.
co-operated and wrought outf a constitution which has stood the test of half n
century, and has been the model for +'re
constitutions of other commonwealths.
Under this constitution the spirit of selfreliance among Canadians has found itself
unfettered by the British North Amerca
Act, which embodied the conclusions c .
that group of men.
I can see that the transportation problem
of Canada-the sound solution of which
is hampered by the vast spaces with which
we have to deal, the effect of the climate
in diverting to the ice-free ports of our
neighbour so large a proportion of the
traffic produced by our industries, the
burden imposed on us by our extravagant
expenditure on )railways--constitutes an
economic crisis scarcely less important to
the future well-being of Canada than the
condition with which the Fathers of Confederation had to deal. The sooner the
Government and Parliament of Canada set
about dealing with this transportation
problem the 'better. Delay in dealing with
it, or misdealing with it, cannot stop the
ultimate progress of this Dominion, but a
sound dealing with it will enhance immediately the prosperity of Canada. The highest
success cannot be reached by a partizan
treatment. The discussion of this question
should bq on the floors of Parliament,
avoiding all old party battles, or old party
cries; to find out how, by mutual concession,
divergent interests could be harmonized
to a great national end.
If the solution which such a treatment of
the matter finds be sound, those who are responsible for «it must be prepared to find
dissatisfaction. It was so in 1867. A historian of Confederation says:
On July lst the new Dominion came into
being. Ontario was jubilant; Quebec doubtful
and expectant; New Brunswick sullen, and
Nova Scotia rebellious. Many of the newspapers
in the Maritime Provinces came out that day
with their columns draped in black. Confederation hac been carried, but the problem remained
of holding it together.

If a sound solution of the transportation
problem of the country be found, it may
give no more immediate satisfaction than
did the British North America Act in 1867.
We know the history of Confederation, and
I think we may safely challenge anyone
to find in the history of Governmnents an

instance where sound statesmanship and
courage have failed to carry with them,
in the course such leaders propose, a people
as intelligent as are the people of Canada.
It will be well for Canada if this Parliament
and the next contain men with the constructive statesmanship and the sound
courage which were the high attributes of
the men who met in Quebec in 1865. The
people of Canada will agree absolutely and
entirely to any solution, which its leaders
reach in a united way, of this transportation problem or any other great question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? He says
our Confederation has been a model one.
I ask him, a model to whom?
Australia was
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
largely influenced by it, and New Zealand,
though not entirely.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Just the reverse
of our method in Australia, because there
the separate states got the power to govern
themelves. If the honourable gentleman
will read their answer to the British Government, he will find that they refused
absolutely to take a constitution like ours.
They said: "You can keep it; we won't
have it at all."
Nobody was
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
forcing our constitution on the other Dominions. I said that ours was very carefully studied.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I do not propose making
any discussion on this inquiry, but will
simply answer it shortly. My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. David) placed the following question on the Order Paper:
That he will calil the attention of the Senate
to the letter of Lord Shaughnessy re solution
of the Canadian National Railway difficulties
and inquire whether the Government intend to
take action in regard thereto.

In reply, I would say that the Government is engaged in giving special attention
to the solution of the Canadian railway
problem, and will continue to do so as
long as it is charged with the Administration.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will you give
the answer which you gave to Lord Shaughnessy?

is the answer.

JUNE 3. 1921
If I were
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
consulted as a lawyer, I would say honesty
pure and simple.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: But as a rule the
greatest damage to hay is caused by
moisture. If the hay gets damp and musty,
would you hold the owner responsible?
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Certainly. Hay
that has been pressed in the winter time,
in very cold weather, and then shipped, we
will say in the early spring, to St. John or
New York, and is allowed to lie there a
while, is apt to become entirely changed
in quality. If the hay gets moist, the
quality may be entirely changed in three
months. Why hold the owner responsible
for that?
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: Would the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
make the owner of the hay liable under the
penalty clause in the amendment that he
brings in, because a stone, or a stick, or the
skull of a beast had accidentally got into
that hay? It is by accident that such things
get in. No farmer wants to gather up that
kind of stuff and put it into his barn, but
accidentally he may gather it up and roll
it into the hay, and it may go into the
presser.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is. for the
courts to decide as to the element of
honesty.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What change in
the weight of the hay would there be, if a
skull, for instance, got in?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Whose skull?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Well, yours for
instance. There would not be very much
weight in it, I admit, but stillHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is pretty
heavy.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The amount of hay
of which the purchaser is deprived by
reason of the skull being in it would be
very small; it would not pay him to go
after the original owner of the hay, or the
man who got it pressedHon. Mr. WATSON: It would not pay
for the -postage stamp.

Hon. Mr. TODD: I think that is rather
stringent legislation. Down in New Brunswick-and I think the same applies more
or less to Quebec-there are farms owned
by a large number of concerns who press
hay, but do not weigh it. It is not for
sale at all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
not amending the law in that regard.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
Yes; it says
"owner." Any person could come around
and have you fined for not tagging your
hay.
Hon. Mr. TODD: Is there in the Bill
anyth{ng that makes this point clear?
Under that amendment, would not a man
who pressed hay but did not weigh it be
liable to a fine?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
law to-day.

That is the

Hon. Mr. TODD: The law should be
changed, then. There are thousands of
tons of hay in New Brunswick, and probably in Quebec, that is not weighed at aIl.
The hay is simply pressed; it is not sold.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think we would be
doing a public service if'we were to strike
out sections 340F and 340G altogether.
I agree with the view taken by the honourable gentleman. from Lindsay (Hon.
Mr. McHugh). There is no good in this
proposed amendment; lt does not get yoa
anywhere, apart from the matter of certifying the weight. The buyer can simply
order that the hay be put on a scale. Moreover, the tagging of a (bale of hay is not
like the stencilling of a barrel or a box of
fruit. How are you going to prevent the
changing of the tag, if there is any importance in the tag? The only reason that
I can suggest why these tags might not be
changed. afterwards is that it would not
be worth while. The whole thing is a
piece of nagging, useless legislation. If a
farmer has hay to sell, let him say what the
quality is, and give his guarantee, and let

the buyer beware. Let him stipulate what
he wants, and see that he gets it. If he
does not get it, he has his action for
damages, that is all. I would move that
instead of the proposed amendment we
strike out sections 340F and 340G altogether.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
sections?

What are those

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The sections read
as follows:
340F. Every seller of baled hay or straw in
Canada shal affix to every bale of hay or
straw sold or offered for sale a tag having
thereon plainly written and legible, bis name and
business -address, and the weight of the bale.
Such tag shall be securely fastened to the bale
and shall be of not less than one and one-half
inches in width and three inches in length.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does it ask for
his religious denomination?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 340G provides:
Any seller of hay or straw who fails to
attach a tag to each bale of hay or straw, as
prescribed by this Act, shall, on surmmary
conviction, be liable to a fine of ifive dollars for
each such violation.

These two sections, the honourable member from Middleton moves to strike out.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is there anything
in those clauses about foreign substances?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There is nothing
about foreign substances in them. Section
340d reads:
340d (1) All inspecting officers shall where
necessary enter in their books their detailed
reasons for grading any particular bale or bales
of hay or straw.
(2) Hay or straw pressed in bales for sale
in Canada shall be free from ail foreign matter
that would prejudicially affect the grade or
add to the weight of the bale.

Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Who is responsible for that-the inspector?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is what the
inspector has to report on.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: How can he?
The clause is no good.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK (reading):
(3) The wire to ,be used in baling hay or
straw shall be of a strength and quality not
below number fourteen standard gauge annealed steel wire.
(4, When hay or straw that is baled is
inspected, the inspecting officer shall enter in
bis book a statement of the character and
condition of the fastenings of the bales.
(5) The scales used by pressers of hay or
straw shall be inspected at least once every

year.

These are the clauses dealing with that
particular question. Then there is a clause
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

.

dealing with hay imported into Canada,
but I do not think honourable gentlemen are
interested in that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: are there inspectors
all over the country?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have not the
original Act vith me, but I imagine the
Department appoint their inspectors in
ddfferent parts of the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I see one
advantage to the country in retaining those
two clauses and in adopting the amendment
which I propose. The advantage is this,
that the owner or grower of the hay, by
being required to anounce the faiet that
he is the person who has grown it, is
prompted to divide bis hay into various
grades.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But the owner
might not be the person who grew the hay.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In three cases
out of four it is the farmer who gets the
hay pressed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No, it is the other
way about: there are three out of four
who -do not press it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Sometimes it
may be the purchaser who sends the presser
along; but in the Province of Quebec,
I think I may fairly say, in three cases out
of four it is the farmer who gets the hay
pressed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not believe it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So the owner
of the hay at the time it is pressed will
be interested in obtaining as high a reputation as possible as a producer of hay.
All that is asked is that his name shall
appear on the bales. If be has two or three
qualities of hay on his farm, be may te
impelled to put them in different grades,
so as to maintain bis reputation. That is a
point which occurs to me, and it is for
this reason that I am inclined te vote
against the subamendment.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: The effect of
this whole legislation is to relieve the
middleman, the hay dealer, and put more
work on the farmer, by requiring him to
get cards of a certain size, put bis name
on them, and put them on the bales of hay.
I thought the world was trying to legislate to eliminate the middleman and let
the producer and the consumer get the
most they could out of their dealings. The
farmer raises the hay and sells it. Generally speaking, a hay dealer, who giets

JUNE 3, 1921
news that hay is going to advance in
price, will telephone to forty or fifty
farmers in a day, and secure their hay at
$16 or $18 a ton, or whatever the price
may be. These dealers, to buy the hay,
will send out $100 the next morning with
someone in an automobile, in order to
clinch the bargain, if they know that hay
is going up five or six dollars. Why compel
the farmer to get printing done and to put
tags on the bales?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I am opposed to
both of the amendments. I think the better
plan for us to pursue would be to pass the
Bill as it comes before us. The amendment
proposed by my honourable friend from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) is one this
committee is asked to pass without really
knowing the sections of the Act that we
are asked to repeal. They are not before
us. The honourable member from Kamloops (Hon. Mr. Bostock) bas just read
them, but I doubt if there is any honourable member here who really knew what
they contained, before the honourable
gentleman read them. They show that there
are throughout this country officials who
inspect the quality of hay and straw. I
do not know what other duties they may
have. If you strike out those clauses you
certainly take away from the inspectors
all èontrol over the products they are
appointed to inspect. I think it is unwise
and rash to strike out clauses with the
effect of which we are not familiar. We
ought to proceed a little more slowly in a
radical matter like this. We really do not
know where the matter would end. The
Bill before us places on the presser the
onus of marking the correct weight. I
agree with that. I think he is the right
man to put this on. Sometimes the owner
himself is the man who presses the hay;
and of course there would be in that case
no question. At other times there are men
who make a business of pressing hay,
which is brought to them, and it is they
who, under these circumstances, should
put the tag on if it is necessary, so as far
as I am concerned, I propose to vote
against both amendments.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We
have already occupied more time on this
Bill than on any important measure that
has come before us this Session. The
blunder that was made when the Bill was
criginally passed was made in the Senate;
that is, the word "seller" was put in
instead of the word "presser." The House
of Commons bas passed this Bill, and subS-48J
.

755

stituted the word "presser" for "seller,"
as was first intended. Of course, this
House has a perfect right to differ from
the Commons. If the Senate does not see
its way to adopt the Bill as it has come
down from the House of Commons, then I
ask leave to withdraw the Bill. I move
that if the House is not prepared to vote
upon the question now, because, with prorogation. in sight within a few hours-for
I understand the House will prorogue today, at least the Commons will get through
with its business to-day-I feel that we
cannot advantageously spend further time
on this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand the position taken by the honourable
leader to be that if my amendment were
carried it would mean that my honourable
friend would withdraw the Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not necessarily, but I want it disposed of; I do
not want it to occupy any further time.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I agree entirely
with what has been said by the Minister.
The suggestion was made the other day
that inquiry on the points in dispute should
be made of the Minister of Agriculture,
who probably knew more about hay than
the Minister of Trade and Commerce. As
far as I am personally concerned, I am opposed to all of these amendments, and also
to the Bill. Has any person any reason to
suggest why an amendment should be
made? What abuses have taken place in
the last three years while the Bill has
been in force? We hear no complaints. We
hear a lot of suggestions made that are not
practicable; but if no complaints are made
why should we take any action at all? No
one is suggesting that any one has suffered in thé last three years.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am opposed to
this Bill.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: As I understand, both amendments are withdrawn.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No. Question.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The question is that
I have the floor; you cannot snuff me out
like that, you know. I say that this Bill
is a mischievous Bill. The honourable
leader has complained that time has- been
wasted in this discussion. It is not the
fault of the members of the Senate who
are opposing this Bill that time bas been
taken, up with it, because we consider it a

SENATE

mischievous Bill. I consider ail that sort
of legisiation mischievous, and there is
altogether too much of it in the country.
I ar n ot trying to defend the farmers, but
I believe in fair play and justice for ail.
We have here the agrarian leader in this
House, and I wouiýd like to hear fromn hlm.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourabie gentiemnen,Some Hon. SENATORS:- Question, question.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I have said nothing
yet about this Bill, and as one who perhaps
bizys more hay than any person who has
spoken on thi s subject I want to say that
I believe this section shouid be passed flot
oniy in the interest of the farmers but in
the interest of every person who purchases
hay. It entails no work on the presser oi
farmer other than scratching on each baie
with a pencil its weight and the name of
the man, therefore I hope -that this section
wiil be passed.
The amendment of Hon, W. B. Ross was
negatived.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was negatived.
Section 1 was agreed to: yeas 35; nays,

PUBLIC SERVICE RETIREMENT BILL
SEDCOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 107, an Act to
amend an Act to provîde for the Retirement of certain niembers of the Public
Service.

JUNE 3, 1921
He said; Honourable gentlemen, I think
it -was last Session we passed what was
known as the " Calder Act," respecting the
retirement of certain public servants over
the age of 65 years, and also making provision for the superannuation or retirement of members of the public service who
were incompetent or inefficient. A reasonabie retirement fund was provided for under the provisions of that Act. This Bill
to some extent extends that Act. Some
misapprehensions or misinterpretations of
the Act arose touching the retirement of
public servants who were net employed
continuously in the Governiment, or who
were net employed under an annual salary.
This Bill makes provision te cover a class
of men, for instance, men as te whose empleyment there is an interruption, such as
keepers of canals or lighthouses, and that
class of men, who would not be continuously employed, and yet who may have been
in the service of the Government for a
number of years. That simply is the object
of the Bill. lit is made a little more elastic
than the Act of last Session.
Hen. Mr. TURRIFF: Will the Bi1 go
te Committee of the Whole House immediately?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, I
would propose that.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed, the Senate went into Committee
on the Bill. Hon. Mr. Daneil in the chair.
Section 1-short title-was agreed te.
On section 2, paragraph b-"officer"
defined:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would my honouraible friend say what is the difference in
the definitions? This is a very much longer
definition of " officer " than that in the old
Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Paragraph b covers the extended conditions which
I have mentioned, under the definition of
the terni "officer." My recollection is that
the statute of last Session deallt with one
who was in receipt of an annuel salary.
As wiIl be observed, this is te enlarge that
interpretation, te permit 'the class of
public servant whom I have mentioned te
come within the provisions of the BdI.

751

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But in line 16 of
this section I notice it reads:
but shall not include any person appointed for
a temporary purpose, or any person whose duties
do not require his constant attention.

The same wording is in the 'Act of last
year, chaptet 67; the definition of "officer"
given there is:
"Officer" means any officer, clerk or employee
who is employed i.n the public service and wio
receives a stated annual salary, but shall not
include any person appointed for a temporary
purpose or on part time.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not for
a temporary-purpose; that is all right.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It means that it
only includes an officer who is -in the permanent service, who is receiving an annual
salary; 1s that the definition?
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; it
says:
For a period of not less than an average
of six months in each year.

I do not think that is in the present Act.
That is the main change.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Se that the extension is that an officer who âs receiving
a salary for six months comes under this
Retirement Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Previously he had
te receive a salary for the full year?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The Act as it is to-day applies only te
officers under an annual salary, but this
Bill enlarges that very considerably, and
makes prpvision for those employed from
year te year for a period of not less than
an average of six months in each year,
or who, having been continuously employed, receives a daily, weekly or monthly
rate of wage or salary.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It seems te me
that this clause does not go quite far
cnough. I am not going te discuss now the
merits of giving- a retiring allowance at
all, but there is one class of men that it
leaves out altogether. Take, for instance,
the Sessional Clerk who has been employed
every year for the last 20 years. He is
not employed yearly, of course, but he is
employed every year. This clause limita
the Act te those who are employed for six
months in each year.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I might
say te my honourable friend that the
minister who had charge of the Bill in the
House of Commons bas just sent down te

758

SENATE

me a proposed amendment striking out
those words and making the section read
as follows:
Who has been continuously employed from
year to year for a portion of each year.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That is just what
I was wanting to bring about, in order to
prevent injustice being done.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It would then
read:
"Officer" means any officer, clerk or employee
who is employed in the public service and who
receives a stated annual salary, and any officer,
clerk or employee in the said service who has
been continuous.ly employed from year to year
for a portion of each year, or who, having been
continuously employed, receives a daily, weekly
or monthly rate of wage or salary, but shall
not include any person appointed for a temporary purpose or any person whose duties do
not require his constant attention.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This leaves
out all the sessional employees?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It omits the
words, "a period of not less than an
average of six months," and instead of
"six months" it makes it read, "a portion
of each year."
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Except those who
are employed from year to year for a
short term.
The paragraph, as amended, was agreed
to.
Section 2, as amended, was agreed to.
On section 3, subsection 2-rate of
retiring allowance to officers between 45
and 60 years and over 60, proviso as to
average salary for full term:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not exactly
understand that proviso:
Provided that if the average salary of any
officer retired under this Act for the last three
years during which he was in the public service is less than the average salary of such
officer for the full term of his service, such latter
average shall be taken as the basis upon which
to compute any retiring allowance to whicbh
such officer may be entitled under this Act.

What case does that affect?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
simply means that should his salary have
been reduced, and the average based upon
the last three years be less than the
average struck at a previous time, he is
entitled to the larger average.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported, as amended.

FRENCH

EXHIBITION
CANADA

TRAIN IN

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, with your permission and the assent
of the honourable leader of the Government, I beg to make a brief statement,
which I hope will prove of interest to the
House.
About the 25th instant an important
French delegation will arrive in Canada.
It will, I believe, be the first trade mission
sent by the French Republic since peace has
been restored. The delegation will comprise
fitting representatives of the brilliant
French Parliament, of its immortal army,
and of the master minds of industry, trade
and finance, who have accomplished so
much in reconstruction work in France.
The purpose of the mission is to inaugurate
the made-in-France sample train, which
will tour the Dominion a few weeks later.
As the Senate has. shown its interest in
this project from its very inception,
I thought that perhaps a brief word of explanation, as to the method in which such
idea is intended to be carried out in Canada,
would not be altogether without meriting
the attention of my honourable colleagues.
The train in question will really constitute an exhibition on wheels, composed of
eight different departments-manned with
a competent personnel travelling with the
train and living in the sleepers and diner
provided for their comfort. The eight exhibition coaches will each present some special
products of France prepared and exhibited
under the patronage of distinguished personalities.
The first car, entitled, "La Pensée Francaise"-the French thought; comprising
literature, science and arts-will be under
the ipresidency of Mr. Raymond Poincaré,
Senator and Ex-President of the French
Republic.
The second car, entitled, "Industry, Commerce and Tourism," including transportation by land, sea and air, and civil and
mechanical engineering, will be under the
presidency of Mr. Dal Piaz, President of
La Compagnie Générale Transatlantique,
commonly known as the French Line.
The third car, entitled, "Fashion, Tissues
and Laces, etc.," will be under the presidency of Mr. Auguste Isaac, Member of

JUNE 3, 1921
Parliament, Honorary Piresident of the
Chamber of Commerce »of Lyons, and ExMinister of Trade and Commerce.
The fourth- car, entitled, "lLeather Industries," and ranging £rom the raw material to the glove and highest-grade .product,
will be under the presidency of Mr. Poullain, President of the General Association
of dealers in skins, hides and leather, of
France.
The fifth car, entitled, "Chemical Products, Drugs, Pharmacy, Perfumery, etc.,"
will be under the presidency of Mr. Amic,
Senator, and Vice-President of Le Comité
Français des Expositions.
The sixth car, entitled "Articles de Paris,
scientific instruments, etc.," will be under
the presidency of Mr. Emile Dupont, president of Le Comité Français des Expositions.
The seventh car, entitled, "Agriculture,
Horticulture and Foodstuffs," will bie under
the presidency of Mr. Albert Viger, President of the National Association of Horticulture of France, ex-Minister of Agriculture.
The eighth car, entitled, "Jewellery, Objects of Art, etc.," will be under the presidency of Mr. Paul Templier, President of
the Jewellers and Goldsmiths of Paris.
The gooda and fittings of this moving
exhibition are expected to arrive in Montreal in August, and will be immediately
set up and the train started on its circuit
at the nmiddle or end of that month.
Practically every important centre will
be visited and the public given full opportunity to view the exhibits.
A tentative itinerary has been arranged
covering the following cities and townis:
Montreal, Joliette, Shawinigan, Three
Rivers, Quebec, Sherbrooke, St. Hyacinthe,
Thetford, iSt. Johns, Valleyfield, Ottawa,
Belleville, PeterBrockville, Kingston,
barough, Toronto, Niagara Falls, St. Catherines, Hamilton, Brantford, Woodstock,
London, Windsor, Chatham, Stratford,
Kitchener, Gaît, Guelph, North Bay, Sudbury, Soo, Port Arthur, Fort. 'William,
Winnipeg, -Saskatoon, Edmonton, Banff,
Kamloops, Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary,
Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Swift Current,
Moosejaw, Regina, Brandon, Winnipeg,
Cochrane, Cobalt, Ottawa, Montreal.
Concurrently with each stoppage in suitable theatres, moving pictures will display
special goods and striking industrial processes, and especially the natural beauties
of the land of the lillies and its treasures
of art and historical landmarks. The cir-

759

cuit contemnplated will cover over 8,000
miles, and extend over a period of more
than two months.
Upon its completion the exhibits will be
placed in the beautiful museum hall of the
school for high Commercial Education, in
the city of Montreal, and remain there upon
a fixed exhibition for another six months,
in order that the exhibitors after such a
rapid j ourney through the land may have
an opportunity to establish agencies, tie up
solid commercial relations, and form the
nucleus of a clientele which it is hoped will
grow with time. Ibis, it is confidently
hoped, will be magnificient demonstration
of the revival of the industrial life of
France. It comes to us with the full endorsation of the French Government and
the prestige of the men of very high repute who have undertaken its organization,
and who, for a score of years as Le Comité
França'is des Expositions, have assured the
success of every large international exposition by France.
In this country the care of attending to
the proper reception of the distinguished
guests shortly expected, as well as seeing to the carrying out of the sample
train idea in Canada, will be assumed by
the following gentlemen: Right Hon. Sir
George Foster, Minister of Trade and Commerce; Right Hon. C. J. Doherty, Minister
of Justice; Hon. P. E. Blondin, Postmaster
General; Hon. R. Dandurand, Senator, Président Le Comité France-Amérique; Hon.
Smeaton White, Senator, representing the
Canadian Press; Mr. H. W. Beauclerk,
President, Trans-Canada Theatres; Mr.
Joseph Quintal,- President, L'Ecole des
Hautes Etudes Commerciales. To the above
gentlemen will be added one representative
of each of the three big railways of Canada,
and.myself.
It cannot be said with too much emphasis that this realization is due alm,-st entirely to the generosity of the transportation companies of both countries. Indeed,
the carrying of the exhibits across the water
both ways is furnished gratuitously by La
Transatlantique.
Générale
Compagnie
Their storing is provided ti the samne generous manner by the Montreal Harbour
Commissioners. The train itself, its equipment, and its circulation from. the Atlantic
to the Pacific and back again, has been
assured, 'without cost, by the public spirit
of our three big railways and the remarkable men who direct them. The TransCanada Theatre Company is furnishing a
theatre for the moving picture displays in

760

SENATE

practically every city traversed with the
undertaking to turn over all net proceeds
to France for her blind soldiers or other
war charities. L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes,
are emptying their large museum and
turning it over with adjoining halls to the
French Exhibitors for one half year, without recompense. This remarkable concourse
of generosity is prompted by a highly patriotic sense. Indeed, the extraordinary facilities and privileges extended to France are
predicated on a reciprèocal understanding
between the French and Canadian Governments, by which it is agreed that at any
time that Canada should so desire the full
equivalent of all these facilities and privileges would be assured to Canada by
France. This, I venture to say, is of no
small importance to our own industry and
commerce.
Better perhaps than any other two countries in the world, Canada and France can
exchange their products without fear of
importing competition either way. If in the
carrying out of this idea we greatly help
the French Republic to advertise and sell
her goods in Canada and popularize her
land as an ideal country for travel, please
bear in mind that we will open to her a
market and the resources of some 8,000,000 people, whilst we in turn shall get access in like manner to her market of 38,000,000 people.
When the time has come-and it cannot
much be delayed now, as the reaction in
business calls for an effective and determined effort towards exportation-when the
day selected by the Government and the
Canadian producers and manufacturers has
dawned, then we shall gather our exhibits,
a splendid display of the whole scale of our
natural productions, and fabricated goods
and a marvelous selection of films showing
the incomparable resources and beauties of
our land. We shall then turn to France

materials, but of highly finished merchandise-where they can somewhat realize its
great possibilities in the future as a factor
in the trade of the world, where they .can,
upon the screen, admire a variety, and
beauty and a grandeur of nature unsurpassed the world over. All these facilities
and advantages will be granted to us on
the full basis of reciprocal gratuity to
which the French Government has readily
agreed. The Canadian sample train will
bring our goods practically to the doorstep of every Frenchman. It will advertise
them to the entire population in a rapid,
economical and striking manner. The fixed
exhibition will allow our exporters the time
and means of laying out their organization to capture their fair share of the
French market.
Do not forget that France is easily our
third best customer, notwithstanding the
fact that our goods are practically unknown
to the average Frenchman. Better commercial intercourse will help to preserve the

thereby will contribute very usefully to fortify the bond of friendship between the two

After five years of efforts, when this

bound to express my gratitude to those
who have so generously contributed to its
realization. They comprise leading publie
men of all political views both in Canada
and in France; and also in both countries,
the heads of important newspapers of all
creeds, boards of trade, industrial bodies,
other associations, and more particularly
the transportation companies and the corporations above referred to who have generously agreed to bear practically the entire expense required to carry it out.
I beg anew to express to this honourable
House my deep appreciation for its unanimous support as far back as 1916.

DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 130, an Act to
amend the Dominion Elections Act.

JUNE 3 1921
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill upon the face of it looks somewhat
formidable, but rwhen examined it wiil
prove to be flot as gerious as its contents
might indicate. This is peculiarly a Bi-I
dealing with procedure in elections. It
has been introduced at the instance of the

Chief Electoral Officer.
clauses contained in the Bill relate to procedure, and the major part of the Bill, as
honourable gentlemen will see, is taken up
with forms.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, the Election Act is flot a question
that we discuss to any great extent in this
House, as it does not affect the members
here. But there is one clause of this Bill
to which-I think attention should be drawn.
The third clause of the Bill contains a
Proviso which affects section 29 of the
Election Act, which was enacted at a time
when it was thought advisa-ble that certain
people should not have their names placeà
on the voters' list, and should be,
prevented from exercising the franchise.
I do not understand exactly how far the
proviso that is included in the Bill will
modify the present Act, but I think it
would havé been wise on the part of the
Governrnent, to have gone further in ths
matter, now that the war is over, and conditions are becoming more settled in the
country. Relief might have been granted
to those people who voted previously to
the war, but who felt aggrieved because
they regarded as unfair the action of the
Government in passing the Election Act
of 1920.
I do not intend to say more upon the
subject now, but when we go into committee this question can be discussed
further.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 cannot entirely appreciate the position taken
by my honourable friend. I am informed
that the Minister who has charge of this
Bill, namely, the Minister of Immigration,
bas stated that every Western member is
in favour of the particular clause to which
my honourable friend refers. It considerably extends the right of voting, and, instead ()f being subject to criticism, it seems
to me it should be the subject of commendation, so far as the Government is concerned.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
friend means that the proviso in the BilB
extends the franchise?
Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOUGHEED: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But I arn trying to
find out to what extent it increases the
number of those who may vote under that
clause. Subsection 2 of section 29 reads:
For the purposes of this Act, the alleglance or
nationality of a person, as it was at the birth
of such person, sha-h be deemned incapable of
being changed.

I takethat; to mean that anybody coming
fromi Europe to this country does flot get
the henefit of naturalization; that in this
respect their nationality cannot be changed
under the Naturalization Act.

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, I
think it is.
If it is an

vote on their return from work or on
going in the morning. This is simply to
meet conditions of that kind..

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Ithink
it is. The answer is this, that the men
who are most concerned in it are the men
who approve of it, and the men who are
not concerned about it at all are the crities
of it.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And it will
be the municipality that will make the
application through the 'municipal council?
It would not be done at all on the suggestion of the electoral officer; but on that
of those who would be interested in meeting
such conditions.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
answer.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That applies to
everything in the Bill, from the first section to the last, and if because it suited the
members of the House of Commons we are
not going to discuss these questions, we
need not discuss any of the Bill. I do not
see why my honourable friend is getting
on his high horse-why he is getting excited and angry over it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Because
my honourable friend insinuated that I am
trying to restrict discussion of it. I am
not doing that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am making a
suggestion that this clause should be altered, and I am met with the objection that
that has passed the House of Commons and
it suits the Commoners. In that case, I am
not going to waste any time in discussing
it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would it not be
as well to add that in any case the polls
shall be open from eight to six? As I read
the clause in its present form, if the returning officer is dishonest and wants to
favour some one in his district, he might
change the hours and say, "I want only one
hour."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You must guard
against that. People are not all lawyers,
any more than I am. That may be an exaggerated instance, to say one hour, but he
could fix the time of polling at a very unsuitable hour.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: We are not going
to run any election on that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I might
say, for the information of honourable
gentlemen, that the question arose in connection with electors crossing over the
boundary-for instance, from Windsor to
Detroit-as tn whether there should not
be a certain amount of elasticity given to
the electoral officer se that those men could
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The municipality could speak through its council?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The municipality,
as I understand, must be near the boundary
line; it might have more effect on the
Fraser River than in any other part of
the country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend will see, under 6A, that
that condition has been specifically stated
-"the
application by any municipality
situated upon or near the international
boundary."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not
want to criticise, but it seems to me very
amusing that this exception is made for
people living across the international
boundary. If they are living across the
St. Lawrence, and returning across the
bridge, it seems to matter little. We have
people who leave the ibig city, or come in
the morning to a big city to work, near
Toronto, for example, having te run halfan-hour to reach their work, and returning
after the closing hours. It seems te me
that those people are as interested as the
Detroit people.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
vision is already made for them.

Pro-

Hon. Mr. BLAIN: It must not be overlooked that there cannot be very much discretionary power given to the returning
officer, for this reason, as will be seen
further down in this section:
The Chief Electoral Officer shal notify the
Returni.ng officer of any change in the hours
of polling authorized by him, and the same
shall be duly announced by the returning officer
at the time appointed for the nomination of
candidates.

Therefore whatever is done must all be
done prier to the nomination day, and
publicly announced at the nomination.

why we give that preference to those people

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
For
this reason. The Parliament of Canada
would have authority to take a vote at
the place where those men are living, but
that could not be said to be in a foreign
country; they could not go across the
international boundary line and take the
vote. That is the distinctibn.

COURTS 0F CRIMINAL APPEAL
DEB.XTE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed, fromn May 17, the
debate on the motion and inquiry of Hon.
L. McMeans:

SENATE
That in the opinion of the Senate it is essential for the better administration of the criminal
law that a Court of Criminal Appeal should be
established in the different Provinces, with
jurisdiction similar to that possessed by the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England, and will
inquire whether it is the intention of the Government to create such Courts.

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Though I
am not in the confidence of the honourable
gentleman who initiated this inquiry, I understand it was not his intention to press
for an actual vote on his resolution; but,
if I interpret his meaning correctly, I think
he desires to have the considered opinion
of those competent to speak in this House,
as to whether we should move in the direction of having a court of criminal appeal
in Canada.
The honourable gentleman from Winnipeg first introduced a resolution dealing
with excessive and inadequate punishments,
and we passed the same, but that was not
acted upon by the Commons. We have now
the happy conclusion that the House of
Commons accepted our amendment to the
Criminal Bill which has just been before
us, and that resolution emanating from the
Senate, is now a part of the criminal law
of Canada.
When my honourable friend introduced
his resolution regarding excessive and inadequate punishments, I intimated to him
that if he had seen fit at that time to
enlarge on the scope of his resolution so as
to provide at the same time for a court
of criminal appeal in Canada I would cooperate with him. The Act that would be
contemplated by reason of the resolution
on the Order Paper would of course go
much further than the one already covered
by the statute that we now have, or will
have when the House prorogues, dealing
with excessive and inadequate punishments,
but the two do not altogether overlap in
the same field. The Criminal Code, as it
is now being amended, does give relief in
a very large number of cases, undoubtedly,
where the sentence of the court may be
reviewed as to inadequacy or excessiveness.
One of the difficulties, as those familiar
with the administration of criminal law
know, is that we have no uniformity in
sentence, even in the various provinces of
Canada, let alone individual provinces, as
to a person sent to prison with a light
sentence or a heavy sentence. It depends
largely on the temperament of the judge,
sometimes on the state of public opinion
at the time, which is more or less inflamed
or agitated in connection with a certain
crime, and which has an unconscious reflex

action on the judge himself; because under
our criminal laws at the present time, in a
very large degree, the extent of the punishment is left within the jurisdiction and discretion of the judge. We are pretty well
departing from the old absolute fixed sentence method of punishment, and coming
to leave it to the judge who heard the
matter, without any offence restrictions
whatever, to fit the punishment to the

crime.
it is all right to provide that there shall
be a minimum sentence, and we have provided that, on the whole; but between the
minimum and maximum there should be a
very wide discretion left to the judge who
heard the case. In the case of the technical
offencer who has brought himself within
the pale of its provisions by an actual
breach of the law, and where no discretion
is left to the trial judge other than to find
him guilty, the extent of his punishment
may often range to the widest degree,
from a mere suspended sentence to a long
sentence.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the
debate was adjourned until the next sitting of the House.
The Senate adjourned until 3 p.m.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S
DEPARTURE
ADDRESS

FROM THE SENATE AND
HOUSE OF COMMONS

THE

The Senate proceeded to consider a message from the House of Commons requesting the Senate to unite with that House in
an Address to His Excellency the Governor General on the occasion of the approaching termination of His Excellency's
official connection with this country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, a few years ago the
Parliament of Canada bade farewell to
His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, who was the immediate predecessor in the high office of Governor General
of Canada to His Excellency the Duke of
Devonshire, to whom we are on the present
occasion bidding a like farewell.
Coming officially to Canada at a time
when the Empire was engaged in the
greatest war of all history and in which

JUNE 3. 1921
Canada played an important and distinguished part, we have had the opportunity of availing ourselves of the valuable services of His Excellency during the
crucial period of the war, as weil as in
the peace which. bas so happily f ollowed.
His Excellency represents a famiiy
which for generations
rendered distinguished service in the interests of the
Empire, and during the period hie bas filled
the bigh office of Governor General in
Canada hie bas added lustre to services
aireaidy rendered by bis family to tbe etate.
Her Excellency likewise Weore coming
to Canada was cIogelly identified witb us
tbrough bier distinguished father, the Earl
of Lansdowne, wbo for some years filled
the office of Governor General in Canada
so acceptabiy and popularly as flot to bie
forgotten by the Canadian people. It wa.s,
therefore, witb peculiar pleasure, some five
years ago, that we welcomed Her Excellency to our shores as the consort of His
Excellency in the higb office assigned to
bim.
During the time Their Excellencies bave
been in Canada, tbey have filled this inmportant office to the satisfaction of our
people, in a way flot exceeded by any of
tbeir predecessors.
Their Excellencies
bave visited ail parts o'f the Dominion and
have been welcomed by our people wberever tbey bave gone, and bave created an,
impression in tbe popular mind that wiil
long bie remembered.
Their Exceilencies have identified tbemselve.s wîtb our many institutions hy a
sympathy and an interest whicb bave
deepiy appeaied to our people. During the
five years tbey bave 'been witb us, they
bave gone in and out among our people as
if to the manner born, and Canada bas
appreciated most deeply tbe symipatbetic
interest tbey bave evinced in ail the
features of our National life.
His Excellency has been a wise administrator. He bas recognized to the f ull tbe
freedoqn of our representative institutions
and the free expression of the popular wiii.
The surest way of maintaining tbe good
relations between Canada and the Empire
is tbrough the greatest possible freedom
being recognized in the governing institutions of Canada and thosle of the Empire.
It is neediess to say that in the wise administration of His Excellency as Governor
General-of Canada that freedom bas neyer
been in the least degree fettered, but bas
been given that wide scope of expression
which is best callculated for the development of our representative institutions.

during His Excellericy's
tenure of office in Canada. He bas reflected
in bis own person tbat peculiar tie of
kinship between the mother country and
ourseives by which Canada's loyaity to
the heart of the Empire is strengtbened
as time goes on.
Aq Their Exceilencies bave fromn time to
tirne corne in contact witb our people, the
gracious consideration and tbougbt sbown
by Her Excellency, particuiariy in ail
matters reiating to the social life of Canada, have pecuiiariy impressed -our people.
Thus, in taking a retrospect of the five
years that Their Excellencies, bave been
amongst us, we recaîl witb tbe utmnost
satisfaction the very pleasant relations
wbicb bave been maintained during tbeir
terni of office.
It is, therefore, witb the deepest regret
that, upon the expiration of Their Excellencies residence in Canada, we are tbus
calied upon to say farewell.
We shall
always cberisb the most pleasing memories
of His Excelleney's administration in the
bigb office whicb bie filied witb sucb distinction, and the grace and cbarm witb
whicb Her Exceliency bas surrounded
officiai life in Government House. Canada
will always feel assured, upon the return
of Their Exceliencies to EngIand, that sbe
bas in the mother country-in the very
heart of the Empire-amongst bier staunchest and most loyal friends Their Exceliencies tbe Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.
Their Exceliencies witb their family in
leaving Canada carry with tbem the deepest regret of our people in the severance
of tbe officiai relations wbich united theni
to Canada for. the iast five years, and they
carry witb tbem tbe best wishes of our
people for their future weifare and bappiness.
I have very great pleasure, therefore, in
moving, seconded by the Hon. Mr. Bostock:
That the Senate doth unite With the Bouse of
Commons In this Address to IRis Excellency the
Governor Genera] by filling up the blank space
with the words "Senate and."'

Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, it gives me very mucb pleasure
to join with myý honourable 'friend the
leader of the Government in seconding this
Address to His Excellency upon the termination of bis terni of office. His Exceliency
came to this country as Governor Generai
at a tume wben the condition of the country
was a serious one, and when we were ail
very much in dou'bt as to what was going
to be the resuit of the war in wbicb we were

SENATE
then engaged. The serious position of the
country at that time required the experience of a Governor General who had
strength of character, good common sense,
and judgment, to help us to face the situation which confronted us. Since he has
been among us His Excellency has set
everyone an example of devotion to duty
and attention to everything that affects
the interests of the country.
Coming of a family so well known in
the history of England for their devotion to
the interests of their country and a recognition of their duty to do their best to
assist in the work of that country, it is
no surprise Lo us that whilst His Excellency has been among us he has done everything that could be expected of him in
helping the development of the interests of
Canada. He has worthily upheld the traditions of a great family to which he
belongs. His experience and his interest
in everything that enters into the welfare
of Canada-his interest in art, in science,
in sport, in everything that helps towards
the development of the country-has been
appreciated by the people from one end
of Canada to the other. They look upon
His Excellency as a friend who sympathizes
with them and their purposes.
My honourable friend made one statement of which I think he possibly hardly
realized the effect. He spoke of His
Excellency as a wise administrator. I think
His Excellency would be the first to take
some exception to being considered as the
administrator of the affairs; of Canada.
His appreciation of the Constitution of
Canada and of the views and aims of democracy would make him the very first to regret that he should be looked upon by the
people of this country as an administrator
in the office which he bas held with so much
credit to himself, and so acceptably to the
people of Canada, during the last five years.
We appreciate very much the gracious
presence of Her Excellency as the consort
of His Excellency in all the work he has
undertaken, and we remember with very
great pleasure that the early days of Her
Excellency's life were spent in this country,
and we realize that she has always had a
very strong feeling of love towards Canada.
To both Their Excellencies and to their
family we desire very heartily and fervently to express our earnest wishes for
their future happiness and future prosperity in the life that is before them. We
realize, as my honourable friend has said,
that, wherever they may be, whatever their
duties or their position in life may be, in
Hon. Mr. BOSTPOCK.

the future Canada will always have very
warm friends in Their Excellencies and in
the members of their family; and we join
very heartily in presenting this Address to
them and wishing them every happiness
and success in the future.
Hon. L. O. DAVID: Honourable gentlemen, as a French Canadian, I think it
proper to say that we cancur in everything
that has been said of Their Excellencies
by the two leaders of this House. His
Excellency the Governor General bas been
a worthy successor of the best Governors
who have preceded him in this country. He
bas given evidence of tact, wisdom, impartiality, and kindness to everyone, without national or religious distinction.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: The honourable
gentleman would have been warranted in
going a step further and saying that the
words he bas spoken are the expression of
the feeling of all the French Canadians in
this country.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That His Honour the Speaker do sign the said
Address on behalf of the Senate, and that a
message be sent to the House of Commons accordingly.

The motion was agreed to.
CANADA TEMPERANCE ACT

SECOND

READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 219, An Act with regard to certain Proceedings under Part IV
of the Capada Temperance Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in moving the second reading of this Bill, I need
scarcely remind this Chamber that dur'ing
the war there was placed upon the statute
book legislation making provision for the
submission to the different provinces of
Canada of a plebiscite which would permit
of the will of the people being expressed
on the question of prohibition. In the different provinces of Canada those plebiscites have been submitted in pursuance of
the legislation which was then enacted. A
question bas recently arisen as to an alleged irregufarity in a proclamation which
was issued by this Government in connection therewith. The whole tendency of
legislation in regard to technicalities, not
only in questions of this kind, but also in
judicial and other matters, bas been in
the direction of curing the technicalities by
legislation, or of not giving recognition to

770

That is, as I understand, the principal
clause of the Bill. It provides that, if there
has been any irregularity in the issuing
of the proclamation, the proclamation
shall not be void. I presume it is on that
very question that the action before the
courts has been taken. I think that a
proviso should be added at the end of the
clause, declaring that this section should
have no effect on matters now before the
courts, in order that we may not in any
way interfere with those questions. There
could be drafted along those lines a
proviso which would give the Government
the benefit of what they desire with regard
to the taking of the referendum, but we
should certainly protect the interests of
the parties who are now before the courts.
I
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
might as well freely confess that the object
of the Bill is to cover pending litigation.
I arn not advocating the policy of always
curing litigation by remedial statutes of
this kind; but the present situation is
one which the Government considers
warrants the bringing in of the measure
we are now considering. If the Government
is committed to the policy of maintaining
the Act, so far as it can consistently do
so, against any attack which may be made
upon alleged defects, it renders nugatory
the litigation at present pending, which
would simply mean that the question would
have to be again submitted in a referendum and the country would be put to the
enormous expense involved in that re-submission. Where would there be any particular advantage in doing that. Furthermore, if the law were left in a state of
uncertainty between the present time and
the re-submission of the question, it
would profit no one. So, if no good purpose
would be served, why not cure the defect
at once?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Whose fault was
lit that the last legislation was defective?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The legislation
was not defective.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Or was some official
derelict in his duty in attempting to carry
it out? Let us know who is to 'blame.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend has been practising at
the bar for a great number of years, and
I fancy he would not be prepared to admit
that anyone who takes a different view of a
subject from what a court might take is
therefore wrong. That is precisely the
situation that has arisen in this case. The
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

law officers of the Crown contended, and
hold to-day that, by reason of the language
employed in the statute, they were warranted in omitting the date upon which the
Act would come into force. It was considered difficult to say-in fact, it is difficult for anyone to think-how the date
could be filled in. As I understand it, the
Act was to come into force within a certain time after the returns were made.
One therefore had to anticipate when the
last return would be made, in order to
fix the date. The law officers of the Crown
thought it would be better to await the last
return, 'and then to fix the date as prescribed by the statute. But apparently the
view is entertained, although no judicial
decision has been given upon the question
up to the present time, that the proclamation should have mentioned a specific date
upon which the Act should come into force.
Now, that is just a difference of opinion,
and both parties maintain their point up
to the present time.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is generally considered unsafe to pass legislation concerning a matter that is at the time sub judice.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I quite
agree.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: This is w'hat we
are trying to do in this case. I understand
the matter is on appeal in the Supreme
Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has
not given its decision. It would seem to
me that there should be very strong reason,
what we might call paramount reason, put
forward for violating so good a rule as
that, in passing legislation regarding matters that are sub judice. I do not think
that we have heard that reason yet. The
law officers of the Crown are presumed
to know the law; otherwise they would not
be the law officers of the Crown. They
are supposed to be masters of their profession, and know as much as the Supreme
Court. Until the Supreme Court has given
its decision, how do we know but what all
this may be a tempest in a teapot? The
Supreme Court may hold that the proclamation was all right, that the Prohibition
Act :is safe, and that Ontario shall remain
bone-dry. That is the consideration that
is desired. I do not see why we should
pass this legislation now. I think we had
better let it stand over until next Session,
so 'as not to violate 'so wholesome and wise
a rule as that which I have mentioned, for
the sake of a contingency which may not
happen.

JUNE 3, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then
no harm could be done.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
Oh, yes. You
will have set an example.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am going to
support the Bill, because I do not want
to have the other provinces given a chance
to vote again. They might change their
minds, and I want to have, the monopoly
kept right in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I should like the
honourable leader, of the House to teil
us, if he can, the nature of the litigation
that is. before the courts. Is it in the
nature of a criminal prosecution?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Or confiscation
of property?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
What is the
nature of the action?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not very familiar with it, but the outline
of it I understand to be this. A. proceeding
was taken in the court of the Province of
Alberta by a firm of liquor dealers to
compel the Dominion Express Company to
carry liquor in 'the course of its business
of transporting parcels by express. The
Express Company claimed that it was not
able to do so under the law, and a question brose as to what the law upon the
subject really was. This involved among
other questions a consideration of the
judicial interpretation by the court, of the
matter now before us.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is this to render
null and void a prosecution in a private
case? If it is, I will certainly vote against
it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. It
is a case now before the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Private parties?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. ,DANDURAND:
The proclamation which the Governor in Council
had to issue after being requested by the
various legislatures to do, is to be found
in chapter ,8 of 10 George V. The proclamation is to set forth:
(a) -the day on which the poli for taking the
votes of the electors for and against the prolibbition will be »e]d;
(b) that such votes will be taken by ballot
between the hours of nine n'clock in the "forenoon and five o'clock in the afternoon of that
day;

S-49i

771

Among other things which the proclamation should contain is:
(g) the day on which, in the event of the
vote being in favour of the prohibition, such
prohibition will go into force.

This was apparently not in the proclamation. As .my honourable friend has
said, a Vendor who wanted to ship fron
British Columbia into Alberta offered his
goods to , the Dominion Express, and
the
Express
agent
said:
"There
is
a ' proclamation
prohibiting
us
from carrying liquor into Alberta,
and I will not take your goods." A wri;
was issued to force him, and the local court
decided, though not unanimously, that there
were paramount reasons why this obligation to fix the date, this neglect in the
framing of the proclamation, should be
disregarded, and the writ should be rejected. There was an appeal taken, which
is now before the Supreme Court, and I
quite understand the fear of the Department of Justice of the proclamation being
declared insufficient and invalid.
Hence
this legislation, which would prevent the
whole procedure under the proclamation
being .set aside, and the electors being called
again to the polls.
My honourable friend says it is one of
those extraordinary or special cases wheie
the law could very well be made retroactive.
Well, I will not enter into that field. I
know how shy we should be about making
laws retroactive, which would affect pending litigation; but I draw the attention of
my honourable friend to section 3, which
says:
Any court in which proceedings are pending
at the time of the coming into force of this Act
in which the validity of any proclamation referred to in section one hereof is questioned
shall have discretion to make such order as it
may see fit with regard to the costs of the proceedings having in view the provisions of this
Act.

Well, if this Act passes, the Suprenie
Court will have to take cognizance of it,
and, although it may hold that the action
was well taken, and the Dominion Express
Company was at fault because the proclamation and the whole procedure under
it was invalid, yet in expressing that opinion
it clearly cannot maintain the appeal because this Act is a clear, complete estoppel;
but the court will give the costs against
the respondent. That may be sufficient
for the case as it stands befqre the Supreme
Court; but I would like to ask my honourable friend a question. If there happened to 'be a case in Alberta--since we
are speaking of Alberta-in which one
violated the Act, and when brought before

SENATE

772

the magistrate would plead that the Act
was invalid, raising this same point, and
his defence were rejected, and he would
be condemned to either a fine of $1,000 or
six months in jail, what would be his recourse, in the face of this remedial legislation validating, so te speak, a judgment
which was ab initio wrong, since the
Supreme Court would declare that the
whole proclamation was invalid, but was
estopped from registering a judgment
against the defendant?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
informed, in the first place, that there are
no such cases; but, in the second place,
if there are such cases the Government will
assume the responsibility of seeing that
there is a remission of any fine that may
be imposed under the circumstances mertioned by my honourable friend, namely,
where the question should arise as to the
irregularity of the proclamation.
What about the
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
costs?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Power
is given as to costs here.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Sections 2 and 3 were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 221, an Act to
amend the Income War Tax Act, 1917.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a Bill chiefly for the purpose of reducing
the penalties which were imposed for the
infraction of the Income War Tax Act of
1917. It proposes reducing the penalty from
25 per cent which was imposed in the event
of an infraction, to five per cent. Then there
is an additional penaltyfor each day's default. I may say that the Bill deals entirely
with penalties, and we can discuss it more
advantageously clause by clause in Committee of the Whole.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Schaffner in the Chair.
On section 1-penalty for failure to file
returns:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is it the intention
of the Government te continue the system
of requiring the taxpayer to make out his
own returns?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Of côurse, it was a
new idea when it was introduced, and my
honourable friend can give us some idea
of how it bas worked. There have been
many expressions of opinion in the country
against the policy of the Government in
forcing the taxpayer to make out his own
return, and to pay the greater part of his
tax at the time he sends in the return. As
I understand this section, the penalty is
reduced from what it was in the Act of
1919?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is it on account of
the working out of the Act that the Government have thought it wise to reduce the
penalty, in order to encourage the people
to send in their returns more freely?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. It
was felt that 25 per cent was too great a
penalty to impose; and yet it became
necessary to name a drastic penalty on
account of the reluctance of the public to
conform te the requirements of the Act. It
is unnecessary to say that all countries
that have imposed an income tax have
realized the difficulty of collecting it. That
has always been urged as the chief reason
why the income tax should not be adopted
as a method of taxation. But the imposition of the penalty of 25 per cent was quite
an encouragement, I might say, to the payment of the tax, and up to the present time
it bas resulted very favourably. I think
the collection of the tax by Canada has
proven much more satisfactory than has
been the case in other countries that rely
upon their income tax. Cases have been
pointed out, however, showing that the penalty was too drastic, and therefore we are
reducing it to five per cent. So far as regards the casting of the duty upon the taxpayer of making his own return, that has
been found to work very beneficially. In
the first place, it impresses upon the taxpayer that ho bas a duty to perform to the
state entirely irrespective of the initiative

JUNE 3, 1921
being taken by the state; and once he
recognizes that the duty is cast upon hlm of
doing the particular acts refarrad to in the
law, he becomes more or less familiar with
those duties, and he complies very much
more willingly in paying the tax than if
he were to be notified by the Crown, and if
that duty were confined exclusively to the
Crown. I thin-k thera is a .ma&urë of
psychology in the law which will appeal to
most of us; if we rely upon somehody else
setting us in motion,, wa are very loth -ta
take any step in tbat direction until we are
set in motion by the outside forces.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON'- I think probably the penalty appeals to people more
than the psychology.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
both may be said to be an encouragement
to the performance of public duty. However the axperienca of the Finance Depart-.
ment has been most satisfactory of late
in the matter of the collection of the tax,
and it saems to me that the lagislation embodied in this Bill is in the right direction.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
There is one
featurel that I do not l.ike. Supposing a
man is ill and unable to maka up an income
tax raturn, no provision is made for that.
The section says:
lavery persor' failing to dleliver a return
pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1 hereof within the timne limhlted.

Hon. W. B. ROSS:

Put such a provision

in, and we will alI get sick.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The, iiinass would become a public contagion.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The party would
have to show that thera were good reasons
for bis not being able to make up a return
at the time. A man might be taken iii, and
ramain 111 for two or three weeks, ana
thus ha behind time and hiable to this fine.
Surely he ought to be excusad.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point this out, that where a fine on a five
per cent basi:s woul amount to a very
substantial sum, such an individual would
have a staff to look after s0 impartant a
matter as his inceme, and bis -business
would go on notwithstanding his illness.
1Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But ha may not be
a business man; ha may nRot have a staff.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If he
has a sufficiently large incoma te suifer by
ireason of the impositioni o! the tax, I sheuld
85y lie wouhd have a clarical staff or some-

773

body loolking aîter bis business in the event
of bis ilbwçss; and, where 4 taxpayer is
paying a contparatively small income the
tax i.s nlot very large. Furthermore, in n
case where it would ha obvious that a gross
injustice was being done, the Governor in
Council invarie.bly intervenes to assist. 1
have lpüown that to occu.r.
Hron. Mr. DAVID: Will the honourable
leader explain to me the latter part of
section 1:
mha]l be liable to a penalty of $10 for each
day ini default; provided, however, that such
penalties sha1l flot in any case exceed $50.

How can it be said that they will not exceed $50?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: $10 a
day for every day of default in nlot making
the return provided for in subsection 6;
then the five per cen*t would corne in with
regard to the whole of his income.
Hon. M-lr. ROCHE: I do nlot know what
system of psychology the Minister fias
studied, but in my limited experience 1
have neyer yet found anybody who experienced pleasure in paying taxes. I know of
a great many people who use certain expressions about taxes which. are net ini the
Book of Homilies-I do nlot know whether
the Minister has ever studied that very
much.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May 1
be permitted to say that I did not*dilate on
the pleasèure of paying taxes, but rather re ferred to the duty of paying them. Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Well, I neyer îouni
a person yet who feit very much a-gitated
hy a desire to pay, as a question. of duty.
I may say the majority of people I havet
corne in contact with have expressedl detestation at the way in which the taxa-I
are placed, and the dimclulty of finding
out axpressly what is meant by the taxes.
A gond many people, those who have to
keep books and others, have been very
much puzzled over their inability to determine as between gross profits and net
profits, and what should be included in
the net profits and wha.t *~ouldt be left
out in the gross projits. Tbiere is a wide.
divergency in the estimation of profits by
ai people in. business, and I find very few
who feel competent to, make up, an accurate
return, aven if thay wish ta do so, f rom
the fact that there is a good deal of ambiguity i the law; that la, it deçductR, and it
increases, and it eomes. back &~gain and s»vtaxes; and then, in addition to that, ther8
is a supertax, and ail that. But the main

SENATE
reason that deters a great many people
from making the returns themselves is that
they cannot determine exactly the sums
that ought to be given in as gross profits.
I think the majority of people desire to
do what is honest and fair, but they are
perplexed, and often abstain because they
are unable to determine exactly what the
tax ought to be that they are to make up
Then some firms have to employ additional
clerks to go through their books and estimate exactly what their profits have been.
Furthermore, I could mention many instances of officials themselves being so
puzzled that they are unable to determine
exactly *hat the tax should be; and if
those men who are experts and who have
been instructed in connection with the Act
cannot determine on the spot what a man
should pay, how on earth can a man make
up the return when he bas no assistant and
is not a lawyer?

deflciency amounts to twenty per centum or
more of the correct income, such person shall
pay to His Majesty an additional amount equal
to the amount of such defleiency.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my hon.
ourable friend is quite right in speaking of
the difficulty of a taxpayer making his way
through the intricacies of the law which
make him feel more and more the load he
is carrying in money. Once he bas succeeded, after three or four attempts, in
reaching the figure, he bas sworn so much
at the intricacies of this law that be bas
but a moment left in which to sign his
cheque.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. POWER: While the honourabfe leader of the House is forging the
weapon that he proposes to use presently,
I may be permitted to express my great
gratification at the fact that the Government have decided that our income law
needs to be revised and improved. Every
honourable gentleman here, I think, and
perhaps some very astute lawyers, will feel
that it is a very important matter to be
relieved of the necessity of carrying out the
law as it stands at present. The truth is
that the ordinary man-I could say an ordinary member' of this House, and certainiy
the ordinary outsider who is not a skilled
accountant-would require to employ an
expert in order to enable him to make up
his statement. One may be perfectly honest and anxious to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and, of course, nothing but the truth;
but it would puzzle, as they say, a Phifadelphia lawyer to tell from looking at the
law as it stands now just what one should
put in. It is very gratifying to know that
the Government have realized the position,
and have submitted this Bill, which, I hope,
will be much easier to interpret than the
present law.

On section 3-understating true amount
of income:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This simply re.
peals?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
this is superseded by the former section.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It is subsection 8
of section 7 of chapter 49 of the statutes
of 1920. Subsection 8 reads:
Any person liable to pay any tax or surtax
under this Act, who in return of the income
liable to taxation, makes a return in which he
states the income to be less than the true
amount, shall pay to His Majesty the additional
amount of tax and surtax due on the income
omitted from his return and, In addition, interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum
upon such amount from the last day prescribed
for making such return until the same is paid.
If the amount of the income omitted from
his return exceeds ten per centum of the correct income but is under twenty per centum
of the same, such person shall pay to His
Majesty an additional amount equal to one-half
of the amount of such deficiency, and, if the
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

So they are all struck out?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then there is no
penalty at all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
reduced to 5 per cent.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-failure to comply with demands:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable friend state what that amendment is?
I have not the Act of ·1917 here, and I can
not make it out. There is nothing in the
statute of 1919 that throws any light on
it.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not think
the trouble is to know what to put in, but
what to leave out.
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
fine was $100 when certain default was
made. This reduces it to $25.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: So, when one gets
at it, it is a very simple amendment. I

JUNE 3, 1921
think this is one of those cases to which
my honourable friend might draw the attention of the gentlemen who draft these
Bills.
Hon. Sir' JAMES LOUGHEED: I find
it easier to struggle with the question here
than to get them to do anything.
Section 4 was agreed to.
Section 5 was agreed to.
On section 6- date of coming into force:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the object of this section?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is to
be retroative as to the penalties to be imposed.
Section 6 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.

BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 222, an Act to
amend . the Returned Soldiers Insurance
Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen will
probably remember that in the Session
of 1920 provision was made for, a cheap
class of insurance for returned men, the
principal feature of the Bill being that the
Government would insure the returned soldier without exacting a medical examination. This Bill is for the purpose of extending tie provisions of that Act, which
are very much in the interest of the returned soldier, but of which he has not
availed himself to the full extent to w-hich
he would have been warranted.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bdll
was read the second time.
OONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the
Bill. Hon. Mr. Watson in the Chair.
On section 1-iprovision respecting insurance and limits thereof amended:

775

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This extends the Act to soldiers domiciled outside
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does that mean
men who have , served in the Imperial
forces?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No;
Canadians who are domiciled outside of
Canada.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-provision respecting payment amended:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the effect
of that âmendment?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
original section 3 of the Act limited the
amount of cash payment which might be
made on the death of the insured to onefifth of the sum insured. For instance,
in the case of a $500 policy the amount
of cash payment on death could not exceed $100, the balance being payable in
instalments. In the case of a $1,000
policy the cash payment could not exceed
$200. Complaint has been made by returned men that this initial cash payment
in the case of smaller policies is insufficient to provide for ordinary funeral expenses of the insured, and the beneficiary,
therefore, has nothing for her support out
of her insurance policy until the first instalment falls due. It is believed that the
minimum amount of cash payment on the
death of the insured should be $1,000,
except in the case of a $500 policy, when,
of course, the full amount of the benefit
witl be the face of the policy. The effect
of the amendment is that policies of $500
and $1,000 will be paid in full on the death
of the insured and in the case of larger
policies $1,000 of the amount will be paid
at death and the balance will be payable
in instalments.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Can any man
who is a returned soldier secure this insurance?
Yes,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
without medical examination. That is the
chief feature of it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable friend say what is the largest amount
they are allowed to insure for?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
thousand dollars,- I understand.

SECOND

READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The actual experience is that the well men do flot take this
insurance.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
designed to cover a class of men who could
not otherwise get insurance.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I -suppose that the
soldiers are satisfied with this. I do not
think it is very good kegislation. I think
that the whole $1,000 is toc, much to give
on the death of the insured. Probably $100
was too littie. People of that class are
apt to be improvident and inside the first
year the whole $1,000 may be gone, and
you will have themn coming back and
asking for something else.
However, if
they want it that way, I amrnfot going
to object.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUJGHEED moved
the second rcading of Bill 223, an Act to
amend the Pension Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill is the outcome of the report submitted
by the Special Committee of the House of
Commons to consider questions relating to
pensions, insurance, and re-establishment
of returned soldiers. The amendments in
the Bill consist principally of a slight readjustment of the pensions payable to
dependents. I do not understand that they
increase in any way the rate of pensions,
but, as a result of experience, they make
a somewhat different provision for the payment of pensions to certain of the dependents of the deceased.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
want it.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the
.Bill. Hon. Mr. Mulholland in the Chair.
On section
1-provision
respecting
rates of pension amended:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This is another
of those cases of amendment the effect
of which cannot be at ahl understood unless
one refers to the Act. I do not know
whether my honourable friend can explain
this or not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
a-i explanation with regard to that. Frequcntly the draftsman does not anticipate
the questions which occur to the penetrating mind of my honourable friend.

Thev

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What premium
is paid for this insurance?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
dependsý, I fancy, upon the age of the
applicant.
I think the premiums are
Lased very largely upon standard rates,
and are a shade less than standard rates.
I understand the premiums will be found
in the Act of 1920.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Sections 3 and 4 were agreed to.
On section 5-proviFion respecting limit
of benefits when death of insured due to
wvar amended:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
What is the
amendment in this clause?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: I think
this 'is to bring it into line with section
1, in which we extend the Act to men
residing outside of Canada.
Section 5 was agreed to.
Section 6 was agreed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the third reading of the Bil'.
The Inotion was agIreed to, and the
Bill was read the third time and passed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

CONSIDERED, IN

COMMITTEE

The object in a.dding the ivords "as such" i
to more clearly deflne the ontention of section
Il of the Pension Act, 1919, as amencied,
namnely, that pensions to or in respect of members of the forces can only be awarded wlien
the death or disability was d'efinite1y caused by
mili-tary service. The principle of "Insurance
during service," as applied to pensions, was, by
the te'rms of the Pension Act, 1919, diseontinued
after the declaration of peace, and the amen1ment makes no0 change in practice.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 do not quite
understand the meaning of what my
honourable friend bas read. Can he make
it any plainer?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: The
purpose is to make it clear that the pension can be awarded only when the death
or disability was definitely caused by
iîitary service.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I see.

JUNE 3, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
was some doubt as to whether or not a
pension was payable when death or
disability was caused otherwise. Assuming
that the man was in the service, his death
must have been eaused by xilitary service.
The purpose is ta clear up that doubt.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Sa that a man
who was actually in the serviceHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
death was not the result of service, then
he is not entitled to the pension.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: He do'es nlot get
the pension.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-provîsian' respecting
support of parents amended:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Pension Act, 1919, provided that deaths
due to misconduct were not pensionable.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Death?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
that deaths due to misconduct were not
pensionable. By the amending Act, 1920,
this was changed to allow of a pension
being awarded when the death had
occurred on service. That is, if death had
occurred on service it was pensianable
The
although there was misconduct.
anomaly thus arises that the dependents
of a member of the forces now on service
would in the event of death thraugh misconduet be -entitled ta pension, whereas on
death froni any other cause nlot directly
attributable to military service pension
would be refused. The amendment is
designed ta correct what was obviously not
the intention, and limits the date up to
which a pension may be awarded ta a
dependent of a member of the forces whose
death. on service was due ta miscanduct.
That exHon. Ms. DANDURAND:
planation does not caver section 2?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Yes.
That is, the dependent gets the pension under those conditions. It has ta do with that
purely.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Then it seenis that
these is a right ta the pension only if he
died prier ta the coming into force of the
Pension Act. Section 12 of the Act of
1919 says:
A pension sball not be awarded wben the
death or disablity of -the member of tbe forces
was due to improper condiiet as berein defined;
pravided that the Commission may, wben tbe
applicant is in a dependent condition, award
sucb pension as it deems fit in the circumstances.

777

Then, by the Act of 1920 we added
that clause:

o

and provided also that the provision of thie
section shall not apply when the death of the
member of the forces concerned bas occurred on
aervice.

Now we propose to add at the end of this
clause: "prior ta the coming into force of
the Pension Act."
One
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
has te travel through ail the intricacies of
many amiendments which have been made.
The object of this section is to limit the
-liability of the Crown to pension in cases
*where the man has died, not from miscon,uct, but from military service. The difficulty is that the present Act seems te be
rloudy in meaning. There are deaths from
venereal diseases and other causes of that
k-ind, and it is now proposed to clear up
,he liability of the Crown by limiting the
-pensions to deaths fromn military service
and excluding deaths froni miseonduet.
That is the clearest explanation 1 can
give.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: lYo I understand the
Minister te !!ay "including de.ath froin misconduct"!
No;
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED:
excluding. There is ne liability in that case.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1 think that is a
mistake.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That hardly explains the words tliat this section adds:
"éprias ta the coming into foree of the Pension Act." But perhaps we eau get no further with this, and we shall -have ta take
it as «it stands.
Section 2 was agreed ta.
Sections 3 and 4 were agreed ta.
On section 5-section giving additional
allowance ta widow and children repealed:
Hon. Ms. BOSTOCK: What is the object
of that?
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section 3 oïf the Pension Act is as follows:
When a penaion le awarded ta the wldow or
cblldrefl, or both, of a member of the forces
who ls not a pens&oner, on account of bis death.
to two
payment equivaient
an additional
montbs' pension shall be paid.

The purpose of this section was ta provide a bonus for the widow of a member
of the forces dying prier ta discharge,
The conditions which brought about this
provision no longer existing, it is proposed ta repeal this section.

778

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: With regard tu
the administration of this Pension Act, I
would point out that, while it is not perhaps the fault of officers at headquarters,
there are men receiving pensions who are
not entitled to anything like what they are
receiving, and on the other hand there are
men receiving pensions that are entirely
too small. Sometimes the local iboards are
too careful and take altogether too light
a view of the injury done to the pensioner.
Some cases of that kind have come under
my own notice. I know of two men who
are in receipt of very considerable pensions
and whose services to the state were worth
little or nothing; whereas men who were
excellent soldiers and rendered splendid
service to the state and have been badly
injured are not receiving what they should
receive.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend would at any time mention any case in which an obvious injustice
has been done, the Governmént will be
only too glad to have the case reviewed;
for these cases can be reviewed at any
time. If our attention is directed to it, I
shall see personally to a review of the
case.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I shall be very
glad to do so. I have a case in mind now.
I have to-day received a letter from a
man who is apparently unable to work.
An order was sent from headquarters here
for him to be taken to the hospital at
Lancaster; that is over at West St. John.
The doctor turned him out, and he is
receiving a pension of, I think, only seven
dollars a month or something like that. A
medical doctor at one place, on an order
from headquarters here, sent him to the
hospital, and then the doctor in the hospital
said there was nothing to be done for him.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will
my honourable friend give me the particulars? I shall have inquiry made.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I have a number
of cases. I have always found, when I
have spoken to officers at headquarters,
that they were desirous of doing the right
thing; they were courteous and kind, and
took the right view of matters. But some
of those local men, probably men who have
never themselves served, do not appear to
appreciate the situation.
I make this
statement merely because I want to do
justice to the headquarters officers, who
have been courteous, kind, and attentive
always.
Section 5 was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED

On section 6-pension of or in respect of
persons wounded or killed while in training,
etc., increased while recipients reside in
Canada:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
clause says:

I notice that this

The pensions which are now being paid to or
in respect of members of Canadian Naval or
Military Forces-

Does that not include the Air Force?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Those
who served in the Air Force during the
war belonged to the Imperial Service. The
Air Force was not the Air Force of Canada, although a great number of Canadians
served in it. They are under the Imperial
pensions.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: They do not come
under this?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This Pension Act
is a cintinuing Act, I suppose.

Does it in

any way apply to the men who are in the
service at the present time? There are a
certain number of Air Force men in the
Departments at present. As I understand,
there is a military branch of the Air Force
and there is a civil branch.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
Pension Act, as I understand, applies only
to members of the Expeditionary Forces.
This clause applies to pensions awarded
prior to the outbreak of the war to those
who took part in the Fenian Raid, the
Northwest Rebellion, the South African
War, etc.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, this does not
apply to the Great War?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
simply to extend the pensions under the
Act to those who participated in those
other wars.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It does not affect
the situation at the present time?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There are no men
in the permanent forces who are entitled to
any pension under this Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
have a Pension Act.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: A separate Pension Act?

JUNE 3, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, it
is a separate Act. They wouid corne under
the Pension Act if death.were due to miiitary service.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: They would corne
under this Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Weli, if
death were due to military service.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Now the Fenian
Raid veterans are brought under this Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED': Yes. 1
do not know whetber there are many of
them. lef t who are entitled to a pension. It
likewise appiies to, South African veterans.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 7 to 9 inclusive, were agreed to.
On Section 2-provision respecting support of parents arnended (reconsidered):
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, before finishing with this Bill I would
ask the Cornmittee to take up section 2
again. Reading Section 2, 1 find in the
wording of it nothing whatever to expiain
to anyone, at ail events anyone who is not
a lawyer and acquainted with these various
statutes, what is being done. It is, oniy incidentafly that one iearns that the effect
of this is to take away from a soldier who
has been unfortunate enough to contract
venereal disease any benefit fromp this Pensiion Act. I take it that a man who bas
venereal disease, while he may have haïd
no right to get it, is thereby punished
severely enough, and I think it is not good
poiicy to punish hiln stili more, and, further, to punish ail bis dependents; for this
Act affects flot oniy the soldier in taking
away bis pension, but it affects aiso
ail those who 4are in any way dependent
on him. ,It
may be bis
children. It may be bis wife, after he dies.
I do not think that it is wise or good
policy to punish a man who has already
been punished, -by excluding bis dependents
froni the benefit of the Pension Act- and
I wouid move the reconsideration of that
section 2. There is notbing in the section
as it reads to give any one an idea what it
refers to, and it was oniy incidentaliy that
I ascertained tbat it refers'perbaps to tbose
who have been unfortunate enough to contract venereal disease and die in consequence of it..
Hon.
motion.

Mr.

FOWLER:

I second that

779

Let
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
us understand this if we can. Section 12 of
the Act reads as follows:
A pension shall fot be awarded when thE
death or disability of the member of the forces
was due to improper conduct as herein defined;*
provIded that the Commission may, when the
applicant is ini a dependent condition, award
such pension as Lt deems fit in the circumstances.

At that tinie, under the original Pension Act, he was not entitied.
Now, under
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the clause as just read, be is not entitled,
but he niay get it.
His
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
dependents may. We arnended that by
adding:
and provided also that the provisions of thissection shall fot appiy when the death of the
member of the forces concerned has occurred
on service.

If he dies on service that does not appiy.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It means that be
can get a pension.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It means, as if be
neyer bad this disease.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
if he dies on service.
Then he is
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
forgiven.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
bis dependents get the pension. Now, we
sirnply amend this section 4 by providing
that he shall have died prior to the coming
into force of the Pension Act. That is to
say, if he died prior to the corning into
force of the Pension Act bis famiiy wouid
have been entitied to a pension and wouid
be drawing a pension to-day. That is ail
that we say. We do not propose that this
Pension Act shahl be made appièable to
tbe members of the Permanent Force and
tbose who may contract disease and wbo
xnay suifer frorn risconduct after the coniing into force of tbe Pension Act; that is
ail it means.
That is, after
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
Juiy 7, 1919?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then those wbo
participated in the great war will not be
aifected?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
No,
those who died prior- to September 1, 1919.
But those wbo
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
contracted the disease during their military
service and have died subsequent to' this
date, wbat about them?

7io

SENATE-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
would flot get it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think that would
be wrong. Why should the dependents
suifer?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
it is but reasonable to exclude those who
through obvious misconduct placed their
family in that position. Surely the Government of Canada is flot pensioning those
who through misconduct of this kind since
the Pension Act came into force wlll die?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No, but my honourable friend speaks of misconduct. The
conduct of those men, sQ far as their miiitary ýduty was concerned, might have been
above reproach. They might have been as
brave as Marshai Ney for us, and yet contract venereal disease. It means that, in
addition to 'being good soldiers, in addition
to 'being brave fighters, they must be pure.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No;
if tbey died through that particular, cause
that is a different thing.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
Died from that
particular cause?
Well, they may contract it easily enough. 0f course, it is
very wrong; but we have to Ineet human
nature as it is, and to realize the frailties
of the flesh, and men without knowing, without expecting that they are going to reap
such a fruit, do indulge in pastimes which
sometimes carry in their train just such
diseases as this. Surely their dependents
ought flot to suifer. When a man bas made
a good record in the war, it does not follow
that hie bas not been a good servant of the
public because hie bas met with niisfortune
by reason of contracting venereal disease
when away fighting.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have considerable sympathy with my honourable
friend, and I do not like to add to his
troubles. I knuw hie is wrest]ing with facts
that are intricate, and we should have
consideration for him. The enly point I
want to mnake clear is that of two soldiers
wbo have been stricken at the saine momient with the saine disease, on the saine
day, one will leave a pension to his chiIdren
if hie is lucky enough to die before a certain date, while the other one, if hie lingers
,over that mark, will leave bis relatives
notbing. I understand that to be the situation.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: If this Act refers
to those who contracted this disease since
the war bas ended, I bave notbing to say;
Hon. M. FOWLER.

but I understand that it refers to those
wbo contracted disease when they were
overseas and under unusual circumstances.
I bave no doubt that men contracted that
disease who, if they had been at home attending to their business in the ordinary
way, would not have contracted it at ail,
or have taken any line of action wbich
would give them an opportunity of doing
so. But, taking into consideration the fact
that those men were ail living under unusual and strange circumstances, if they
were unfortunate enough to contract
disease, and so unfortunate that that
disease really took their lives, I do net
think it is right or fair under any principle that their dependents should be deprived of any pension or anything of that
kind which otberwise tbey would bave been
entitled to.
That would be punishing the
friends for an accident to) the soldier, because there is no doubt that as between
those who took venereal disease and those
who did not, it was a mere toss-up-merely
accidentai. We can readily understand that
very many of the men made theniselves
liable to that disease wbo were fortunate
enough not to get it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 might
point out that this distinction must be
drawn: if a man died before discharge hie
got bis pension, but this relates to men who
were discharged long ago and who may
have died since.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
But they contracted it during the war.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, we
cannot tell that; that is one of the difficulties.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If they contracted
it afterwards, I bave nothing to, say.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The difficulty is to determine that. However, there
it is.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
Tbeir medical
history would show that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
Commons Committee on Re-establishment

MOTION AND INQUIRY

That, in the opinion of the Senate, it Js essential for the botter administration of the crimninai
law that a Court of Criminai APpeal should be
estsbliehod 'in the different Proyvixwes, with
Jurisdiction similar to thýat posseissed by. the
Court of Cri-minai Appeal in Engiand, and wjii
inquire whether it is the intention of the Government to croate such Courts.

He said: The leader of the House has
courteously allowed the debate on this resolution, which has stood so long on the Order
Paper, to be continued. I reiterate the
promise made when 1 first rose, that I
would bot disc-uss it at any great length.
This is due not only to the fact that we are
at the end of the Session and that I might
trespass on your time, but also because I
think the primary objeet of the mover of
the resolution was to ascertain the sentiment of this House and the feeling of the
profession and perhaps of the judges of
Canada as to whether they would favour
the introduction of legisiation foreshadowed
in the resolution. One distinguished member of this House has already spoken on the
matter-a distinguished member of the profession to which I have the honour to
belong.
The mover of this resolution, in bringing
it in -first, gave the history of the establishment in England of the Court of Criminal
Appeals. It had to meet the usual quiet
obstinacy, if that is the proper word, shown
against every ref *orm, as being somewhat
novel legislation. If you read the history

first Act was introduced in England in
1844, and from that time there was a
period of nearly 80 years before the present Act went on the statute book. Many

judges
eminent lawyers had spoken on it, eminent
legislators who were not lawyers had
championed the cause in the House; yet
it took that long period of education before
the court of Appeals finally found its
place on the statute book.
We have in fact important legislation
on subjects akin to that legislation, and
have wisely followed the legislation of
the old country, because the parliamentary
draftsmen connected with the Houses of
Parliament in the old country are most
eminent lawyers, and those Houses have
at all times among their members a percentage of the most eminent barristers in
England as well as a percentage of eminent
rolicitors. And the culture and varied experience of the Bar of England are of
enormous assistance aided by parliamentary counsel in passing legislation.
They have been cautions in all kinds of
criminal legislation, but we have proceeded more rapidly in Canada. We are not
trammeled by traditions. Take the Criminal Code, with which this measure would
be associated. You know that the Criminal
Code of Canada is very largely founded
on the English draft Criminal Code which
I think bas not yet found a place in the
statute book of England. It only shows
that in the newer country we are more
ready, and make more rapid progress
than they do in any old country.
Now I am going to gallop through the
few things I want to say. The court of
Criminal Appeals in England, constituted
in 1908, was as I say established by Act of
Parliament after long controversy and
long examination. A great many people
thought the Act was not required, that its
provisions would never be invoked. The
honourable member for Winnipeg bas
shown, however, that that is not the case.
He bas been good enough te furnish me
with a list of the cases that were heard
under the Act, which demonstrates that
the Act bas been of some active help in
the administration of criminal law in
England. Applications for leave to appeal
in the - year 1913 were granted in 111
cases. In addition, there were 33 appeals
on grounds involving questions of law.
In 73 cases sentence was confirmed, in
79 convictions were quashed, 47 sentences
were reduced, and 5 appeals were
abandoned. That is a good practical ilHon. Mr. WILLOTGHBY.

lustration of the fact that in England, with
all the safeguards around this Act, it is
serving a useful and necessary purpose.
My honourable friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. MeMeans), while dealing with
many phases of the question, did not deal
very fully perhaps with the actual provisons of the Act. Anyone can read it, and
I suppose that is one reason why I should
not deal with it at length. From the Act
and text-books issued at the time the Act
came into force, you will find that in the
first place the appeal must be against a
conviction; and that, in the second place.
it can be on a point of law or a point of
fact, or on a mixed point of law and fact.
Heretofore in Canada we have had no appeals, that is, from the higher courts, except
on questions of law. The trial judge sitting
in assize can, at the instance of the accused,
reserve a point of law for the consideration of the Court of Appeal, or he can refuse to do so, if he see fit, whereupon an
appeal lies to the court immediately above
for the right to appeal on that point of
law. But in this country there is no appeal on a question of fact. In England
they proceeded a little differently, but they
are practically on a parity with Canada in
the procedure. Formerly in England the
judges, not by compulsion but voluntarily,
conferred together in dealing with criminal
appeals, to establish a similarity of procedure. That voluntary conference ended
with the establishment in the early forties
of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved,
by 11 and 12 Victoria, chapter 78. That
was the first court established in England
for the purpose. That court had not jurisdiction to deal with questions of fact, but
could only try points of law. It disappeared with the coming into force of the
Judicature Act, under which the powŽrs
were vested in the Court of Appeal. Now,
the'new court can deal with a question
of law or of fact, or a question of mixed
law and fact. There is no appeal by the
Crown except in a case in which it is
certified by the Secretary of State that it
is desirable in the public interest that an
appeal should be brought, when it may be
taken to the House of Lords. But to aIl
intents and purposes, when the Court of
Criminal Appeals bas dealt with a casc,
it is finished. The judges of that court
are given very plenary powers: they have
power to amend a conviction or to impose
another sentence in place of the one already imposed, so long as the evidence warrants it.
They have also the power of

(Hon. Mr. McMeans) has dealt fully and
adequately with the mercy of the Crown,
which in Canada is granted through the
Remissions Branch of the Department of
Justice,- and, in the old .land, through the
Home Office.
I shaîl not say anything
further in connection with that. I shaîl
only ask whether there are cases in Canada
in which this court would be of service?
I say that the court in England has had
so many cases before it, and bas in so
many cases varied or' quashed the decision

your speech and ail the debate with grýeat interest andi hope you wilI be successful. I could
flot adequately diseuse the matter In this brief
letter, but there are many inequaities in convictions and sentences throughout the country
which render a reconsideratien Important. The
longer I amn at criminal work the more convinced I arn that it requires specialists, experts,
men wbose attention is continuous]y given te
such mattere.

That is the opinion of -a judge who has
had a very wide experience in.the administration of the criminal law,
Another
expression of opinion which deals more
with the question of inadequate and excessive punîshments, is an article from the
Montreal Herald of May 13. Under the
heading, "Two judicial sentences," it says:
Two remarkable sentences were recorded in
the courts in Montreal, one on Tuesday and
the other on Wednesday. In the former case a
youth of 18 was sentenced te flve years in -the
penitentiary for thef t; in the latter a man of
41 received a sentence of three yeai's for rape.
In the case of the boy he had been before
the court on one previous occasion, but no one
would pretend that this constitutefi a criminai
record or lndicated an ineradicable criminal
ten-dency. Under tfie severe sentence he will
berd with criminals during the most important
period of his life. The province provides a farm
prison for just such cases and detention there
for si-x or twelve months might have the beneficiai effect of preserving the boy te society.
In the case of the brute in human formo who
had comimitted a most vicious crime that will
cioud the whole life of a littie ohiid, the Judge
remarked that he deserved a life sentence and
the lash, yet the man was let off with a sentence
of three years on the ground that lie was under the influence of liquor. Our courts have
never recognized this as an excuse in palliation
of criminal acts; else one-haif of our convicts
wouid be at liberty hoe prey on society. Indeed
it hlas been held freauently not te extenuate
but te aggravate the offence.

That deals with a specific case and shows
the inadequacy of the punishnient in one
case and the excessiveness of the punishment in the other. Fortunately, by the
time Parliament prorogues a law will be in
force to reniedy that.
I 'would suggest to the honou'rable gentleman £rom North Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeains> that at the next Session of Parliamen.t hie should iintroduce this matter early
in the Session so thiat we may have a full

SENATE
discussion upon lt, and bring in a draft
Bill when we shall not be hampered by
lack of time.
Just a -word or two more as to the objection that has been made as to the phraseology of the motion. It says:
That in the opinion of the Senate it is
essential for the better administration of the
criminal law that a Court of Crimi-nal Appeal
should be established in the different Provinces.

It is no doubt true that Parliament cannot institute courts in the different provinces; -but we can institute the right of
criminal appeal; and I 'have no doubt that
the provinces will concur in setting up the
necessary madhinery to carry out the law.
We have the right to pass a law giving
the right to appeal, and I have not the
slightest doubt that if this Parliament provides for such a court-because to this Parliament is entrusted the enactment of the
criminal law-the various provinces will
readily establish the courts necessary for
carrying this into effect.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, I just wish to say two or three words
to bring to your attention a point of view
which -came under my observation this
afternoon in connection with an appeal
which I made to the Justice Department
on behalf of two persons. It came out.
particularly in one of these cases, that
sometimes the accused person is so overcome and stunned by the fact that he is
accused of a crime that he does not take
the necessary steps to procure evidence,
particularly evidence of previous good
character, which, if it had been brought to
the attention of the court, no doubt would
have gone a great way towards obtaining
his discharge.
In many of these cases which are appealed
the sentence is lessened, I understand, not
because the judge who tried the case made
a mistake, but by virtue of the fact that
under the law relating to appeal additioiîal
evidence can be prdcured. You can well
understand that when a man of previous
good character, and belonging to a respectable family in the community, is accused
of an offence, he is overcome by the disgrace and the excitement of the moment,
and neglects to take proper steps to produce evidence that might be of very great
value to the judge considering the case. If
there is an appeal new evidence can be presented. But it is not so easy to present new
evidence when an appeal for clemency is
made to the Justice Department, because
the question is immediately asked, "Why
was not this evidence produced in the court
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

at the trial?" Reasons have to be given
for the non-discovery of this evidence, and
it has to be shown that every possible effort
was made to procure all the evidence relating to the case before the trial was
closed. For that reason it is almost impossible to succeed in gaining clemency on
new evidence. You must very largely rest
your case on the evidence taken in the
court below, and the report of the judge
who tried the case. The virtue of the new
Act will be that new evidence can be produced; and, I imagine, it is largely upon
this new evidence that the sentences in
England have been lessened. This point
just occurred to me because of what has
recently come under my observation.
The motion was dropped.
DAIRY PRODUCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON (Minister of
Labour) moved the second reading of Bill
206, an Act to regulate the grading of
Dairy Produce.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
has been introduced by the Department of
Agriculture primarily for the purpose of
improving the grade and reputation of
Canadian dairy products in the export
market. There is very little further to be
said about it. The Bill is short, and perhaps, if there are any questions to be
asked, they might be dealt with when we
go ýinto Committee.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Honourable
gentlemen, I should like to address myseilf
to this Bill, for a few moments. First, I
should like to inquire of the Government
who is asking for this particular legislation. It is not the manufacturers or producers of these articles. It is not the
wholesale dealers. Who is it that wants
this legislation passed? That is a most
important question. It is a well-known
fact that Canadian cheese to-day the world
over stands on the high rung of the ýladder.
The men who have built up this great industry, I think, are quite capable of providing for its future wants during the next
five or ten years. This is a very serious
interference with the dairy industry.
As I understand the Bill, there are to be
graders appointed. Where are they to come
from? Are they to be boys who have had
six months' or a year's course in some agricultural or dairy school? Do they know the
conditions of the export trade better than
men who have been furnishing customers

JUNE 3, 1921
for the past twenty years, Who have

lives
in
the business,
an.d have made it what it is to-day? I
do not think so. We should have no interference regarding the quality of our export
cheese or butter. I know of no other country in the world except New Zealand and
Australia that has its cheese and butter
graded before being exported.
Why is
grading done in those countries? Because
the transportation takes so long a time and
the product is, exposed to such high temperature that it frequently deteriorates in
transit; but the Government certificate regarding the quality of the product relieves
the shipper of responsibility. The samne
conditions, I arn happy to say, do flot apply
to Canada. If we have goods that require
transportation in cold storage, we have
facilities on the steamer.
I have been engaged in this great dairying industry since the year 1873. Only
yesterday 1 paid out nearly $30,000 for
cheese; and I have bought as much more
for delivery next week. Surely I musthave learned something regarding the dairy
trade in that period of time; if not, I should
flot be engaged in it to-day. I know certain
customers in England and elsewhere who
can use a cheese that possibly niight not.

bas to go to the grader's store for a certificate, and is branded No. 2 and is exported
under that brand, I have to take a ecent or
a cent and a hall a pound less than its
actual value as a food product.
I fail to see any necessity for this legislation at this time. Take, for instance, the
cheese that is made in the month of JuIy.
I can remember certain seasons when it
was almost an impossibility to get what
might be termed finest or fancy cheese,
owing to the high temperature-something
over which the milk producer or the manufacturer bas no control. Many and many
a can of milk, I know, goes wrong in hot
weather. The milk is refused at the factory.
If it were made into cheese, the cheese
would deteriorate immediately. Now, that
can be used as a product; but if it is to be
branded as -second or third, whom are you
going to help by that? You are going to
injure the trade. You are going to injure
the dealer.
I take great pleasure in moving that
this Bill be not read now a second time, but
be read this day six months.
S-50

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In answer to
the observations of the honourable member
from Brockville, I would point out that the
proposed grading of dairy products is not
a new venture, as his remarks would lead
the House to assume. It was done on a
voluntary basis last year. At the port of
Montreal alone 4U~87 boxes of cheese, for
example, were înspected and graded, of
which 34,650, or 79 per cent, graded No. 1.
That cheese bas gone to the export market
bearing the approval of the Canadian
Governinent Inspector as being of A-i
quality. We know the importance of maintaining the reputation which Canadian
cheese bas gained in other countries, and
it is quite as important that'our reputation
should be preserved and extended to other
dairy products.
,There is an inspection of canned, goods
and of ail our abattoirs. The killing of
meat and its preparation for market is ail
done under inspection. If after years of
experience such inspection is proven to be
justifiable and in the public interest, why
is it not just as proper that the samne
general method should be adopted and' fhe
samne principle prevail in connectidîh with
dairy products?-e
,Hon. ]&r. ,efflUEzi Ï txnderstand that
it would not be compulsory upon anybody
to have his cheese or butter graded; that
this Ineasure is only for the purpose of
establishing a means whereby the grading
may be done in case it is required by the
owner of the goods. Is niy understanding
of the Bill correct?
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: In replyto the
honourable the Minister <Hon. Mr. Robertson), I might say that there is now a
grader in Montreal who will settie a 'Il
disputes over quality. If I buy a thousand
cheese from a dealer, and they are shipped
to Montreal, and if I find that 1, 2, 3 or 4
factories are of inferior quality, I go to
that inspector and get a certificate as to
how xnany 1's and 2sa there are in the lot,
and I can settle according to that certificate or can send back the stuif to the
man who owned it. That is the situation,
and that is what it should be.

difficult for us to understand what we are

to state whether I would be opposed to the

very objectionable to introduce legislation
of this kind at this late hour of the Session, when we are expecting prorogation
to take place so soon, and nobody, so far
as I know, has heard anything about the
Bill. I have to use a copy of the Bill

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This BilH1 has

dairy produce-

cheese and butter-should be inspected and
graded just as meat, canned goods, and
other articles have been inspected and
graded for years, in order that the consumers' interests may be protected, and,
further, that the interest of the Canadian
producers may be protected by seeing to
it, by means of inspection

and grading,

that nothing of inferior quality is marketed
in a foreign country as a superior Canadian
article, and thereby allowed to damage the
reputation of our dairy produce.

I trust,

honourable gentlemen, that the Bill may
receive its second reading. In committee
all necessary details can be discussed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Just before
leaving I heard the honourable member
from Brockville (Hon. Mr. Webster) make
an inquiry, and I do not know that he has
been answered. He asked who wanted this
Bill. Well, I am informed that all the
provincial Ministers of Agriculture, at a
conference, were unanimous in asking for
this Bill.
I am also informed that the
National Dairy Council asked for it.
I
understand, further, that the Dairymen's
Association of the Province of Quebec

want it.

I have received that information

from the president of the Association himself, who happens to be a member of the
other House, and who spoke in favour of
the measure this morning.
It appears, furthermore, that during the

war the grading gave great satisfaction.
An Imperial Commission, during the war,

hought cheese and graded it as No. 1, No.
2 or No. 3 quality, and that grading gave
great satisfaction to all concerned.
If
people have a good article to sell, they
naturally want the full price.
If the
article is not se good, they must be pre-

pared to accept less. If there is no grading,
evorybody naturally wants to sell his article
at the best price, and the effect is that

in other countries the reputation of our
cheese is injured.

Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: In reply to the
honourable minister, I might say that Mr.
Thompson, member of the House fron
Hastings, who is a large buyer, feels regarding this Bill just as I do. In answer
to the honourable gentleman who has just
taken his seat, I would say that the cheese

is net owned by the factory men when it
reaches Montreal; it is owned by the merchant in Montreal. Then why should you

give that man a certificate for quality that

l'e is shipping to some customer in England whom he has supplied for the last
twenty years, and who knows exactly what
he wants?

JUNE 3, 1921
Take, for instance, the situation throughout this country in the month of July,
when the thermometer is registering very
high. It is an impossibility for any man
to make finest cheese. It cannot be done.
Are you going to brand ail the cheese as
seconds? If you are, you are going to
take millions of dollars out of the Producers' peekets. It does nlot make a dollar's
werth of difference to me; I arn net interested in factories in any -way; but this
legislation is an interference with the trade
and commerce of this country. It is
making a soft job for some fellow.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honeurable gentlemen, I corne £rom a county that has the
largest cheese expert business of any
county in my province. In fact, it is the
dairying ceunty of the Province, and exporets more than ail the rest of the Province together. This Bill, I feel, will work
serious hardship to the manuf3acturers of
cheese in that county. It ýis of a kind
with the legisiation that I was objecting
to to-day-putting obstructions in the way
of business, putting impositions upon business, making cost te the people who are
engaged ln the trade, increasing the cost
to the people who buy, and diminîLshing
._he 'profits to the people who sell. It is
clearly wrong. You are going te appoint

1What is, the fact with regard to the
cheese business? Ganadian cheese stands
'high in the markets of tihe wurld, and its
reputation has been built up by the integrity of the men who have been en-gaged

honourable gentlemen. Yeu are 'here fer
a specific purpose. It is the partdcular
duty of this House te supervise legîslatiorýand te stand between the public and tbeiT

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 asked a question
of the Minister, because I. had net a copy of
the Bill before me. The question was net
answered, but I have since ascertained that
the Bill, if it passes, will net compel any
trader te have his cheese graded at aIl. It
is'only to provide for machinery se that
anybody who desires te expert cheese
abroad may have the advantage of ebtaining a certificate as te its grade from the
Government inspecter. I fail te see what
objection there can ýbe te that. The purpose is te maintain the quality and reputatien of, Canadian cheese in England or in
other ceuntries. This cannet d% any harm
te anybody, because nebedy will be compelled te have receurse te the grading provided fer by the Act.

SENATE

788

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have mentioned more than once since this debate bethe same information. The objection I see
to this Bill is that we really do not know
what it will involve. Section 3 says: "The
Governor in Council may make regulations."
I say we are really giving a blank cheque
to the Governor in Council to make such
regulations as the departmental officials
recommend. I do not think we know just
what we are doing under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Look at the penalty
clause.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I am referring,
not to the penalty clause, but to the regulations.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In answer to
the question raised by the honourable
member from De Salaberry, as I read the
Bill it does not definitely state that the
grading would be compulsory, but if I
am not mistaken it would be within the
power of the Governor in Council to make
regulations on that point.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I draw the honourable minister's attention to the fact that
he will not find in the penal clauses anything to prohibit the selling of cheese
which is not graded.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, there is
not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, you will.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I want to
answer one observation made by my
honourable friend from Sussex (Hon. Mr.
Fowler) in reference to the army of inspectors. There were 43,000 odd boxes
inspected last year by one man. It is not
the intention or expectation of the Department of Agriculture that it would take
more than three men in all Canada to
perforrn this work. There is also a provision in section 3 of the Act for the
imposition of fees to cover the cost. My
honourable friend from Brockville observed
that cheese made in July, for example,
might not be up to standard. I wonder
if it is desirable that our Canadian cheese
that is not up to standard should be sold
as standard cheese? Last year 79 per cent
of all the cheese graded was of grade 1;
13.5 per cent was grade 2; 7 per cent was
grade 3; 6.8 per cent was specially fine,
special grade No. 1. In my opinion-and
I do not pretend to be a cheese authority,
although I used to handle some cheese,
milk, etc.-the purchaser will receive in

graded and the grade is known. Then wc
vould not have a bad batch of cheese injuring our Canadian trade, as the export
apple business got a very black eye in
Europe a few years ago, because of inferior
grades going over to England in bad
condition, as honourable gentlemen may
recollect. I sincerely hope that this Bill
may pass, because I know it has received
the personal attention of the Minister of
Agriculture, who is a practical man, and
I am sure all honourable gentlemen will
appreciate that it is desirable legislation
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It seems to me
when there is so much opposition to the
Bill, that its introducer should be able te
give some reasons for it, saying where complaints have come from, whether from producers or from dealers. Personally I do not
know enough about the cheese business to
discuss it; but I know, in connection with the
grading of wheat, that in the early days
when we only had two or three grades,
very often a farmer took in a load of wheat,
and if it came just a little below No. 2,
say, while it might be worth only one or
two cents a bushel less than No. 2 quality,
he had to accept the price of No. 3, which
sometimes would be five cents or six cents
below No. 2. If it did not quite come to
No. 3 he had to take the next grade lower,
and I have seen the spread frorn eleven to
sixteen cents a bushel. If it is quite possible that in that respect the maker of a
batch of cheese that was not quite up to the
mark might get less, as my honourable
friend from Brockville says, than if cheese
was not graded at all, and he sold it for
what it was worth-practically on a sample
market, as we call the wheat market. All
that I wish to suggest is that, coming at
the dying hours of the Session, when we
cannot give it proper attention, might it not
be well to hold this Bill over till next year,
so that we might find out just exactly
what has been the trouble that is calling
for this legislation?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
The cheese of
Canada stands high in the old country
market and this condition bas been brought
about without this legislation, and we
ought to be sure that we are right when
we undertake to change present conditions.
As far as I can see, we cannot find out
before this session closes whether we are
right or not.

be given to the House in committee, but 1
think we are discussing details on the principie. The principle is surely right, as it
has long been established in this country
that meats, fruits, grain, if you like, should
be inspected under Government supervision, and Government guarantee as to
quality shouid accompany the article. It
is proposed 110W to extend that principle
to dairy produce. It has been practised for
some time, and I would-be surpriseýd if this
House would say that the principle was
wrong.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If this grading is
done, when once the seller bas the Government inspection, he is then entitled to coilect bis money for that grade, and in seliing te the other side he selis, like wbeat
and mnany Ctber products, subject to tbat
inspection. The minute there is Government
inspection, tbat is the umpire between the
seller and tbe buyer, and if it is wbeat

accept tbe opinion of the meinber from

Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: I wouid like
to ask the honourabie Minister what he
wouid do in the case of American cbeese
being exparted from a Canadian part?
You bave no contrai over that cheese in
regard to giving a man a certificate for
it. You cannat pass iegislation of tbat
kind bere; but you are gaing to put Canadian cheese up against the cbeese that is
not inspected. One baif of the cheese that
goes ta Europe goes from Montreal, or is
bought hy Montreal dealeËs. If it is a
good thing for tbe industry, wby is it not
appiied to that great republic ta tbe soutb
of us? What became of the Ontario Government's advanced legisiation passed ler
years ago regarding tbe manufacltrÉe of
cheese, or the quaiity of miliç.tw"be delivered ta cheese factories?- '4i1as it ever

Minister of Agriculture could inform the
bonourable Minister of Labour wbether, in
such an advanced country as Denmark,
whore dairy products rate so higb in tbe

similar ta tbis.

DAIRY

PRODUCE BILL

CONSIDERICD

IN

COfMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before 6
o'clock some bonourabie gentlemen were
iquiring for certain information respecting Bill 206. One of the questions asked

SENATE
was: "What interests in Canada are
asking for this legislation?" I find from the
Department of Agriculture that, first, all
of the provincial Departments of Agriculture have advocated it and asked that
it be enacted; second, that all the dairy
associations-they do not exist in all the
provinces, but they do exist in Ontario,
Quebec, and Saskatchewan, where dairy
products are extensively produced-are
asking for it; and, third, I find that the
National Dairy Council of Canada bas
joined with the others. So the dairymen
throughout the whole country, plus the
provincial Departments of Agriculture,
plus the Dominion Department, of Agriculture, all seem to be of one mind on the
subject.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: May I ask the
Minister whether he bas communications
from these bodies?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I have not
got them before me; but I had the pleasure
of being at one of the meetings where this
matter was discussed. I assume that this
louse will accept the statement of the
Department of Agriculture on this subject.
With reference to another question
asked as to the practice in other countries.
It was pointed out that the United States
might ship cheese through the port of
Montreal, and it was asked whether it
would be subject to this grading. I find
that the United States does not export
cheese in any large quantity, but, on the
contrary, that it imports large quantities.
Therefore it is not a factor in this matter.
The only large cheese-exporting countries
in the world are Australia, New Zealand,
Sweden, and Canada.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Will the
honourable gentleman tell me how many
American cheeses have already been exp.jrted through the port of Montreal this
year?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not in
a position to state.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Will you tell me
what the exports were last year?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I cannot.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: You are not
familiar with the situation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I say that
the quantity exported from the United
States is comparatively small when compared with the quantity imported into that
country.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Denmark and Holland are dairy-producing countries. They do not export cheese
in large quantities, but they do export large
quantities of butter. Denmark does not
permit the export of butter unless it grades
number 1. It must come up to that standard before it is permitted to be exported at
all. Holland has an optional system, which
is growing in favour, and it is anticipated
that Holland will shortly be on a par with
Denmark.
My honourable friend from Sussex (Hon.
Mr. Fowler) this afternoon expressed the
view that in the province of New Brunswick it would not be desirable to adopt the
grading system. My information from that
province scarcely indicates that to be the
opinion held there. Practically; all the
cheese manufactured in New Brunswick
during the past two years has been graded
for the local market by an official of the
provincial department of agriculture. The
dealers agreed to purchase only graded
cheese, and to scale the price as between
first, second, and third grade. The quality
of the New Brunswick cheese bas shown
marked improvement under this stimulus,
and relatively a much better price has
been obtained for it. I find that Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba have a grading
system of their own for butter, and that
butter is not exported from any of those
provinces unless it has undergone Government supervision and bas been graded by
an inspector. So the principle adopted in
this Bill is not new in Canada, and is
in keeping with legislation on the same
subject which is in effect in the three other
large dairy-producing countries of the
world.
One wonders, perhaps, just what the
objection can be to this system; and that
wonder grows, at least in my mind, when
I find that the buyers or brokers at the
port of Montreal at the present time have
a grading system, and maintain a man at
their own expense for that purpose. I cannot help thinking that a Government inspector could probably do the work just
as well and as accurately as that gentleman,
and that his inspection would be accepted
in foreign countries with fully as great
alacrity as the inspection of an employee
of the buyers of cheese themselves. Therefore I am more strongly convinced than
I was before obtaining this information
that the Bill is a perfectly proper one and
ought to prevail.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: I see that the
honourable Minister is not familiar with
the dairy industry.

this country has to be shipped to a place
where there is a grading store?
That
No.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

the Governor in Council as a grading store,
and any warehouse where cheese is stored,
which the Governor in Council may designate, is a grading store.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Suppose I have
a- car of cheese in Belleville, and I want
to ship it via Grand Trunk, by way of
Portland. Where would it be inspected?
It would mean unloading, extra cartage,
and re-loading the cheese.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 think it la
probably correct to say that these grading
stores will be located at points of export,
because this Bill deals with export.
.May I ask the Deputy Minister of Agriculture to corne within the Bar?

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do you not think
it would be better to have the grading done
at the factories? Otherwise it would be
unsafe to buy the cheese. How would a

answer that question?
I find that

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: ,There la flot
any obligation on the part of the owner of
the cheese to have it graded, unless he
desires to have it graded for export.
.Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: H1e is compelled
to do so then.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the cheese
is finally exported it must be graded before it leaves Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then it does not
make any difference what sort of cheese
you put on the poor -Canucks, so long as
you send the good cheese abroad.
1Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They can have
it graded if they want it
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: As the honourable gentleman has had the Minister's
opinion, may I say that'any man who has a

iiL

SENATE

factory and is selling cheese is very
anxious to have it graded, because, as I had
the honour of telling him this afternoon,
the minute it is graded there can be no
further argument. The cheese is sold as
No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, and there is a price
for each of these grades, and there can be
no argument as to the quality of the
cheese. If that is not done the cheese can
be culled. So every man doing business
wants to have his cheese graded at once.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: I explained that
situation to the honourable gentleman before dinner. The buyer goes through the
country; he visits the factory and inspects
the products; he makes a dicker with the
salesman, and the cheese goes on to Montreal. If there is some inferior cheese fourd
in that shipment, there is a man already
in Montreal, in the employ of the Goverrment, who will give him a certificate.
Before the product has left the manufacturer, it is not the property of the different
salesmen. If I am the manufacturer, it is
my property-the property of the individual. What right, then, has the Government to interfere and give a certificate
for export that is different from mine. I
find the grade myself. It is my money that
is in the business. Why should my product
be abused in that manner? It is Government interference by commercial legislation that makes people dissatisfied.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should think
that my honourable friend, as the owner
of a substantial quantity of cheese, would
be in exactly the same position as a man
running a factory who owned a smaller
quantity of cheese. If the grading were
done in the first instance, the result to the
owner would be exactly the same as in the
other instance, except that there would be a
larger quantity involved. I do not see that
there can be any difference as between the
two situations, and, inasmuch as cheese is
now graded by mutual consent of the
owners and the brokers in Montreal, the
question seems to resolve itself into this:
is it preferable that cheese being exported
from Canada should bear the stamp of approval of the Government inspectors as to
grade and quality, or is it preferable that
it should bear the stamp of grade and
quality of an inspector in the employ of the
owner of the cheese?
Hon. Mr. McCALL: Mr. Chairman, this
Bill calls for the inspection of butter and
other products as well as cheese. I feel
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

safe in saying that the inspection would be
of the greatest value if made at the creamery or at the cheese factory.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER:
place for the inspection.

That is the only

Hon. Mr. McCALL:
With regard to
other food products, such as canned goods,
evaporated apples, and condensed milk, the
Department of Agriculture have a large
staff of inspectors. They cover all the
slaughter houses. Those inspectors visit
the factories regularly, perhaps once a
week, and there can be no shipments made
from those factories unless the inspector
bas made an examination and granted a
certificate.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: The inspection is
made at the place of production.
Hon. Mr. McCALL: At the place of production. It certainly seems to me that to
have an inspection that will protect the
buyer, whether the home buyer or the
buyer for export, particularly in the case
of an article like butter, it is necessary to
have the inspection at the point of production, and that would require an army
of inspectors. Butter and cheese are produced all over this Dominion. For every
canning factory there are perhaps twenty
or thirty cheese factories or apple evaporators. There are also large shipments of
apples made in the fall of the year. I
feel that before I could give this measure my support I should know what is
to be covered by the regulations that
are to be made from time to time
-whether
or not there is to be
inspection at the point of production-the
only kind of inspection, I claim, that would
be of any value, or any protection to the
consumer, except perhaps inspection at the
cheese board or at the station from which
the cheese is shipped. In some parts of
Ontario, after the buyer has been at the
cheese board, there will be perhaps a dozen
factories, each having a half carload, and
the teams bringing in the cheese for shipment will cover the road for miles. If
there is an inspection at all, and if it is
not made at the factory, it should be made
at the station, at the point of shipment,
while the cheese is still under the control
of the buyer and the manufacturer is
present to protect his product. I feel
that the House should have more information, if it is available, as to what is coverei
by all the regulations provided for in section 3.

JUNE 3, 1921
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.- In answer to
my honourable fniend from Simcoe (Hon.
Mr. McCall) I can only state that the
.regulations are noV as yet worked out un
detaîl. Neither do I thin-k that it bas ever
been customary to go to the trouble of
working out aill'the deta¶ls under whicb
an Act may be operated, until it is known
wbetber or njt that work is .necessary.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: In o.Vher words,
you want a blank cheque.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I amn sure tbat,
in the regulations whicb govern the export
of fruit, ment, and other foodstuifs, under
laws similar to this, there has been no
abuse; if tbere bas been, I bave neyer
beard of it. The Department cd Agriculture sbould surely be as well truoted to
make regulations applicable to the situation as in any of the other cases. The
point raised with regard to the regulations would hardly seem to be a reason for
withholding consent to this legisiation.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Here is one
of the unfortunate aspects of Governnient
inspeetion. 1 know, of niy ow#n personal.
knowled4ge, of a gentlemn who last year
* bought one hundred barrels of applee.
When they arrived at bis store be x~rte
9
=r\ hei.H
tem. and made SelEcip
shÎý,pçdNtlue11fMxse 15àî4re1s ef apples
down here Vo Ottawa to, tbe inapector, by
express. Eleven days afterwards he received a reply, that the inspe-ctor tbought
they ought to.be classed as No. 2. When
he got that reply be called me into bis
store and said: "You have been a very large
packer and exporter of apples. I want to
show you something. Here are some
apples that I bought fromi Mr. So-and-So,"
in a certain city west of Brockville. "I
bought them for No. 1 and No. 2. How do
you classify them?" 1 saiýd: "I am not inspectîng them, but if I were buying I would
class them as No. 3 and No. 4." He said,
"That is just where they belong." Now,
what satisfaction did that man get? He
had to pay for those apples, every Ône of
'tbem, just as they had been marked by the
fellow who shipped tbeïm to him. That is
Government inspection.
Let mie give you anotber instanoe. I
know of a deaier wbo bought a earloed
of oats, inapected in Winnipeg. After a
very short time he went Vo unload it, and
be found six inches of good oats at the
top, and the rest inferioir in quality. He
came up Vo my office and wanted Vo kno.w
if I would corne do'wn and in-spect the osts
and report Vo Ottawa. I said: "No, there

793

is an inspector." I referred blin to the
inspector. He said: 11 spoke to the inspector six weeks ago about a carload f£rom
another firm, and I have not yeçt reoeived
a re'ply." That is Governrnent inspection
for you.
I say that the inspection should be made,
as the honourable gentleman from Simcoe
has pointed out, at the factory. Close yýour
deals there. Pay for the goods there, and
let every mnan inspect bis own product and
pay bis own money. The only proper place
for the tborough inspection of. the product is the cheese factory, where the goods
are on the sheif.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Honourable gentlemen, as representing a province which produces a large quantity of cheese, 1 would
like to, know if it is the intention of the
Government under this Act to appoint inspectors at various points in the province,
or to have one inspector going from factory
to factory.
There is a great deal in the contention
of the honourable gentleman from BXockville (Hon. John Webster). Anybq9y who
knows anything about cheese-_.an& I dlaim
to know consîderable aboe.it--knows that
the btqyeri. g1ýA4\<o)th-fÂctory, takes the
rn 4 off the cheese, looks at it and buys it
on its merits. Is it intended under this
Act that an inspector shall be located at
every place, or only at a central headquarters, like the cheese board clearing
kouse which we have in Charlottetown, or
what is the intention? I suppose, as the

Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: It is not worlcable

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As to the number of inspectors, I do not think it is the
intention of the Department to engage a
large number. There will probably not be
more than three or four, and they will be
located at points from which cheese is exported, and will be available to go to any
central point where cheese is collected for
shipment»to ports of export.
With regard to the case to which My
honourable friend froni Brockville (Hon.
John Webster) refers, regarding the inspection ot apples, I may say that I ami no
ýxpert in that respect, although I have
hauled many apples into the station and
rolled many barrels into cars. IV just ccurs to nie that theý three barrels which

opportunity of examining the lot, 1 do
flot think it would be considered to be a
fair inspection.
As to, the delay in the inspection of the
oats, of course I have no knowledge.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does the honourable gentleman suggest that the owner, at
his own expense, should have sent aIl the
apples to Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Goverament inspector should have gone there,' and
would have gone if hie had been requested
to do so.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-regulations:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
The honourable
member frorn De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique) seemed to think there was no penalty attached to violation of these regulations.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: On looking at the
Bill agaîn, I observe that there may be
compulsory grading under paragraph a
of section 6.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, no, I arn not
sayîng that at ahl; that is ahl righit.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is what
is provided.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, but there is
more than that. Under paragraph a of
subsection 1, section 3:
The G.overnor in Council may make regulations (a) for the grading of dairy prodýuce intended for export.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Well, if a man
violates any of those regulations, if hie
d'oes not have his stuif graded, hie is subject to a fine.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Or if hie disobeys any future regulations.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Or any future
regulations that may be made-not necessarily the regulations that are outlined
here, but any regulations.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I point
out to my honourable friend that that is
a very clear justification of the prnposal
of having the inspection at points of export, because the manufacturer of the
cheese at the factory has no idea as to
w.,hether the cheese will be exported or used

of weights, in bis inspection, takes a cheese

It is an irnpossibility. It is ridiculous te

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is the troubIe,
tbat the people wbo are devising these

Tbey are tbeorists, and they are tbeorizing

that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERT SON: I quite agree
with my honourable friend that I neyer
made cheese. Nevertheless I think that the
department's. officiais have undeubtedly exarnined into this matter very carefully. As
I stated before, this Bill bas been approved

795

by ail of the interests namned-the dairy
producers, the dairymen's associations of
the various provinces, and the provincial
Departrnents of Agriculture; and it bas
been worked out with the greatest care.
The regulations, 1 have no doubt, will be
acceptable-thiey must necessarily be ac-.
ceptable--to thos-e directly concerned in
themn. 1 suggest that the section be adopted.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: I may say, for
the .information of the Minister, that at the
*dinner hour I spoke to the Chairman of the
Committee on Agriculture, and hie told me
that it was owing to our being so close te
prorogation that he did flot fight this Bill
in the other House. H1e said: "If it had
net been for that, I would have taken five
hours and detained the House." He said:
"I hope the Senate will throw it out."
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: This question
deals with a very important branch of
agriculture. I amn disposed to agree with
the honourable member from Kings and,
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowier) that we shquld
net pass the Bill and give the Dep .ient
Power to make certain regij1alins and

pre se nt we kniow ii"11thing about. I was unfavourabie to the Bill when it was, brought
down this afternoen. Since six o'clock I
have made an effort to inquire from the
member for South Oxford, wbo represents
the most Important dairy district in Western Ontario, and hie expressed himseif as
strongiy opposed to the Bill. I think the
matter is of such importance that the Bill
might be held over for another year. To
authorize the making of regulations, as is
provided for in this Bill, is really, as the
bonourable gentleman from Kings and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) says, giving a
blank cheque. It may be ail right, but in
niy opinion the inatter is too important te
be dealt 'with in this way.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: May I ask the Minister if the passage of this Bill and the
establ'ishmnent of the system of inspection
proposed by it are going to do away with
the purcbasing on cheese boards, as it is
done in the part of the country where I hive?
There are cheese boards in the different
centres, the cheese is inspected at the
factory and reported upon, and the cheese
buyers from Brockville and other parts of
ihe country corne to the boards and buy.
TLey will take the factory product on the
standard that the inspecter bas given it,
and will pay one price te one factory,

SENATE
another price to another, and a third price
to still another factory. How is this Bill
going to affect that method of doing business?
The farmers who turn in their
mi'k to those factories that are co-operative appoint a salesman to go to the
cheese boards, and he either accepts or
refuses the offer made by the buyers of
cheese there.
They may hold over the
cheese and sell after the expiration of the
board, making a private agreement with
purchasers for the best prices they can get.
If the purchaser has to wait to have the
creese inspected at the port of export, I
cannot see how he is going to fix the price.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Ihere is no
comîpulsory inspection required at the
factory. The owner, when he goes to the
cheese board, will sell his cheese just as
he bas always done, but if be desires to
bave his price fixcd as a result or part of
the grading, that will be done. When he
gets to the place where it is graded he
may decide to sell bis cheese on that basis.
This will not necessarily interfere in any
w-y with the present practice.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: I know from
exoolience what the effect of this legislation will be. I am a buyer; I visit the
factories; I see the cheese; suppose there
are 200 cheeses in the factory, and perhaps
20 of them are not up to the standard.
The seller says to me, "Will you take my
cherse?"
J reply, "Not at the price of the
finest, because you have a few cheese there
that the
Government may mark as
seconds."
The result will be that the
seller will take from a quarter to a half
cent less for his cheese than he would if
this legislation were not on the statute
book.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: AI] round?
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Yes.
uon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I think the
sceler of the cheese would say, "I will ship
ny cheese to the grading station, and,
whatever it grades, I will take compensation on that basis."

lon. Mr. FOWLER: In order to make
this section so that J think we shall all
appreciate it, I offer the following amendmont to section 3:
After the word "may" in the first li.ne insert
the words, "subject to the approval of Parliament."

It would then read:
The Governor in Couneil may, subject to the
approval of Parliament, make regulations for
the grading, etc.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH.

Hon., Mr. MURPHY: That would mean
threwing it over till next year.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
I do not think
there is any such pressing haste for this
that it cannot be left over until next year.
There is a very good old motto, "Festina
lente," which means, make haste slowly.
Soretimes we make haste rapidly, and the
results are serious. "Subject to the approval of Parliament" would bring the
regulations before us; we would not be
giving a blank cheque. It seems to me
that would make everything right, and
then we shall have till next year to think
this over and talk with the people whom
we represent.
I come from a county
which is entirely devoted to the dairy
industry, and I would like to discuss this
matter with the cheese men in my county
so that I could vote more intelligently on
it than I can with the information I now
have. The honourable Minister has made
a fair defence of what I think is a very
bad case; but I would like to have further
information with regard to this.
Therefore J move this amendment.
Hon.
Mr.
ROBERTSON:
Speaking
against the amendment, may I point out
that to me as a layman-I do not desbre
honourable members to think for a moment
tbat I am attempting to give a legal opinion
-it
appears that those words would be
entirely superfluous. Surely Parliament has
the power to do anything it likes at any
time. What would be the sense of Parliament passing a law providing that the
Governor in Council might make regulations subject to the approval of Parliament? The Governor in Council has authority to do that at any time, and I would
think that the honourable gentleman's
amendment would not add anything that
could possibly be useful to the Bill-indeed, would hardly be in keeping with the
dignity of legislation at all.
,Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I would like
to ask the Minister why there is any 'rgent necessity for passing this Bill at this
stage of the Session?
Why was it not
brought down earlier so as to receive consideration by Parliament?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
My information is that this Bill was brought down
more than two months ago, and it stood
for six weeks before it went to the Coimittee of the·House of Commons. Honourable gentlemen are as familiar as I am,
perhaps more so, with all the reasons that
could be advanced as to why this Bill has
given precedence to what was regarded

7

JUNE 3, 1921
as more urgent legisiation up to the present tume. Some Bis have necessarily to
stand over tili near the close of the Session, and it happens that this was one
of those.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: In what Conirnittee was this matter considered?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Committee
on Agriculture and Colonization. I b'ýlieve.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Has this Bill beenexamined by the various dairy associations, and endorsed by them?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Lt has, and
thîs legislation has been .sought, or at least
is proposed, as a result of requests from
the National Dairyman's, Association, the
Dairyman's Associations of Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan, and of aIl the
Provincial Agricultural Departments of theà
varions Provinces.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Has the Bill itself,
in concrete form, been submitted to thosc
associations and received their approval?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

No, I think not.

Mr. MURPHY: The intent of the

The amendment of Hlon. Mr. Fowler was
negatived.
Sections 3, 4 and 5 were agreed to.
On section 6-penalties:
There is one
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
curious thing about the drafting of this
Bill. I do not know that it is important,
but in section 2 we have a definition of what
"égrader" means, yet in ail the other sections
of -the Bill the term used is "dairy produce
grader." I arn unable to see the object of
defining "grader" in the way this Bill is
drafted.
Hon. Mr,. ROBERTSON: I assume that
it is to prevent confusion, as with a grader
of canned goods or an inspector of meats.
I am informed that in the regulations
under which this Act will be administered
it would be nmade clear that the termn refers
to dairy produce grader.

take one-haîf or one-quarter of a cent less
than they could otherwise have got for the
cheese. If the honourable gentleman froïn
Brockville is able to pay haîf a cent more
for that cheese, and has put it off on England or Europe or any other country, I
don't think that is right. I think that this
Bill is a move;in the right direction, and
for that reason it has my support.
Whether it is expedient at the present
tume or not; is another matter.

DEPARTMENT 0F CUSTOMS AND
EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 211, an Act respecting the Department of Customs and
Excise.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in 1918,
by an Order in Council, the Department of
Customs and the Department of Inland
Revenue were combined under the name,
Department of Customs and Inland Revenue. Notwithstanding that, the ýCustoms
Act and the Inland Revenue Act each contain the sections constituting two departments. Lt is desirable now that the two
departments, by the Bill before us, should
be consolidated and made into one department. Lt is proposed to change the title
from Customs and Inland Revenue ta Customs and Excise, and to, make corresponding changes throughout the two Acts. The

a

SENATE
purposes in view are enumerated in the
different sections, and we shall save time
by going into Committee and dealing with
each section as we proceed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend bas introduced this Bill as if it
were a very harmless, ordinary kind of
Bill. The Bill bas been brought down in
the last hours of the Session, and if
honourable gentlemen have had time to
read it they will find one or two clauses
i it that are anything but harmless; they
are far-reaching, and may have very wide
effects when put into force.
As regards the sections of the Bill that
deal with the amalgamation of the Customs and Inland Revenue Departments
and the formation of a new department
under the name of Customs and Excise,
that is an ordinary matter, and I do not
suppose any one would raise any question
about that being done if it is thought that
in the interest of the country it should be
done.
But when we come to the other sections
of the Bill, we find that they raise a very
wide and important question. My honourable friend bas not made any mention of
them. He has not told us what his own
view is, but section 8 of the Bill deals
with a matter which I think we dealt with
in the Senate in another form some short
ago. This section 8, if I understand
tie
it rightly, deals very specially with the
question of trade and commerce. It
provides that on invoices of goods coming
into this country the value of the currency of the country from which the
goods come shall be taken at a certain
rate; that is to say, if the value of the
currency of the country whence the goods
are invoiced to Canada has dropped very
much below the par value of that currency
before the war, under no circumstances
shall that currency be valued at less than
50 per cent of its par value as it was
before the war. Now, every honourable
gentleman knows that the value of the
currency of a large number of European
countries at present is exceedingly low;
and the effect of this legislation, if it
goes through, will be that the value of the
goods in the invoice will be raised very
considerably, and the duty charged will
amount in some instances to 10, 20, 50,
100, even as bigh as 200 per cent, which
of course, in the latter case, would be a
prohibitive duty. At the present time
Canada wants to trade with other countries. We do not want to be injuring and
interfering with the trade of the country
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

and preventing other people from trading
with us, or hindering Canada from trad:ng with other countries.
As honourable gentlemen will remember,
some time ago Canada made a loan to
Rumania, and I presume we hope to get
that loan repaid; at any rate, we hope
some tinte to get some interest paid on
that loan; but I do not see how we are
going to get that if we pass legislation of
this kind, which will very seriously affect
the trade between Rumania and Canada.
The currency of Rumania to-day is
down to a very low level, and the effect
of this legislation will be that we shall
be putting a duty of something like 150
per cent on goods coming into Canada from
Rumania. The same thing will apply to
Greece; any trade we can do with that
country will be affected in the same way.
In regard to Italy the same rule will
apply. The Italian lire is to-day worth
about 6 cents in our money; at its par
value, it is worth about 19 cents. Under
this section of the Bill an invoice made
out in Italian lire would be calculated on
the basis of 6 cents, but when the value
of the invoice has to be arrived at for the
purpose of arriving at the customs duty to
be paid, the value of the lire would
be raised to 92 cents, or a 50 per
cent increase of the invoice before the duty
was charged. Honourable gentlemen can
see that that is going very seriously to
affect the trade of this country, and that
it must and will do considerable danage
to Canada.
Canada to-day wants to get into as many
of the markets of the world as possible.
As we know, recently in the United States
legislation has been put through which is
going seriously to affect the trade of this
country with the United States; and if
we are going to pass such legislation as
this Bill proposes, we shall make the conditions throughout Canada worse than they
would be if we did all we could to encourage trade between Canada and those
other countries.
Another country whose trade is of course
going to be seriously affected by this legislation is Germany. The German mark,
at its par value, stands somewhere between 23 and 24 cents, but to-day its value
is a little under 2 cents. If we take it
at 2 cents, it means that on goods from
Germany coming into this country the invoices would be increased to six times the
value that they had when they left
Germany. When the honourable member
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
brought in his Bill to exclude German

JUNE 3, 1921
goods from this country, the Senate, after
discussing it, did flot approve of that legislation; but I think that was a very much
more open way of dealing with the question than the method proposed in this Bill,
of giving an arbitrary value to the Gerinan
mark.
If -.ve are going to pass legisiation of
this kind, I would like to ask the honourable leader of the Government what is the
use of members of the Government addressing people in this country and trying to
explain to them the value of the League
of Nations? If we are flot prepared to carry
on business with these other countries, if
we are going to do everything we possibly
can to prevent trade with them, personally
I do not see any use for the League of
Nations. The whole idea of that league is
to bring the various nations of the wor]d
into dloser relations with one another so
that they may understand one another,
and in that way we may make progress
and prevent wars coming about in future.
The very best possible way in which we
can go about promoting wars and creating
trouble in the world is by passing legisiation of this kind to prevent countries coinxnunicating and trading with one another.
0f course, if the people of this country
ý0'ý not wish to trade with Germnany o>r),aedo
0,punt of the feeling that they siMi have
ag4inst ,e Germap 1)pja4e,ber4e of the
way 'in'w)i*r'he acted ýduring the war
and have been acting since the war, it is
quite open to thesu to refuse to buy Germnan goods; but, on looking into the figures,
I find that last year we bought f rom Geriy.any $1,547,000 worth of goods. 0f this
amouint $1,014,000 came in duty free, and
$533,000 worth was dutiable. On the other
hand, we sold Germany $8,200,000 worth of
goods. So our sales were $6,653,000 in excess of our purchases. 0f the goods that we
sdld to Germany last year $5,340,000 were
in the form of vegetable products, and $2,238,000 in the form of anima(l products.
Honourable gentlemen will see from these
figures that if we are going to stop the
trade between Canada and Germany, we
shall be striking a very severe b$Iow at the
farming community. One of the items that
Germany
bought from
Canada was
asbestos, to the extent of $600,000 worth.
Proba'bly Germany would have bought that
from us anyhow, because nowhere else in
the world that I know of cou¶Id she get it.
But I think the Government, ini placiiig
this clause ini the Bill, is very badly advised, and when we get into Commnittee I.

hope .that honourable gentlemen will examine the matter very carefully, and that
we may be able to make some change in it.

SENATE
On section 7-valuation for duty at not
less than wholesale prices:
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Who fixes the
reasonable profit?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Custoins authorities-the Minister of Customs.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Will there be any
regular rule that a certain rate of profit
will be allowed?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
profits a wholesaler or manufacturer would
expect or would receive. That might vary
with different products; but it is a matter
that will necessarily come within the knowledge of the Department of Customs, and
they have the machinery for ascertaining
and determining it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I hope it will not
be what the manufacturer might expect.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No;
what he usually receives.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable friend say what is usually considered
a reasonable profit?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
a matter of trade; it is pretty well determined by trade. I could not mention
any arbitrary percentage, because wihere
there is a very large turnover the percentage of profit is very much less than where
there is a very much smailler turnover.
That will depend on the nature of the
goods.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But the officer of
the Department or the Minister would not
know what the turnover on this particular
business was.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It
would depend upon the dharacter of the
product. That is to say, there is a class
of product which represents a very large
turnover-products of general consumption that all the community may consume.
On the other hand, there may be special
articles whidh have a very limited consumption, and upon whidh the profits would
consequently be larger.
Section 7 was agreed te.
On section 8-valuation of currency:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Will my honourable friend explain this section?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend has gone fairly largely into
that subject. I may say that it is felt
that in some foreign countries, w'here the
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

paper currency has become greatly depreciated, prices of domestie raw materials and
labour costs stated in terms of the standard.currencies of the countries have fallen
much below the normal. The limiting, as
proposed, of the allowance of depreciation
of the paper currencies will have the effect
of correcting this to saine extent, and will
cause the duties on importations into Canada to correspond more closely to the duty
return on normal values.
My honourable friend spoke of the depreciation of the mark, and illustrated it
as falling to about 2 cents, and of our
bringing into operation this principle upon
that reduced or depreciated currency.
That cannot happen under this clause,
because we are limited to 50 per cent. In
no case is the reduction to be below 50
per cent of the par value. Therefore, no
injustice will be done, and no excessive
duty will be levied by reason of that. It
must be manifest that if the value is to be
taken in a depreciated currency and set
over against our dollar, it would mean
practically free admission into Canada.
That would not only handicap our manufacturers, but would defraud the Canadian
exchequer of the duty that should be legitimately paid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It means that
what you have bought in Germany for 2
cents will be valued at not less than 121
cents,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
not buy at 2 cents.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: You buy in Germany. If you paid gold there you would
pay 2 cents per mark, and when you
brought the article here you would pay
duty on 12 cents.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is what
this clause means.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes; but if you do
not do that, you close up every factory in
Canada.
You
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
might as well take down all your barriers
and let Germany come in.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Has the Government taken into consideration the fact
that many more marks have to be paid for
the article there? Say you want to get a
meal-I do not say you are going to import meals-but if you want to get a meal
you have to pay ten times as many marks
The invoices will show a
as formerly.
great number of marks.

JUNE 3, 1921
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If you want "to
buy wine in France to-day, you have to pay
about double the number of francs, or
two-and-a-half times as many as you used
ta. The price bas risen ta such an extent
that I actually cancelled a consignmnent
of brandy.
It would have cost in aur
money about $75 a case in France. They
have simply raised the price as the money
depreciated.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: They have not raised
the price in proportion.
The mark is
worth 2 cents.
But they 'have raisedt
prices only three or four times, not twelve
times.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I do not understand this yet, and I should like ta have it
cleared up. My understanding of the
matter is this. If I took $1,000 in gold aver
ta Germany ta buy goods, I could buy
marks at 2 cents per mark or under, and,
as my honou.rable friend *has just stated,
while the mar k has gone down considerably
the goods have not gone up in proportion.
The resuit would be that I would pay
$1,000 in Canadian money for those goods,
and when I would bring them ta Canada and
enter them at the Customs I would pay a
duty, not on the $1,000 which I paid for
the goods, but on about' $6,000. I would
be paying six times the rate of duty because
of this law being in force.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: There is no reduction over 50 per cent.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: If you bought the
gaods at the old price, the mark would be
worth 24 cents.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend states that I would pay perhaps
twice as much, or possibly three times as
much.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
much.

Six times as

Han. Mr. TURRIFF: If I paid three
times as much when I brought; the goods
into Canada, I would pay duty on about
$3,000, 'instead of $1,000.
Sa, on goods
ordinarily carrying a duty of 85 per cent,
I would be paying about 100 per cent. I
have heard a great deal of argument in
this Chamber during the past year on the
necessity of getting an export market for
the goods manufactured
in Canada.
How can any one think that we
S-51

80i

shall get an export market for goods made
in Canada if we shut out goods from other
countries by putting 100 per cent duty on
themn?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
It has been
figured out among the business men that
the duties will amount; ta more than the
price of the article.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Might I give
the House a concrete instance of just how
the present law works out by reason of the
debased currency? We have a substantial
number of lithographing establishments in
Canada. At the present time they are
practicahly out of business-why?
The
minimum wage they pay their workmen,
and have been paying them for sonie
time, is
$6
per
day.
The 1lithographers ia Germany to-day are working for 40 cents a day in aur money.
Therefore the Canadian buyer of calendars, almanacs, bill-posters, or anything
that hie wants in that line, can purchase
those goods in Germany and bring them
here, paying duty at the present time on
one-twelfth of the actual value of the goods
in Canadian maney. He may bring them
in hêre at a valuation far below the lowest
possible cost of production in Canada. That
is only one of mnany lines, and, because of
the 'debased currency, the competition that
is coming ta aur Canadiail manufacturer
is contributing very seriously and substantially ta aur present unemployment situation in Canada. If a man takes to-day $100in gold and purchases $100 worth of goods
in Germany, at the present rate of the
market, what does hie get? Twelve hundred
dollars worth of goods.
Some Hon. SENATOIRS: No.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. This Bill
states that he must pay duty on at Ieast
fifty per cent of that. The valuation for
duty miust be at least fifty per cent of the
value in German currency.
lion. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Twelve cents
for each mark.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It ought to
go even much further than that; but surely
we oughlt not ta permit a situation to exist
whereby, becs use of the debased German
currency, goods can be bought under such
conditions and brought over here and sold
la Canada just below the cost of production la Canada. Mmnd you, the consumer
does not get the benefit. Our manufacturing is closed down, and the consumer pays
the shot just the samne.

REVISED EDITION<.

SENATE

The Minister
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
surely does not mean to say that in Germany men are now working at 40 cents a
day. That is 27 marks. How do they buy
shoes? A pair of shoes costs 200 marks.
Perhaps the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
fact has been overlooked that there is a
domestic and a foreign value on German
currency.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
point out to this Chamber that, under the
tariff legislation now before the United
States Congress, it is proposed to admit
German goods only upon the value of the
goods in the United States. That is much
less favourable than what we intend do-

as I see the matter, if this legislation goes
into effect, all German goods will come
through Holland or some other country
which has not such a duty against German
goods as we are placing against them, and
whose currency is at par, or the same as
Canadian currency ýto-day. The consequence will be that all the German business with this country-such business as
is desired to be done-will be done through
Holland; but Italy will not be helped in
the same way, because its business is done
in a totally different manner, and it could
rot take advantage of the situation of
Holland.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That would be
much fairer.
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
German mark is atHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: A cent and a
half.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
at 1.6; that is, about one-thirteenth or
one-fourteenth of its par value. It seems
to me we are dealing very generously with
Germany when we place the value for duty
at fifty per cent, which would represent
practically 11 cents and a fraction, or
nearly 12 cents, on the mark, whereas the
value of the mark is below 2 cents. It
seems to me we restrain ourselves in not
going below 12 cents, or 11 and a fraction.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
The honourable
the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) pointed out that a certaih class
of workmen in Canada received $6 a day,
whereas men doing corresponding work in
Germany got 40 cents a day, in our money,
and he proposed that that situation be
regulated by this legislation. I would like
to ask my honourable friend this question.
Is it the policy of the Government, when
in other countries competing with us the
wages paid for the making of certain goods
are much lower than in Canada, because
the labour men in this country, through
their unions, are able to keep up their
wages, that the Customs Act is to be
amended so as te enable such goods to be
made in Canada, regardless of the cost of
labour or of what is being done in those
other countries? If that is the case, what
hope can we have of trading with other
countries? Can we trade with them if we
deliberately, through the Customs Act,
undertake to shut out their goods because
they can be made more cheaply there than
in Canada?

ing.

My honourable
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
friend speaks of Germany, but it is not
Germany alone that we are hitting in this
matter.
We
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
are dealing with all countries with depreciated currencies.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes; and the
trouble that I see in the matter is that
we have advanced money to some of those
countries. We are in a curious position.
We advance money to a country, and we
want to trade with it, but immediately
we put an obstacle in the way of trade between that country and ourselves. As I
said before, if it is Germany that the
Government wants to bit, the proposal
made by the honourable gentleman froin
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) in
this House last session would seem to be
a more intelligent way of doing it; because,
Hon. Mr. ROBEPTSON.

Oh,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
well, we shall have to take our chances
with that.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The policy of
the Government is to protect Canadian industries and Canadian workmen as far as
is necessary to prevent the destruction of
the industries and the throwing of the
workmen out of employment. In this particular instance the proposed action is not
due to any trade unions in either country;
it is due to the debased currency in Germany, where $1 of our money is at the
present time worth almost $14. The German manufacturer and the German workingman, if paid in our currency, would
thus have the tremendous advantage of
something like 1,200 per cent. This most

JUNE 3, 1921
serious situation is to some extent rectilied, and protection is given-not as far as
I think it should go-to, our Canadian
workmen and Canadian industries.
Section 8 was agreed to.
On section 9-entry of goods outward
by land conveyance:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
is to correct an error appearing in the
fourth line. The word "landing" should
have been "lading."
Section 9 was agreed to.
On section lO-Customs house brokers
may be licensed at any port by Collector,
subject to approval by Minister:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Has the Government been licensing these brokers heretofore, or is this a new provision?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
an entirely new provision.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the reason
for it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: So that
we rnay have more control over the matter.
Heretofore we had not control.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Anybody could
be a customs broker before, if he wanted
ta be.
Section 10 was agreed to.
Sections il to 14, inclusive, were agreed
to.
On section 15-beer casks, barrels and
botties to be stamped with name and address of brewer or bottier, also per cent

was read the third time and passed.
PATENT BILL

Bill 140, an Act to amend the Patent Act.
-Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
-SEOOND READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I fear
that this Bill has not been printed, although my honourabie friend (Hon. Mr.
Bostock) has been furnished with a copy
of it. 1 suppose that if the clauses are
read at the Table honourable gentlemen
will readihy comprehend them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we should
have the Bihl as it was passed by the House
of Commons.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 have
the Bill as passed by the Commons, certified to by the Clerk.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has it-been
very much amended?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
purpose of the Bill is to grant relief to
patentees and inventors who, through dis'.
turbances caused by the war, have either
lost their patents by violence throuigh
failure to manufacture and non-payment
of fees, or have failed to obtain patents
for their inventions by not applying wvithin the prescribed time. The Bull is in line
with legisiation enacted by most countries
eng-aged in or affected by the war, which
us gencrally referrcd to in patent cirches
as "cleaning up" legisiation, as it removes
a,, to patents ahi the traces of the war
remaining after the operation of the

SENATE
treaties and previous war legislation.
There was a suspension during the war,
by agreement; in fact, it was agreed under
the Treaty that that suspension should be
recognized by the various parties to the
Treaty.
The Bill is also for the purpose of
securing for Canada the benefit of what is
known as the Nolan Bill, passed in the
United States on the 3rd of March last,
which extends for six months from its
passage the time for filing belated applications for patents, but only in favour of
such countries as pass reciprocal legislation within that period. It also makes
certain changes as to payment of fees.
is necessary during the present
i
Session to take advantage of the reciprocal
provisions in the Nolan Bill, by passing
this legislation. It is simply to place the
Patent Act where it should be after the
cessation of the disturbances caused by the
war. As honourable gentlemen• will probably remember, Canada, like the other
Allies, passed certain Orders in Council,
or certain war legislation, dealing with
patents.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Laird in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask permission to bring in Mr. O'Halloran,
the Commissioner of Patents?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the
honourable gentleman inform the House as
to the value of the German patents which
were set at naught during the war?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
informed that none of the patents were set
at naught. We issued licenses on a royalty
basis during the war. We did not in any
way interfere with the ownership, and they
will revert to the owners.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
But the countries in continental Europe have taken possession of all the German patents.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that the course which we pursued is
that which was pursued by the other Allies
in regard to German patents.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then we own
them. I think I could show you.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question
which occurred to me was this: Have those
rights of the Germans throughout the world
been forfeited?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Have they lost
the rights which they had under the
patents?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -and
anyone availing himself of the advantages
of the patent did so by license issued by
this Government, through the Commissioner of Patents.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Are these licenses
to be continued, or cancelled?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
licenses are continued, of course subject
to the intervention of the Government at
any time to cancel them. Now it is proposed to repeal the first two sections cf this
Rili, which deals with fees. The fees for
patents are very varied, and it ias long
been the attitude of the Senate, under a
number of Bills that have come up from
time to time for renewal of patents that
had lapsed, that the Government should
adopt a different policy with regard to
fees. As honourable gentlemen will recall,
the fees were payable in instalments, and
where the patentee neglected to pay the
fees the patent lapsed. Now we are trying
to get over that difficulty by fixing a fee
which will avoid lapses.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Only one fee
for the wholeterm, as in the United States?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
With the permission of the House I will
read the clauses that we propose to repeal;
they form part of section 23:
But, at the time of the application therefor, it
shall be at the option of the applicant to pay
the full fee required for the tern of eighteen
years, or the partial fee required for the term
of six years, or the pantial fee required for the
term of twelve years.
2. If a partial fee only is paid, the proportion
of the fee shall be stated irn the patent, and
the patent shal, notwithstanding
anything
therein or in this Act contained, cease at the
end of the term for which the partial fee has
been paid, unless before the expiration of the
sai.d term the holder of the patent pays the
fee required for the further term of six or
tw'elve ears, and obtains froin the Patent Office
a certificate of such payment in the form which

JUNE 3, 1921
is, from Urne ta time, adopted, which certificate
shall be atrtached to and refer to the patent, and
shall be under the signature of the Commissioner
or of the Deputy Commissioner.
3. If such second payment, together with the
first payment, makes up only the fee required
for twelve years, then the patent shall, notwithstanding anything therein or la this Act
contained, cease at the end of the term of
twelve years, unless at or before the expiration
.of such term the holder thereof pays the further fee required for the remaining six years,
making up the full term of eighteen years, and
obtains a like certificate in respect thereof.
47. The following fees shall be payable before
an application for any of the purposes herein
mentioned shall be received by the Commissioner, that is to say-

It is unnecessary for me to read the
patticuilar items of the tariff; tlhey number twelve or thirteen items.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-tariff of fees:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: These fees are
very much lower.
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, I
would say the fees we now charge are
probably more reasonable. There is one
fee for the whole term.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Thie fee for the
whole term before was $60; now it is only
$35.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Just
by way of illustration: On filing an application for patent, $15 is paid; on grant
of patent, $20; thet is $35 for the whole
term of the patent; whereas there was a
ful fee for 18 years df $60, a partial fee
for 12 years of $40, and a partial fee for
6 years of $20. But we are exacting other
fees, Which will represent an additional
income in favour of the proposed Bill of
$112,625.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is no
question but that $35 for the whole terhi
will give a much larger return, for, as the
Deputy Minister could tell-us, a large proportion of inventions are never renewed.
Sections 2 and 3 were agreed to.
On section 4-no patent void by failure
to make or by import between lst August,
1914, and 10th January, 1922.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Has my honourable friend any information as to the extent of that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
clause is for the purpose of removing any
uncertainty as to the meaning of section
82 of the Treaty of Peace order, 1920. The

805

Justice Department has given an opinion
that it applies to patents in force in
August, 1914. There is greater reason
why it should apply to later patents.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-time extended for paying
fees:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The following has been added as subsection 2 to
section 5:
(2) The privileges set forth in this section in
so far as regards payrnents of fees on patents
already obtained and lapsed by reason of nonpayment of such fees are hereby granted only
in favor aft nationals and residents of Canada,
but the Governor in Council may extend the
same ln favor of citizens or subjects of all
countries which have extended, or which now
extend, or which within the period of si.x months
from the passage of this Act shall extend substantially reciprocal privi.leges to citizens or
nationals of Canada.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
tu bring it into conformity with the Nolan
Bill passed in the United States.
The amendment was agreed to.
Section 5 as amended was agreed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honoarable friend give us exactly the meaning
of that proviso? It is rather confused.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
taken exactly from the Nolan Bil:. It is
praotically similar to a clause which we
invariably insert in our Bills-that, in the
hiatus which occurred between the lapsed
time and the life of the patent, those who
took advantage of the patent shall be protected.

those who had commenced in good faith
to manufacture.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
in a later section-No. 8 of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This should he complete.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, this
is the clause which has been taken from
the Nolan Bill, which is reciprocal legisiation, and we have to use the same ianguage.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8-saving rights of persons
who have commenced lawfully to, make,
use or seli invention while patent was void:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: So that if a man
has started he is protected?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: Yes,
even though he has not entered on the
manufacture.
Section 8 was agreed to.
On section 9, subsection 2-orders and
regulations in force for one year:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Why is it necessary to keep the order in effect for one
year?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
orders rend that they shall continue in force
during the continuance of the war and for
one year after, and the war is stili on: i
the opinion of the Justice Department, we
are stili at war.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Whom are we

THE NEXT GOVERNOR GENERAL
RIUPORTED APPOINTMENT
BYNG

OF VISCOUNTI

On the Orders of the Day:
I would
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK:
like to ask the honourable leader of the
Government if he can confirm the report
that apipeared in hast evening's newspapers
as to the appointment of a successor to
His Excellency the Governor General. It
was stated that Lord Byng had heen
chosen. I noticed also a certain criticism
of the fact that that announcement comes
from Enghand to the newspapers here.
The point is made that, inasmuchi as
Canada now occupies such a prominent
place in the aff airs of the Empire, the announcement should have been made simultaneously in Ottawa and in London, and
that it is somewhat of a reflection on Canada that the announcement shouhd have
been flrst made in London and then sent
to Canada.
I would also like to ask the honourable
leader if the Government were consulted
on the question of who should he chosen
as the next Covernor General, and whether
they think that in the present condition
of affairs the interest of the country is
best served by having as the next Governor General a man whose whohe training, so far as I know, has heen in military
affairs. At the present period we are
dealing with the question of reconstruc-w
tion, hoping that war is over; and the
solution of the many difficulties we are
hiable to meet in the future wilh be, we
hope, ahong economic lies, and not ahong
the lines of militarism and war. It is
quite true that my honourable friend (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) stated yesterday that
we were stihl at war; but the country hopes

JUNE 4, 1921
that such is not the case; that, as far as
Canada is concerned, we have entered on
the period of reconstruction after the war,
and can face the questions and difficulties
that confront us with confidence that we
shahl not have to be invoived in military
matters for a long time to cerne. Therefore I would like the honourable gentlemnan to give us some reason as to why a
gentleman has been chosen whose whoie
training is in military affaira.
0f course, I thoroughly appreciate that
Lord Byng has thoroughly endeared himself to the men who served under him
during the war; that hie has a very high
reputation in ahl militaryaffairs and has
accompiished great thing&~; but the question is whether his training is a training
for the work which will devolve upon him
in the future if hie cornes here as Governor General.

807

ments with 'çwhich that gentleman's namne
has been associated in the late war have
lent lustre to his name. It seems to me
that, if hie possesses the qualifications
which have been mentioned by my honourable friend, they shouid commend him
strongiy, not only to the Imperial authorities, but to every loyal and patriotic
citizen of this Dominion, and I arn sure
that, if appointed, the association which
he has had with Canadian soldiers on those
historie fields of battie in France, wili not
only add distinction to his namne, but give
to him the confidence, respect, and loyal
support of every Canadian citizen.

SENATE
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR TO
WASHINGTON

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Could the leader
of the Government tell the House whether
the Ambassador to Washington has been
appointed, or is going to be appointed?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
ambassador?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Canadian
Ambassador? We voted $50,000 for that
purpose last year, and this year it was
increased to $60,000. That money is going
begging.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Would the honourable gentleman accept it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
see that the honourable gentleman is duly
advised of the appointment.
CIVIL SERVICE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill 122, an Act to
amend the Civil Service Act, 1918.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill
before us is an amendment to the Civil Service Act, 1918. I am sure that a perusal of
it by honourable gentlemen will result in
its commending itself to their consideration.
At one time there seemed to be threatened
a kind of wholesale attack upon the Civil
Service Commission, and a return to patronage; but honourable gentlemen will
observe, on reading this Bill, the sagacity
which has been displayed by the House of
Commons in not departing from the priniples which have already been crystallized,
I might say, in the Civil Service Act.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Lack of sagacity.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, it
is a matter of opinion, I suppose, as to what
we may call it.
I may say that the Bill in no sense
departs from the principle of the Act. It
simply makes a departure to some little
extent in giving wider powers to the Civil
Service Commission as to the appointment
of disabled soldiers. From a close perusal
of the Bill I fail to see that there has been
any substantial change made in the Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I have had only a few minutes in
'which to look at this Bill; but, as my bonourable friend has said, there does not
seem to be very much in it, although I
understand that in another place considerHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

able attention was given to the question.
I understand that the Bill was introduced
into the other House and referred to a
committee, and that after the committee
had considered- the matter for a long time,
another Bill. was brought down; and the
question then arose as to which Bill was
te be proceeded with. Eventually, I believe,
both Bil-ls were eut down to the Bill that
we have before us. I do not know that
there is anything objectionable in this Bill.
The question of principle is not before us,
and it seems to me that any further discussion could better take place in cominittee.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, I had hoped that there was
something in the rumour that the Bill
known as the Spinney Bill, which was to
be introduced into the House of Commons,
would change somewhat the Civil Service
arrangements in this country. But from the
character of the Bill before us, as outlined by the leader of the Government, it
seems that the Bill now before us will not
have that effect.
I remember when the Civil Service Commission was first inaugurated. We were
told that economy and efficiency were the
objects aimed at, and that they could only
be accomplished by the abolition of what
was designated by the social and other uplifters as the terrible evil known as
patronage. I had been a member of the
House of Commons, and for a number of
years previous to that a member of the
legislature in my native province, and I
may say that I had never seen any very
great evils attaching to the patronage
which came to members of legislative bodies.
I had not observed that the men who were
appointed to positions in the Civil Service
under that system were not efficient. I
had not observed that there was any great
lack of economy in the carrying on of the
public service in those days. But these
uplifters, these social reorganizers and reformers, were able to get hold of a certain
section of the newspaper press and to impress upon them the idea that it was absolutely necessary, if this country'were to be
saved from final destruction, that this evil
cf patronage should be wiped out, and that
an independent body-independent of everybody, independent of the people, independent of the press-should be appointed in
order that these men who, I suppose, they
expected would get divine inspiration in
making their selection of those who were
to form the Public Service of this country,
should organize that Public Service in such

JUNE 4, 1921
a way as to bring about the much-desired
efficiency. Well, the first vote for this purpose was, 1 think, for sorne $25,000-a
nice, gentie, opening wedge. The vote for
last year makes the expenditure nearly
,k700,OO0.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIIN:

Shame.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, the country does flot realize what
this divinely-inspired Civil Service Commission is costing at the present time. I
think I have a memorandum of the cost
here. The vote in last year's Estintates was
$453,105, with $150,000 to cover the reorganization of the departments at Ottawa,
and, in addition, in the Supplementaries,
$64,920, making the total for the year just
c]osed $698,025. Fromn $25,000 to $700,000
is a pretty long btep in the way of econcmy--econorny on the wrong side of the
ledger.
Now, has the Civil Service Commission
reduced the cost of Civil Government in
this country? Let us cee what the figures
show as to that? In the last three years
tbere lias been an increase of over $8 ,000,000 in the cost of Civil Gove-ýnment at
Ottawa-that is another economical step
which these gentlemen have taken. That
is in the Incide Service, and does flot; inCivil Re-establishment,
clude Soldiers
Soldiers Land Settlement, Pension Board,
Air Board, or Health Department. In
spite of the fact that the heavier expenditure due to enlarged staffs during the war
has been largely reduced, and in spite of
the fact that the services that I speak of
are not included in this expenditure, in the
lact three years there bas been an increase
of $3,000,000 in the cost of Civil Government at Ottawa. The cost of the Civil
Government is fearful. In the last ten years
the expenditure has grown frorn $25,000,000 to $60,000,000; and yet, during a great
portion of that time, thic Civil Service
Commission that was heralded as bringing
the dawn of a new day, that was heralded
as the harbinger of economy, has'been in
power, and very much in power. You get

Hon. JOHN WEBSTER:

Have you the

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No, I have not got
it with me, but I think I can tell it frorn
mnemory. One gentleman-and this is only

809

one sample of many-received last year
$8,400, and hie is but a first-clacs clerk in
one of the departmnents.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Naine hirn.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: His original calary for the year before was $3,600. He
got a raise of $1,200, which brought his
salary up to about $4,800; hie got $1,200
of back pay. He got an increase, as I
say, of corne $1,200; but hie was flot catisfied with that, and went to the Board of
Hearing. This Board of Hearing is a sort
of institution used for the purpose of
boosting up people who do not consider
themselves quite well enough boosted.
This gentleman was a member of the
Board of Hearing, and therefore the other
members of the Board were somewhat
sympathetic; and, although hie was already
receiving a -fair remuneration, they increased it on hic petition corne $800 more.
Three hundred
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
dollars per annum?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, per annurn.
But hie has also another job in connection
with the Governrnent which .brings hMm
$1,000, making his calary in all for last
year $8,400-and I will gua.rantee that hie
does flot give full value for that amount.
That is one sample brick to show you
something of the quality..
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: How rnuch work did
hie do?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I will guarantee
that hie did not do $8,400 worth in the
whole tirne.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Can you give the
naine?
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: He had no tirne
to work.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Certainly not; hie
was working all the tirne getting hic increase.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Will this new
grader that is to he appointed at Montreal
be selected by the Civil Service Commission and paid by the Governrnent on the
camne ternis?
Hon.- Mr. FOWLER: Having to do with
a job that requires exceedingly great skill
and knowledge, and this man receiving
$8,400 not having skill or knowledge along
any line, I imagine that a man who can
-tell a good cheese from a bad one should
get at least $12,000.
Now, the Civil Service Commission were
not satisfied that they had within thern-

SENATE
selves sufficient ability to organize the departments so as to reach the greatest
degree of efficiency. They went to the
United States and brought up a lot of unlicked cubs-persons who, if they possessed
knowledge and ability, certainly had one
faculty very highly developed, and that is
the faculty of concealing any appearance
of the fact that they had knowledge or
ability. Not only had they the faculty of
concealing all appearance of knowledge,
but they also had the faculty of concealing the effects. They were not able to get
the effects. I venture the assertion, and
it will not be contradicted by men who
know, that the Inside Service was never
less efficient than it is at the present day.
What do we find? We find here to-day a
disorganization, instead of an organization, among the Civil Service of the Capital. We find the Civil Service attempting
to dictate to the Government of the day,
their employers, what they shall and what
they shall not do. They think that they
are independent; that Parliament bas no
power over them; that the whole thing is
in the hands of this Commission-a sort of
Frankenstein monster reared by the Government to destroy it. So far as the treatment of the Civil Service by this Government is concerned, let me say, honourable gentlemen, that I do not think it will
commend itself to the electorate of this
country.
I hoped that there was going to be a
change, and that this Spinney Bill was going to bring about the change. What is
the harm of patronage? What is the evil?
I think I have sufficiently shown that there
bas been no change in the way of economy
or efficiency. What is the evil of patronage? Is it correct to say that a man who
is elected by the people, who represents
the people, and who must go back to the
people for re-endorsement, is not a fit
person to recommend a man for a position? Are you going to have democratic
government in this country? or are you
going to put this matter in the hands of
a bureau which is respensible to no one?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
way it is now.

That is the

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is the way
it is now, my honourable friend says. You
are putting it in the hands of a bureau of
three men-controlled by a fourth, as is
popularly thought-to say who shall and
who shall not fill the positions in the Public Service of this country. And are you
going to say that the men who are responsible to the people and who are elected
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

by the people shall not have the right of
recommendation to these positions? It
seems to me that it is subversive of the
ideas of Democracy and Responsible Government.
For many years I represented a constituency in the other House, and I
never saw anything of these evils that we
are contending against. When an appointment was to be made, during the time the
party I supported was in power, I had the
privilege of recommendation, and I was
very careful to recommend good men
for the positions that were vacant, particularly in my own constituency-why?
Because, as a man possessing some slight
.degree of common sense, I know that in my
representative capacity I could make no
greater blunder, I could do nothing that
would do me more harm in my next candiriature, than to recommend an inefficient
person to be appointed to the Public Service. There was an object-lesson for everybody to look at, and everybody could see it.
I am speaking now of the outside service
entirely; I do not care anything about the
inside service, and would not care whether
any member had anything to do with it
or not; and I ask, who is so well qualified to
say who would be suitable for a job
such as a postmaster in a country district,
or a lighthouse keeper, or anything of that
kind, as the member for the county, who is
acquainted with everybody and with all the
conditions in the county, and who makes
these matters his study, and, properly so?
But a recommendation from the member is
the worst thing that a man can have if he
is applying for a position under the Civil
Service Commission. They avoid the member as though he were a pestilence, as
though they would be liable to catch the
plague if they spoke to him and asked him
who was the right man to appoint. To say
that a man sitting here at Ottawa could tell
who would be a proper postmaster for a
country district such as the parish of
Waterford in my county, a remote parish,
is ridiculous and absurd. Oh, but they get
the recommendation of the post office inspector. That inspector lives in one part
of the province, and probably never saw
Lh-it district, and knows nothing about it.
The man on the street, the man least qualifjed, is the one chosen as the source of information by the Civil Service Commission.
That bas been proven again and again. I
am utterly impartial in this matter; I have
no axe to grind; we in this House have no
patronage, and desire none. I am speaking
in the interests of the country, and I sup-

uîevspapers see fit to notice what I have
said here to-day; 1 shall be houn'ded by the
Civil Service Association through the newspaners for expressing these views; but
èvAry word 1 have said here is the absolute
truth.
Saine Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 do neot make a
practice of reading from newspapers, but
I have an article from a newspaper which
has a very strong influence in the country,
aîxd whose pronouncements are treated with
rt.cpect.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What paper is it?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The Montreal
Gazette. In its issue of April 25, 1921, it
had an article on the Civil Service, in which
it sa.id:
Trhe general public know littie and care lems
about the constitution of the Civil Service, the
importance of the reform of which wîas probably ¶nagnified, to politicians who when nlot
pleased at havlng secured an appointment for
a friend or a frjend's friend, were perturbed by
thé complaints of disappeinrted applicants. and
so in elther case had little leisure to forget the
suhject. We have now had in Canada four or
fIvE; years of a reformed Civil 'Service without
conclusive evidence that the advantages of the
new systemn exceed those of the old, nor that
former abuses have passed away. It is trite to
say that unless the reformation has produced
etonomy and promoted efficiency it has failed
In i1uriose, since this was the avowed object in
depriving politicians of patronage; and the
assertion may be made with a good deal of conflètence that pra-ctice has flot proved the virtue
of theory in this case. An independent body
rns.naging the Civil Service te 'which entrance
can be cbtained only by way of competitive
exNamination sounds admirable and mnay be an
excellent mechanical method. but men and
women are more than machines.

-A mere examination of tliat kind does
not get you very far in the mattèr of efficiency and of fitness for the post.
À cardinal fault ef the present system is
that it ignores the human quality and runs te
for
crammed
of candidates
the »election
ischoiastic examinations forgotten as soon as
aptitudes and qualififulfilied, and disregards
cations of higher value.

The papers are full of advertisement s of
people offering te crain candidates for the
Civil Service. Just as you stuif a turkey in
the faîl te hasten his fattening and fitness
for the market, s0 these people go te those
crnmmers and get stuffed with a little
knowledge just te pass the examination, and
then, as the paper says, forget it as soon
as it is learned. A persen who has passed
su,2h an examination, perhaps with the
highest marks, may be totally unqualified
and unfit for the post te which he is

811

appointed. They forget the human equatien, just as our friends the Germans in
the late war forgot the human equation;
but it accounts for much in civil life as
well as in military tactics. The Gazette
goes on:
There is no evidence of greater effloiency in
the Civil Service since the Commission was
given control, because efficiency would be manifested in reduction of numrbers, instead of whdch
the numrber ef employees is larger than ever.
Nor has economny been effected. The Service

motion, a condition that will inevitably continue
se long as selection Is made mechanically by
,in uninforrned Commission instead of by the
heeds of Departments familiar wiih the inerits
of their officers.

I say that if 1 were a Minister I woUld
cail in my Deputy Minister and say te hum:
" Ôrganize your staff; get efficiency; if yeu
&rie not capable of doing that, you are net
fil, for the job of Deputy Minister."
That is what I would say, and I think
tbat is the way the departmnents should be
reorganized. Some departinents, however,
have net permitted the 'Civil Service CernYnus sien te interfere with them; and ho* do
-c
1_y contrast? The best departinent administered in this whole Civil Service was
the Department of Soldiers Civil Re-establishment, adxinistered under the leadership
of a keoni, clever business man, who said
te the Civil Service Commission, " Hands
off !"-and there was ne interference, and
that departinent has been the most satisfactory of ail the departinents.
Seme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Which department is that?
Hon. MVr. FOWLER: The Department cf
Soldiers Civil Re-establishmnent; the head
of that department was strong eneugh te
say, " I w4ll have ne interferer.ce."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear;

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is net a bouquet;
it is a'plain statement ef fact. The Incorne Taxr Department alse said te the Civil
Service Commission, " We will have nei

there has been ne interference with that
departinent, and more satisfactory resuits
are being obtained than were expected when
that department started.
I do net propose, honourable gentlemen.
te take up any more of your turne; but I

SENATE
do say this: I regret very, very deeply that
the members of the House of Commons
have flot been strong enough to grappk
with this matter; that they have feared the
type of newspaper man who, being a mere
theorist without any practical knowledge
whatever, sits in his littie den and writes
an article which, if he had spoken it to you
on the street, you would have treated with
contempt. But such is the strange constitution of the great majority of minds that
if we see anything in a paper we place a
great deal more credence in it, put more
faith in it, listen to it, and are sometimeýt
guided by it, even against our own bettec
personal opinion and judgment, than if we
heard it spoken by some man. We wold
treat it with a snap of the finger and say,
"Poob, nonsense !" if it were said to us,
and yet in cold type it bas an effect. Now,
those articles that have appeared from time
to time in the newspapers, telling of thc
wonderful work the Civil Service Commission bas done for 'Canada, have scared the
members of the House of Commons. They
know by practical experience that there
bas flot been the efliciency that was looked
for. They know, wben they examine the
accounts of the Auditor General, that instead of greater economy there bas beeri
an enormous increase of expenditure. Why,
honourahie gentlemen, if aIl tbe faults of
the oid systemn that we read about wesie
real, and aIl those faults were corrected by
the new metbods; if ail the inefficiency was
wiped out, and ail tbings that were wrong
were made rigbt, yet the actual cost to the
country of tbis present Civil Service Commission would be greater than tbe gain
effected by those reforms. On the contrary,
however, instead of reforms, instead of
economy and efficiency in the Public Service, I say that the Public Service was
neyer in a more unsettied and restless condition than it is to-day-J arn speaking of
the Inside Service.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Disorganized.
H-on. Mr. FOWLER: Witb these Boards
of Hearing men neyer know where their
salaries are. There is constant unrest, anî 1
if we are going to haro reai efficiency the
wbole system must be changed. 1 may be
wrong, but as I understand the matter the
Government bas left it largely to the control of a Minister wbo, wbatever bis qualifications may bave been, time, with its aleffacing fingers, bas effaced those qualities
that mnade this Minister valuable, and he is
ne longer so; and it is an unfortunate thing
botb for tbe Goverment and for Canada if
Hon. Mr. PIOWLER.

it be true that this Minister whom I bave in
mind is tbe master with regard to the
Civil Service and bas been allowed to bave
bis way.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Honourable gentlemen, reaily the honourable member for
Kings and Albert is asking too mucb
altogether from one man. Here was a man
getting $3,600 a year, but hie had to work
te get ail those increases, and, with his per-

severance and bis industry, see how hie had
to wvork to get that Board of Hearing
together, how hie bad to cenvince those members. I wouid like to see any man in ordinary private life who could get increases
from $3,600 to over $8,000 a year just
through his obstinacy, through his buttonholing those wbo migbt give him an increase. Tbat man bad a busy year. if hie
neyer did a stroke of work for the Government, working to get those increases.

An Hon. SENATOR: Who is this man?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Ask the memnber for Kings and Albert.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN:: Who is the man?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 will go this far,
and say that this man is a weli-known
officiai. He gets this pay; bie is a member
of tbe Board of Hearing, and hie also is thý
Secretary of a Commission that is paid by
the Covernment.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the

Senate went into

Committee

on the

Bill. Hon. John Webster in the chair.
On section 1-Act not to apply to employees on railways or ships; positions,
how excluded from operation of Act:
.Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 want to draw
tbe attention of the honourable leader of

the Government to certain things in this

Bill. He will see that the first section
begins by saying that section 38A of the
Civil Service Act, 1918, is repealed. On
turning to the Civil Service Act of 1918,
there is no section 38A at all; there is
eniy section 38. Tbere is added in chapter
10 of the statutes of 1919 a section 38A,
which is being repealed. Then section 2
of the Bill reads:
Section '39 of the said Act, as amended by
the said ohapter 10, ts repealed.
If he looks at chapter 10 of the statutes

of 1919 be wiil not be able to find any refer-

JI}NE 4, 1921
ence to section 39. 1 just draw my honourable friend's attention to these matters,
because I think the way some of these
Bis have been brought down to the House
is most objectionable, and that the matter
should be more carefully attended ta hy
whoever i's respansible for the drafting of
these nxeasures.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do
flot assume responsibllity for that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No, I do not suppose my honourable friend is responsible.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
for the House to correct it, if that is the
case. We propose by the first section to
repeal 38A and 38C, and to re-enact them.
The only new provision in this is 38B; consequently that is practically the only thing
that may need our consideration.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Section 38A, as
I understand it, provides that this Act
shall fot apply to the Government railways
or to any railway under their control. The
honourable member f rom Kings and Albert
(Hon. Mr. Fowler), in 'bis address to the
House, mentioned the Income Tax Branch
of the Finance D'epartment as flot coming
under the Civil Service Act. Is that branch
kept out of the control of the Civil Service
Commission by this provision made in 38B?
0f course, it is not covered in 38A.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
work being carried out by that branch is
simply temporary; that is to say, its
present strength is only temporary; consequently it does flot corne under the Civil
Service Commission. This new section 38B
gives the Commission authority to exclude
certain work that may be carried on-say,
of an emergent temporary character-from
the operation of the Act. It is simply to
permit the Commission to ecercise its
authority in that particular direction. That
is ail it has relation to.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 0f course, I can
understandj that the Soldiers Civil Reestablishment is only a temporary Department, and, one which is being gradually
wound up; but I think it will be news to
the country to learn that the Income Tax
is only a temporary measure, or that the
brandi of the Service whose duty it is to
see that the taxation is properly carried
out is temporary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I did
not mean to leave upon the House the impression that that was a temporary work.
I said temporary so far as its present con-

stitution is concernied. The introduction of
the Act, the placing in operation of s0 comprehensive a measure as the Income Tax,
necessitated a very large staff; but it is
not anticipated that that staff will be maintained at its present strength for ail time
to corne. When the Act becomes recognized
by all the people of Canada the staff will
be considerably reduced. But this measure
does not refer particularly to t1hat work.
It simply permits the Commission to exercise its authority from time to time to give
recognition to> an emergent class of work,
and permits of the Governor in Council to
exclude that work from the Civil Service
Act.
New sections 38A and 38B were agreed
to.
On new section 38C-Act not to apply to
appointment of Commissioners, etc., or
Deputy Head:
Hon. Sir JAMES L0UGHÈtED: That
is the present Act.
New section 38C was agreed to.
On section 2, new section 39, subsections
2and 3-special list of pensioners; preference for person who served in war:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. The new
enactment in clause 39 is subsection 2,
paragraphs i, ii, and iii. The abject of
that is to give a preference to disabled
soldiers. At the present time, while a preference is given to returned men, yet the
disabled soldier is not singled out as enjoying a preference over an able-bodied returned man, and it is simply to give that
preference that this subsection is inserted.
This entire clause practically establishes
three classes; first of ah, the disabled man;
secondly, the returned man who, is flot disabled; thirdly, the civilian; and, 1 might
Say, the members of the Naval Forces have
been added, as appears in subsection 3.
Subsections 1, 2, and 3 of new section 39
were agreed to.
4 of new section 39-age
'On
limit subsection
and physical requirements flot to
apply to persons with war service mentioned in 2 and 3:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
proposed ta amend that subsection by adding the following:
If the Commission certifies that he is of such
an age and in such a satisfactory physical
condition that lie is then able ta performn the
duties of thse office and w111 prabably be able ta
continue to do so, for a reasonab1e period after
his appojntment.

SENATE
That means simply that the Commission
is satisfied that the disabled man has the
physical ability to perform the duties for
which he is appointed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That applies
to the question of age limit and physical
requirements?
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With respect
to any appointment in the Civil Service?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
object is to correct a clerical error. The
words are in the Act now, and were left
out of the Bill by mistake.
" shaîl not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
apply to any persons with the milîtary or
naval service," etc.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
applies ta ail appointments. The appointees
must have the physical ability.
Is that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
amendmenit added to subsection 4, or is it
separate?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
added to subsection 4. Subsection 4 now
reads:
(4) The provisions of any statUte or regulation prescribing the age limit and physical
reouirements with respect to any appointment
in the civil service shali not apply to any peTsons with the military or naval servic-e mentioned in subsection ýtwo or three of this section.

Thie amendment is to add:
If the Commission certifies that he is of such
an age and in such a satisfactory physical condition that he is then sble to perform the
iI piobably be able
(juties of the office ani
to continue to do so for a reasonable periocl
affer his appointment.

The amendment of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed to, and subsection 4
as amended was agreed to.
On section 3-promotions to be made for
merit; Commission may restrict competition to employees or employees of certain
class of specified seniority:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is there much
change in that clause?
No,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
there is practically no change, except that
to " reports, tests, records, and ratings,"
the word "recommendations " is added.
Otherwise the clause is just the same as it
is in the present Act, except that the
phraseology has 'been slightly changed. I
can find no other change in it.
Hlon.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: -What change does
subsection 3 make? It is apparently a new
subsection.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
but I cannot see that it makes any change.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It seems to restriet
the selection in certain cases to a certain
class of employees.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, of
specified seniority.
Section 3 was agreed to.
The preamble and the titie were agreed
to.
The Bill, as amended, was repor-ted.

CAUSES 0F UNEMPLOYMENT
REcPORT

0F SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from June 2 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. McDonald for concurrence in the second
report of the Special Committee of the
Senate to inquire into the causes of unemployment in Canada.
Hon. WILLIAM ROCHE: Honourable
gentlemen, when the report was brought in
by the Committee I purposed making a few
remarks. The consideration was postponed
and I was put down as the mover of the
postponement. This would caîl upon me for
perhaps a more elaborate treatment than I
intended, but the time is short and I rely
upon the suggestions of those honourable
gentlemen who will follow me to fill in the
vacancies or the omissions that I may make,
particularly on the subject of the remedies.
The honourable gentlemen whýo composed
the Co.mmittee are to be thanked for the
efforts they have made in investigating the
causes of the deficiency of employment, and
for the statements they have presented;
but I thînk that their report was not broad
enough. They took the opinions of representatives of the bankers, representatives
of labour, and representatives of capitalthe manufacturers. I think they should
have g-one further and taken the testimony
of labouring men, merchants, retailers, and,
ahove ail obtained some opinions from the
great body of consumers in the counitry, as
ta the causes of unemployment and the

JUNE 4, 1921
remedies. They might have made a summary and a pronouncement which might;
have been to somne extent a se'ttler of the
question. That was not-done.
Following that report was a statement
made by the Minister of Labour, and, as
I think the Committee were flot; broad
enough, I think the Minister of Labour
was flot deep enough. He s.poke of several
superficial and obvious remedies. Ail, 1
think, admitted that the statement of -the
situation was corret-that there was a
large amount of unemployment in the
country. But the Minister of Labour did
not go deep enough in this respect, that
ho did flot allude to that which is the
foundation of the law of supply and demand, namely, the proportion between the
cash and means of the consumer and the
pToduct whièh. lie wisbes to purchase.
Perhaps, in the first place, it would lie
just as well to state briefly how the labouring man, the mechanic, the trades unionist
and the organizations of which they are
menibers have contributed to the lack of
enwloyment in the country.
In their
lodges, in their arguments, and also, I
think, in their belief s, they have divided
the population into two classes, the workingman and the capitalist, leaving altogether out of the calculation the great
mass of consumers, the public. They have
had no regard for them. What means did
they adopt? First of ail, in an arbitrary
manner Vhey fixed hMg'h -rates for labour and,
Vhrosugh rtheir irumbers, their operations
and their influence upon their "enemy," as
they supposed the capitalist to be, they
have maintained and increased froni tume
to tume the high rates for labour. 0f
course, when I epeak of high rates I
mean relative rates. They can be estimated and judged only by their proportion to money and to other essentials.
Then f rom tume to turne they threatened
the capitalist or the manufactuxrer with a
strike if their views and demands were
flot complied with. They used that threat
as a terrorism. Not only did .they do that
in what niay be termed a -selfish way, but
in their own interest specially they kept
out of employment a great number of men,
some of 'whom may now -be in the list of
tinlerployed. ,They would not allow those
who were not members of their organization or society to have eniployment at all.
.1f any non-union men were employed, tbey
.would threaten to strike, and the employer
knew that a strike would occur-that there
wouid lie an entire suspension of bis work,
and perhaps his ruin might result; so they

badl their way, and there were a number
of people unemployed, and the list was
gradually growing.
Again, the employer of labour knew that
bis, product was at a very high rate.
Thinking men, careful and cautious men,
who have in their keeping the funds-of
others-for instance, the bankers--saw
that the high prioes could not be maintained. The bankers confined their boans
to objects which would flot be liable to the
great fluctuation -which was supposed
was going on. The security companies,
the boan companies, those who represented mortgages,' ail those engaged
in money lending, were afraid there
would be a great slump in real estate.
They restricted trheir boans, and when the
prices of bouses and other buildings were
very bigh, they did not want to become the
possessors of theni at the very high rate
because, perbaps, they wouid lie unable
to dispose of theni at more than 50 or 75
per cent of what was required to be advanced; and they cautiously withdrew.
Other employments followed suit. A
man who wished to buy a house contrasted
his money with the sum tbat was demanded by a contractor. Contractors
could not get people to buy their bouses
or to employ them; and the effect was
gradually to contract the number of hands
employed.
Then, again, every bouseholder or
other person who received a bill opened
his eyes with astonishment to flnd that
so littie work could be done for so large
an amount of money; and no person was
inclined to have any work done which 'ho
could avoid or postpone. And again, the
amounts required were out of proportion
to the means of those who lad to pay.
This condition began to have an effect
upon the people generally. It induced a
concensus of opinion that labour was too
high; and everyone began ta look upon
the labourer with aversion, because the
high den-ands that hie made diminisled the
resources and comforts of the persons who
had to pay for labour. Ail this began tD
work upon the community; aIl these contributory causes tended to diminish the
use and occupation of labour.
But that was not aIl that the labourers
did. Without knowing it, they created a
distrust and an aversion. Distrust began
to pervade the community, and when that
tidal wave sets in there is no force that
can operate against it, there is .nothing
that can control.it, and it has its way.

SENATE
So, in the first place, I am afraid that
we shall have to charge the labourer witn
being the promotive cause of the want of
occupation of labour.
But we are not to blame the whole
of it upon the workman. Others were
extortioners; others demanded fabulous
rates; others contributed to this general fund of unemployment. The Government started it. They are always to
blame. The Government during the war
required alnost every commodity, every
supply-provisions, munitions, appliances
of all kinds, and in every direction-and
they lavished money right and left.
Everyone had a hatful. Then the Government issued loans. The newspapers
£ound the advertising of loans very rethe
munerative. Those good people,
brokers, and others, advised everyone
who had a little money to invest in Government bonds, saying, " They will be
issued at par, and in a few years they will
be worth a great deal more "-some said
5 per cent, some said 10 per cent; I do
not know what the limitation was. This
was the causa causans of the unemployment, because it took up the surplus money
of the people generally. People who had
small investments, or money in the bank,
at home, or elsewhere, hastened to invest
their money in Government bonds.
Then, everybody was an extortioner.
The farmers were extortioners in the
prices they asked for their products; the
merchants were extortioners, because they
could readily sell their goods; the retail
merchants were extortioners, because they
put on 200 or 300 or 400 per cent; employees of all kinds, down to washerwomen and charwomen, were extortioners,
because they all wanted increased wages.
The consequence was that there was extortion all round. The only classes exempt
from this category were the lawyers and
the plumbers, and the reason for that was
that they had taken everything that was
in sight before.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
How
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
about shipping agents?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: They were all at sea.
But the hard fact remains that the ready
money of the people was absorbed, and
householders and others realized that their
money was inadequate to procure for them
even the necessaries of life, let alone the
luxuries and the ornaments of life; and
consequently the volume of sales was
d'iminished. People curtailed their purHon. Mr. ROCHE.

chases and did not buy anything that was
not absolutely necessary. in place of buying ornamental and other articles, their
money was absorbed in the purchase of the
necessaries of life; so those who were employed in the production of other articles
found the demand for the products of their
labour diminished to a great extent, and
consequently they were out of work.
Workmen and others thought they would
restore conditions by limiting the hours of
labour. That was no palliative; it was only
a very slight expedient to remedy the evil,
because it kept up the prices of the commodities produced. If a man worked only three
days in the week, receiving a wage per
day, the employer had the expenses of bis
workshop and his clerical staff going on,
and the price of the article was not diminished and the labourer got no more money.
Then, again, there is a large class of
people who have no representative: they are
not represented in this House, they have
no spokesman, they cannot corne before the
public and state their case, and they must
naturally suffer-those who perhaps are
living on the income from a little invested
money, or the rent of a 'house, or something of that kind, and who have no employment. These are the real sufferersnot the abject poor, and those who live on
charity, whom we call poor. Those people,
who perhaps formerly belonged to a higher
class in society, and whose means were
diminished by every change, were suffering;
and their minds were all turned to the
object lesson of the high pay of the labouring man. For instance, I have heard of
ladies in moderate circumstances who went
to buy an article of household use, of common necessity, and were amazed at the
high price charged; but a labourer's wife
would come in, and without demur would
buy the article and walk off with it. That
created a vein of envy in the feminine
mind. These women thought: " We were
well off once; we oould buy these things;
now they are artificially boosted by a certain class of public opinion."
The tidal wave was created and started,
and it now overwhelms the whole community. For instance, some labouring men
obtained $60 a week, for time and overtime, and they were able to flourish, while
a large class of the community were in a
state of comparative poverty and had to
abstain from the use of ordinary and perhaps necessary articles. All this produced'
the opinion that the cost of labour was
too high and should be diminished;
that there should be a new level estab-

JUNE 4, 1921
lished between the means of the great mnass
of the consumera end t~he deinands of the
la.bouTers; and that it .was to be obtained
only by a general levelling down of prices.
1' think the honourable gentlemian f rom
Ainherot (Hon. Mr. Curry), 'who addreased
the lieuse, aM that the war wlas not the
cause of or did- not contribute te this uneniployment. Well, I think ît was the promotive cause. Lt was due to the lavish
expenditure of rnoney by the Governiment-necesaitated, it is true, by thbe war--and
alse to the feot that a large nuniber of
yeuung inen and others were taken f ree
tiheir exnployment and "ent te the war.
They camie back; bhey were unemployed;
they wa.ited on the Ilberality of the Government. In the meantime, a large inumber
Mf them were supplanted by women--and
the 'women have corne to stay. T~he woenn
filled situations that men. ocupied before.
They wiorked for leus pay, they were civil,
and I have net heard of eny gesneral atrikte
amongst them. They have retained the
confidence of their empdoyers, and the resuit ls thiat a large number of people 'whe
worked in situations sinilar to those now
occupied by women have lest thedr employment. This haa alI contributed to the general mass of the unemployed.
Now, I must shorten my reniarks. I
could go on much further. I must apply
myseif to the remedy. The Minister of
Labour, who perhaps knows more of this
question than anyone else in the Flouse,
suggested some superficial and obvious
remedies. In the first place, he said that
the £armers were te be urged. te keep on
their employees in the winter when they
had no employment for them. The farmers
are noý built that way. They do not wish
to pay out money when there is no return
in wôrk. They do nlot want ornamental
handis around their farmsto drive inté the
neighbouring towns in automobiles a nd to
corne back at midnight or laVer. They want
a fair ret.urn in products for the money
they expend; and the rnoney of the farmers is as well guarded as that of any
other class of people.
.Then the Minister said that there would
be a ni4ve:ment of labour from places where
there was a plethora of it to places where
thère was a scarcity. If the information
and statistics upon these points were ready
and availabie,. some pailiation of the situation-might be obtained. But these are oniy
temporary expedients; they are noV enduring; they are not comprehensive. In certain cases temporary relief is, the only
method of removing distress, and in such
S-52
PuvIsI

cases it must be availed of, because when a
man is starving it is no use to tell him to
go to a neighbouring city-that he can get
work there; he must be relieved by some
fund, or by money from soniewhere.
Those were the remedies suggested by
the Minister of Labour; butan extensive
and effective remedy can oniy be secured
by a general reduction of prices ail round.
Prices and costs must be adjusted to the
resources of the people. Formerly there
was a safety valve of relief in the fact that
the excess of labour could go to the States;
but a very costly and damaging remedy
that was. Perhaps some of the best of our
mechanica and vigorous Young men went
to the States and remained there. But now
Vhey cannot go to the States. The press
of the United States, and ail sorts of men
there, have seen with dismay the advent of
people frore ail parts of the country to the
great cities, with a general excess of labour
over employment. They want those people
Vo go back to the farma Vo produce more.
That unfortunate situation has been augmented by the constant stream of immigrants coming into the United States, s0
that there ls an excess of people over the
employment that can be offered to them.
To-day there is, no resort to the United
States on the part of our employed.
One remedy not alluded to by the MinisVer of Labour is Vo keep on the farm the
people who belong to the farm, and to give.
more encouragement to the Young men
already on the farm. Do not allow thern
Vo crowd into the cities. Inform Vhem that
there is already an excess of unemployed
people in the citiMes, and tell Vhem not to
come. 'That would be a remedy.
But there is an evil to be contended with,
one which has been much applauded in the.
press and by clergymen, and other pXofessional men, and that is the constant tendency of mothers oîf families in the cou*tzy
Vo give. their sons professions. They aay:
"We have struggled aIl along in poverty,
labouring hard, and exhausting ourselves;
such-and-such a person is, in Parlismefit;
a very fortunate man -bas got into the
Senate; .the professional men are, largeiy
rewarded, they becom.e rich,-e.»4,we wsýd
like to have our sons, advance -a»d ne longer
be drudges on the farin."! How areyou
going Vo correct that.evil?. I wquld suggest
a remedy. It is that people should. be winlling Vo give fair remuneration, fpr the cost
and labour of producing farm products; Vo
make comfortable the .homes. of those who
have sons; to give them some of the -amuse-

ments, some of the comforts, and some of
the benefits of life. The world owes every
man a living-that is the doctrine of the
labouring man-and the world is provided
with a living for every man. But what
kind of a living? We all cannot be professional men; we all cannot be parasites, as
they are termed, upon the exertions of
others. Some must be the starters; some
must be the originators; some must be the
producers in order to support the fabric of
society.
Now, I believe that people generally
would be willing to pay for commodities produced on the farm, not prewar prices, but say 50 per cent addition
to the prices prevailing before the war.
If that were done, I think it would to a
great extent stay the exodus from the farm
to the city. I believe that the cities should
not be given so much representation in Parliament, but that the representation should
be more widely distributed throughout the
country. I think there should be more inducements in that respect to remain on the
farm.
Another great evil is that the public are
too much devoted to sport. Take up a
newspaper and what do you find? There is
a little item in the corner about the vagaries of Parliament, or the extortions of the
Government if the paper happens to be on
the other side, or about the ministers not
properly expending the public revenues by
way of salary or otherwise, while threequarters of the paper are devoted to sport
and divers automobile activities and contrivances. Now, that should not be; neither
should the whole mind of the public be
occupied with sport to the exclusion of
everything else. Sport and amusement are
proper in their place; but remember that
we have new exigencies, that the late war
has changed our whole social fabric, and
that the people must devote themselves
more to labour and production, to economy,
and to the restoration of what has been distuybed and wasted by war.
Then, again, a comprehensive remedy is
for all classes--the farm producer, the
merchant, the mechanic, the labourer, all
classes, including the professional classto reduce their costs and expenses, to reduce the price of all that we produce by
every process. Labour being the very large
ingredient in the aggregate, the reduction
must begin with the labouring man. He
must be prepared to reduce the cost of
labour in the interest of the labouring man
himself and in the interest of the public.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

Hon. JOHN STANFIELD: Honourable
gentlemen, at this late hour in the Session
I do not intend to occupy more than a very
few moments. I am sure the House will
agree with the remarks just made by the
honourable member from Halifax. I do
not, as a rule, believe in post mortems,
but there are times when they have to be
held.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: They are necessary,
too.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: In the past and
in the present, we have been too fond of
"passing the buck," to use a slang phrase.
To a certain extent the manufacturer is to
blame, and labour is to blame. If leaders
of organized labour, instead of holding out
for the high wages they are getting to-day,
would advise the labour men to get together and have a show-down-I do not
mean a strike, but a talk between the manufacturers and the labour men-I think they
would readily see that labour has to come
down somewhat in order to enable this
country to prosper.
I intend only to touch, and very shortly,
on the railway situation, more especially
in regard to freight rates, which have more
to do with unemployment, perhaps, than
a great many other causes. In my judgment, reduction in freight rates is more
important to the Western farmer than a
reduction of the tariff. But in order to
bring freight rates down there must be
a reduction of wages. What do we find today in connection with the Canadian Government railway? Unorganized labourers
employed as temporary men are having
their wages reduced; men are being laid
off; engineers are being reduced to foremen; foremen are laid off until they become
workmen; but has there been any reduction
among the officials? I received a telegram
yesterday from the matron of the station
of the town in which I live, stating that
she had received orders that her services
would be no longer required after the 15th
of this month. That woman bas done good
work for, I think, $40 a month.
That
action has been taken on the ground of
economy. I do not blame the District
Superintendent for that, but I blame the
head men in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Why, if
they do not need her?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: Why do I blame
them? Because, on looking over the workmen's time-table, I find a new official, called
a Relieving Superintendent, between Mont-

JUNE 4, 1921
reai and Halifax. During the var the railway men had more work than they couid
attend to-flot enly officiaIs but operators
-ýnd what did the Superintendent do when
he wanted a vacation? Why, the Assistant
Superintendent carried on. Well, honourabie gentlemen, when business conditions
are se bad, surely the Assistant Superintendent couid carry on while the Superinteindent teck'a few days' vacation. There is
nlo doubt that the raiIway men's wages
miust be reduced, but I suggest te the nababs
in Toronto that they start in and lay off
ail the officiais that are unnecessary-there
must be a lot of them who could be spared
-until such time as they are needed again.
Then let them reduce their cwn wages,
right freim the top down, and I feel sure
that the men at the bottoma will say: "Weli,
the hifh-up officiais have taken their reduction; we will take ours gracefnliy."1
I couid say a geed deal mare, but there
are several gentlemen te feliow, and I wiil
give way.
Hon. GEO. W. FOWLER: Honourable
gentlemen, the-re bas been no effiective
remedy suggested for nnempleyment and
thý high cost of living. Everybody seerna
te think that the labourer sheuld be the
ene te sacrifice hiniself-in other words, to
put it in a common, vulgar way, that he
should ha the goat. Now, I can quite understand his reluctax'ce te offer hiniseif as a
vicarieus sacrifice for the rest et us. I
suggest that we sweeten the pill for himthat there be a generai reduction aIl round.
Hononrabie gentlemen in this House enjoy a certain indemnitr 'wbich was increased about a year ago on account ot the
high cost. cf living. Let hononrabie gentlemen in this House start the hall reliing,
\set
the fashion for the other people; let
them say: " The high cost cf living is being
reduced; butter was selling the ether day
at 16 cents a poi.md in Saskatchewan; prices
for farrn products everywhere have coe
down, and will corne down very mnch; now
we wilI reduce our indeinity."'

Hon. Mýr. FOWLER: Let the niembers of
the Government say te the cuntry, "We
wilI take a rednced arnount of rnoney for
our services." Let the judges take a redneed amoiant of monty--thus wiil be a very
serions and very difieuit thing to do.
Now, I would Propose this seriousiy. 1

higher pay than himaself, noa matter how
well they earn it, a'nd stili retaining their
ernolurnents, he feels that he 'should nlot be
the oniy person ta make the sacrifice, and
therefore he resents it. I wouid suggest

in regard ta that over which the Government and Parliament can exercise a certain

remedying the situation, let us begin at
home; let us begin at the top with those
members of the Government who are reYour
ceiving these high emoluments.
Ronour who sits in the chair there, receiving a very handsome recompense for the
very easy labour which you perform, be
content to take your reduction of 40 per
cent. I am content to take my reduction
of 25 per cent.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We are really
better off with a 25 per cent reduction
than we were in pre-war times with the
$2,500 that we got then. We were able to
carry on with that. We must all expect
to make a certain amount of sacrifice for
the good of the country; let us be willing
to make it. I trust that the Government
during the recess will consider this matter
-I charge them nothing for the suggestion.
I hope that they will consider it, and put
it in charge of the Minister of Labour.
He is an expert at getting through legislation in this House, as witness his great
success yesterday with a most iniquitous
Bill, the Cheese Bill. I am sure that if
the Minister of Labour were to introduce
a Bill, and bring to it the power of his
captivating words, he would get it through
this House, and probably the public pressure would force it through the other
House. The Bill would properly come from
the Minister of Labour; it would not be
for a capitalist such as the leader of the
Government to introduce it, because people
would not believe in his sincerity. If such
a Bill were passed, we would have set an
example to the labour men and the workers
of the country-I should say, to the other
workers of the country-which I am sure
they would gladly follow.
Hon. GEO. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, one has heard here all
sorts of advice given to other people as to
how to reduce the high cost of living and
the increased cost of employment; but
when my honourable friend who has just
sat down pointed out to us how the high
cost of employment should be reduced, I
venture to say he did not strike a responsive chord in every bosom in the Chamber;
which shows that men in every walk of
life are eminently greedy and selfish. SelfHon. Mr. FOWLER.

sacrifice is the noblest virtue in the world,
and we only desire to see it practised by
other people, although we admire it so
intensely.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: At a distance.
Now,
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
you cannot get any reforms except by necessity, and the only way by which you will
bring down the cost of labour and the cost
of everything else is by starvation. That
is the only argument that will prevail.
Men are all alike, from the king to the
peasant; every man is looking out for himself, and every man is going to keep all he
can. If you should walk out, when you are
receiving $4,000 a year for three months'
work, and tell the people who are chiselling
the stones to build this edifice that because
they are getting $10 or $15 a day they are
getting too much money and they ought to
set an example to Canada, you would be
speaking to ears as deaf as your own when
you are spoken to in this House. I consider
that all these rules of political economy that
we are asked to apply are utterly and absolutely useless, for the simple reason that
they are always ignored.
My honourable friend is absolutely right.
All those salaries should be reduced; in fact,
they never should have been increased. An
unconquerable desire to increase one's gains
and an equal indifference regarding other
people's money is manifest in all walks of
life. I venture to say that, by employing a man for $20,000 a year, I could save
a million dollars, in each year around
Ottawa without dismissing a single person
by preventing extravagance. There is not
a committee that looks after any of these
things. Stationery is sent out to the
members here in trunks that
cost
four dollars each, and that are not
worth a snap of the fingers to anybody;
yet no one even takes the trouble to ask
them to send the trunks back again. There
are a hundred trunks at four dollars apiece
given out here, anI they are stuck in every
member's house, and nobody cares a rap
for them.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
expressage.

They are not worth

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Members need not pay expressage; they could
send them back here on the Government
road; but new trunks will be bought every
year at four dollars each. It is the same
with everything: nobody takes any interest
in anything but himself.

JUNE 4, 1921
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, according to the ethics of my
honourable, friend, it would be apparently
useless to give advice to the public: we
should begin by trying individually te practice virtue. Yet there are facts that can be
stated for people to examine and draw
their own conclusions.
We have this
morning heard two very interesting disquisitions on the causes of unemploymen t
and some remedies that should be applied.
1 sat on the Committee, which heard the
four or five witnesses representing the vanious activities that go to make up the
economic life of this country, and one could
not help realizing that one of the principal
causes of unemployment,- apart from the
general economic situation of the world,
was the wage question. The French have
a saying, which is as old as France:
"Quand le batiment va, tout va "-when
the building trade is booming, everything is
booming. The building trade is not boominig just now. We hear that in the city of
Ottawa it is almost paralyzed by a stnil«.
of the wage-earners in that industry; and
why is it paralyzed? Because the wageearners will not consent to a readjustment
of. their wages.
Yet we are presentedl
with a resolution unanimously adopted here
in Ottawa last month by the building and
construction industries of -Canada, whichi
declares among other things:
The Geneyal Committee -of titis Joint Confer-

ence of Employers and Employees in the Construction Industries begs to report that it bas
had three meetings during the sessi ons and hes
considered without hesitation some of the vital
questions of our industry, wlth a view to aidIng this conference In arriving at a satisfactory
conclusion. The chief questions on which no
agreenment bas been reached at titis ttue etter
In committee or in the Conference Itself are
those of wages and the, methods which. have
been used to obtain wage reductions.
After the most serlous and careful consideration and with the full knowledge that we are
not In any sense a legisiative or authorized
body, but a voluntary one, and therefore without jurisdictional powers, beg to recommend
the following:
"Whereas there now existe a condition of
either strike or lockout In our lndustry in several of our Canadian cities because of the
so-clalled arbitrary -reductions demanded by
employers; and
"Whereas titis condition la the result of a
general abnormal. Etuation, over which we
could not possibly have any control; and
"WVheireas the post-war unnatural higit peak
in cost of living and therefore in wages was

passed last year; and

"Wbereas
In
many
Important
centres
throughout Canada and adjacent UJ.S. points
wage adjustments have been reached by mu-

tual agreements or arbitration; and

"Whereas the chief deterring factor whIch
prevents a real sibstantial reduction In cost
of living Io undoubtedly higit rent; and

821

"Whereas it is realized by us that only the
building of inany thousands ot dwellings can
alleviate Canada's depiorable housing shortage; and
"Whereas we are as an industry to a siight
degree responeible for ibis eituation, and
"WThereas
it- bas been conclusively shown
In titis Conference that building material prices
have already been substantially reduced;
"Therefore be it resoived by titis Conference, acting as Individual builders and workers and not in our capacity as officers of any
particular organization, and with the full nealization that eacb Iocality must of necessity
deal with its own peculiar situation, as follows:
'"That in our best judgment a moderate asd
reasonable adjustment et wages shouid be
agreed upon without furtiter delay In such
large centres, where an abnorrnally higit peak
bas been reached and where no settiement has
been accepted, and that such agreement sbould
be fIxed upon for a period ot twelve montits;
and, further, that we strongly urge the linmediate resumption of negotiations with a view
to Tnutual agreement, and that failing mutuai
agre ement, voluntary arlbitriatfon j#houldl ibe
entered Into.
"In conclusion, your Generai Conimittee feels
that this action will tend to stabilize condi.
tions by preventing an undue and abnormal
drop In wages, and remove strikes, strife and
distrust, and thata new post-.war normal wIll
more epeedlly be determined."

This resolution is signed by nepresentatives of organized labour, one of the principal ones being Mr. A. Martel. Mr. Martel
with othens recognizes that the, high cosl;
of living is gradually, day by day, coming
down. Yet that gentleman, when before
our Committee, although hie admitted the
conditions, nefused to state that hie was
willing to recomnmend, or that these orgarizations were ready te accept, a lowering of
wages. He gave as his reason for that
attitude the fact that rent and fuel were
still going up. This gentleman adMitted
that the cost of labour represented 80 per
cent of the cost of building. -In this resolution he has admitted that the high cost of
niaterials and labour prevent activity in
the building trade. Yet hie tells us that, so
long as there is a shortage of houses and
a consequent high rate of rentals, wages
should not be diminished. This is obviously
se illogi cal that I think it suffices to men.tion it for the ordinary labourer, who lias
some intelligence, to realize that hie himself is'the cause of the high rentale and
of the unemployment in the building trades.;
for if hie accepted a reasonable reduction
in wages, not only when 'the material is
assenibled for the erection of a house, but
also at the varions mille, where the matenial
-is prepared, then prices would come down
and people would stant to, build.* To
my personal knowledge buildilngs are

SENATE

822

urgently needed in Montreal, for which
individuals and corporations are ready
ta supply money ta the extent of
many millions, but which are not started
because when the specifications are made
out and tenders opened it is found that
the cost would be from 150 ta 200 per cent
mare than it was before the war. These
figures are absolutely prohibitive, and the
people are waiting. I can state that
between McGill street and the Post Office
praperties have been bought in the last two
or three years for the purpose of the construction of large and imposing buildings,
but these buildings will nat be put up while
costs are 150 ta 200 per cent more than
what they should be. Therefore I cannot
understand why the leaders of oiganized
labour do nat place these facts clearly
before their members, in aider that they
may realize that they are themselves ta a
large extent the cause of the unemployment in the large cities of Canada.
The other reason given by Mr. Martel
was that the price of coal was soaring.
That, again, is ta a large extent due
ta the high wkge paid ta the miner. *The
skilled miner in the western part of Canada is to-day receiving an average of
$9.54, if I arn nat mistaken, and the ordinary labaur $5 and a fraction. The cost of
transportation, awing ta the high wage
paid ta raîlway emnployees, has been increased ta an exceptianal degree. Sa we
find at the root of the difficulty the question of wages.
My honourable friend from Kings and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) has said: " Let
the people who have large salaries show
the example; let us ail show the exanmple."
I have no objection ta that example being
shawn, but I contend that it has already,
in a certain measure, been shown in the
Income Tax which high-salaried officiais
are paying. There is mare than one way
of showing an example. I think that when
the Incarne Tax returns are made, the
wage-earners, who are free from that
burden, will find that the people with large
incarnes are doing their bit for the carrying on of the affairs of this country. I have,
as I have stated,' no abjection ta an exampie
being ,shown in variaus ways, such as that
suggested 'by my honourable friend from
Kings and Albert; but it would only
be an example; it would not salve the
economic problem. A reduction in salaries
-the salaries of the higher railway officiais,
for instance-wauld be but a drap in the
ocean. There are but few at the top who
receive large salaries. It is the immense
Hon. Mr. DANDUYRAND.

army of wage-earners who represent the
factor which weighs in the economie situation. A reduction of 10, 15, or 20 per cent
in the wages of that immense army would
practically solve the problem of costs. Sa
that, while the suggestion of my honourable
friend from New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
Fowler) is one which would perhaps appeal
to the imagination of the masses, and
satisfy them that those in the top ranks of
society are not profiteers, yet the economie
problem can only be solved by a reduction
in wages. 1 arn convinced that this resolution of the joint conference of the building and construction industries, if it were
followed out, would have an immediate
effect on the unemployment situation.
I do not suggest that labour should revert
to pre-war rates. I amn sure that the people
at large who cannot be called wage-earners
and who are flot represented in labour
organizations, are in favour of labour
receiv.iTig a living wage.
I have no other suggestion ta make,
except to recail a recommendation made 'by
the Secretary of the Bankers' Association,
which was alluded to by my honourable
friend from Halifax, namely, that an effort
should be made to bring about a retuin of
people ta the land. My honaunable friend
from Halifax does not believe that this
effort can be very effective unless we better
the conditions of the farmers and their sons.
This, again, is governed by general principles which must be recognized. Sa long
as labour in the cities receives high wages
and works short hours, it will be attracted
ta the cities. The young man of the farm,
who in reading the papers observes what
wa-ges are paid for labour in the towns and
cities, and that eight hours constitute a
day's work for those wages, will naturally
be induced ta drap the twelve-ýhour work on
the faim and will be attracted ta the city.
We cannat hope ta keep the young men on
the faims until conditions are brought back
ta normal, and that will not be until the
city wage-earners agree ta a reduction of
the inflated wages they have been receivïng
since the beginning of the war.
The Secretary of the Bankers' Association made a suggestion which the Government should take into consideration, namely,
that the Government, thraugh its agencies,
should notify the farming communities, who
for a number of years have been complaining of a shortage of labour, that now is the
time ta apply ta the provincial emplayment
bureaus for labour frorn the cities. ý The
best agency which has been xnentioned is
IV has been sugthe Post Office.

JUNE 4, 1921
be put up in
gested that posters
the post offices, which are tu be found
in every nook and corner throughout
the country, advising the farmers ta apply
for labour at certain provincial centres.
It has been aptly remarked by the honour(Mr.
from -Halifax
gentleman
able
Roche) that the farmer has as rnuch business acumen as any other individual in
the country, and that if hie needs labour
for only three months he will not pay for
it for twelve months. Yet, if hie makes
application at a town where unemployment
ex.ists to-day, and where it is likely ta continue ta exist, the advantage will be that
those unemployed will be lnformed where
work is ta be had durlng the sunimer, and
the cail will doubtless appeal ta thousands
amang theni who were en the land up ta
four or five years ago, and a certain proportion of whom would feel that, instead
of starving or begglng in the streets of
oui towns and éities, it would be opportune and'necessary for them ta retuirn t)
the land, either singly or 'sdth their
familles. I think this is an excellent idea.
Many of these people, who have toIt the
pinch of poverty in the towns and cities,
will be attracted anew ta, the land, and
will perhaps decide ta remain there and
follow their old vocations. 1 cannot too
strongly urge upon the representatives of
the Government in this Chamber the suggestion that a campaign be carried an by
moans of posters in the post offices, notifying the farmers that by making application tu the variaus provincial employment
bureaus they can get labour.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Dues my honourable friend know that that waff done
two and a-half years ago?
Honý Mr. DANDURAND: I am flot
aware of that, but I amn sure my honourable friend will realize that the ground is
naw far better prepared for such a campaign as has been suggested when
thousands of men are walking the streeta
of aur towns and cities looking for employmént.
The honourable gentleman tramn Halifax
said that many of the people who might
be recalled ta the land would find in the
auturnn, alter the crops were gathered in,
that they would be loft to shift for . themselves; but surely a large proportion of
theni would rather remain about the villagon and the coufttryside, .doing little odd
jobs during the winter, than go back and
tall inte the queues in order to reaeh a
sçup kitaen In Toronto or Montreal.

Han. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I do flot propose to take part in
this discussion. 1 rnerely want ta draw
the attention of the Chairman of the Committee to the last two lines of the Committee's report. It says:
and request that the nexct Session they be
empowered to continue their inquiry ta the
extent that conditions wiUl then cail for.

That is flot the regular formn in which
reports are brought in, and, il the honourable gentleman would consent to strike out
those words, the report would be muc1 i,
more in keeping with our ordinary procedure.
Han. Mr. McDONALD: I arn perfectly
willing, because I ,understand that we cannot in one Session bind ourselves as ta the
proceedings during the next Session.
May 1 be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
allowed tu draw the attention of the Government and of the Labour flepartment
ta one fact? It is alleged that the manufacturers have materially reduced their
prices, and have Written off their lasses
by drawing on their reserves or credits in
order ta seil goods at prices based on the
present cost of raw materials. It le aileged that in very many Uines the wholesalers have reduced their sale figures
similarly. But it is alleged that the retailers-and the biggest unes at that, the
departmental stores-have not made similar reductions in their prices ta the consumer. I may for their justification say
that, while they are taking a large profit
on these lines, they are try'ing ta adjust
their lasses an other lines in which the
costs' have flot eorne down, or -on those
parts of their stock which they bought at
high peak prices. Yet 1 will mention one
line which the public purchases largely,
and that is cotton. In cotton, prices have
come down materially; the aid stocka have
been sold, and the new stocks are on the
shelves; but, according ta my information,
the prices ta the consumer have not been
reduced. I mention that becauaq it seems
ta me that catton is a commodlty which
the people need, and 1 should lilce tA know
what justification there is for the action
of these departmental stores ini keeping
up pricesan that commodity.
The motion was agreed te, and the report was concurred In.
The Senate a.djourned until 2.80 p.rn.
this day.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, there are no Orders of the

time. The probabilities are that the Supply
Bill will not be down for an hour or so.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

I have no intention, honourable gentlemen, of making any observations upon the
Supply Bill. It is not customary for me
to do this. I simply give the figures, and
it is for my honourable friends opposite, if
they so desire, to enter upon a discussion.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, the amounts which the honourable leader of the Government has read to
the House are certainly large, considering
the condition in which the country is placed
to-day. The items that we are voting by
this Supply Bill, as I took them down, totai

has not mentioned how the Government
intend to obtain the money needed te meet
these expenditures.

According te those estimates there would
be a deficit of about $6,000,000. To that
must be added these items regarding loans
which my honourable friend has mentioned.

JUNE 4, 1921
I' have here to take exception again, as I
have had to do on formeroccasions, to the
rnethod of inclnding appropriations for
loans to railway companies in the general
Suppby Bill. The Supply Bibi ahould be, I
maintain, the voting of money for the carrying on of the general, every-day business
of the country. I regret that, la apite of
protests that have been trnade for 'several
years past against the practice of voting
in the Suppby Bibl large arnounts of money
for snch purposes as boans to, railway companies and boans te the provinces, it is repeated on this occasion. I think that the
Senate shonld take this matter into serions
'consideration, perhaps not at present,,but
on some future occasion, and enter avery
strong protest againgt this method of bringing down such items in the Supply Bill.
As a mile the Senate does flot deal with
snppby; it is only in very serions cases
that this House wonld think of taking
action in this respect. But if the present
method is continued, we onght to take some
action regarding such items as these boans
to railway companies being put through in
this way. It does not afford the Senate a
proper opportnnity of discnssing the matter or of dealing with the Supply Bill as it
onght te be deait with.
There is one question with regard to
the bcans to which I would direct the
attention of the Honse. The amount of
the loans to the railways has been increasing from year to year. We have had to
make boans to the Canadian Northern for
fouir or five years past, and the amount
has gradnalby increased fromn $15,000,000
to $25,00,000, then to $35,000,000, and now
to $50,000,000. This year we have te provide also for the boan of $89,687,633 te' tne
Grand Trnnk raibway, and the item of
$26,000,000 to the -Grand Trnnk Pacific,
making a total of $165,687,633 for railway
boans. If hononrable gentlemen have by
a copy of the Estimates, they wibl se
-thern
that it is provided that these maibway cernpanies shail pay to the Governrnent 6 per
cent for this rnoney. I fear that the Geveranent wibl have te, borrow in this country, ia the United States, In England, or
wherever it can be obtained, practically al
this rnoney In order te be able te lend it
te the mailways,- and the Goverament wibb
find iA very difficult indeed to raise the
money. Every honoumable gentleman in
this House knàows the cônditîon of the financial :markets of the wôrld to-day. It' is
very doubtfub that the Government-will-be
able te raise this money at 6 percent. :The
probabibities are that theyý wibl have: te

825

pay more than 6 per cent, and that therefore, in addition to providing this large
sum. of money to lend to the railways, we
shall haveý to provide next year for the
difference between the interest the railways
are expected to pay to the Government and
the interest which the Government rnust
pay on the money they will have toborrow.
I think that our expenditure will be considerably increased in that way.
The Railway -Commission last year
granted to the railway cornpanies an increase in rates, which must, of course,
corne ont of the pockets of the people. Notwithstanding that increase, we have to provide an enormons sum of money for the
railways to enable thema to carry on for the
T.he present situation is
ensuing year.
that the railway companies are virtually
waiting for this money, in order to pay
their present debts. If it were possible for
us in any way to prevent the granting of
these boans, and~ if we did prevent it, we
should be tying up a great dleal of business
in this, country; for there are many persons throughout the country who are to-day
awaiting the voting of this money in order
that their ac counts may be paid by the
Government.
The country is in a very serions position.
I do flot want to take np mnch of the Urne
of the House, bnt I do think we ought to
enter a very strong protest against the
enormous amount of rnoney that we are
now asked to vote in this Snpply Bill. As
I have already pointed out, it will be necessary for the Goverament to maise a considerable sum-I have heard it estirnated
to bie as high as $200,00,00-for the purpose of carrying on the conntry's affairs
this year. The conntry cannot afford to
continue spending rnoney in the way it is
being spent, as shown by these Estirnates.
I think that in this matter sufficient consideration has not; been given to the present
condition of Canada. The returns I have
before me with regard te the trade of the
conntry ghow that onr trade, instead of in,
creasing, is- at the present time decreasing.
A retnrn pnblished recently by the Goverament shows that the total importa of
Canada for the twelve moniths ending
April, 192-1, amounted -te $1,207,178,994,
whereas in the previons year, 1919-20,
the imnports arnonnted te $1,108,563,Q99.
During the saine period ending April, 1921,
.6ur exports arnunted to -$1,179,088,050,

should be paid ta take it, there is an arbitratian sitting in the good city of Montreal
to decide how mueh money we will pay for
it.
On the l3th of April last the Grand
Trunk railway, by being dilatory, actually
lost the option to seli the railway; and
when that was known -there was joy
throughout the land of Canada. We expected that the Government would have
taken advantage'o! their opportunity, and
would have permitted the law ta take its
course, and that this question, like that of
any other bankrupt railway, would have
been taken to the Exehequer Court, In
accordance with the excellent law which
we have on the statute book, put there by
the honourable gentleman frein De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), and that the
preferred creditars would have been paid
whatever the road would -bring when sold
under the public haxnmer. -There is no
doubt that nobody would have bld very
much. I do not believe that the road would
have brought enougih to pay its bonds
and debts. Still, there la an aibitration
sitting in the city of Montreal ta determine
what the taxpayerB of this country are ta
pay for a railroad which is a publie charge,
and of which 1,600 iles are in the United

States.
How i. Ris Majesty the King going
ta aperate a railroad in a foreign
land when, in the legisiature of every
State which it traverses, there will be
people who are inimical ta England and to
the British Empire? I sec the Minister of
Labour looking at me. No ane knows
better than he how dificult it will be ta
operate that railway; how, at every turn,
the operation of the road will be hampered.
Thank Gad, we are gaod friends with the
United States. The vast majority of the,
people of the United States are in
e.ympathy with the British Empire; but
friction may arise at any moment,

and there are two large elenients in the
United States that are fat froni friendly,
bath of which have representatives in

every State.
ta

I say it is dangerous ta this pauntry
undertake the operation of rail-

ways in the United States. In my view,
honourable gentlemen, these railways have
not been paying their way. The Vermont
Central railway, for one, ha. had a huge
deficit, and mont o! the other roada, lncluding the' one running te Grand Haven, in
the. State of Michigan, have not paid theit
way. Many of the. railtoadu in the Uaited

States to-day are not paying their way,
and the ones that I have mentioned are not
the best of themn.
Why the Government should persist
in buying the Grand Trunk railway
is more than I can understand. Some
years ago--it will be four years, next
fail-the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company were told that they should intervene
and prevent the purchase by the Government of the Canadian Northern railway.
They were told that surely they must have
friends in this House, even if they had
lost ail their friends in the other Hanse;
and that if they had only two or three
f riends here they should prevent the Canadian Northern deal going through. The
taking over of that railway -la one of the
reasons why we are in such financial
straits ta-day. The Canadian Pacific railway have only got themselves to blame.
If they had exercised their influence at
that time things might be different, and
that nefarious transaction might have been
prevented. That Bill was run parallel
with the Conscription Att, and so anxious
were the promoters of the scheme that, in
spite of the great necessity there was slipposed to be for conscription, in spite of the
fact that men were dying in France, the
Railway Bill was run through bath Houses
of Parliament in less than a month, while
the Conscription Bill took three months.
Our boys were being killed, but bef are help
could be sent to them we had to buy the
Canadian Northern railway. That policy,
honourable gentlemen, has been more disastrous financially than the Great War.
The 'Great War has corne ta an end, and
the interest an out war debts is not as
large an, amount as the deficits an that
railway; and when we add the Grand
Trunk the burden will be 150 per cent
greater. The Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company have no one to blame but themselves. Il they had used their influence
at the time they would have been able to
prevent that deal golng through.
While talking about the Canadian Pacifie
rallway I mlght allude to Lord Shaughnessy's plan. Lord Shaughnessy's plan unfortunately did not create a ripple of excitement -in anothet place, and in this House we
gave it, two days ago, a very quiet funeral.

SENATE

The other day, I think it was yesterday,
the honourable member for Rideau (Hon.
Mr. Edwards) sang the praises of the new
temporary Chairman of the Grand Trunk
Railway Board. Well, God forbid that I
should make an uncharitable
remark
against Sir Joseph Flavelle; but I could
not help thinking that Sir Joseph Flavelle
was very friendly to the Canadian Bank
of Commerce, and that the honourable
member from Ottawa was also very friendly
to that bank. One would think since. 1911
that only the friends of the Canadian Bank
of Commerce were entitled to occupy any
positions; and I say right now that the
singing of the praises of Sir Joseph
Flavelle by the honourable Senator from
Ottawa reminded me of Messalina singing
the praises and virtues of Cleopatra. When
it came to forming this Government it was
a friend of the Canadian Bank of Commerce who was entrusted with the key of
the strong chest. He had not been a member of Parliament-no, not even a candidate. Sir Robert Borden looked amongst
all his followers up to that time for one
whom he could trust with the money of
Canada, but not one of them would he trust.
He looked in New Brunswick, which had
been the home of Sir George Foster, who
had been the Finance Minister, but on
account of past history he was passed over.
In Nova Scotia nobody was found. He did
not look very hard in the Province of Quebec, or he would have found plenty of
honest men there. But he looked in Ontario. He had some 75 followers in Ontario; not one of them would he trust. He
went to Manitoba; Bob Rogers offered himself, but he would not have him.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Who told you that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He went to Saskatchewan and Alberta, nay, even to British Columbia, and amongst all his followers,
looking them all over, he seemed to have
said: " I don't see any of you that I would
trust with the key of the chest; I have
to take a man who was a Grit as long as
Laurier was in power; I have to take
that Grit and make him Finance Miister."
And who was he? He was the Manager
of the National Trust Company, of which
Sir Joseph Flavelle is the President. It
seems all to work in the family: it is always
some one of the Bank of Commerce connection; and to-day what is he? He is the
arbitrator for this Government. He even
sat in the House of Commons as member
for Leeds.
He bas resigned his seat.
At last he had some conception of the proHon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

priety of not being paid and fed at public
expense while a member of Parliament. I
must say to his credit that he did not take
his seat there; but he should have resigned
that seat at the opening of the Session,
or before, in order that the county of Leeds
might have been represented as it is entitfed to be. However, he is sitting to-day
in the city of Montreal as an arbitrator to
saddle us with the Grand Trunk, and his
ancient chief, Sir Joseph Flavelle, is the
Chairman of the Board.
Now, the other 14,000 or 17,000 miles of
Government railway-who is operating
them to-day? Mr. Hanna. Who is Mr.
Hanna? He is a friend of mine, and I
will not say a word against him, but at
the same time he was the chief man of
Mackenzie and Mann, as everybody knows.
Therefore what hope is there that this
budget will not be much greater next year
than it is to-day? There is no telling what
expense we will be put to. The extravagance is something enormous; nothing
seems to stop or stay this Government.
To-day, when railroads cannot be given
away in the United States, to think that we
are buying them! I think the most charitable thing I can say is that it is a case of
insanity, because it would be much worse if
they knew what they were doing. We must
be like our Saviour on the Cross, who said,
" Lord, forgive them, they don't know what
they are doing." That is the only explanation I can see; that is the most charitable
construction that I can put on their conduct.
Now, I do not want to detain this House
very long, but I just want to saySome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, honourable gentlemen can answer if any one of
them wants to. Do not let that detain you;
the Governor is not at the door yet; there
is plenty of time.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: We are not
through yet.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If those honourable gentlemen who have less affection for
the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Sir Byron
Walker, Sir Joseph Flavelle, Sir Thomas
White-they are all knighted now-if those
gentlemen know that there is no use changing this Government, that any other Government would do the same thing, I
would tell them that no Government can
change as fast as the Bank of Commerce
can. Why, right up to the last minute
they were the pillars of the Laurier Govern-

JUNE 4, 1921
ment in Ontario, and when there was a
change of Governrnent they seemed to have
corne down here and dictated their terms.
You know the old slogan; if the honourabie
-nember for Kings and Albert is here hie
will rernember it-he said it: 'ýCox can't
wait." That was the language of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. That was the time
my honourable friend was taking the Government ta task-"YCox can't wait"'; and hie
had another great phrase: "This Government is swayed by women, wine, and graft."
We ail rernember those words; they were
beautiful words. If I were to paraphrase
themn to-day, I could not say anything in
the presence of the ladies; and, as to wine,
that has disappeared; we have prohibition,
and, as you see, I arn drinking wàter. Al
that remains is graft, graft, graft. Therefore I arn afraid that this country is in a
very bad predicament.
We have a deficit facing us; we are
having unemployment increasing. Only last
night I was reading in the Montreal Stara good Conservative paper, owned and
edited by Lord Atholstan, one of the best
supporters and one of the creators of this
Government-the statement that people
are actually starving now, at the beginning of the month cf Jufle, in the
city of Montreai, and after a very hard
winter the doctors who have been exarnining the people and their familles find that
through mal-nutrition the men are not fit
ta work even if they could get work. That
is what la taking place to-day in Montreal,
and at the saine time millions galora are
being squandered, and careiesely squandered.
The Government stated that they were
going ta change the administration of those
railways, but we have not had even the
promise that there will be a change, and
what has taken place? As every honourable gentleman in this House knows, the
Minister of Finance has adrnitted a deficit
of $70,000,000. There is a great deal more
than that, but taking his own figures they
amount to $5,000 a mile cf deficit-more
than the total earnings cf the C.P.R. while
that company was paying 10 per cent on
its stock a few years ago. I say that la a
dpficit that looks to me most mysterious,
and it will have ta be explained sorne day.
There la no possibility cf a railway being
run honestly and having such a deficit. At
Saskatoon, for instance, where the C.P.R.
dues 60 per cent cf the business and the
National Railway 40 per cent-to illustrate
the situation and make it easy to understand-suppose there are a thoiusand cars,

82S

and the C.P.R. moves 600 of those, while
the Grand Trunk only moves 400, stili the
C.P.R. does ail the shunting and rnoving of
those 600 cars with two, shunting engines,
while the beautiful adrninistration of Government rail'ways uses 17 shunting engines
with 17 crews to do 40 per cent of the work,
as against the 60 per cent done by two
shunting engines on the C.P.R. I see the
gentlemen from the Northwest who to-day
profees to be in favour of Governrnent
ownership. I said to themn some sessions
ago: "Don't corne back and whine at the
high rates; you want Governrnient operation." Well, you have it, gentlemen, practiçal Governrnent operation, and you are
paying through the nose for it. I arn serry
for you, but I cannot help you, and you
have only yourselves to blarne for it.
The present position is a sad one indeed;
and what is stili sadder is to find that rny
honourable friends opposite wiil not say
one word in justification of that scandalous
budget and those estimates--not one word.
If they couid send us hiome with some
words of consolation, even to say that they
hope it will be better in the near future;
if they could dress this up and make thernselves believe that we were ail right, that
these deficits were going to cease; or give
us another ray of hope by saying that they
would flot take the Grand Trunk, and that
they would let the law take its course.
But no, I arn afraid I will meet nothing but
silence, and notwithetanding ail the provocations I may give I will not get a response
-unless, perchance, my honouralbie friend
from Kinge and Albert wili corne to the
rescue and say something in defence of
the Governmnent. He did not always speak
in favour of the Governrnent this rnorning;
perhaps to-night he might mke his peace
with his friends by saying a good word for
them.
Reverting to the Shaughnessy plan, I
forgot to mention that thst plan, by which
the C. P. R. would have received dividends
in secula seculorurn, for ever and ever,
would ie a very nice thing, a cornfortable
thing for the shareholdirs; but there
minds of
must be lurking in -the
some of the Directors of the Canadian Pacifie the thought that, Vith the
disorganization of 'labour through the
length and breadth of this land owing to
Government operation, it is going to be
more and more difficuit for them to get a
reasonable day'e work for a reasonabie
day's pay on their railroad. Lord Shaugh*nessy thought that by puttiig thls UP to the
people there might be a chance of the

SENATE
Government biting te the cleverly baited
book, and saying: "Ail right, you can
take our ralýlways and run them; you can
have deficits on them; but your railway,'
the C.P.R., will always get the same dividend as it Is getting to-day." That would
have been very comfortable, and 1 arn sure
the C. P. R. stock would have gone up
somewhat, though probably nlot as much
as when Laurier was in power. Honourable
gentlemen will remember that when Sir
Wilfrid came into power the C. P. R., which
is the financial barorneter of this country,
was at -a low figure, but as soon as the sun
of Laurier began to shine over Canada,
then at once the C. P. R. stock conuTenced
te Tise with the sun, and it rose to 150, 175,
200-nay, it went, 1 believe to 280, if not to
300 at one time; but as soon as niy honourable friends opposite came into power the
C. P. R. stock commenced to tumble, like
everything else; immigration to this land
stopped. At the time Sir Wilfrid Laurier
left office immigrants were coming into
Canada at the rate of a thousand
a day or more; but as soon as the
honourable
gentlemen
opposite
came
into power the immigration stopped,
our population was at a standstill, and
C. P. R. stock commenced to tumble to
where it is to-day. Therefore the plan of
Lord Shaughnessy was buried, and the old
saying was proved thett the good die young.
It might have been a good proposition;- it
certainly was such for the C. P. R., and
that proposition might have been considered, but being so good it died young. It
reminds me of the verse 'we used to learn in
the old Seminary of Quebec, when Malherbe
was writing to Dupérrier, to dilate upon the
de.ath of the latter's daughter:
Mals elle était du monde, où les plus belles

After which His Excellency the Governor
General was pleased to close the fifth
Session of the thirteenth Pariament of the
Dominion of Canada with the following
SPEECH
Honourable Gentlemen of the Senate,
Gentlemen of the House of Commons:
1 amn glad to relieve you f rom further attendance ln Parliament after a iSession which ha.
been marked 'by legisiation of an important
character.
Steps to Increase the trade of the country
have been taken by the ratification of commercial agreements with France and the British
West Indieýs. It may be hoped that the latter
agreement will result ln strengthening the ties
whýich bind together His Majesty's dominions.
Consequent on Canada's position as a member cf the League of Nations, Acts have been
passed to define 'Canadian nation-ale, and to
authorize the ratification and carrying into
effect of the Protocol accepting the ýStatutýe for
the Permanent Court of International Justice.
The attempt to arrange for joint control by
the Dominion and the Province of Ontario cf
the levels and flow, of the Lake of the Woods
water system having become abortive, by reason
of a Bill concurrent to The Lake of the Woods
Control Act failing to pass the Legisiature of
Ontario, legislation has been enacted declaring
certain works ln that system to lhe for the
general advantage of Canada and iroviding for
control by the Dominion In the public Interest
of ail parts of the country having rights therein.
A Committee on Pensions. Insurance, and, Reestablishment has given thorough reconsideration to these problerns and their reconunenda-

tions have been embodied ln legislation which
will make more adeciuate the assistance which
the country owes to its ex-service men.
A Bill to regulate the grading of dairy
has become law. This legislation
produce
should conduce to the more systematic and
satisfactory marketing of a very Important Canadian product with better resuits to both producer and consumer.
The Act to repeal the Conservation Act and
to make Provision for the carrying on by the
appropriate departments of government of the
necessary services hitherto conducted under the
Commission of Conservation will resuit ln a
reduction of public charges which Is so Important at the present time.
A further step towards the solution of the
probiem of the National Railwaya has been
taken in the passage of an Act by virtue of
which Possession and control of the Grand
Trunk Railway System ha. been acquired and
provision made for reviving the aribitration
proceedings to ascertain the value of the stocks.
A special commIttee ha. conducted an enqulry
into certain phases of the problem o! the operation of these railways.
The proposais as to revenue contained ln the
Appropriation Act will It Is confidently hoped
meet the necessities of the year with a minimum of burden on the people and on the conduct of industry.
Gentlemen of the House of Commons:
1 thank you for the liberal provision you have
made for the public service.
Honourable Gentlemen of the Senate,
Gentlemen of the flouse of Commons:
This ls the last occasion I shall have the
honour o! addressing you a. my termn of office
wiil have expired before you meet again.
May I assure you that I shall always retain
a very real affection for Canada andi its people
andi I shahl watch your progress with the greatest interest in the sure belief that an ever lncreasing measure of happiness and prosperity
will be the lot of the Dominion.
