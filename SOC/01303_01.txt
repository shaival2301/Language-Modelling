OFFICIAL REPORT

THE SENATE.
Monday, Septemiber 1, 1919.
Thé Senate met at 2.45 p.m.
OPENING OF THE SESSION.

-

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication ,from the Governor 'General's Secretary,
informing him that His Excellency the Governor General would proceed to the Senate
Chamber to open the session of the Dominion Parliament on Monday, the 1st September, at 3 o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE 'DHiRONE.
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to -the Senate
Chamber and took his seat on the Throne.
The members of the Senate being assembled,
His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendanxce of the House of Commons, and,
that House being come, His Excellency was
pleased to open the Third Session of the
Thirteenth Parliament of the Dominion of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Gentlemen of the Senate:
Gentlemen of the House of Commons:
In this, tis first visit to our Dominion, His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales at once
renews happy associations with lis comrades
of the Canadian army, and at the same time
undertakes the important duty of making himself acquainted at first hand with the resources
and development of our country, and with the
ideals and aspirations of our people.
The
warm and sincere welcome which everywhere
greets him is an assurance that the ties which
unite our country with the Motherland and
the other dominions in a great community of
nations were never closer or firmer than they
are to-day.
The urgency of proceeding immediatèly to
the consideration of the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and
Germany, signed at Versailles an the 28th day
of June, 19119, has compelled me to summon
you to renewed labours which I trust will not
be of long duration.

8-1

My advisers are of the opinion that this
treaty ought not to be ratified on behalf of
Canada without the approval of Parliament.
Authenticated copies will be placed before you
without delay for your consideration.
In addition you will be asked to direct your
attention to other measures, including those
rendered immediately necessary by the approaching return of peace and by the terms
of the Peace Treaty.
Honourable Gentlemen of the House
of
Commons:
Estimates will be laid before you making
such financial provision as may be required in

Honourable Gentlemen of the Senate:
Gentlemen of the House of Commons:

For more than five years the world has en-

dured the devastation and horror of war forced
upon it by an intoIerable spirit and purpose of
aggression. Fortunately our country has been
spared the desolation and ruin which have been
inflicted upon many other nations; but our
participation in the war has involved heavy
burdens and vast sacrifices which our people
have borne with an unflinching spirit. With
reverent thankfulness we realize that the worid
emerges victorlous from its long struggle
against the forces of barbarous militarism and
savage aggression. The labours of reconstruction may be difilcult and even painful; and we
must undertake them with the same united
resolve and inflexible purpose as sustained our
efforts during the years of conflict. To
you
and to the great nation whose affairs are committed to your charge, I bid God-speed in ail
your endeavours.

lis Excellency the Governor General was
pleased to retire, and the House of Commons withdrew.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.

Hoi. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I onitted
to sav tliat, with a view of securing action
by Parliaxent as quickly as possible, tie
reslutions wiil precde a Bill. It is desirable to have aun expression of the Parliament
of Canada upon the subject by way of re-lution, owing to the delay which might
occur in discussing a Bill; but the Bill,
which will be introduced at the earliest
possible moment, will be along the sanie
linos as the resolutions.
I 'beg te lay upon the Table the following
papers relating to the Peace Treaty:
1. Treaty of Pence between the Allied and

I may say, honourable gentlemen, that
the papers respecting'the Peace Treaty have
arrived only within the last couple of days.
They are being distributed, and it has
been arranged that each honourable gentlenian will receive a copy of the Treaty as
received by the Governîment of Canada.
As to the French version, only one copy
lias been sent from France, but we are now
endeavouring to get an equal number of
French copies for distribution.
When may we
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
expect to get copies of those documents?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
will be distributed at once.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The resolutions
submnitted to the House do not cover the

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH.
ADD'RESS IN REBLY.

The Senate proceeded to the consideration of Ris Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. FREDERIC NICHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, in rising to move that a
vote of thanks be presented to Ris Excellency the Governor General in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, I want, first of all,
to thank the honourable the leader of the
Government for the honour accorded" to
me n selecting me to make this motion,
particularly because I believe the present
session of Parliament marks an epoch in
the advancement of Canada to a dignified
position among the great nations of the
world. The fact that for the first time in
the history of this country we have departed from the status of a colony and have
entered upon the status of one of the great
powers is evidenced by the fact that the
Parliament of Canada has been called together to consider a treaty of peace and to
ratify it if it so elects.
Another reason why I consider that this
is a very important session is because we
have recently been honoured by the visit
of Ris Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
who yesterd-ay laid the corner stone of the
tower of the new Parliament Building. In
the Speech from the Throne Ris Excellency
refers to this visit, saying:
In this, his first visit to our Dominion, Ris

Royal Highness the Prince of Wales at once
renews happy associations with his comrades
of the Canadian Army, and at the same time
undertakes the important duty of making himself acquainted at first hand with the resources
and development of our country, and with the
ideals and aspirations of our people.

In 1860, fifty-nine years ago, Albert Edward, then Prince of Wales, laid the corS-i

'

3

ner stone of the old Parliament Building,
which a few years since was destroyed by
fire. The Prince of Wales of that day
afterwards ascended the Throne as His
Majesty King Edward the Seventh, reigned
wisely and well, was beloved by his people
during his lifetime, , and was sincerely
mourned at his death. Yesterday we all
attended a brilliant function when the corner stone of the new Parliament Building,
which we hope soon to occupy, was Laid
by Ris Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales. Many material changes have taken
place in the destiny of the Dominion during the time that bas intervened between
these two important functions. But honourable gentlemen will agree with me
when I say that no change whatever bas
taken place during that interval of fiftynine years in the fervent loyalty of the
'Canadian people to the British Empire, to
our King, and to the Royal family; and,
honourable gentlemen, the manifestations
of loyalty and affection which have been
witnessed during the recent visit of Ris
Royal Highness prove to my mind beyond
all doubt that British connection is our
chosen destiny.
Ris ;Royal Highness, while young in
years, has played a man's part during the
war, and notwithstanding his exalted
station has served with distinction at the
front; and, in my opinion, the fact that
during part of that time he was attaehed to
our Canadian army, and also the fact that
since his arrival in Canada he bas expressed the desire to be known as Canadian
in sentiment, will render the occasion of his
departure from our shores one of national
regret; and that when the time comes to bid
him Godspeed, all of us will echo in our
hearts the words "Au revoir," and not
"Good-bye."
There have been many material changes
in the life of Canada since 1860; for seven
years thereafter a nation was born-, when
the Act of Confederation was passed, which
bound together the scattered provinces of
British North America; and since that time
so many changes, always for our betterment,
have occurred that even the most optimistic
of those virile and far-sighted statesmen
who have since come to bé known as the
Fathers of Confederation could not have
conceived of the important rôle Canada was
destined to play during the lifetime of a
single generation.
Honourable gentlemen, I have here an
orticial copy of what J believe to be the
greatest document the world bas ever seen:
a synopsis of the Treaty of Peace with Ger-

SENATE

4

mîany, and the terms under which the
League of Nations will be called together.
Who would have dreamed at the time of
Coniederation, fifty-two years ago, that w-e
to-day would have been called together to
consider a document of such enormous portent? As this has only been recently distributed and cannot have been considered
very fully by the majority of the members
of this House, I will read the names of
those countries which are banded together.
hie fact that this country is one of the
signatory parties, and that our own Prime
Minister sat at the Imperial councils of
peace during tue time this important document was ceing framed, should redound to
our national credit and appeal to our
national pride. The countries which I have
mentioned are as follows: the United States
of America, the Kingdon of Great Britain
and Ireland, the Dominion of Canada, the
Conmmonwealth of Australia, the Union of
Souîth Africa, the Dominion of New Zealand,
India, the French Republic, the Kingdom of
Italy, the Empire of Japan, the Kingdom
of 3elgium, the Republic of Bolivia, the
Republic of Brazil, the Cuban Re.public, the
Republic of Ecuador, the Kingdcom of
Greece, the Republic of Guatemala, the Republic of Haiti, the Kingdomu of Hedjez, the
Republic of Honduras, the Republic of
Liberia, the Republic of Nicsragua, the Republic of Panama, the Republic of Peru,
the Kingdom of Runania, the CzechoPolish Republic, the Portuguese Republic,
Slovakian Republic, tie Republic of Uruguay.
Tlese, honourable gentlemen, are the
naies of the different signxatories to this
Peace Treaty; and, wlhile there may be
somne objections to it, it is a wonder
vast questhat, when such
to nie
and detions lad to be considered
eided in such a very short space of time,
the objections were not more numerous
than they have been found to be.
lis Excellency also refers in his Speech
to the necessity and the wisdom of considering the Peace Treaty at the earliest
In that, so far as I
possible moment.
am personally concerned, I am in accord,
for the reason that until the world is at
peace and we settle down with an understanding of the ternis under which we are
to live in the future, it is impossible that
production shall go forward, and it is impossible unless production goes forward
that ve shall be able to arrange to provide
the wherewithal to carry on.
I have in my hands a copy of the New
York Times of August 20th, which I think
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

is a very valuable document to help us in
considering the terms of the Peace Treaty.
It contains a full stenographic report of
a conference between the President of the
United States and the Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate, at which he was
questioned in regard to nearly every point
of difference that had arisen in the discussion in the United States Congress. The
President of the United States, in addressing the Conference, stated:
I welcome the opportunity for a frank and
full interchange of views.
I hope, too, that this conference will serve to
expedite your consideration of the Treaty of
Peace. I beg that you will pardon and indulge
me if I again urge that practically the whole
task cf bringing the country back to normal
(onditions of life and industry waits upon the
decision of the Senate with regard to the terms
of the peace.
I venture thus again to urge my advice that
the action of the Senate with regard to the
Treaty be taken at the earliest practicable moment because the problems with which we are
face to face in the readjustment in our national
life are of the most pressing and critical character, will require for their proper solution the
most intimate and disinterested co-operation of
ail parties and all interests and cannot be post1oned without manifest peril to our people and
to all the national advantages we hold most
dear.

i these sentences I think the importance of expedition is exemplified mîost
thoroughly.
In an editorial in the saine paper on the
same date, the following appears, under
the heading of " War when there is no
war":
The President's conference with the members
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
should send the Treaty unchallenged to immediate ratification. In the address with which
he opened the conference, Mr. Wilson appealed
te the understanding, the candour, the fairness,
the patriotism, and the judgment of the senators. He pointed out to them that our present
condition is that of being at "war when there
is no war;" he laid before them' clearly the
need of the country's industry for settled peace:
he pointed out the grave riskcs we run by further
postponement of peace of losing our present advantage in international trade; labour will be in
a turmoil, and there can be no stable conditions
of employment until we know what the finaL
settlement will be; the future of Europe will
remain uncertain, and there can be no return to
normal conditions of life in this country until
the war has been ended by the acceptance of
this comact.
Honourable gentlemen, it would be unwise, and it would be in bad taste, for me

or any other member of this honourable
House to discuss or criticise the proceedings

of our neighbours to the south in regard tthe Peace Treaty; but we may hope that,
whatever conclusion is arrived at after full

SEPTEMBER 2, 1919

and fair discussion, it will end in a settlement that will unite the Anglo-Saxon
nations in a .peace that we can feel is
going to be permanent and will make for
the betterment of the world, and-that the
League of Nations may become the very
citadel of peace and good will among mankind.
Sir Robert Borden, as soon as he arrived
in Engl'nd, after the signing of the aratitice, stated:
The problems that lie before our country, In
common with other Britannie nations, are quite
as momentous as those whIch we faced during
the war, and I believe even more difficult. Our
people will face them with the same courage,
resolve, and confidence as sustained them during
the weary years of war.
Honourable gentlemen, I think we have
already shown that this country has been
prepared and is prepared to face all problems, and that we intend to be true to ourselves and to deal fairly with every section
of the community. During last session, since
the armisti4e was proclaimed, many legislative enactments have been passed, to some
of which I may refer; for instance, the
Pensions Act 'amendment, which provides
that the pensions granted by Canada shall
rank highest amongst those of the nations
who fought during the war; the War Service
Gratuity Act, which provides a generous
gratuity according to length of service; the
Soldiers' Land Settlement Act, which
makes provision for extending financial aid
to soldiers who desire to settle upon theland; the creatiori of the Department of
Soldiers' Civil Re-establisment, which is
entrusted with the care of the returned
soldier from the time he is discharged until
he is re-established in civil lite; the creation of the Board of Commerce for the investigation and restraint of monopolies and
undue enhancement of the prices of con*modities; and many other enactments of
greater or lesser importance.
We have given evidence during the war,
and since the war, in many ways, of our
ability to shoulder the burden when our
own integrity and the integrity of the empire were at stake. We all know that the
Government has borrowed from our own
people, in round figures, a billion and a
half of dollars; but notwithstanding this
fact we have taken home to ourselves the
motto of Lloyd George: "Save and serve."
The savings in our chartered ibanks have
increased to one and three-quarter billions
of dollars. Our farmers have obeyed the
injunction, "Save and serve," and, according to the latest figures which I have, which
are merely approximate, the total wheat

-

5

yield of the Dominion for the current year
will be about 230,000,000 bushels, valued
at about $500,000,000.
Our balance of trade still runs in our
-favour, and some of you may be astonished
to learn that during the last fiscal year
our exports per capita amounted to $195.
as against $70 for the United States and
$55 for Great Britain.
We are being
accused of extravagance, and perhaps with
more or less justification; but, honourable
gentlemen, the State s like an individual:
unle's we have confidence in ourselves, we
shall not be able to carry on our government and at the saie time take care of the
requirements of our people. And at this
time it ils, I think, just as well to pay attention, not te our- disadvantages, but to
our great advantages and to the wonderful
resources -which we have within ourselves
and which the will of our people 'will see
developed in proper time.
- Parliament has assembled in special session, as I stated before, to consider what in
my judgment is the greatest document that
has ever been produced since the world
began-the Treaty of Peace. There are a
great many advantages in it, with possibly
some disadvantages; but we must consider
that if we are going to enter into an undertaking which is for the purpose of assuring us eternal peace, we cannot assure this
to ourselves without assuming some responsibilities. I believe, honourable gentlemen, that after this Treaty of Peace has
been discussed and ratified, after this
Parliament has prorogued and we settle
down t
attend -to all our material affairs, which have been neglected
during the stress of war, we shall find
that Canada will advance much more
rapidly in the future than it has advanced
in the past. We in Canada are not looking
for any monetary recompense as a result of
the war; but we have done something for the
sake of freedom and humanity.
A very brief perusal of the teris of
the Treaty of Peace, and of other literature
that I have been able t gather together,
leads me to disagree with those who think
that the terms of peace are severe against
Germany. One should remember that Germany has not been devastated. Her tactories arç all intact, not ravaged like those
of France and Belgium, which it will take
many years to reconstruct in order that
they may compete with the other nations
of the world. But, serious as those terms
may be, we in this House shall have to give
them consideration, and I have jotted down

been associated with 'Canadians. Part of
his war service-a war service which was
very creditable Vo him-was spent with the
Canadians. Unlike his oousins tbe Hohenzollerns, hie did noV command an army
corps or an army, but ba 'began at the lowest rung of the ladder-began as a'lieutenant,-and did service in the tranches-as
othar lieutenants and other men from
Canada did--servica which daily risked his
life: again unlike 'hie cousins the HoIhenzollerns, who took ýparticular cara of their
more or less unworthy lives.
The iPrince has corne to this country; hae
has only been in a portion of it as'yet; but
wherever he has gone *he has made
for himiself Iriends. He might ruly say, in
tbe words of a great soldier of old, -"I
came, I saw, I conquered." I question if
there is a constituency in Canada, or in
that portion of Canada at laast through
wbich bie has travelled, tbat would not
eleet him by acclamation to-morrow as
their representative. 1 know I would noV
want to run against himi in any constituency; I feel that I should be disastrously
beaten. IV is a splendid thing to feel that
the future, if this young man lives, is
assured, and that we shahl have upon the
Throne of hs Empire so worthy a successor to a great line of monarchs, with
some fe'w exceptions. In many respects hie
is like bis ýgrandfather, tbe great peacemaker, wbo>se statesmanshîp, we know, was
largely responsible for the splendid position which we occupied in this war, largely
responsible for the splendid feeling that
existed between France and England when
t.he war broke oixt.
The Treaty of Peaca is bafore this House.
IV is -a voluminous document, and necessarily so. There bas been a great deal of
criticisrn about the tiine occupied by the
plenipotentiaries at Versailles in making
this Treaty of Peace, but it seems to me
that it is foolish criticism. We have had
four yaars and a haif of the greatest war
the world bas ever seen, and if people wil
look back into history they will find that the
settlement of other great wars which. were
insignificant when compared with this,
and when the matters to be considered
were noV nearly so far-reacbing, occupied
a very much longer time than this settle-ment bas occupied. But we are an impatient people and we think everything
should ha done in a day or so. I think that
the men who met at Versailles to settie
these great questions were of the very
higbest type and that tbey have done their
work splerididly.

7

that if we came down ta considering tc

We shall have, I understand, a full opportunity of discussing those questions in connection with the resolutions which have

With regard to -the other matters dealt

saine tinte, not only the Government, but
every person in the country who thinks

the strictest economy is necessairy in both

to develop the natural resources of the country as much as possible in order to be able
to bear the heavy burdens that have been
placed upon us by this war. I am sure it is
the desire of the people throughoiit this
country to make the niost earnest efforts in
helping to retrieve the obligitions which

Hon. L. O. DAVID: Will the honourable
leader of the House allow nie to ask him a
question? I would like to know wvhy there
owas nobody this year to iove or second
the Adldress in French. That is contrary to
ain old custom which bas always been followed. Is it because there is nobody on
the other side who is able to speak French,
or is it bocause nobody consented to move
or second the Address in French?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend froin Mille Iles bas always
been facetious in this Hose, and we welcOie lis sense of humdur particularly on
this occasion. I iay remind my bonourable friend that the Address last session was
moved by the no-st recent appointee from

mient froi Quebec having been iade since
that time. If a new miember liad been appointed froin that province, I am sure the
Government wouild have been most pleased
to invite such a miember to move or second
the Address. Had I made such a request to
same of my French Canadian friends to the
left of flic Speaker, they miight not perhaps
have responded with the alacrity which I
desired. Consequently I selected the two
mrst available men on this side of the
House.
Honourable gentlemen, I join with my
honourable friend the leader of the Oppo-

SEPTEMBER 2, 1919
sition (Hon. Mr. Bostock) in congratulating
moet heartily the mover and the seconder
of the Address. My bonourable friend the
mover of the Address has long been known
in the commercial accd industrial life of
Canada as one of the great captains of industry and as one of the most representative men in this Dominion in large affàirs.
Lik(ewise' my honourable friend the seconder
of the Address is a man of very great prominence in public life. He was for many
years a member of the flouse of Gommons
and occupied a distinguished position in
that Chamber. We in thîs Chamber are
fortunate and may congratulate ourselves
that gentlemen of this class are members of
the Senate and bring to ise deliberations the
knowledge, experience, ability, and judgment whch they possess.
During the five sessions of Parliainent
preceding the present year, it was our public and unavoid-able duty to deal withi
questions having to do with the carrying
on of the greatest war in history, and one
iu wbich Canada was engaged to an unprecedented extent. During that period al
the resources of Canada were enlisted in
the responsibilities whicb we had assumed.
In addition to this, our people were at the
higbest tension of nervous strain in the
efforts which they had undertaken, and
in their anxiety concerning the war, which.
in itself was overwhelming. It was, therefore, with great relief that during the session preceding the present one, by reason
of the armistice of November last, we could
look forward to the negotiations for peace
which were then being colisidered, knowing
they would terrninate satisfactorily at a
reasonably early day. Since the last session of Parliament the Peace Conference,
representing the Allied Nations of the war,
succeeded in determining upon conditions
of peace wbich. have necessarily te be ratified by the different nations concernied.
The Treaty of Peace with (iermany has
not only been accepted by Germany, but
bas been ratified by the British Parliament,
and will during the. present session come
hefore us for our ratification. In view of
this Tre«aty being submitted iby the Govermient at an early day, it would be unwise
for me at the present time to enter upon
any discussion of the conditions and details
embod-ied lu ithat Treaty. Suffice it to say
tha.t we can repeat the language 'used in
the S-pee-ch frorn the Throne that "'wi4jhi
reverent tbankfulness we realize that the
world emerges victorious from its long
struggle against the forces o! barbarous
miilitarism and savage aggression."

i

The period that bas passed since the
arnmistice wvas signed, and covered by the
deliberations of the Peace Conference, bas
been marked with an unrest of the masses
throughout the civilized world.
This, in
itself, was the naturaI' outcome of the war,
It was impossible for a convulsion of the
civilized forces of the world to take place
during the five long years o! that war without bringing about a disturbance of the
normal conditions of lufe. The many millions of men that were compelled te leave
the ordinary channels of industrial life,
and to participate in the conflagration by
wbicb tbe wbole of the civilized world was
aflame, naturally brought about the greatest revolution tbat the world bas ever seen)
from wbat had been the normal conditions
of huinan lufe. Tbe concentration of tbose
millions of men in equipping themselves
for the work of destruction and devastation
o4 111e and property, which almost without
interruption was carried on for five long
years, could flot fail te bring about conditions of disturbance and revolution sucb
as marked the period of at least six months
after the termination of the war.
When we consider the millions of lives
lost, the destruction of property, the
devastation of national resources and
wealth, the creation of an almost inconceivable' debt, 'and the diversion of humar)
energies from the ordinary channels of
life, we are more than surprised that this
disturbance of which we speak bas not
assume-d proportions more overwhelmingly
destructive than have been reacbed.
The
aftermath of a great war is usually fraughl
with more serionis tbougbt and anxiet3
than existed during the carrying on of the
war; but in the case of a war like the
world's great war whicb bas ju'st closed, b

wbjch the werld of civilization was set
ablaze and alm-ost destroyed, we may wel]
congratulate ourselves that we see witbin
reach hefore us a settlement of conditions4
by wbich we may soon hope to reach those
normal conditions that mark the reign, of
peace.
We in Canada are ju'st beginning te

SENATE

When Parliament last met we had not
seriously entered upon the deniobilization
and return to Canada of the forces which
we sent to the front. This was a problem

which gave us serious thought, and which
at that time was thought would cover a
period of a year and a half. We have been

successful

in practioally

completing

de-

mobilization in half the period which was
anticipated.. It was thought by the whole
of Canada that upon the return of our large
forces, and particularly at a time when employment conditions were unfavourable,
there would be multitudes of men who had
returned seeking employment unsuccessfully. Not only the Government, but the
public and the press, were more than apprehensive of those conditions assuning
serious proportions. Happily our apprehensions have not been realized. While to-day

demobilization

bas practically been com-

pleted, there bas been a return to civil life

without unemployment being seriously felt
of the several hundred thousand men who
have returned from Europe, together witb
their families and dependents. There bas
been an absorption by the general public
of these great masses, and our normal conditions of life in Canada are rapidly being

resuned, notwithstanding the disturbance
in our civil life brought about by war conditions. The absorption of this great mass
of returned Canadians from Europe is a
natter of profound satisfaction not only to
the Governient but to the people of
Canada. It speaks in the highest terms not
only of the industry and resourcefulness of
those who have returned, but of their conception of citizenship by which they realize
their duty to thenselves and to the State.
It is this saine conception of citizenship that
will prove Canada's greatest asset in again
returning to those channels of peaceful development which marked our history before
the war. The enlistment of all those national
traits by which we were equal to responding to our duties to the Empire will reestablish Canada on a firmer and more

permanent basis in the eyes of civilization
than she otherwise would have assumed.
Canada, therefore, should have no feeling
of pessimisn in facing the responsibilities
of the future. That saine ability by which
she denonstrated to the whole world he
energy and enterprise during the war will
from now on assist ber national progress
and prosperity to a degree not hitherto
anticipated.
It is with great satisfaction that we note
in the Speech from the Throne reference ýto
the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

of Wales to Canada at this notable time.
The demonstrations of loyalty and enthusiasm which have marked his visýit wherever he bas gone throughout Canada manifest in the most unspeakable way the at/
tachment of this Dominion to the great
Empire to which we belong. There is even
more in the demonstrations to which I have
referred than those of loyalty and attachment to the Crown. It is the admiration
which His Royal Highness, by his captivating presence and personality, has evoked
throughout the whole of this Dominion. The
Imperial House to which he belongs, and
of which be is the heir to the Throne, is
peculiarly fortunate, as well as the Empire
itself, in having as their future King one
of the most captivating personalities that
bas ever graced the Throne to which he is
heir. Now the people of Canada have seen
and met His Royal Highness, they will feel
a deeper personal attachment to that Throne
by reason of the personal knowledge which
they have thus secured.
As foreshadowed by the Speech from the
Throne, the Treaty of Peace will cone before us for ratification at an early day. We
then will have an opportunity of discussing
its various features; with these we are all
more or less familiar, but to enter upon a
discussion of thein at this time would be
somewhat premature.
The submission of this Treaty for ratification by Canada may be said to indicate
progress in our constitutional growth. For

a more definite and progressive step as to

Canada than we have heretofore entered

ingly on this subject. I saw the corner
stone of the Parliament buildings laid by
the Prince of Wales in 1860. I do not know
that tiere are many other honourable gentlemen who were present on that occasion.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I was.
Hon. Mîr. DOMVILLE: We remember the
occasion with a great deal of pleasure. You
talk about the Royal family. There was
the great Queen who kept the world at
peace. And Edward VII was called the
peacemaker. I have a med-al thait he presented to me-one of tho.se presented at the
Peace Conference in London; but I do not
hang it out on a string, and I do not advert
tO my circumsta.nces there, whether they
were of any use or whether they were not.
Still I ha-d the honour and pleasure of
being present at the meeting in London.
King Edward unfortunately died. He was
the greatest king I ever saw or heard of.
All his energies were devoted to the maintenance of peace. As to the Hohenzollerns,
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Fowler),
who was at the front, would know more
about them than I do. I do not know very
much about them, except that in royal
families, as in all other families, some are
good and some are bad. We have had the
pleasure of paying large pensions te them
all. The present Royal family of England has cut away from the others,
and there is a line of demarcation;
it is now the House of Windsor.
We are done with the Hohenzollerns,
and the Hapsburgs. It is fortunate that
the Sovereign of England, looking all over
Europe, wherever the relatives of the Royal
family were, should have seen the difficultics of the hour. He had the good of his
country so much at heart that he severed
his connection with them, and he is to-day
a *people's King, and he will be sustained
by the people.
. We speak about reforms. We need reform
in many things. There is a new era coining.
Things that were good enough in the past
are not suitable to-day, and we should all,
on both sides of politics, in both' Houses,
try to unite and develop in a rational way
something that will help the future peace of
the nations, and those who are responsible
for the conduct of affairs should set an example to the world. Let us pay all due
honour to the great men we have, let us
erect monuments to them, decorate their
graves, or do anything else you like; but
let us have common sense. I concur in what
has been said by my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) about reckless extra-

vagance. I do not want to attack the Government at all, but the country will want
to know, and will demand to know, the details of the large expenditure, and whether
it was right or wrong, rational or irrational.
You speak of paying off your debt of two
billions of money. Do you know how mu'ch
that is a head P Where are you going to
get it? Are you going to take it from the
smaller men, like clerks and officials, who
have families? No, they cannot pay it.
They have as much right to mercy at our
hands as the Allies or any other nations.
Mercy I call it, because they cannot bring
up their children, they cannot sustain their
families, unless the high cost of living is
reduced and unless they can receive a fair
day's wage for a fair day's work. I do
not find any fault at .all with employees
who are seeking ilicreases in wages. They
have a right to live and to have their condition considered. We who sit in this red
Chamber, this Chamber of light and darkness, do not rule the country; we are only
the representatives of the people, and they
have a right to look to us as such for the
extricatiqn of Canada from the terrible hole
she is in to-d.ay. She could not help getting into the hole, perhaps, but the administration of the country's expenditure
is a matter which must call for great
criticism.
Now, I have, not said anything offensive.
I have tried 'to praise everybody. I praised
the mover, I praised the seconder, and I
praised the honourable leader of the House.
I always feel a great deal of satisfaction in
hearing him, and I think the world of him.
I shall be glad to help him to bring about
the condition of affairs that should exist,
and he will be independent enough, I am
sure, to take such action as will force our
rulers-for they are our rulers-to put
affairs in better shape than they are to-day.
I regret having said so much; but when
I heard no mention of the relatives of those
who died, I felt it was necessary for me
to point out that somebody in the Senate
renembered them. If this were the proper
time, I would move an amendment to the
Address; but I shall not do so. I would
move an amendment stating that this House
desires to express its regrets and sympathy
to those who have sacrificed/ everythingtheir money, their business, their children,
and, many of them, their bread. However,
they will find that some of us here were
considerate enough, though having no
power in the matter, to think of them, and
to think well of them, and to be sorry that

SENATE

although there were no newly-appointed
French senators, there was aliways a French
member of the Senate to move or second the
Address. I give bim my own case as an
example. In 1905, although I had been the
mover of the Address in 1903, I was asked
to second the Address.
In order to preserve the old custom, which
is a respected one, and which must be considered as constituting a right, I will say a
few words in French, and take the place of
the honourable gentleman on the other side
spoken in French.
have
who should
Although I do not like to repeat what I
said yesterday, I am inclined to think that
the only reason why there was not a French
speaker was that there was nobody on the
other side able to speak French, or, if there
was, that he refused to move or second the
Address. I sec one honourable gentleman
who might perhaps b able to explain that.
I am happy to have heard the honourable
leader of the House, in his eloquent speech
on the Address, say that in all parts of
Canada, in all the provinces of the
Dominion, the Prince of Wales had been
received with the same enthusiasm. That
applies evidently to the province of Quebec
as well as to the other provinces. Yes, that
must certainly apply to that poor old
province of Quebec, whose loyalty has been

so often suspected.
Quebec has proven in this case, as in mauny
other cases, that she is always as ready to
show her respect for British institutions,
for the Crown and for the Royal Family, as
any other part of Canada, with the exception
perhaps of the city of Toronto. Of course,
no part of Canada can be conpared with the
city of Toronto for the expression, of strong
feelings, whether good or bad. There are
many who think that if the Prince of Wales'
life is to be spared, it would not be prudent
to send him again to the city of Toronto.
I will now continue my speech in French.
The province of Quebec
(Translation.)
has never failed in its duty in this respect.
Of this I could give numerous examples. In
1860, when the beloved King Edward VII
visited Canada as the Prince of Wales, the
province of Quebec, with all other parts of
Canada, welcomed him with the greatest
cordiality. The Prince of Wales in 1860 was
a handsome prince-such a prince as is
described in romances and fairy tales-amiable, affable, and charming. The Prince
who is visiting us at present resembles his
grandfather in several respects. Like him,
he is amiable, democratie, a veritable
Prince Charming, winning the affection of
everybody-the old and the young, the big
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

and the little, the rich and the poor, the
women and the young girls-much admired
by the young girls, in whose eyes le resemblcs the ideal prince of whom they have
often dreamed.
I am pleased to recognize that the Prince
of Wales speaks French, and speaks it well,
like all those in England who 'have received
a good education.
The English Government, composed always of emnîinent men, of great diplomats,
has always taken care to be represented in
British colonies, especially in Canada, by
men of sympathy, who would treat the different races and religions and all classes of
society with equal inpartiality and consideration.
That Government bas taken
care, at a time when the eagle of imperialisn most powerfully flaps its wings, to
select one who can most favourably represent its view§. At all events, whatever
enthusiasn there may be for this young
Prince and for the Royal Family, this will
not prevent us fulfilling our duty in the
consideration of this Treaty, and I am convinced that there will be in this Senate'
memibers sufficiently independent to consider its problenis fro'm the point of view of
Canada, its destiny, and its best interests.
This Treaty, honourable gentlemen, is one
big with consequences. It raises very serious
and grave probleis which merit the best
attention of our public men and of all who
are interested in the future and the destiny
of Canada. In the first place, what will be
the effect of the ratification of this Treaty?
What woul be the effect of a refusal to
sanction it? Sone contend that the effect
would be nil, because the Treaty bas been
signed by the English authorities, by the
representatives of the different nations, and
by the representatives of 'Canada, and as a
consequence we are bound.
The honourable the Prime Minister bas
said that if the Treaty were not ratified the
Government would be obliged .to resign.
This is net the first time he has made such
a threat when he bas wished to have his
policy adopted by Parliament. But in any
case thîs would not be a great misfortunea nisfortune so great as that which would
result froin the ratification of a Treaty fatal
to our interests.
Now, what effect is this Treaty likely to
have on the destinies of 'Canada? Through
the smroke of the incense -in which the
honourable leader of this Chamber las enveloped the Treaty we can discern some
danger. The sound of the bells which celebrate it mnight well be the tocsin or the
knell of the autenony of Canada. To what

SEPTEMBER 3, 1919
extent, honourable gentlemen, can we bind
our heirs, our successors? To what extent
can we bind future generations, compelling
them to take part in all the wars which
shall be determined upon by the League of
Nationsi To what extent can we restrict
their liberty of action in their commercial
relations with other countries, especially
with our powerful neighbour, the United
States? If Article 10 is rejected by the
Congress of the United Statea, if they refuse
to restrict their liberty of action, what shall
be our situation?
Honourable gentlemen, we slhould not forget that we are in America and not in
Europe, that geographically we are Americans and not Europeans, and that our commercial and industrial interests, are American. We cannot isolate ourselves, from
American activities without putting in danger our prosperity, without imperilling the
destiny of Canada. Our love for British
institutions and our desire to continue to
live under the ægis' of the British Constitution should not prevent us realizing that
our interests are in, great part common with
those of the United States. I believe I
should add that the partisans of imperialism
and even those who, like myself, and like
the great majority of the inhabitants of this
country, wish to continue to remain British
subjects, will do wrong to place ourselves
in a situation in which our interests would
necessarily come in conflict with those of
the United States and even with those of
England.
However, we shall have an opportunity to
d scuss this questionf when the Treaty shall
be officially placed before us, and I hope
that the Senate will discufs the great problems to whieh it gives rise with the impartiality and the independence which they
demand.
The motion for the Address was agreed to.
THE TREATY OF PEACE.
CONSIDÇERATION OF PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS POSTPONED.

On the notices of motion respecting the
Treaty of Peace:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Hbnourable gentlemen, I should like to amend the
first motion-that appears on the Order Paper
by adding after the word " Peace " the
words, " between the Allied and Associated
Powers and Germany." These words were
omitted through inadvertence.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does my honourable
friend purpose going on with the reaolution?
8-2i

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am in
the judgment of the House. What is my
honourable friend's disposition on the
question?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My disposition at
the present moment would be to raise a
point of order as to the method 6f procedure which my honourable friend has
seen fit to adopt.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Perhaps
we can consume the afternoon discussing
that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It seems to me the
procedure suggested is rather an extraordinary one, and one that this House has
not hitherto given its consent to. As I
understand, my honourable friend has resolutions which he proposes to move, and
the Prime Minister has similar resolutions
on the Order Paper in the other House
which he proposes to move. It is for the
Government to decide how they shall conduct the business of Parliament. It is open
to them to proceed with these resolutions
either in this House or in the House of
Commons. After discussion and adoption
by one House, the resolutions would go to
the other House to be discussed. If adopted
by both Houses, they would become an
expression of the opinion of both Houses.
But if we should proceed with this resolution in this House to-day and adopt it, and
should the House of Commons proceed with
the resolution and amend it in some way,
it would not be an expression of the opinion
of both Houses. There would be an expression of opinion by the Senate and there
would be an expression of opinion by the
House of Commons. It seems to me that
this is an absolutely new method of procedure. I do not know whether His Honour
the Speaker's attention has been drawn to
it, but I think that we should very carefully
consider the matter before dealing with the
resolutions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand
that the honourable gentleman has in mind
the adoption by the two branches of Parliament of one and the same resolution
which will represent the view of Parliament? I should surmise that that was the
intention of the Government, as it reads
in part as follows:
Resolved, that it Is expedient that Parliament
do approve the Treaty of Peace.
It is not that the Commons nor that the

Senate approves, but that Parliament do
approve.

It is sin ply the question of pro-

20

SENATE

cedure that I am now discussing. We are
about to discuss one and the same Act of
the two branches of Parliament; and if
it is one and the same Act of the
two branches of Parliament, should it
not be taken up by one branch, discussed
there, and then be brought to the'other
Chamber in the form in which it will leave
the first Chamber, in order that the
second Chanber may have the views' of
the first Chamber before them, and may
amend the resolution or accept it as it is.
If that is not clone and the two Chambers
attempt to pass one and the sane resolution,
and if the resolutions are not identical when
they cross the thresholds of the two Chambers, how long shall we be carrying on the
discussion and exchanging our resolutions
before we agree upon one and the saine text?
I do not know whether ny English correctly
expresses ny thought. This is the first
objection that I see to these resolutions
being presented to the two Chambers concurrently; because, if we start amending
tbese resolutions, as it is our right to do,
and it is the right of the Commons to do,
I do not sec when we shall ever unite and
agree.
Bon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There are
three ways by which Parliament may express itself; one is by statute having the
sanction of the Senate, the Commons and
His Excellency the Governor General representing His Majesty. Parliament may aiso
express itself by a joint address, an address of both Houses; or by an address of
either House. It is laid down that the
Hous-e of Coinions nay express itself by address; likewise the Senate may do so. It
need not be a joint address; it nay be an
expression of the opinion, the sentiment,
or the judgnent of either House. So far as
a resolution is concerned, although I do not
speak with the greatest degree et confidence
on the subject, I ai unaware that there can
be a joint resolution of both Houses. A
resolution, is simtply an expression of opinion of eithier Chamiber as to what Parliament should do; it has not attached to it
the sanction of law that a statute has.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the honourable gentleman allow me a question?
If these resolutions are adopted, is it the
intention to send them over to the Commons ýto have them approved by the
Commons?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. The
object of these resolutions is that a general
expression of Parliament may be had as to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the desirability of ratifying this Treaty for
the purpose of conveying immediately either
to the Peace Conference or to France, who
is desirous of an expression upon this subject, the assurance that in due course the
Treaty will be ratified. It is quite apparent
that the introduction of a Bill will necessarily occupy some time. The Peace Conference tas been extremely anxious that
effect stall be at once given to this Treaty.
There is a provision whereby effect is not
given to the Treaty until three of the Alied
Powers become parties thereto. It is highly
desirable for manifest reasons that this
should te done at the earliest possible date.
Not only are the Allies anxious that this
should te done, but also Germany itself, so
that thait Power may ait once give effect
to the obligations which have been placed
upon it. It has been suggested that the
speedier way of doing this would be for the
Parliament of Canada, by resolution of both
Houses, to signify its agreement with the
Treaty. A resolutio-n of both Houses does
not, in my judgnent, necessarily operate
as ratification of the Treaty; but it would
be a fair earnest of what Parliament will
Io when the Bill comes before it. It is
only for that purpose that this is being
done.
In regard to this Chamber f-llowing the
resolution of the Commons, that is not
absolutely necessary. This Chanber could
give an expression by way of resolution as
to the desirability of ratifying the Treaty
which would be possibly sonewhat different froin the expression of opinion of the
louse of Coimmons. It is for those receiving the resolutions to form a judgment
froin the expression of opinion of both
Houses of Parliament as to the probability
of ratification.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Will the Bill be
founded on the resolutions of both Houses?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I cannot but think
that the course which it is proposed to follow is not the course which should coinmend itself to this honourable House. I
draw the attention of the leader of the
Governîment to this fact, that wheînever
anything is to be done by Parliament it is
done by Bill; and I understand that the
intention is to have a Bill brought up folThe Bill is introlowing the resolutions.

having been passed by that branch, is sent

If we proceed as has

SEPTÈMBER 3, 1919

been suggested, the two Houses may arrive
at different conclusions, and there would
be no means of having a conference. When
the resolution is passed by the Senate, it
cannot be taken up again; when it is passed
by the House of Gommons it cannot be
taken up again. Two resolution6 may clash
in form or in intent; for instance, this
House might vote -agaînst the resolution,
or it inight adopt a resolution which would
be contrary to the Bill which would be introduced in the House of Gommons. Surely
we should avoid a danger of that kînd, a

itself. I do not believe it is fair to Parliament or fair to the country, and for that
reason, if my honourable friend moves, we
on this side of the House will move that
the resolution be not now considered, but
that it be considered this day three weeks,
or this day two weeks. We owe a duty
to the country and to ourselves not to bind
ourselves to the Treaty as a whole without
having had a chance to read it.
I have just been reading a study of the
Treaty by one of the principa1l historians
of France, who said that it had taken the
representatives of the Allies six months to
bring about the Treaty, and that it had
taken him six weeks to analyse it and
put in writing his views. We are but asking time to read and digest this important
document.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
not proceed with the motion to-day. I am
willing that this motion sho.uld stand until
to-morrow; but when to-morrow comes I
purpose asking the House to proceed with it.
The Commons will proceed to deal with the
matter to-merrow, and there is no reason
why the Senate should not do so. Furthermore, I say to my honourable friend, and
he must be fully aware of it, because he
is in touch wiith the latest cable news,
that as long ago as the 28th of May last the
purport of this Treaty was cabled 'to Canada
in English and in French, and was circulated; and the reading public, particularly
the public m'en of Canada, shoulýd certainly
Le seized with the fullest knowledge of the
contents of the Treaty. While with all due
deference I accept what my honourable
friend says as to his want of knowledge of
the Treaty, yet every opportunity has been
given to everyhody in Canada to become
acquainted with its purport. I move that
the resolution, stand until to-morrow.
The resolution stands.

inquired

of

the

Government:
(a) If their attention has been drawn to a
statement appearing in the Free Press published in Winnipeg on the 28th August, 1919,
as coming from their Ottawa correspondent,
which expresses a doubt as to whether the
coal leases issued on the Smoky River to Col.
Shillington had been cancelled.
(b) If these leases were cancelled by the
Minister of the Interior in July, 1919.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
(a) The attention of the department had
not previously been called to the article.
(b) The Order in Council dated the lst
of July, 1919, P.C. 1369, authorizes the cancellation of-eight coal mining leases bearing
date the 29th and 30th of August, 1918,
issued in favour of A. E. Austin, W.
Barnett, R. W. McClung, A. H. Weir,
C. W. Coppock, G. E. H. Hauff, J. A.
Leask and W R. Gouin, and assigned on
the 27th of January, 1919, to C. A. Barnard,
K.C., of Montreal, and Adam T. Shillington,
M.D., of Ottawa, and that the rights
described in
these several leases
be
reserved to the Crown.
The eight leases
were accordingly cancelled in the records
of the Department of the Interior and the
solicitor of the lessees was advised accordingly.

COMMITTEE ON SELECTION.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
adoption of the first report of the Committee
of Selection appointed to nominate senators
to serve on the several Standing Committees
for the present session.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the only
changes made in the Committees are as
follows: Hon. Senator Power replaces the
late Senator Taylor of Leeds on the-Joint
Committee on Printing; Hon. Senator Webster replaces the late Senator Taylor of
Leeds on the Committee on Internal Economîy and Contingent Accounts; on the Conmittee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
Hon. Senator Fowler replaces the late

The motion was agreed to.

THE PEACE TREATY WITH GERMANY.
RELFýoUTPON OF APPRO'VAL ÂGRflED TO.

Hon. Sir JAiMES LOUGHEED moved:
Resolved,

That It le expedient that Parlia-

ment do approve the Treaty of Peace between
the Aliied and Aseociated Powere and Germnany (and the Protocol annexed thereto),

whlch -was signed at Versalloe on the twenty,eighth day of June, nineteen hundred and nineteen, a copy of which has been laid before
Pairliament, and which, was signed on behaif
of Bis Mtajesty, acting for Canada, by the
pIenipotentiaries therein namned, and that this
Blouse do approve of the sarne.

HIe -said: Honourable gentlemen, ln rnoving the resolution which stands in my narne
on the Order Paper for Vo-day,' I shahl
assume thatt.he copies of Vhe Treaty which
have been received frarn the Imperial
Government have been distributed, and
have been read by hanourabie gentlemen
ini this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Net read.
ýHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, I
hopeso; I hope honourable gentlemen have
read the Treaty.
Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE2 I rwas unable ta get
my copy until half-past two yesterday.
Hon. Mr. POPE: You had all night.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I know
sa well the',ability of my honourable friend
ta acquaint himself speedily wlth volurninvous documents. I am quite sure that in an
hour or two hie could'fully acquaint hlmselfwith the contents o! the Treaty.
I should ho very sorry Vo weary the House
by going into any very lengthy explanation
o! the Treaty. It will, however, be necessary for me ta make some passing reference ta some of the articles in the Treaty,
partieularly those'in which we feel rather a
greater than a less degree of interest.
1V may not be ont of place for me ta say, ln
beginning my observations, that the Treaty
is probably the most important and most
momentous Treaty' that has ever been
entered into hby any group of nations, IV
deals with matters frauglit rwith greater importance, not only Vo Vhe public of the
present day, but Vo future generations, than
any similar document ever penned; and,
owing, Vo its momentous import, the responsibility upon aur shoulders is all the
greater ta give every consideration Vo the
subject before us.
IV is neodless Vo esay that the Treaty marks
the fortunate ending o! the war. We can
readily recaîl with 'what trepidation we
entered upon the tremendous. struggle which
camrnenced in August, 1914; the ànxiety

with which not only Canada -but the Em
pire ta which we belong, -and in fact nearly
ail civilization, was strained, Iby reason of

It
ginning.
Vo sketèh the developatteinpt
to
ment of that struggle or Vo refer to it at
any great length. Suffice it Vo say that for
four long years there was a neck-and-neck
struggle betiween the Allies and the enemy.
IV looked at one time as if the forces which
the Allies hiac brought to bear upon the
battleflids of Franoe and Flanders rwould
be insufficient to cope suocesefully with Vhe
enemy. When we contemplate what might
have happened had the Allies' been vanquished in the great struggle upon which
they had entered, the human mind is staggered by t.he thought of what might have
followed a victory 'by Germany under the
terrible circumstances which. surrounded
the war. When we think of Vhe conusequences whidh did resuit f rom the war, notwithstanding the splendid victory of the
Allies; when we consider Vhe convulsidii of
noV only the whole of Europe 'but the wh7?de
a! civilization, by reason of the struggle
which was started and maintained by Germany, we faîl Vo grasp the possibilities of
defeat; and yet, honourable gentlemen,
there was a time when we held aur breath
fearful if the Allies 'woul not be successful
in the war in which. .they had engaged.
TRV needlesm Vo say that if Gerrnany. had
is
coniquered in this war autocracy would have
been triuraphsint, fireedom would vaniah,
liberty would be trarnpled in the dust, and
the Allies, including Vhis Canada o! ours,
would be, under the tyrannical heel of the
Prussiein'8 jaick-boot fer probably generatio'ns-4o corne. But fate was kind to us, and,
notwithstanding Vhe apprehiensions with
which we looked upon Vhe war a year agio,

-found within the four corners o! the Treaty
we aire eûnisidering Vo-ilay.
1 arn quite aware, honourable gen Vie-men, *hat there has not been conclusive

iV is a compromise on the opinions and
views of ahl the signatories Vo,the Treaty

SENATE
And yet I venture to say that no one reading this Treaty critically, and proeeeding
to what might be termed a final analysis
of the ju-dgment arrived at, can criticise it
successfully as failing to give effect to the
fundamental principles in view. It may be
said-and I fancy that it was at one time
expected-that if Germany failed in this
war, on the terms of peace which are
usually imposed upon a vanquished nation,
she should be made chargeable with paying
the cost of the wai; but when we consider
the overwhelming character of the struggle,
when we consider that practically the whole
edifice of civilization was shaken like a
bouse of cards and that devastation and
destruction swept over not only Europe
but other continents, we eau readily understand that, with Germany crippled, as we
are glad to ýsay she was when the war terminated, it would have been impossible for
her, notwithstanding her ability and her
possibility of recuperation, to meet the
enormnous cost involved in the carrying on
of the war. I noticed the other day that
it- was stated by the Prime Minister of
Great Britain that the war had cost the
nations engaging therein no less than thirty
billions of pounds sterling. For the carrying on of the war Great Britain alone had
to raise by loans and revenues nine
billions and a half pounds sterling. Her
army numbered 7,700,000 men.

There were

no less than 3,000,000 casualties in this
Empire. When we proportionately apply
the cost and the casualties to the other
nations eng'ing in this titanie struggle,
it can Le readily conceived that it would
be impossible for any nation, or practically
any group of nations, to assum the entire
burden of the overwhelming cost and debt
whiclh have been created by that struggle.
The human mind cannot grasp the figures
which are involved; they transcend our
imagination to such an extent that we cannot grapple with them.
However, wben we peruse this Treaty
which is now before us and consider, net
nerely in detail, but in the aggregate, the
terms which have been imposed upon Germany, we cannot fail to come to any o.ther
conclusion than that they are enerous in
the extreme; yet, while they are onerous
in the extreme, they are not dxcessive but
generous. If Germany ha.d conquered in
this struggle, she would have crushed the
life-blood out of her enemies and her heel
would have been on our necks for generations to cone. Yet, we are glad to say,
the Allies are to-day generous and merciful taskmasters, notwithstanding the reasons
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

they have for reprisals against the arch
foe which they combatted.
In reviewing the terms for a moment,
probably ut tie risk of beinîg considerei a
little tediou, r.y
I be permitk'd to ennmerate to ome extent the losses of territory
which Germany bas sn;ained as the outcome of these peace conditions May I preface that by saying that when Germany
entered upon this war ber object was that
of world domination, That policy embraced
territorial aggressions by which she proposed to take froin the other nations of
Europe territory of enormous magnitude,
and by which, if she had succeeded, she
would have become territorially the most
powerful empire in the world.
More attention, I imagine, was given to
the retrocession of Alsace-Lorraine than to
the cession of any other territory which
Germany lost; and it was probably the
arbitrary action of Germany in 1870 in
exacting from France the cession of those
two French provinces which had a great
deal to do with the position they occupy
to-day. Under Article 51, on page 38, we
find:
The territories which were ceded to Germany in accordance with the Preliminaries of
Peace signed at Versailles on February 26,
1871, and the Treaty of Frankfort of May 10,
1871, are restored to French sovereignty as
from the date of the Armistice of November 11,
1918.

Again, on-page 48 of the Treaty, we find
territory

taken

from

the

German

empire

by which the Czeceo-Slovak State becomes
one o.f the important national entities
Europe. Article 83 reads as follows:

of

Germany renounces in favour of the CzechoSlovak State all rights and title over the portion of Silesian territory defined as follows.

I need net read the boundaries thereof.
Coming down to article 87, we find that
Germany has had to renounce the territory

of Poland, which 150 years ago she acquired
through tyrannical action by which the
people of Poland were crushed, and from
which time the people of Poland were under
the beel of the Prussian.
Germany, in conformity with the action aiready taken by the Allie:1 and Asso:iated Powers,
recognizes the complete independence of Poland,
and renounces in ber favour all rights and
title over the territory bounded by the Baitic
Sea, the eastern frontier of Germany as laid
down in Article 27 of Part II of the present
Treaty.

On page 59 of the Treaty we find the renunciation by Germany and the retrocession of the free city of Danzig, a city of no
mean importance.

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
At page 62, in Article 109, we find Germany
cornpelled by the Peace Conference to make
provision for the restoration to Denmark
ol Schleswig,. il its 4people so determine.
One need not review the bistorical circumstances under which Germany through
n-ational fraud secured thîs territory fromn
Deninark.
On page 66 of the Treaty it will be found
that that great fortress wbich was looked
upon as impregnable and inaccessible, and
which played sucb an important part in
-the naval engagements of the North Sea.
viz., Heligol.and, will be diamantled and
its fortifications destroyed.
Article 115 reads as follows:
The fortifications, miiitary establishments, and
harbours of the Islands of Heligoland and Dune,
shall be destroyed under *the supervision
of
the Principal Allied Governments by German
labour and at the expense of Germany within
a ýperiod to be determined by the said Governments.

Then we go on to the section dealing with
the German colonies. Under Article 119Germany renounces in favour of the Principal
Allfed and Associated Powers ail her rights
and tities over bar oversea possessions.

When we consider that those colonial possessions covered no lesa an area than about
1,500,Q00 square miles, we can well appreciate the humiliation suffered by Germany
in thus losing ber colonial empire. Those
colonies consist of Sôutlhwest Africa, Togoland, the Cawmeroons, Est Africa, New
Guinea and certain other islands in the
Pacific ocean.
Coining to China, we find that Germany
bas bad to relinquisb all bier possessions in
tbat country. Under Article 128 we find
Gerinany renouncing in faveur of ChinaAil benefits andi privileges resulting from tha
provisions of the final Protocol signed at
Peking on September 7, 1901, and from al[
annexes, notes andi documents supplementary
thereto.

. Comning to Siam, we find under Article
136 thatAil goods andi property ln Siam belonging
to the German Empire or to any German State.
with the exception or premîses used as diplomatie or consular residences or offices, pasa
Ipso facto and without compensation to the
Siamese Government.

Likewise, as to Morocco, we find tbat
under Article 144Ail property and possessions in the Sherilian
Empire of the German Empire and the Ger.man States pass to the Maghizen without payment.

And we find that property of the German
Empire and States-i

2

shall be deemed to include ail the Property of
the Crown, the Empire or the States, and the.
private property of the former German Emperor and other Royal personages.

Article 153 provides thatAil property and possessions ln EgYPt of thue
German Empire and the German States pas3
to the Egyptian Government without payment.
For this purpose,- the property and possessions of the German Empire aind States shall
be deemed to lnclude ail the property of the
Crown, the Empire or the States, and the
private property of the former German Emnperor and other Royal personages.

Turning to Artjcle 156, we find thatGermany renounces, in favour cf Japan, ail
her rights, titie and privileges-particularly
those concerning the territory of Kiaochow,
railWaya, mines and submarine cables-which
she acquired in virtue of the Treaty concludedl
by her with China on March 6. 1899. -and of
ail other arrangemknts relative to the Provin'ýe
of Shantung.

This reveals to us, honourable gentlemen,
that it would be difficuit to have imposed
tapon *any nation miore oneirous terms, in
the transference o! vast territorial possessions, than the terma embraced with in
the present Treaty impose. Germany has
been stripped, flot only of ail ber outside
possessions, but also of very large areas of
ber own empire in Europe, to an extent even
greater than we had bitherto tbougbt.
Coming to the question of 'tbe disarmament of ber military, naval, and air forces,
miay I point out the humiliation te which.
she bas heen subjected by reason o! the
terms imposed upon ber? Under Arficle
159The German military forces shahl
mobilized and reduced as pres.-ribed
after.

he deherein-

inien again under Article 160:
(1) By a date which must not be later than
March .31, 1920. the German Army must not
comprise more than seven divisions of Infantry
and three divisions of cavalry.
After that date the total number 0f effectives
ln the Army of the States constituting Germany
muai not exceed one hundred thousanfi men,
includiný officers and establishments of depots.

When we remember, bonourable gentlemen, that five years ago the armiy o! Ger-

many was a menace to the wbole of the
civilized world, and wben we- tbink of its
position to-day reduced from about 4,000,000
of effectives to 100,000, who can say that the
terms that have been imposed upon Ger*many are* not onerous? Why, bonourable
gentlemen, previous to tbe war, tbe army
of Germany, as I have said, was the greatest menace to civilization.
Tbe world
tremnbled at its clank o! arms. There- was
net in Europe a nation that bad not to keep

SENATE
up its armaments, both military and naval,
because of tbe standing army main'ained
by Germany. Peace would haie brooded
over practically the whole of Europe had it
not been for this military machine of Germany, which threatened in season and out of
season to crush the nations of civilization.
True, we did not apprehend, to the extent
we should have done, its danger, its possibilities, and the fact that Germany had
fully intended to enter upon a campaign
of world power. When we look back upon
those days and think of the fool's paradise
in which the nations of Europe lived, particularly Great Britain, and to a lesser extent France, without making that preparation which was necessary to meet the vast
preparations which were made in Germany
and which were not in any way concealed,
one is anazed, one is astounded, at the
credulity of those nations in their lack of
preparation
and
equipment
for
the
vast
struggle
the
signs
of
which
then
appeared
upon
the
horizon.
However, it is a matter of profound satisfaction, honourable gentlemen, and one cf
the greatest guarantees of peace that we
can possibly have for the present generation, that we find within the four corners
of this Treaty a provision-which has not
only been imposed by the Peace Conference
but which bas been accepted by Gernmany
herself-that ber army shall be reduced to
100,000 men. More than that, we find under
article 168 that the manufacture of arms,
munitions or any war inaterial shall only
be carried on in factories or works the
location of which shall be communicated
to and approved by the Governmnents of
the Principal Allied and Associated Powers,
and the number of which they retain the
right to restrict. When we think of those
enormous industries, covering hundreds of
thousands of acres in different parts of
Germany, by which armaments were being
made for the deliberate destruction of our
fellow-men, it is a matter, I say, of the
profoundest satisfaction to find that under
article 168 those great industries of destruction have been wiped out by one stroke
of the pen of this Conference whose Treaty
we ara considering to-day.
On page 83, under article 180, we find
a very important condition that bas been
forced upon Germany:
All fortifled works, fortresses and field works
situated in German territory to the west of a
line drawn 50 kilometres to the east of the
Rhine shall be disarmed and dismantled.
No longer will those forts that threatened
destruction and devastation te the people
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

of France lift their heads, menacing the
life of the fair land of France.
.Next, we come to the naval clauses.
Under article 181 we find that
After the expiration of a period of two months

from the coming into force of the present
Treaty the 'German naval forces in commission
must not exceed 6 battleships, 6 light cruisers,
12 destroyers, and 12 torpedo boats.
Under article 183-

The total personnel of the Germany navy,
Including the manning of the fleet, coast defences, signal stations, administration and other
land services, must not exceed 15,00,0, including
officers, and men of ail grades and corps.
Look back a few years, honourable gentlemen, to the time when we perused the
news from Germ'any of the growth of the
German navy and of the policy which was
laid down for the building up of a navy
that would be second to none that sailed
the seas. We can very well recall the apprehension with which we regarded the
dread news which from time to time came
froin Germany as to the upbuilding of that
navy. It
inspired our own efforts to
strengthen our own naval defences.
We
know the apprehen-sion which, I might say,
continually racked Great Britain herself,
notwithstanding the fact that she had an
incomparable
navy,
superior
to
anything that sailed the seas.
There was no subject discussed in the
House of Commons with so much tremor,
so much fear of possibilities, as the building of the German navy. Now, honourable gentlemen, we have the satisfaction of
knowing that that navy has disappeared;
it bas vanished into the oblivion of the
sea's depth, sunk by the Germans themselves, and their navy for years to come
must net exceed a personnel of 15,000 men.
There is another matter which gives us
satisfaction: that is, the provisions in Articles 227 'and 228 regarding the trial of the
Kaiser and those associated with him, who
are responsible for the greatest crime of
the ages. It is to be hoped, honourable
gentlemen, that all the provisions of this
Treaty in regard to the trial of the ex-Emperor of Germany and those associated
with hilm rwill 'be prosecuted to tihe fullest
extent, because, if there bas been an archcriminal of the ages, it is the man who teday is ýa' fugitive from his native country,
and over whose head hangs a trial by the
Allies, a trial which I hope will be carried
out, se that he shall not go unpunished for
the colossal crime of which he is the guilty
head.
Another matter provided for in the
Treaty, in Article 380, is that-

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
The Kiel Canal and its approaches shall be
maintained ýfree and oPen te, the vesseis of commerce and of war of ail nations at peace with
Germany on terme of entire equality.

Wben we think of the armaments cf
Germany enclesed in that canal, threatening net only the peace cf Europe, but the
peace of the werld, it is a matter cf profound satisfaction te know that this great
waterway will !hereafter be used for the
purposes cf peace.
On page 122- we find provision made for
the payment by Germany cf the cost cf the
army cf occupation:
There shal -be paid by the (3erman Government the total cost of ail, armies of the Allied
and Àssociated Covernments In occupied German territory from the date of the signature of
the Armistice of November 11, 1918. Including
the keep ef men-

and se on. This involves the payment by

Germany cf a very large sumn cf meney..
New we cerne te the question of repar-

ation, which will'involve a greater effort
on the part cf Germany than is involved
in the -articles regarding the sacrifice which
bas been cemipulserily made by lier, as also
in the surrender of lier military and naval
forces. Let us review ifor a moment what
this means. In the flrst ýplace, under
Article 232, Gerinany is called upon te
make good tbe restoratien of Belgium:
In accordance with Germany's pledges, airaady given. as to complata resteration fer
Belgium, -Germany undertakes, In addition te

tives of sailors who lest their lives in the
mercantile sbipping of the Empire, damage
for the loss of ail cargoes; and in the satisfaction of other categories of damage full
reparation or compensation must be made,
ail of which will represent many hundreds
of millions of dollars.
On page 109 we find provision made for
the issue, part forthwith and part later, of
bonds representing not less than one hundred billions of marks. The provisions will
be feund under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of
Article 12 in Anniex IL. Those gold-bearer
bonds will be handed over te the tribunal
selected by the Allies, and the aimounts will
be applied for the time being in the-resteratien, for instance, of Belgium, and in covering the other losses which will have te be
paid by Germ'any.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Is there any likeliblood of any cf that money ceming te
Canada?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
Canada will be entitled te its share of that
ameunt; Canada's pension debt will be reduoed te a substantial extent. That is te
say, Germany makes indemnity te the Allies
for their pension liabilities on the samne
basis as the pension scale of France. The
Peace Commigsion accepted the pension
scale of France as the scale upen which this
indemfnity sheuld be computed.

very much greater interest, than the conditions of peace which have been imposed
upon Germany. It would seem to me that
it would have been illogical and devoid of
human foresight had this Treaty been concluded without some provision being made
along the lines embodied in the Covenant
of the League of Nations. This is the corollary of what bas already been done. It is
inconceivable that civilization should pass
through the struggle in which we have been
engaged for five years past, naving before
it the knowledge, a knowledge so painfully
and so distressingly impressed upon it, without pausing to consider if it were not
possible to prevent a re>etititon of the
crime perpetrated in August, 1914, by which
the whole of civilization was defied and
ti anpled upon through the criminal ambitiens and savagery of one nation that it
inight aggrandize itself at the expense of
civilization.
I need not say that war is as old as the
human race, and. notwvithstanding
the
League of Nations and ail other leagues that
huimainity mïay enter into, there is just a
possibility of human passions so asserting
thenmselves that we may not be able entirely
to prevent war. But the subject of war is
a very much more important problein to-day
than it ever was in the past. To-day, with
the advance of science, and with the development and progress of the human race,
war bas become so formidable a question
that the great Powers have found it absolutely necessary to consider what can be
done to stop the creation of the enormous
liabilities and debts with which Europe and
the rest of the world have been struggling
for tc last generation. The greatest pacifists in the world to-day are the great
Pocwers themselves. Honourable gentlemen
xery well know that, previous to the declaration of war by Germany, no power in the
world put forth so nmany efforts as Great
Pritain to have a specific understanding with
Germany with the view of avoiding war.
The cost of modern armaments is the heaviest burden that the great Powers have to
bear. There is nothing that to-day weighs
so heavily upon the shoulders of Europe as
the cost of modern armaments. There has
been intense rivalry froin one year's end to
another, from one decade to another, betwxeen the contending sections of Europe as
to which shculd possess the greater and more
destructive armaments.
I suppose at no
period was the propaganda of peace in this
regard carried on to the same extent as immediately before the war.
Some of our
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

apostles of peace were regarded as the prophets of old: they predicted that war had
passed away, that the reign of peace had
b-egun, that the nations had turned their
swords into ploughshares and their spears
into pruning hooks. Then, suddenly as a
bolt froi the blue, came the declaration of
war, and we found all Europe plunged into
the greatest war of history, a war in which
the losses aggregated more than those of
the wars of many centuries. Now we have
arrived at the point where the Allies have
dictated their own terms of peace to the
enemy, and the question naturally arises
as to how a future war can be prevented.
When the Peace Conference met in Paris in
January last the first step taken was to
frame the Covenant of the League of
Nations. There was an ociion-an
that
opinion was strongly asserted, and effect
was given to it-tþat it should precede the
terms of peace; that there should be an
agreement arrivecl at, not only among the
Allies but also among neutral nations as
wvell as the belligerent nations in the near
future, as an assurance to civilization that
such a universal catastrophe could not again
occur.
Now, I nust say, from a persual of this
Tîeaty, that 1 think it would have been difficult for the huinan mind to conceive, considering what is involved in the Treaty, a
more effective document to carry out the
purposes which are in view. The fundamental principle of the Covenant of the
League of Nations is to prevent war, and in
what other way that can be accomplished
I aie at a loss to understand. It is only by
an agreement between the nations of the
world that war can be made impossible.
IL can be accomplished only by each nation
assuining equal liability for tc
enforcement of the Treaty into which they have
entered. So far as the present Covenant
is concerned, it is the product of the ablest
ninds in the four continents. It would be
difficult to conceive of a tribunal possessed
oi greater intellectual ability, greater experience, greater knowledge of international
affairs and of international jurisprudence
than that whichx sat in Paris for six months.
A- the outccome of their deliberations we
have before us the Treaty known as Part
I of the document which we are now considering. I am aware that it is being discussed to-day, particularly in the United
States. with a degree of warmtth and with
differing views betxween the contending parties; but, honourable gentlemen, would it
be possible to arrive at a conclusion or to
reach a common agreement among all the.

SEPTEMBER 4,1919i

signatories of this Treaty, with absdlute
satisfaction to every signatory who has becorne a party thereto? Mr. Lloyd George
himself bas expressed some dissatisf action;
some dissatisfa.ction bas been expressed in
France; dissatisfaction is being expressed
in the United States; and we find some dissatiofaction being expressed in Canada, that
everything is not juist as the parties expressing opinions upon the subjeet would
have it if they were framing the Treaty
thernselves.
1 arn anticipating some littie discussion
that may take place on Article 10. 1 fancy
that Article 10 may be termed the stcrm
ccntre of the critics who objeet te the
Treaty. Article 10 reads as follows:
The Members of the League undertake to
respect and vreserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and exiSting political independence of ail Members of th.e League.
In case of any such aggresslon or in case of
any threat or danger o!'. such aggression the
council shall advi-se upon 7the means by which
this obligation shall be fulfllled.

That entails upon every signatory country
the respcnsibility of contributing to the
extent that may be deterrnined by the Council and the Assembly constituting the
League, in the carrying out of whatever
decision may be arrived at by that tribunal.
I need not say that any individual, or any
aagregation of individuals, or any nation
wanting to participate in the ben-efits of
this Treaty, -must necessarily incur ail the
obligations incident thereto. Canada cannot become a party to this League and
enjcy ail the advantages of.the Leagueenjoy the defence and protection which she
will be given by the other nations of the
world-unless she is willing to assume a like
responsibility with them.
I say that if
Canada failed to do so Canada would play
the part of a poltroon; Canada would be
unworthy of the name of a nation; Canada
would not be recognizing for a moment her
possibilities, but would sink for ahl time to
corne inte that humiliation and oblivion
iito which ail nations should descend who
are af raid te aisume the national duty of
defence. It is 'unnecessary for me, or for
any member of Parliament, to vindîcate
the action which must be taken by the
signateries in entering upon this obligation. It is one of the Pery flrst principles
of any people that they should be prepared
for sacrifice in defence of their national
entity, and this obligation bas been, thrown
upon Canada as well as upon the other
nations who are signatories to the Covenant.
What would be the consequence, honourable
gentlemen, if we repudiated this article cf

this League and Covenant?
Civilization
would ostracize us from the family of
nations. What would be the position cf
Canada in regard te the Empire te which
we belongP? Could we say te Great Britain,
"We are. going te remain part and parcel
cf the British Empire, but, hereafter we
expeet you-and net only yeu, -but ahl the
other signatories of this Treaty-to defend
us from the enemies cf the Empire? If we
in a moment of cowardice refrained from
assuming-, or refused te assume, the responsibility cf partîcipating with the other
nations cf the werld in this obligation which
is thrown uçpon us, we would become a byword and a reproach ameng the nations cf
the world.
I need not say anything more upon that
-point, honourable gentlemean. But I have
heard rumbling-s in the distance. It is
said that it. would bèe unwise for Canada
te take upen her shoulders this fundamentai obligation cf nationhood. Canada àcquitted herself well in the late war. Canada's ariny stood shoulder te shoulder with
the finest troops in the world, and achieved

exceiled inr history. Hcwever, honourabie
gentlemen, I venture te predict that this
obligation will sit lightly upon the shoul.

her place with the other signateries te the
Treaty.
.I think it is,unnecessary for mie te review
further'this part cf the Covenant cf the
League of Nations. Suffice, it te say that I
think in the near future psterity will regard it as fraught with greater advantages
te civilization than any covenant entered
into in the hîstpry cf the past.
Prevision is made in the Covenant for
the imprevement cf labeur conditions. It
is *a matter ef satisfaction that the League
bas given the most profound attention te
this very impertant question. When it is
considered that cf the soldiers who fought
with the Allies over fhree-quarters were

appreciate the importance cf the probiem
whiýh came before that tribunal te wcrk

corners cf this Treaty is te be found the
machinery by which the representatives cf
labour from aIl parts of the world may
coma tegaether under the ce-eperative action
cf the different nations, te discusa and work
eut those probleffns in such a wayr as will,
I arn satisfied, elevate labour te a plane
which hitharto it bas net occupied. I do

SENATE
not intend to enter into a consideration of
that subject, because my honourable friend
who sits on my right, the Minister of
Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson), is, I may
say, a specialist on that question, and I
must not entrench upon his ground.
Permit me, in conclusion, to say, honourable gentlemen, that I have every confidence that this Treaty, embracing the
Covenant of the League of Nations and all
the other provisions in it, will be handed
down to posterity as one of the most beneficent and momentous international agreements that the world has known. It will
be regarded also not only as a just but as
a retributive judgment for the crime which
was committed by Gernany in precipitating upon the world the war of 1914, and
it will stand, I hope, for all time to come,
as a warning to those nations that would
plunge mankind into a criminally-designed
war.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, the question which is placed
before us in this resolution is one with
which I would like to deal without any
necessity of referring in the first instance
to the method of procedure that has been
adopted by the Government in bringing it
before the House. Before dealing with the
question of the Treaty I desire to express
the objection to the nethod that has been
case. In the course that
followed in tis
the Government has pursued there is established a precedent in parliamentary procedure which is new to this body. The proposal is here made:
Resolved, That it is expedient that Parliament do approve the Treaty of Peace between
the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany
(and the Protocol annexed thereto), which was
signed at Versailles on the twenty-eighth day
of June, nineteen hundred and nineteen, a copy
of which has been laid before Parliament, and
which was signed on behalf of His Majesty,
acting for Canada, by the plenipotentiaries
therein named, and that this House do approve

of the same.
If we pass this resolution it will be simply
an expression of the opinion of this House,
and not an expression of the opinion of
both Houses of Parliament, or of Parliament itself, as it would be if the ordinary
procedure had been followed, of dealing
with the resolution in the other House first,
and then sending it up to this Chamber. I
think the present procedure is open to
strong objection.
Further, I feel that we have not had sufficient time in which to consider the questions connected with this Treaty. Parliament was called together on Monday of the
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

present week, and, it was not until Tuesday
that we had these documents placed in our
hands for the purpose of consideration.
We are now asked to deal with this important matter when we have had only a
couple of days in which to try to acquaint
ourselves with the tremendous questions inAs my honourable friend has
volved.
pointed out, it took six months for the representatives of the various governments
assembled in Paris to come to a conclusion
and an understanding on the terms of the
Treaty they proposed to ask Germany to
sign; yet we here are called upon to express an opinion with regard to those
terms and conditions when we have had
the documents in our hands but a few
days. There seems to be a desire on the
part of the Government to rush this matter
through the House in a way that I do not
.think is altogether seemly in a matter of
this kind. We have been called together
here for the purpose of dealing with
and as far as I know
this Treaty,
there is very little else with which we
shall have to deal during this session.
It would not have been unreasonable
to give us as much time as was given in
the British Parliament, where a statement
was made by the leader of the Government
on the 3rd of July, and the Bill that was
brought in for the purpose of enabling the
Government to supplement the powers and
carry out the necessary details of the Treaty
was not brought forward for a second reading until the 21st of July. Thus the members of the British Parliament were given
the opportunity of thoroughly .considering
these important questions and of familiarizing themselves with the matter in a way
that I have not personally been able to do.
Another. objection that occurs to me is
that before the members of the other House,
who are the elected representatives of the
people, have had an opportunity to express
any opinion on this important question,
the Senate is placed in a position of having
to deal with this resoluition and express
our opinion on a Treaty which iwill in all
probability impose large responiibilities on
this country and require us to deal with
matters with which we have not previously
dealt. We are thus pl.aced in a somewhat
difficult position, because the members of
this House are usually engaged more in revising legislation than in dealing with such
matters at first hand, especially when such
grave responsibilities are liable to be incurred by the country. For myself, I cannot see why there should be any necessity
to rush thbrough the approval of this Peace

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
Treaty in the way we are being asked to do
at the present time.
If henourable gentlemen will refer te page
212 of the Treaty they will notice that in
the provision for the ratification ef -the
Treaty it says:
A flrst procés-verbal of the deposit of ratifications wIll be drawn up as soon as the Treaty
has been ratlfled by Germnany on the one hand,'
and by three of the principal Allied and Associated Pewers on the other hand. Therefore the Treaty could fhave been
ratified by Vhree of the principal Powers,
and we need not necessarily have been asked
to deal with this matter in a hurry.
I do not purpose following the course pursued by my honourable friend, who bas
gone through the terms ef the whole Treaty
as it affects Germany, because personally
I amrn ot able at the pres-ent time to see
exactly what the effeet of the different termes
can be. I realize that this Treaty has been
drawn up by men who are thoroughly competent 'and who have had a great deal of
experience in dealing with the question of
Vhis kind; and the wording of the Treaty
neede to be very caref.ufly considered te
see exactly what bearing it has. on, the different questions. We muet ail feel great
satisfaction that we have arrived at the time
when we are relieved from the terrible strain
of the war under which we have been suffering for the last five years, and ean coneider this question in the light of the work
th-at has béen done by thé representatives
of the countries who have been engaged for
-the
last six menthe in drawing up this
Treaty.,
The principle of the League of Nations is
one of which I think every one who bas
the interests of the world and the peace of
the world at heart muet -thoroughly approve.
The brijnging together of the uierent counttries to sign -a Treaty engaging themeelves
to maintain the peace of the world is an
enormous step forward in the progress of
humanity. After varlous wars in years gene
by attemptis were made te brin-g about a
condition of things -whereby war would be
abolished and' peace inaintained in the
future; but ne arrangement that hae been
made in the past has been of se momentous
or so valuable a character to the peace ot
the world as the arrangement made in Paris
this year. This Treaty can be made ef real
purpese and effect enly by the peoples of
the countries who are parties te it. At the
present time thie Treaty of the League et
Nations as it stands is an expression ot
opinion of the representatives of the
various nations as te the course of
action that can be best pursued by

31

them for the purpose of maintaining the
peace et -the world; but it will take a long
time for the actual working eut of the ditferent articles ot the Treaty te be thoroughly understood and the details se arranged
that we can say exactly wihat the effect
will be of the different -articles, and the
obligations and responsibilities that will
be thrown upon the varieus countries whe
have sîgned the Treaty. The saine ie true
ef ail treaties that have been made i-n the
past. The only -difference that exista in
this particular case je, I think I am righli
in eaying, that this Treaty le the firet. one
that has ever been discuesed in this way
in the various parliaments et the nations
who hiave drawn it up. The usual procedure heretefore has been that the terme
ef the treaties have been arrived at and
agreed te by the rulers of the nations, the
people ef the different nations having hadvery littie oppertunity et discussing or approving of 'the actual termes of the treaties
before they went inte eftect. As was explained by the Prime Minister of thie country in another place the ether day, we
have been made -a party te the League-ot
Nations by eur representatives at the Peace
Conference; and it wae claimed by the
leader et the Government in t'bis Heuse
that this country was placed in a more important position than ever before in regard
te matters affecting the international relations of the British Empire.
For that
reason we are aeked in thie Parliament te
give our approval te the termes eft this
Treaty, -and in that way te bind ourselves
te observe the consequences ef the different
articles of the League et Nations.
My honeurable frîend bas referred te
Article 10 et the League of Nations, and
the rersonsibilities that it will threw upon
thie country. He bas pointed eut the position that Canada would occupy if ehe were
in any way te decline te accept the responsibility that would be placed upon lier
ehouldere by appreving of thie clause et
the League of Nations;- but hie did net enlighten the House as io what were the respeneibilities and liabilities that we would
be aeeuming under that particular article
ef the Treaty.
If hbourable gentlemen
will look< at the termis et the Treaty they
will find that we, -being a member of the
League et Nations, shail be reepeneible for
those new s'ta-tes that are being breught
inte existence at the present time.
We
shaîl have te de our ehare in maintaining
the independence ef Peland; we shall be
directly concerned in the arrangement between Italy and Jugo-.Slavia, and shahl have
our share et responsibility in cennectien

SENATE
with the various other nations that are
being brought into being at the present
time. This is an entirely new position to the
people and the Government of Canada te be
placed in. Heretofore we have considered
that we had enough to do in looking after
the interests and affairs of our own country, and developing the natural resources
of the country. The responsibilities that
will be thrown upon us in carrying out the
ternis of the Treaty nay be very great. As
one of the Dominions of the British Empire, we nay of course be placed in the
position of doing but a very sniall part and
leaving a great deal of the work in Europe
to be carried out by the representatives of
the British Empire.
I had thought that we would have had
sone explanation from the members of the
Governiiient as to wiat they considered
would be the relations between Canada
and the rest of the British Empire in dealing with questions of this kind. As I understand this Treaty, it will be left to the
Council of the League of Nations to tell
the signatories to the Treaty and the members of the League of Nations exactly what
part they will have to play in imaintaining
the peace of the world if any question
should arise between the nembers of the
League of Nations; but we have rot had any
expianation as to the responsibilities that
we are liable to assume or the difficulties
that we may have to meet and overcome.
For instance, there is a condition of affairs
existing at the present time in the Pacifie;
I refer to the relations which have come
about between China and Japan. China
was asked to sign this Treaty, and, on account of the conditions that were laid down
respecting the province of Shantung, she
preferred to withdraw rather than to sign
the Treaty of the League of Nations. She
felt that she had net been fairly treated,
and that she wiii have to make a separate
Treaty with Geriany if she desires to arrange peace. Canada declared war against
Gerimany, and she will still be at war unless she makes teris of peace. We nigit
be placed in a rather difficult position in
regard to the position of Japan and China.
If any difficulty should arise, Canada, being
one of the Powers signatory to the Treaty,
nearest to Japan and China, iight have
to take action; but at the present moment
I do not think the rneibers of the House
can really say what our posi-ioi would he.
There are a number of other responsibilities which will be thrown upon us in
dealing with this matter. We shall have
to supply our quota of men, our qu )a of
ships, and our quota of money for the purlon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

pose of carrying out our responsibilities under the Treaty. If I understand the Treaty
aright, our responsibilities will be fixed by
the Council of the League of Nations, and
to that extent our freedom of action in
these matters will be controlled by the
terms laid down by the Couneit of the
League. This is a matter which my honourable friend did not express any opinion
upon, and it is one that cannot, as far as
I can see, he understood except by those
who have taken part in the discussions
which have taken place in Paris in the last
few nonths.
Therefore the average man
who reads just the ternis of the Treaty
is not in a position to understand what
these responsibilities mîay iean, and to
what extent we mîay be involved in carrying out the terms of the Treaty.
My honourable friend lias referred to the
international arrangements made with respect to the question of labour. The difficulty (f dealing with .any qucestin of that
kind is that an international tribunal can
deal only with general principles.
The
difference of conditions in the various
countries niakes it very difficu't ir d cd to
lay down any particular arrangement that
can be applied to all the countries that are
interested in this Treaty. The whole question of the relations of labour and capital
is one which has a peculiar bearing in each
countr , and the pr blm of applying the
principles adopted at the international
conference will be exceedingly great, and
will require a treimtendous aiouit of discretion and work before the result which
was evident'y desird c cn be attained.
I do net feel that I ai at the present
time in a position to discuss further the
clauses of this Treaty or the questions
which it raises. We are certainly all in
favour of the step that lias been talken to
establish the League of Nations, and in
any renarks that I have made I would
not wish to be understood as objecting to
this Treaty, wvhich bas for its object the
maintenance of the peace of the world. At
the same time I do thiniE that we were
entitled to much more time for the
consideration of its conditions, so that we
might thoroughly understand what we are
doing when wve approve of the Treaty. In
consequence of the way in which this matter has been pressed upon us and of the
short time we have been given to consider
the terms of the Treaty and make ourselves
acquainted with the questions involved,
and also because of the fact that we are
asked to deal with the matter in a way
which, to put it mildly, I do net consider

sisted when the President of the United
States succeeded in including the League
of Nations Covenant in it? They had no
mandate to that effect. It may be asked:
whait interest had we in i.t? what benefit
will accrue to Canada from it? Sir Robert
Borden ansýwers that we have thereby gained
in political status. Have we? Under whIat
form? Is our autonomy enlarged? Let us
see. Have we obtained co-equal rights with
the British Parliament? Have we become
the direct advisers of the King for Canadian
matters in international affairs? If so,
Sir Robert Borden, or the Canadian
Cabinet, must have directly asked His
Majesty to appoint Messrs. Doherty and
Sifton as Canada's representatives. I doubt
it very much. Those recommendations were
surely made through the Imperial Cabinet
or through the British Prime Minister. We
have solely gained the appearance of nationhood, not the reality. We have assumed

international obligations without obtaining

in return an international recognition. We
shall never be represented in the Council
ot the League, as the four representatives
we could vote for will not be selected from
the British Empire, which will already be

one of the nine. I clearly sec obligations of
great magnitude assumed by Canada under
Article 10 of the Treaty; and, since our

self-appointed Cabinet ministers had obtained the right to appear in the Treaty and
to append their signatures to this historical
document, I will not reproach them for accepting it with the obligations comprised
therein. They doubtless felt that Canada
would not refuse to carry its share of the
burden in assuring peace to the world.
There are duties to humanity which all
nations should jointly accept for the general
good.
But I must surmise that Canada joined

in that contract on the express or implied

understanding that the " principal Allied
and Associated Powers" were the main partners and leaders in the League to be formed.
With that condition, which I deem essential,
I have no objection wvhatever that Canada
assume its share of responsibility in polieing the world and contributing to the maintenance of peace, because that share would
be compatible with its strength, and its
associates would be a very great safeguard
against the recurrence of war. With that

condition we could reduce to a minimum
our military and naval establishment.
Before I vote for this Treaty I want to

make sure that all the principal nations
-and

I point specially to the one which took

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
the lead in creating that League, the United
States-will join in it. Till the Senate of
the United States votes this' Treaty we
need flot hurry. France has flot yet adopted iA.
I wjll vote foir the adjournient, first, bccause nothing presses us to act rapidly, inasmuch 'as our ratification is neither essential for necessary; secondly, because delay
will -allow the Comnrnns and the people Vo
be heard; and, thirdly, because Vhne wiil be
given Vo ail the principal AIIied and Associated IPowers to pronounice upon it.
We are committing this country Vo Viemendous responsibilities; what they will be
the future only can tell. I feel that this
Chamber, which is appointed by the Orown,
-and which, has acted principally as a revising body, would be in a much better
position Vo endorse this Treaty if some time
were given for Vhe Commons to study it,
and for the people Vo grasp its purport.
H1on. Mr. POIRIER: Are we Vo wait for

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, we are to

have a document presented Vo us which
binds Canada Vo certain responsibilities for
!a number of years. It seems Vo me that
we should follow the precedent set by t.he
Iniperial Parliament, and let the Ilouse of
Gommons,-the direct representatives of the
people, pass upon it before it comes Vo us.
Great Britain was a month discussing the
Treaty; France has been discussing it for
a number of days, and is stili discussing
it; the Senate of the United States have
had it before them for review for many
weeks; the President of the United States
bas noV feit it beneath his dignity to start
on a long journey across the country Vo
throw light upon it and explain it Vo the
people; and it seems that the Sénate of
Canada would but do its duty if it adjourned the discussion for a week or two
Vo afford the. people of Canada an opportunity of hearing their representatives in
the Gommons, and of clearly understanding
the various aspects of the question.
In what position would we be if the
United States of America refused Vo join?
The world is in ebullition.

while by its side the American nation would
be enjoying peace and prosperity.
The

there can be no0 League of Nations -as devised in Paris, and Canada would be comnmitting a criminal folly in joining it as a

Let us wait.
Hon. WILLIAi
ROCHFE: Honourable
gentlemen, I think the address of the leader
of the Government is deserving of some
notice from one who has noV a legal mmid,
but who is perhaps on a somewhat similar
plane Vo, the great majority of the people
of the -country. I for one join wilh al
those who express their satisfaction that
ipeace has been declared, and has been com*mitted Vo paper. Peace, so far as we are
concerned, has been signed by the King of
Great Britain. We are bound by bis signature. As far as 4uthentication, power, and
authority are con'cerned, the signature of
the King of England carnies the influences
and resources and wills of ail the people
of the King's dominions, whether they express their opinion favourably or whether
they do noV. The other nations look Vothe
declaration of the King as one of the signatories, and bis signature and bis assent
,as binding upon ail. That is a Treaty of
Peace which, so far as we are concerned,
is secure.
Have we peace? I have listened Vo the
honourable gentleman who preoeded me,
and I ask the question, have we peace?
Where

our
laVe

Russia?
Have we peaoe with Russia? I think I
have read about «an expedition advancing
towaaids the caipital of Russia, which is Tesisted by the people of Russia. We certainly cannot have peace with that great Power,
which was our ally a short ti-me ago, «and
upon which we relied, if we are taking Vhe
capital and combatting the people. Where

SENATE

on paper; but, so far as we are concerned,
and so far as the obligations of Great Britain and the other signatory Powers go, we
are theoretically at peace, and we are bound
by the action of the King of England.
My honourable friend spoke of Canada as
a nation. When did we become a nation?
Have we thrown off our allegiance to Great
Britain? Has Great Britain thrown us off?
The King of England reigns supreme. He
makes treaties; he makes war; he makes
peace. When were we accorded the status
of a nation, and when did the other signatories or the other great Powers agree that
our signature should count as one? I do
not like that language.
I heard about our future aspirations in
regard to the Prince of Wales being our
Sovereign, as to his popular manners and
warlike achievements, and a great number
of other things. Our gracious King is yet a
very young man. I do not think we should
dispose of him in such a short time. I do
not think we should depose the King right
away from being our Sovereign, and become
a nation for the mere purpose of getting a
feather in our cap by signing a Treaty of
Peace with Germany, But, with all that, I
am happy that peace bas been secured. Of
course, the conditions were enerous,
humiliating, crushing to Germany; but Germany bas agreed b them, and we have
nothing to say on ber behalf.
I want also to ask this. Although
the signatory Powers were very particular
to disarm Germany and to reduce her navy,
and to reduce to very moderate proportions
the military force that she was to employ
and keep under pay, to dimin-ish ber territory, to absorb all her colonies, and to take
means to cripple and paralyze that power
in the securing of peace, how many of the
great signatory Powers reduced their armaments? How many have stipulated that
they shall have only 20,000 or 30,000 men?
How much have their fleets been reduced?
What has become of the fleet of Germany
that was handed over to some of the signatory Powers? The Powers have divided up
the colonies of Germany in a very exemplary way, each one trying to get the most
for itself. After the close of the Napoleonic
war there was a comoination of the greatest
sovereigns of Europe. There were Austria,
Prussia, the Emperor of Russia, the King
of France lately re-established on the
throne, who, unde'r the auspices of the Holy
Trinity, formed what was called the Holy
Alliance. It was denounced by England.
It was the origin of the Monroe doctrine in
America. But what did they do? Within
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

six months after the forming of the Holy
Alliance for the pacification of the world
and for securing the rights of kings, 123,000
Frenchmen invaded Spain and upset the
Liberal Government that was established
there. There bas been no disarmament on
the part of the great belligerent Powers of
Europe.
There is along the Mediterranean already, in the Dalmatian and Adriatic district, the beginning of a conflict. Although
Germany has been ejected from Morocco,
and the territory there bas been assigned
to the ruler there-I cannot pronounce his
name-France, Spain, and Italy all have
aspirations along that shore of the Mediterranean. Their possessions and their objects
of conquest are not very far apart, and war
may break out at any time between those
Powers which have the means, and may
cause world-wide war.
It is vain to speak about what might take
place between China and Japan, what
might take place between other Asiatic
nations, what might take place between
Sweden and Russia, or between Spain and
other nations. If the objective is to be
universal peace, there ought to be universal agreement. I do not object to the
nations meeting to formulate terms of mutual arrangement and suppressing these
petty wars that are going on all the time.
I am for peace; I have always been for
peace. I think there was no cause for the
war, and it would not have occurred if
those nations that had taken part in
it had determination and resolution enough
to stay it. But they allowed the situation
to drift; they allowed the war to go on because of the idea that war was inevitable,
that it would come some day, and that it
might as well come now. Although the
nations were professing peace, yet they
were watching one another; and every one
of them was secretly arming.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I ought to
say a word about the obligations we are
assuming. I am not and have no pretension to be an international lawyer, as
everybody knows, but I am firmly of the
opinion that we cannot promise any contribution of money or men while we are
a dependency of Great Britain. We owe
our revenue to the King, we grant money
to the King, the King raises the forces, and
it is an act of independence, a throwing-off
of our obligation to the soverèign, to
promise to grant to the Coneil of the
League of Nations that which we owe as
an obligation to the King of Great Britain.
Who does not remember that last session;

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
when the grant to the King was being
mnade, the honourable leader of the Flouse
put in the Chair a member who declared
peremptorily that the Senate had. no right
to interfere with gifts and grants ot money,
but that the GommLons had the sole prerogative of giving and granting. How can
we promise aid to the League of Nations, gifts and granité which are not
put at aIl in our power, but whieh
the Commons must grant? While we are
a dependent British nation the King can
give whatever hie likes, and hie can cail on
us for our contribution. We have no authority to grant that which we do not own. I
do not know whether it would be an act
of treason to propose such a thing or not,
but if we had lived in the days of good
oid George III, we would be brought up
before the King's Bench, every one of us.
With these observations let us turn our
eyes away fromn Europe and away from the
Far East. We will suppose that weacceide
ka this proposition and that the Council
of the League of Nations can eall upon us
as a nation, as a party to this pact, or whatev er if may be termed-to this integral or
subordinate part of the Treaty-to suppress
an attempt on the part of somes inferior
nation go to war. Suppose that our good
neighbours to the south of us ehould ignore
the hand pointing towards manifest destiny,
and should prefer to have their littie squabbles amongst themselves; suppose that Mexico should resist the benign overtures of
the United States to formn part of tha t great
country; suppose that they should resit
by war an attempt to advance into their territory. Could we be called upon by thé
League of Nations to contribute aur quota
for the suppression of that war? There la
a war undertaken by a small power, and we
sre bound to suppress any effort made by a
power like that, or any smali power, even
fa defend itself--on peace lines, of course.
No nation ever annexes any small territory
unless if is for the benefif of the people.
It neyer has"any idea of aggrandizement,
neyer any idea -of mines, for o! oul wells or
minerai wealth or natural resources or anything -of that kind; it is always for the good
o! the people, in order to prevent turbulence
and distrust and revolutionary government
and ail that sort of thing. Ail these causes
flnd favour amongst the great powers ,in
suppressing anything like a revolufionary
government or any effort to change a government. Tliey a1ways have in mind the great
duty of preserving the peace of the world.
If generally ends by the peace of the woild

3

being disturbed within soine great nation,
and thaf ends ail their aspirations fowards
liberty.
Honourable gentlemen, I concur oord!ally
in what lias been said to the effect that
sufficient time has not been given to us to
consider this very voluminous Treaty. All
that can be gained by the Treaty of Peace
has been secured already. Our adhering to
it or our differing from if cannot affect the
action of the King of England in joining
wîth the other signafories. We rejoice in
peace as much as any one. We take part
with those who celebrate the benign reign
o! peace. I wish I had the language o! my
honourable friend the leader of the Government in this Flouse to express this opinion,
that our sentiments o! rejoicing in the restoration o! peace are just as great as his,
thôugh not so eloquently, expressed.
For the reasons I have adduced, and for
many others which will oýcur to honourable
gentlemen on reading the book which contains the Treaty of Pea-ce, I arn convinced
thaf in the time to corne the obligations*ta
furnish men and money, burdened as we are
af the present fime, is a grave responsibility.
A note o! warning was sounded yesterday.
Everybody feels the great financial burden,
and why should we now embark upon a
new enterprise involving the loss of many
valuable lives and the contribution o! a
great amount of freasure, in our hampered
stâte, when we can get along just as we
are? We mnust try ta pay off the deht, to
relieve ourselves iromn embarrassment,' and
not to enter into world-wide complications
'whieh may land us in destruction and perhaps make né enemies of the great Powei
that we ail revere and under -which we
hope to live.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE. Flonourable gentlemen, I have been able this morning ta give
some attention to the important Treaty
which is before this honourable Flouse,
and, as I shall be unable f0 be present hei-e
to-morrow, I rwould , with the leave o! the
Flouse, takè the liberty ai offering on the
question o! adjourient, which is now before us, the remarks which I propose fa
make, lest the adjourniment may not carry
and 'the dêbate may proceed to-morrow in
my absence.
,I feel, as I amn suire every honourable
meruber of thds Iduse feels, that this is a
question ai such importance that if should
be approached without any political bias or
opinion; and I feel the more so in thaf' I
belong fo a generation for which if has
been a great blessing fo have survived the

38

SENATE

great war. Whenever I saw or heard of an
old man passing away, I pitied him for not
surviving to see the attainment of peace
and the victory of the Allies.
Attention has been drawn in the press
to the fact that, as regards the Treaty itself,
the Dominions are treated as part of the
t
British Empire, and as forming. with · he
rest of the Empire one entity only, and
that, as regards the League of Nations, the
Dominions are treated as separate and
distinct entities from the rest of the Empire. Let us try to see what is the effect of
this difference of status in the two cases.
It will be noticed that in the first page of
the 'Treaty the parties to it are ientionedI.
They -are the United States of America, the
British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan,
these powers lheing doecribed in the Treaty
as the "Principal Allied and Associated
Powers". Then we find the enumeration of
Belgium .and all the other small 'powers
who, with the principal 'powers mentioned
above, constitute the Allied and Associated
Pawers on the one hand, Germany be'ing on
the other. Canada does not appear there:
Canada comes clearly iwithin the British
Empi>re. Then the document, after referring
to the declaration of war in 1914, etc., proceeds:
For this purpose the High Contracting Parties
represented as follows:

The Preisident oif the United States ot
America, by the Honourable Woodrow Wilson and three or four other gentlemen; His
Majesty the King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland and of the
British Dominions beyond the seas, Emperor of India, by the Right Honourable
David Lloyd George, M.P., First Lord of
His Treasury and Prime Minýiýster; ýthe Right
Honourable Andrew Bonar Law, the Right
Honourable Viscount Milner, the Right
Honourable Arthur Jýames Balfour, the
Right Honourable George Nicoll Barnes,
M.P., and for the Dominion of Canada by
,the Honourable Charles Joseph Doherty,
Minister of Justice, and the Honourable
Arthur Lewis Sifton, Minister of Custolms;
foir the Commonwealth of Australia, by
so-and-so; and the same for all the different
Dominions. What is the effect of this? It
was a mere matter of courte.sy to include the
names of the various persons mentioned ais
represen'ting the Dominion of Canada, the
Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of
South Africa, the Dominion of New Zealand,
and India. Each of the Dominions appears
as a part of the British Empire-only as
part of one entity.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Now, if we turn to the end of the document we find the confirmation of what I
have staited in this:
The present Treaty, of which the French and
English texts are both authentic, shall be ratified.
The deposit of ratifications shall be made at
Paris as soon as possible.
A first procés-verbal of the deposit of ratifications will be drawn up as soon as the Treaty
has been ratified by Germany on the one hand,
and by three of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers on the other hand.

You see, honourable gentlemen, that the
Treaty will come into force and be binding
on all parties as soon as it has been ratified
by Germany and by three of the principal
Allied and Associated Powers. I mentioned
a few moments ago who were the principal
Allied Powers: they are the British Empire,
teic United States, France, Italy, and Japan.
As soon as three of them have ratified the
Treaty, Germany having also ratified it, the
Treaty becomes effective. What is the consequence? The consequence is that, whether
we approve of the Treaty or not, it comes
into force and we are bound by it as a party
to it. It is between the British Empire and
the other powers mentioned that the Treaty
is made, and it becomes effective for the
British Empire, including the Dominion of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Supposing that Japan, Italy and France were
the only signatories besides Germany, would
it not then follow that the Treaty came into
force just the saine, even though the British
Empire and the United States had not
signed it?
. Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, surely it would;
and then Canada, being part of the British
Empire, would not be a party to the Treaty;
it would net be binding on Canada. But
I say that the moment the Treaty becomes
binding on England, it becomes equally
binding on Canada as part of the British
Empire. Therefore, I .say that our ratification of the Treaty is of no consequence at
all. Whether we ratify it, or whether we
refuse to ratify it, makes no difference whatever; the Treaty becomes effective in all its
provisions.
I call your attention, honourable gentlemen, te the tact that the League of Nations
is part of the Treaty, and therefore the
moment the Treaty comes into effect, we as
parties te the Treaty, being part of the
British Empire, are bound by all the provisions of the League of Nations.

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does not the fact
that Canada is one of the signaitories to
the Treaty give it a position and a vote in
the League of Nations itself-a position
which is not taken by other parts of the
British Empire who did not sign the
Treaty?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am just going to
proceed with that very question.
, We must not lose sight of the fact that
the Covenants of the League of Nations
are part of the Treaty; that the Dominions,
as regards the Treaty itself, forming with
the rest of the Empire one entity only, the
Treaty does not call for any ratification
on the part of the Dominions. The moment that it is ratified by the Crown, in
the exer&ee of its perogative, it becomes
binding on all portions of' the Empire. I
think I may say without danger of contradiction that, whether we like it or not,
'whether we approve or disapprove of the
Treaty, or of the League of Nations, the
moment the Treaty is ratified by the Crown
it is binding on us, and we become members
of the League, independently of our own
action.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER: What would be Our
position. if England would not ratify the
Treaty -and we did ratify it?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: We would not be
in the League of Nations, because the
Treaty would not come into effect.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: If three nations
signed it?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I answer the question without hesitation. If we ratify and
England does not ratify, we are not in the
League at all, because the British Empire
is not a party to the Treaty, -and the formation of the League of Nations is only a
part of the Trea-ty.
I again ask, what is the effect of the
Dominions being treated as separate entities
from the rest of the Empire? It is, first
of all, that we are made contributories by
the League of Nations for the sanction of
its decisions. If the Dominions were not
treated as separate entities, the Empire as
represented by the British Government
would alone be made contributory and each
ýoi the Dominions would be free in any
given case to decide as to whether or not
it would share in the 'contribution, whether
in men or money, with the British Government; always subject, of course, to the
right of the British Parliament in the exercise of its paramount authority to pass a

law applicable to .the whole -of the Empire,

and making the Dominions contributories
as the United Kingdom, which in our days
wolld be an extreme measure, and not
likely to be ever resorted to.
Another effect of the Dominions being
treated as separate entities is that we become members of the League of Nations
on a footing of equality, so to speak, with
the United Kingdom, and that, as regards
all matters falling within the province of
the League, we are subject only to its decisions, and, strictly speaking, independent
of England.
Let me illustrate my idea. Article 10 of.
the Covenant says:
The mnembers of the League undertake 'to
respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political Independence of all members of the League.
In case of any such aggression or in case of
any threat or danger of such aggression the
Council shal advise upon the ;means by which
this obligation shall be fulfilled.

Then Article 11:
Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the members of the
League or not, is hereby declared a matter of
concern to the whole League, and the League
shall take any action that may be deemed wise
and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.

I need not read the balance of the article.
Article 12 says:
The members of the League agree that if there
should arise between then any dispute likely to
lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter
either to arbitration or to inquiry by the Council,
and they agree in no case to resort to war until
three months after the award by the arbitrators
or the report by the Council.

Article 13 says:
The members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which
they recognize to be suitable for submissiionto
arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily
settled by dlplomacy, they will submit the whole
subject-matter to arbitration.

Article 14 says:
The Council shall formulate and submit to the
members of the League for adoption plans for
the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice.

Article 15 says:
If there should arise between members of
the League any dispute likely to lead to a
rupture, which Is not submitted to arbitration
in accordance with Article 13, the members of
the League agree that they will submit the
matter to the Council.

Then we come to Article 16. I read only
the main portion of all these articles, as
they are not of very great importance to
the point I am making. But Article 16,
taken with Article 10, is of great importance.

40

SENATE'

It says:
Should any member of the League resort to
war in disregard of its covenants under Articles
12, 13 or 15, It shall ipso facto be deemed to
have committed an act of war against all other
members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance
of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals
and the nationals of the covenant-breaking
State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the
nationals of the covenant-breaking State and
the nationals of any other State, whether a
member of the League or not.

Suppose now that England should resort
to war in disregard of any of these covenants, what would be the position of the

Dominions? Would they not be called
upon to decide as to whether they
would side with England, disregarding thereby the covenants, and conmitting the Dominion or Dominions to
a war with all the other members of the
League except England, or whether they
would respect the covenants and thereby
remain in peace with the other members
of the League and in war with England?
That would of course mean the disruption
of the Empire with the support of the
League. This of itself shows the very great
importance of the matter which is now engaging our attention, and it raises the question as to whether the interest of the Empire would not have been better served by
treating the whole Empire as one entity
only. The question is not now a practical
one. The Treaty has been signed, and we
are irremediably committed to its terms,
unless we chose to withdraw from it under
the terms of the last paragraph of Article
1, which says:
Any member of the League may, after two
years' notice of its intention so to do, withdraw
from the League, provided that all its international obligations and all its obligations under
this Covenant shall have been fulfilled at the

time of its withdrawal.

If we did so, we would, I suggest, remain
a member of the League ais part of the
British Empire, but not as a separate entity,
and no complication such as those to which
I have just called attention could arise.
This brings me to invite this honourable
House to consider the advisability of either
abstaining from making any approval or
ratification, which, to my mind, is unneces-

sary, or approving the 'Treaty subject to
further considering withdrawing from it
under the paragraph et Article 1 which I
have cited.
I desire now to consider the question from
another aspect. Whatever may be the imperfections of the League of Nations, is it
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

not, after all, the best means, or at least
the best hope, of avoiding future wars?
Composed as it will b of twenty odd different nations, possibly of thirty or forty,

with amongst them such nations as the
United States, England, France and Italy,
is it not fair to believe that any nation,

whether great or small, and whether a member of the League or not, will hesitate at
doing any act which will make it at war
with all these other nations? In other
words, is the risk involved under its provisions, and especially the obligations resulting from Article 10, reasonably compensated by better guarantees of peace? For
my part, I believe so. I doubt if the world
could again go through another such war
as we have seen. Apart from the losses in
money and property and the disturbance of
economic conditions, I am afraid that, witlh
the progress in science which naturally is
taking place all the time, it would prove far
more destructive of humanity. No efforts,
therefore, should be spared, whatever the
cost, to avoid it.
To sum up these few remarks, the
Dominions are, by virtue of the Treaty,
bound by
its terms
and
members
of the League of Nations. Their .approval or disapproval of the Treaty
will cut no figure; it cannot change or
affect their position in the least. The only
matter left for practical! consideration is
whether or not we should remain members
of the League as a separate entity, or should
withdraw as such and remain a member
only as part of the British Empire, which
we can do at any time.
At six o'clock, the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. LEGRIIS: I wish to inquire of
the honourable leader of the House whether
he can explain why the French version of
the Treaty is dated June 20, while the
English version is dated the 28th?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I fancy
that precedence must have been given to
the French version by some eight .days.
That is the only explanation I can offer. I
do not iknow.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: After the
very cloquent and forceful address that was
made by the bonourable leader of this
House-a speech which covers the ground
completely, and which from every standpoint was unanswerable-it seems scarcely
worth while to make any effort to reply to
the feeble attempts of honourable gentle-

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
men opposite, which rwere *so pitif ni and
pitiable.
The honourable leader of the Opposition
has my deepest sympathy; that is earhest
and sincere. R1e bas my deepest sympathy
because his desire to, follow the dictates of
bis party were so at variance with the dietates of bis heart that necessarily he failed
to me-ke any impression. I arn suie that
the honourabie gentleman rejoices with the
rest of us that there has been concluded
with Germany a Treaty so advantageous to
the Allied Powers and so detrimental to,
Germany'e pre-war desire for the domination of the world, I amn aure that the
honourable gentleman rejoices also that this
League of Nations lias been formed for the
purpose not only of imposing conditions on
the enemy, but aiso seeing that these conditions are carried out.
My honourable friend the leader of the
Opposition found only tw4i points in this
Treaty that were objectionable. One was
that iA was new. Well, it was a new war;
therefore it wonld require a new Treaty. to
conclude it. But <«new " !-that is to Ibe an
objection by the leader of a Liberal
Opposition! Shades of Gladstone and John
Bright! When d.id -a Liberal ever objeet to,

would think, would be reserved for the
hard-sheli Tory, not for the leader of an
advanced Liberal party such as oocupies the
benches..on.the opposite side of this Honse,
with particular accent on the - advanced."
H1e said also that the labour part of
the Treaty was very difficuit, and that
was an objection. It seems .to me that
the saine answer that applies .to its newness
would also apply to the difflculty of that
portion. What kind of statesmanship isit
that objeets to taokling a thing because it
is djiffi.culit? All the more reason -why the
utmost wisdomn and statesmanship should
be brought to bear in order to, work ont a
difficuit problem and to bring about that
happy condition of affairs in which labour
and capital shall each have dts proper
share of thie world' goods.
We had also a speechi fromn the honourable gentleman fromn De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Dandnrand). H1e does not object to,
thie Treaty at ail. I arn glad, -to see that
he does not abject to it. But he aska for

credulity. I would not like to say that thie

I do say that he lias more knowledge than

very carefully over the United States, as
lie intimated to us this afternoon. He lias

be careful to, watch the United States. He

My honourable friend says that the

a ray of hope. It ha a ray of hope to those

Does he forget the election in Novemîber,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Decenber.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: In December, 1917.
I see lie does not forget-he does not forget
the date. I am glad to have the correction;
it shows that this is a matter that lives
in my honourable friend's imîenory. An
overwhelming mandate was then given to
the Governnient to prosecute the war to a
successful termination and to do everything
that was necessary for the conclusion of
the war, and the Treaty of Peace is included in that mandate if anything is included.
My honourable friend says we should
wait for the Commons. Wait for the Conmons? Are we in this Chamber to be deprived of our initiative? Do we have to
wait for the Commons before we can pass
legislation? Since when have we become
subservient to the Commons? I think that
the Commons will not feel aggrieved if we
pass this resolution to-night, as J trust we
shall.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He spoke of disarmament. Only Germany had been disarmed, he said, and there was almost a
tremor in his voice, and I thouglit I could
distinguish a tear in his eye, as though the
tenderness towards Germany of which he
had once been accused was still in his
breast, as thouglh looking upon her he would
say: " Poor Germany ! Dear Germany!
Despite thy faults, I love thee still." Nobody else disarmed? Does he forget that

men by the millions, and that France has
done the same thing? Yet he pleads for poor
Gernany, that nobody has been disarmed
but her. That is about all there was to the
honourable gentleman's remarks.
Now we come to the honourable mnember
for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique). With
his usual candour-shall I say?-he first
disclaimed any political bias in this matter.
Of course, we believe him, as we always
do. We have heard him disclaim political
bias on other occasions, particularly when
in the Railway Committee Canadian Pacific
railway matters were up. To use a French
saying, to hear him disclaim political bias,
it is to laugh.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY:

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He says that this
signing on the part of Canada was a mere
matter of courtesy. A mere matter of courtWell, the race to which he belongs
esy
has always been famons for its courtesy;
therefore I should think he would be the
last to object that Canada had been shown
the courtesy of being pernitted to sign
this famous document, the nost famous in
the history of the world.
He says that of the five great Powers who
were on the Allies' side in this war-Great
Britain, France, the United States, Italy,
and Japan-if any three, with Germany,
sign the Treaty, it becones effective. That
was the honourable gentleman's statement.
In that case, if Italy and Japan and France
hiad signed the Treaty, it became effective;
therefore the signing of Great Britain would
be a mere att of courtesy and unnecessary,
and the signing by the United States would
be the saine, if that statement is correctand I take it to be correct. So, after those
other Powers had signed the Treaty we
would be on exactly the sane plane as
would be the United States and Great
Britain.
He asked the question: "If Great Britain
breaks this League and Covenant that she
bas entered into, what is Canada's position
when she also is a signatory?" Can anyone conceive that Great Britain, rwhose name
is a s.ynonym for all that is honourable and
fair and just and right, would, without
cause, without sufficient cause, without
great cause, break a solemn covenant that
she has entered into? You can ask any
sort of a hypothetical question you like;
but the thing is absurd on the face of it.
What would be the position of Canada if'the
honour of England demanded that she
should withdraw from the League? I am
satisfied that Canada, as a loyal member

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
of the Imnperial farnily of nations, would
stand by Great Britain, whioh is but ber
eider brother in that farnily. We have at
last reached nationhood; we are one in a
family of nations. We are one in a partnership of nations, and Great Britain is, but
the senior partner in that .partnershi.p. That
is the position we occupy in Canada to-day.
It is a proud position, a position that we
have earned by the tremendous sacrifices
we have made; a position we have earned
.by the sbedding of the blood of our sons
wbo have fallen in the war on behalf of
justice and right against despotismn and
tyranny. That is what we have earned, and
that is what we have received. Let us get
away frorn political bias. I see a smile on
the face of my honourable friend frorn. Moncton (H1on. Mr. -MoSweeney>. Whenever any
such sentiment is expressed, a cynical smnile
always distorts the sýcarcely handsorne countenance of the honourable gentleman.
Hon. M4r. DOMVILLE: I srnile also.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I care not. There
are men in this lieuse who have hearts
to wbicb to appeal, and those are the men to
whom I -appeal, and not to the honourable
member frorn Moncton.
'I say let us get together and' let us deal
with this matter wbole-heartedly, so that
we rnay take a step forward towards that

Hon. JAIMES'DOMVIILE: Honourable
gentlemen, it was with pleasure theCt 1 listenefl to the statesmanlike speech of my
honourable friend. frorn Sussex (Han. Mr.
Fowler). On the stump, you know, it would
be a very good speech; the action was good.
Demostbenes was asked: "What is the first
requisite of an orator?" "Action." "What
is the second requisite of an orator?"
"Action." Wbat is the third requisite of an
orator?" "Action"ý When you are before a
crowd tbis action wins for you; but -when
you are before a deliberate body like tbis-I
think both sides are agreed to discuss this
question from an independent standpoint
without any beroica or without any calling
up of ail sorts of animosities--it is what
you say that counts, not the action. 1 do
not want to say very much -about my bonourable friend's sipeech; .I think it is a
good aiter-dinner speech, very good.
As I see it,. it is only open Vo us now as
representatives of the Dominion to criticise
this Treaty; we cannot go any further.
Before going any further 1 should like

is
speech w.as a very eloquent one and covered the ground very well from bis standpoint, and I arn not altogether convineed. I
listened also with a great deal of pleasure to
the speeches of the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
and the bonourable gentleman from De
Salaherry (Hon. Mr. Béique>. But we are to
criticise, and I want Vo)do it in a way tihat
will carry soine 'weigbt outside of the House
rather than bere, wbere some of us may
be carried away by excitement or a feeling
of loyalty. We ail know wbat loyalty is:
it is the last refuge of a scoundrel. So Dr.
Johnson says. It is like the old wornan in
the street having a row. Her daughte'r
said, " Callilber a -before
she calîs you
one; get in first." Josh Billings said:
Thrice rlght Is he who'hath bis quarrel just,
But four times he who gets bis blow in fust.
When we corne down to criticisrn, I for
one doubt the wisdom of our being liable to
be embroiled in European complications.
They_ got into a war; there was no doubt
wbere our duty was, no doubt of what we
had to do. I think Canada did bier duty
witbout any besitation. She sacrified both
of hier children and bier wealth, and she is
to-day still loyal to the Empire, and ehe is
not sorry that she entered into the struggle
and did her part. But, sbould we bave
got into it?
My bonourable friend bas talked about
the statesgmen of England. Is one statesman going to run this country? Is bie going
to run the whole wvorld? Is bie superior to
the leader of this House in bramas or intellect?' Wby should they dictate to us and
tell us what our duty is? We know our
duty. It is our duty to be loyal and to
support the Emipire; it is our duty to bel-p
so far ,as we can the British race; but
tbat does not me-an that we should be a
party to the mistakes i statesmanship
they bave made. Why did we give Heulgoland Vo Germany? They armed it. It
is nîentioned in this Treaty. I have not
had tirne to read the Treaty and do not
intend 'to read it. The job is over and we
have to swallow it, good, bad or indifferent.
Why did we gîve Heligoland to the Germans? They bave destroyed our ships and
injured our trade. Why did we give Heligoland to tbem? If that was far-seeing
statesmansbip, why did we not bave an
arrny? Wby did we have, as the Kaiser
called it, "a contemptible littie army?"
He saw that we bad only pbout 135,000
men, and my lionoura'ble friend knows that

like that through which we have just
passed. With all its s-tatesmanship England had to fall back on what India and
Australia and South Africa and Canada
would do. If they had had any real statesmanship in England they would have had
such an army as Germany had, knowing
that the war was coming. If they saw the
difficulties, -why did they not prepare to
meet them? Why did they close the door
when the horse was gone? I say the statesmanship was bad. I say, with due deference, that Sir Ed-ward Grey, who is claimed
to be the greatest statesman of the age, is
the worst I ever knew. He dictated the
policy of the state, and it w'as his ipse dixit
that laid out the destiny of the Empire.
Lloyd George came to the front as a common-sense man, a workingman, a man
of the people; and he brushed aside as
far as he could all the impediments there
were in the way, and said, "We must stand
up for the Empire," and he did his work
nobly and well. He will stand and shine
in British history and the history of the
world forever.
Now, why should Canada shove her nose
into the matter? As bas been illustrated
to-night, Canada having signed that Treaty,
we are a part and parcel of it by dummy
representation, if we might so call it, and
we have to contribute-we have no option.
Our royalty will call upon us to work in
with the Motherland. We would have done
it anyway, even if we had not been made
part and parcel of that meeting at VerThe fact that England was in
sailles.
trouble would have been enough. Canada
would have been just as loyal and would
do in the future as she has done in the past.
Therefore we may fairly ask, who gave our
statesmen power to go to England with all
their staff and this and that and the other,
incurring vast expenditure of our hardearned monies? It would seem almost that
the affairs of Canada were secondary to
themselves; it would seem that they had
lost their heads, believing that they were
the great "I am" of Canada, that the Canadian people had nothing to say. They had
no mandate to go to England to get into the
swim in some way and have honours bestowed upon them.
If Canada is placed in such a position that,
in future, she bas to join in with nine other
nations in the Council, has to do as she bas
been told, tben the people may say, "Where

German fleet bas been destroyed, their army
bas been reduced to nothing, and Alsace
and Lorraine have been ceded back to
France. But we must not lose sight of the
fact that in the olden days Germany really
owned Alsace and, Lorraine before the
French; that is a matter of history. We
have reduced Germany, but we have not
hanged the Kaiser yet; we have not tried
him. •I
think reference might have been
made to that. That is what we desired to
do with him. If he is a malefactor, should
he not meet his fate like any one else in
that position? Now he seems to be lost
sight of, and there are sinister reasons, we
might assume, why that is so.
The future of Canad.a must depend very
largely on itself and on the assets that we
have got. East and west we have our
granaries and our fisheries, and they have
got to contribute, and largely, to meet the
cost of this w-ar. They are great now, and
they will be greater still when we cau get
rid of the weight that is now upon us.
We must not lose sight of the generosity
of England te us. She was very generous.
What about the Ashburton treaty? What
about the Washington and Oregon business?
What about Alaska? What about the

subservient, when they needed us; how
much have we gained from them, and how
imuch have they gained from us? No doubt
the answer will be that we must put up with
everything-it is the part of a great nation.
So it is; but they have never been very
anxious in our interests. What about the
yellow peril, which I objected to in this
House, and still object to? We would not
allow the East Indian te land in the West.
What about the Chinese? They could not
come there, and yet to-day we are making
treaties with them. Under these treaties
are we going to bar them out, because they
provide cheaper labour and are a people
who, perhaps, may be undesirable? They
are all undesirable in their way.
What will the country think? What will
the country do? The man who bas to pay
the taxes is going to inquire why he bas to
pay them. There is no question about
that. If we are te ne bound by the
ipse dixit of nine men in Europe,
where is the liability going to end?
May it not bring about dissatisfaction
and largely endanger our connection with
the Mother Country? We shall have passed
away ten orfilteen years hence; new men

I should not be here. But I am here to
give my vote with the Government on the
questiop of the passing of the Treaty. There
is absolutely nothing else left for us to do.
I do not like all the details, and I do not

of two things: either accept it or refuse to

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
Treaty: I desire te jodn in the compliment
paid by the honourable member from
Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler), for I enjoyed
and was deeply interested in the very clear
and foreible exposition of the Peace Treatiy
and its provisions which the honourable
leader of the Government laid before us
this afternoon; but I regret that he did
not at the same time deal with the Labour
convention contained in the Treaty. That
convention is in my opinion a very important part of the document. It would appear
that those who convened at Versailles and
discussed and drafted this Treaity regarded
the Labour Convention as the fundamental principle underlying the Treaty, for
it is stated in the preamble of the Labour,
convention:
Whereas the League of Nations has for its
object the establishment of universal peace, and
such a peace can be established only if it is
based upon social justice.

In order that permanent peace, based on
social justice, might be estaiblished, undertakings were entered into by the various
nations, members of the Peace Conference
and the League of Nations, to provide
means whereby social justice, and therefore,
permanent peace, shall be assured.
However, before venturing to discuss
briefly the Labour Convention, I should like
to reply to one or two statements which
have been rnade, and which make it appear
that some honourable gentlemen are in
doubt as to the status of Canada among
the nations subscribing to the Treaty and
as to whether or not the plenipotentiaries
representing Canada and the Government
of this country were duly authorized and
competent to act as signatories to that great
document.
I think, honourable gentlemen, thatall
the people of Canada, regardless of racial
or political affiliations, have approved of
the.sentiments expressed iby public men and
the press, that Canada was year by year
growing in strength and importance and in
the confidence of the mother of Parliaments,
and was from year te year increasing in
prestige and obtaining wider liberties and
extensions of our powers of self-government
from the Mother Country. As far back as
the time of the jubilee of Queen Victoria,
increasing recognition and respect were
shown for this country when its Prime
Minister visited London. Since that time,
on several occasions, the Prime Minister of
this country has been similarly honoured,
and through him the Dominion of Canada.
When the great war came Canada had grown
during fifty years from a child te a stalwart

41

young man, and when the Mother Country
was in need of assistance Canada did not
fail in its duty, but performed a manly
part. When the war was over it became
the duty of the nations involved in it to
sit around a table and work out a Treaty
of Peace. The representatives of Canada
felt that Canada had earned a seat at that
table, and, when some objection was raised
to Canada's being represented at the Peace
Conference, the Prime Minister of England
stated very definitely to the gentlemen who
raised the point: " Canada has lest more
men in the war than your country, and
therefore in my opinion she is entitled to
representation at the peace table." .
It is, I think, true that His Majesty
does net seek formally to ratify the Peace
Treaty on -behalf of the British Empire
until the Parliaments of the various
Dominions have given their approval.
Thus the Canadian Parliament enjoys in,
the mind of His Majesty a prestige equal
te that of the Parliament of Great Britain
itself. J think there is no doubt in the
minds of the advisers of His Imperial
Majesty but that Canada ought to
have the right to join in the making of the
Treaty and in approving it, and, I am proud
te say, in the responsibilities that must
necessarily devolve upon all the members
of the League in maintaining its provisions.

It was stated this afternoon, in'the discussion of the resolution before this House,
that by endorsing or approving of the resolution we should be incurring a serious responsibility. I think, honourable gentlemen, that that is not quite the correct view.
It is one thing to give approval to a resolution and it is another thing to enact a law,
and, until the legislation which will likely
be brought down has been introduced and
dealt with in the House of Commons and.
submitted to the Senate, I think that we are
not definitely committed, but only give our
approval to the basic principles that are
outlined.
The honourable leader of the Government
very ably and in detail, I think, opened the
eyes of ýall of us to the tremendous obligations that were imposed upon Germany
when she agreed to the terms of the Treaty;
and yet, while those obligations will be very
onerous, there is no doubt that they are net
adequate or sufficient to compensate fully
for the crimes that she has committed. In
this connection, those who might suggest
that the. treatment accorded to Germany
had been harsh might ask themselves what
would have been the result had the victory
been on the other side. The obligations that

18

SENATE

she would have imposed upon the Allies
would probably have been much more onerous and severe than those which now rest
upon ber. Mature consideration and calm
judgment on that question must bring us
to the conclusion that justice has characterized the judgiment of the gentlemen who
drew up this Peace Treaty and have required
Germany to accept it.
Prior to the outbreak of the war there
existed a widespread feeling throughout
what might be termed the civilized nations
that the time had arrived or was approaching when universal peace would prevail,
when nations would avoid resort to arms,
and would settle disputes by agreement or
by arbitration, and the workingmen belonging te the various labour organizations,
national and international, had bigh hope.
that the desired goal would be reached,
because history seemed to indicate to them
that wars always brought greater suffering
and sacrifice to the poor man than to the
rich. Nevertheless, ivhen this war broke
upon the world the workingmen of all
nations did their part, and, as time went
on and they realized, more fully than
ever before, the truth that the hardships, the sufferings and the sacrifices
bore more heavily upon them, they
emerged from this war more than ever
determined that steps should be taken, by
themselves if necessary, if by no other
means, to attempt to preserve international
peace by agreement. Therefore, about the
saine time or a little prior to the convening
of the Peace Conference there was held an
International Labour Conference, and certain principles were drafted and submitted
to the Peace Conference with an urgent re-'
quest that they be favourably considered
and adopted. That plan was followed. The
result of their deliberations was submitted
to the Peace Conference; but their recommendations were not adopted, and it appeared as though the ,Labour Convention
was not likely to be included in the Peace
Treaty or adopted 'by the League of Nations.
, It then became for a short time the allabsorbing topic among labour representatives here and in Europe, and received a
great deal of attention from the peace plenipotentiaries themselves. Later, some five
or six amended drafts of the Labour Convention were made by representatives of the
various nations. And finally, in order to
make a last effort to reach some conclusion
that would be reasonably satisfactory to all,
the Prime Minister of England requested
the Prime Minister of Canada to take this
matter in hand and see what could be done;
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

and the result, due to the labour of Canada's representatives and peace plenipotentiaries, was the sections of the Peace Treaty
as shown on page 193 and subsequent pages,
known as the Labour Convention, which,
perhaps more than any one other thing,
assured the success of the League of Nations
and the preservation of the peace of the
world for future years.
In future years history will reveal the
fact that the magna charta of labour, which
is to bring to labour throughout the civilized world greater liberty and freedom, and
a fuller degree of justice than it
ever enjoyed in the past, was brought to
it because of the insistence of the delegates froim Canada at the Peace Conference.
If you turn to the record I think you will
find that the insistence went even to the
length of indicating that if the Labour Conventions were not included in the Treaty,
and the agreement entered into by the
various. nations, it was doubtful if the
League of Nations itself 'could or would
survive.
. It is hoped and confidently expected that
the industrial life of the various nations
of the world will be carried on more
smoothly in the future than in the past.
It is confidently expected that the spirit of
co-operation between employer and employed, with the approval and sanction
and support of Governments, will be more
manifest than ever before, now that machinery bas been provided whereby this spirit
may be intelligently promoted and carried
out.
I shall not presume to weary the House
wi.th an attempt to explain all the various
articles included in the Convention, but
shall merely refer to a few of the principal
ones. It is proposed in Article 387 of the
Convention that a permanent organization
should be established, and it was at that
,time established, for the promotion of the
objects set forth in the preamble. The objeets set forth in the preamble were, first, to
establish a universal peace; and inasmuch
as such a peace could be established only
if based on social justiceAnd whereas conditions of labour exist involv-

ing such injustice, hardship and privation to
large numbers of people as to produce unrest
so great that the peace and harmony of the
world are Imperilled; and an improvement of
those conditions is urgently required: as, for
example, by the regulation of the hours of
work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of
the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adecluate living wage,
the protection of the worker against sickness,
disease and injury arising out of his ensploy-

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
gnent, the protection of children, yeung persona
and women, (provision fer old age and injury,
protection cf the Intereets cf workers when employed In ceuntries other than their own, recegnition of the principle of freedem of association,
the organizatien cf vocational and technical
edUcation. and other measures.
Following on that preamble definite pningiples were laid down which it is the duty
-of the Permanent International Organizatien te undertake te promote and cause te
be adlopted i all the countries which participate in this agreement. Among these pninciples the following seem te the high contracting parties te be cf special and urgent

importance:
Wirst.-The guiding principle aboya enuncîated
that labour should not be regarded merely as a
commodîty or article of Commerce.
Second.-The right of association for ail lawfui purposes by the emplcyed as well as by the
employers.
The adoption of these two principles,
honcurable gentlemen, even in Canada at
this time, will eliminate very many of the
that are from day to day
disputes
arising. The twc things that have heretofore caused -a very large proportion cf the
labour disputes in Canada have been,
first, the failure cf the employer to

recognize the right cf his employees
te deal collectively with the employer, and,
secondly, that the labourer was regarded as
cf value only te the extent cf his earning
power and not because he was a man.
The third principle referred te is.:
The payment te the emplcyed of a wage adequate to maintain a reasonable standard of life
as ehis: la undersitood In their time and country.
Necessarily that standard must vary in
different countries.
The fourth principle is:
The adoption» of -an eight-hours day or a
fcrty-eight heurs week as the standard te be
aimred at -where It has flot already been attained.
Fifth.-The adoption of a weekly rest of at
least twenty-feur heurs, -which, should Include
Svnday wherever practicable.
Sixth.-The abolition cf child labour and the
Imposition cf such limitations on the labeur of
young persona as shall permit the continuation
of their education and assure their preper
physical develoipment.
Seventh-The principle, that men and wemen
should receive equal remuneratien for wcrk of
equal value.
It la prohably within the knowledge cf
all cf us that that has not been the eetablished practice in moat countries.
Eighth.-The standard set by law In each
country with respect te the conditions of labour
should, have due regard te the equitable economic
treatment of aIl workers lawfully resident thereIn.
S-4

That is the particular- clause, I think,
-Which causedý a great deal of the trouble,
and was the rock upon whidh the whole
Labour Convention was almost wrecked,
owing te the difficulty of agreeing upon
what treatment should be accorded, to
foreign citbizens in various countries.
Ninth.-Each state should make provision for
a system of Inspection In which women should
take part, In order to ensure the enforcement of
the laws and regulations for the protection of
the unemnployed.

I suhmit, honourable gentlemen, that if
the thirty-two nations which I think are subscribing to, the Pea-ce Treaty, and some thirteea more whic~h probably will subsri>be to
it, lil. honestiy endorse and adopt and ait~temïpt to carry out these princîples as laièd

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Would the honourable
gentleman shlow me to ask hlm a question?
What is the difference between the resolutions adopted by the Labour Convention
and the resoluti-ons which are contained in
the Treaty of Peace?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The amendments or changes are very few. I think in
clause 8 cf the original proposai provision
was made whereby workmen in any country,
no matter what their nationality or enigin
might be, should hoe treate-d as on a par
wiith 'werkmen who were citizens cf that
country, regardiess of their ability, qualification, st-andard cf living, or anything of
that sort. That was a very contenticus matter. We in. this country, where there are so
rnany working people who are drawn from
probably: thirty or forty diifierent countries,
and speaking as many different languages,
ean see the difficulty if a Ohinainian, if you

çlease, or an Austian-or you might name
a dozen other nationalities-were te receive
aîl the benefits accorded to a 'Canaddan citizen. It would be going a very long way,
further, probably, than the working people
cf this or -any other eountry would approve
of. Therefore it was necessary to effect some
sort cf compromise that, would ensure justice and at the same time, not raise those
difficulties. I think .practicaily the only important change appears ip 'ATticle 8.
It is not my purpose te detain te House
further than te say, in conclusion, 'that of
all cf the famouis anci important documents
which bave been written, anmd whieh have

eras in the world'e history, this document is

REYISUD EDITON

SENATE
undoubtedly destined to take the first place.
Our minds run back through history to the
Magna Charta days, when the people demanded justice and obtained a declaration
which gave them much greater freedom than
they had ever enjoyed prior to that time;
but they never for one moment imagined
the far-reaching effect down thrcugh the
ages of the work which they did that day.
Likewise, when the American Declaration
of Independence was made, I do not t'hink
that those who were parties to it ever
imagined the breadth and depth of the
meaning contained in it, or the far-reaching
effects on future generations that that
Declaration was destined to have. Those
two documents applied only to the people
within a given country. This document applies to probably thirty or more different
countries and to many millions of people.
It is a remarkable fact that the Labour Convention, which I deem to be one of the most
important features of the whole document,
affects the vast majority of all the people
of all the nations whieh are parties to the
agreement. It is impossible for us even
to imagine the far-reaching effect and the
benefits that this Treaty when completed is
destined to bring to future generations in
all countries. I tflerefore have very great
pleasure in subscribing to the recommendation contained in the resolution, and in
unhesitatingly endorsing this document.
Hon. L. O. DAVID: Honourable gentlemen, I had intended saying a few words in
French, but in order that you may be certain I shall not take up inuch time, not
more than five minutes, I will speak in
English, because when I am obliged to speak
English I cannot speak very long.
I desire to say a few words about the
amendment,
which
has been much
neglected, 'asking for a postponement of the
question. But before dealing with that I
shall say a few words upon the main question, regarding the Treaty itself. It must
be apparent to all honourable members that
on both sides we are agreed as to the fundamental 'principles of the Treaty of Peace and
of the Covenant regarding the League of
Nations. There is evidently but one opinion on that point, though we may differ
in certain particulars. I do not consider,
however, that the League of Nations will
end all war and establish eternal peace.
No, I think it is a splendid, a noble dream,
but only a drearn, because when there were
only two men in the world, two brothers,
one killed the other, and since that time
war as been continually waged, It will
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON

continue as long as the world lasts. But
the effect of the League of Nations will be
to reduce the number of wars to a great
extent, and that is sufficient to justify its
establishment, because in this poor world
the most we can do is to reduce the evils
which afflict humanity, and in this as in
all other matters it is the most we can do.
Now let us come to the amendment. When
the Fathers of Confederation created the
new constitution, their object in establishing the Senate was to have a political
body of men who would be iable under all
circumstances to consider with mature
judgment and independence all questions
coming before Parliament, and would
correct and revise what deserved to be corrected and revised. Well, honourable gentlemen, there was never a question which
required more mature, deliberate, and independent judgment than the question now
before us, because we are called upon to
bind not only ourselves, but also future
generations, to take part in all the great
quarrels which may agitate and afflict the
world, and quarrels which will generally
be European; .and, I muet add, without
the consent or approval of our Parliament
or any parliament we shall be bound to
participate. You will admit, honourable
gentlemen, that this is a departure from
the policy which was adopted by all the
great chiefs of the Conservative party and
of the Liberal party.
I said yesterday in my little speech in
French that the effect of the Treaty would
be to -put our country in a very critical
situation, full of elements of friction, of
discontent, of complication, which would
probably if not certainly disturb our relations with England and with the United
States, andi I added that the partisans of
Imperialism and all those who desired to
remain British subjects would do wrong
in placing themselves in such a situation.
We are all proud to live under British
rule, French Canadians perhaps more so
than any others-why? Because we have
perhaps more reason than other nationalities to be happy to live under British
rule. We should be ungrateful if -we did
not recognize that England bas been good
to us, and that all th.ose that came from
England to govern us were kind and
treated us with .all possible generosity and
sympathy. It is because I, like the honourable member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique) and the honourable member for
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), think
that the Treaty will create very serious
complications which will endanger our

SEPTEMBER 4, 1919
relations with England that I am anxious
to know what I ought to do. At any rate,
hornurable gentlemen, I have been confirmed in the views that I expressed yesterday by what has been stated by the honourable ,members for De Lorimier and De
Salaberry. They give 4acts to show that
there was reason to fear the consequences
of the Covenant of the League of Nations.ý
Do you not think, honourable gentlemen,
that that is sufficient to induce you, and to
induce the honourable leader of the House,
to allow a postponement for some days. As
the discussion has been so interesting and
has presented such pi'oblems, it may be
supposed that if it were to continue other
problems and other views worthy of our
consideration might be brought forward.
So I am surprised that the honourable
leader of the House, whose eloquence and
whose character. I always
admire,
and who is always so ready to comply with
our desires-I aan surprised that he is so
obstinate in this instance, in refusing to
grant us the delay which we ask in order
that we may give more consideration to the
great problems raised by the Treaty of
Peace. He may have good reasons, but
he has not given any, for being on this
occasion so obstinate in his refusal. I
hope that honourable gentlemen who are
behind him will induce him to grant us a
few 'days more. A fuller discussion would
be of interest to the public, and views
might be expressed which the Government
iltself might perhaps be pleased to hear.
Well, if the honourable gentleman refuses,
what shall we do? We might vote in favour of accepting the Treaty in principle.
Shall we vote for it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: But, on the other (hand,
as we think that the objections which have
been raised are quite serious, shall we vote
againat the Trealty? Perhaps not. Then,
shall we abstain from voting, so as not
to ehare in the responsibility for the difficulties which I have just mentioned?
Whether we vote or not makes no diffeence,
as has been well established in the course
of the discussion. The honourable leader
of the House is smiling now. That is a
good eign. Does he not think that we need
time in order to decide which of the position(s which I have indicated we ought to
-take? I hope he will grant us what we ask.
The proposed amendinent of Hon. Mr.
Bostock was negatived, and the resolution
was agreed to.

TREATY OF PEACE WITH POLAND.
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL AGREED TO.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved*:
Resolved, That It is expedient that Parliament
do approve of the Treaty of Peace between the
United States of America, the British Empire,
France, Italy and Japan, and Poland, which was
signed at Versailles on the twenty-eighth day
of June, nineteen hundred and nineteen, a copy
of which has been laid before Parliament, and
which was signed on behalf of His (Majesty,
acting for Canada, by the Plenipotentiaries
therein named, and that this House do approve
of the same.

He said: What has been said upon the
preceding motion appaies equally well to
this. Canada bas been made a party to
this Treaty, and hence we desire the expression of the Senate upon it.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I might
point out, what la unfortunately true, that
I for one have not had time to examine
the Treaty. In conjunction with all the
members of this Chamber, I acclaim the
recovered independence of Poland, and feel
that this war will have produced more than
evil and suffering, since it will have liberated Poland and a number of otber nations
which were in subjection.
I have said that I did not read the Treaty,
but I have glanced through it and have
noticed in it no clause to which I would
object. I desire simply to draw the attention of my honourable friends from the
province of Ontario to Article 9, which may
suggest to them reflections which would
help towards the maintenance of peace between the races in this country, by bringing about the application in that good old
province of the same principles as are embodied in the Treaty which our plenipotentiaries have signed. Article 9 says:
Poland will provide In the public educational
system In towns and districts In which a considerable proportion of Polish nationals of other
than Polish speech are residents adequate facilities for ensuring that in the primary schools
the instruction shall be given to the children of
such Pollsh nationals through the medium of
their own language. This provision shal not
prevent the Polish Government from making the
teaching of the Pollsh language obligatory In
the said schools.
In towns and districts where there is a considerable proportion of Polish nationals belonging to racial, religious or linguistie minorities,
these minorities shall be assured an equitable
share In the enjoyment and application of the
sums which nay be provided out of public funds
under the State, municipal or other budget, for
educational, religious or charitable purposes.
The provisions of this Article shal apply co
Polish citizens of German speech only In that
part of Poland which was German territory on
August 1, 1914.

SENATE

The work in Paris of the plenipotentiaries
of the most civilized nations in the world
has broadened the ideas of many people
and bas done much to find a remedy for
the ills of humanity which will be of general
application throughout the world; and I
commend this article to my honourable
friends and the population of Ontario.

THE LATE LT.-COL. BAKER, M.P.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
Resolved, That it is expedient that Parliament
do approve the agreement between the Unit2d
States of America, Belgium, the British Empire
and France, and Germany, with respect to the
military occupation of the Territories of the
Rhine, signed at Versailles on the twenty-eighth
day of June, nineteen hundred and nineteen, a
copy of which bas been laid before Parliament,
and which was signed on behalf of His Majesty,
acting for Canada, by the plenipotentiaries
therein named, and that this House do approve
of the same.

He said: What I have said as to the preceding resolutions applies equally to this
one.
Hon. Mr. BOiSTOCK: As this is only an
agreement arising out of the main Treaty,
I should like to ask my honourable friend
the leader of the Government if we are to
understand that all agreements of this kind
will be presented for approval to the Parliament of Canada? This document, in contradistinction to the others, bears the
words, "Presented ·o Parliament by comt
mand of His Majesty." Of course, that
means presented to the British House.
This document is printed in England; but
I understand that it was not presented for
ratification, but for the information of the
House.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
presenting ithis agreement in pursuance of
a promise that the Treaty would be sub-

mitted to the Parliaments of the various
Overseas Dominions; and, inasmuch as this
agreement is practically part and parcel
of the Treaty, and grows out of the Treaty,
it was thought desirable to follow that
procedure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Although it
does not seem to have been signed by the
representatives of Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, by
the representative of the British Empire;
and the British Empire bas been treated
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

FORM OF MEMORIAL.

Hon. GEORGE G. FOSTER moved:
That the following senators, to wit: the
Honourable Messieurs Bradbury, Casgrain, Pope,
and the Mover, be appointed a iSpecial Committee to confer and act with the Committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons, who
have in charge the building and arrangement
of the new Parliament Building, for the purpose
of considering and reporting upon- the form of
the memorial to the late Lieutenant-Colonel
Baker, M. P., for Brome, to be erected in the
said building.

The motion was agreed to.

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That when the Senate adjourns to-day it do
stand adjourned until Monday, the 22nd instant,
at three o'clock In the afternoon.

Hon. Mr. WATSON: On behalf of some
members who are not here, I would request
that the date be made the 23rd instant instead of the 22nd, because it would be inconvenient to some honourable gentlemen to
leave their homes on Sunday, as they would
have to do in order to be here on Monday.
The motion, amended as suggested, was

agreed to.
EXPORTS OF FOOD PRODUCTS, 1919.

(for Hon. Mr.

That an Order of the Senate do issue for a

wheat, butter, cheese, pork, cattle and food
products generally exported to foreign countries since the 1st of January, 1919.

appointed since 1912, their object, the naines of
their mnembers and their salaries, the total eoit
of each commission and those which. are stili
existing.
He said: I know a similar motion was

made st session, by some honourable
inember of the Houjse; perhaps there was
no return made.
Hon. Sir J<AMES LOUGHEED: Yes, there
were returns made. I have no objection to
the motion going, because the information
will be obtainable froin the Journals, and
upon being tranecribed can be placed upon
the table of the House.
Hon. Mr. .POWER: 'I do not rise for the
purpose of opposing this motion, but 1 tbink
the notice is incomplete, I think there
should be added to it something like this:
"And the resuits which have followed frosu
the appointment of the commissions."
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:'0f course, my
mandate is simply to imake the motion. 1
would draw the attention of the leader of
the Govermuent te the opportunity of saving as much -money as possible to the cwuntry. If the motion made bas been covered
in part by a return made last session àt
would go without saying that the mover of
this7 resolution would be satisfied if it were
simply completed.

Hon. GEORGE W. FhOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, owing te the long adjournment, I would ask the leave of the House

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What will the
Yionourable gentleman gain by moving that
motion now?
Hon. Mr. FOWiLEER: The m-atter will

it can be passed now.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I trust my honourable friend does not mean that the motion
is of no importance, for he ie a member
and a very important member of that committee bimself.
Hon. Mr. DANDUREANU: I sbould have
said rather that the matter is not contentious.
Hon. Mu. FOWLER moved:
That a commlttee of twelve ef this liouse be
appointed te take evidence and report at thîs

session upon the navIgability and fishery resources of Hudeon Bay and .Strait, and of the
character of the ports of eaid Hudson Blay with

Hon. Mr. BOSTOOX: With the leave
of the Rouse I should like te draw eny
honourable friend's attention to an article
.which I noticed in the Manitoba Free Press
of September 3, which reads as follows:
Washington. D.C., Sept. 2.-A treaty between

the United States and Great Eritain for the

SENATE
ment to-day. Secretary Lansing sigped for the
United States and R. C. Lindsey, in charge of
the British embassy and Chief Justice John
Douglas Hazen, of Canada signed for the British government.

This is such an important matter to the
province from which I come that I should
like to ask the leader of the Government
if lie can give us any information as to the
nature of the treaty referred to, and also
whether it is liable to pass the Senate at
Washington without any great discussion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
sorry to say that I have no information
upon the subject whatsoever, and will not
be in a position to give any until we reassemfble.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the Treaty
concerns Canada I suppose it goes without
saying that it will be ratified by our Parliament?,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
have to receive the ratification of the United
States Senate, which is rather a difficult
thing to get, apparently.
The 'Senate adjourned until Tuesday,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I thought we had

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A resolution has been brought down and has been
agreed to, but a Bill likewise will be submitted to Parliament at an early day. Outside of that legislation, I cannot at the
moment say specifically that there will be
other Bills of very great importance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the lionourable gentleman tell us if the Bill to
ratify the Peace Treaty will be introduced

as was done in the case of the resolution?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAND: I understood
that the inquiry would cover the capacity
of the country to meet such a demand.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I bave
no doubt of that. Of course, that will be
a fundamental question in considering what
shal be done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it for
granited that if such -an inquiry is to be
made, consideration would be given, not
only to the question of the ailiity of Canada
to pay a certain fixed sun 'to eadh of the
500,000 soldiers that were enlisted, but also,
either prioir to or concurrently with that
study, to the ways and means whereby this
country migiht fulfil the obligation of finding $200,000,000 a year to meet Our additional yearly charges. It seems to me that
this question should be studied at the sane
time as the iability of the country to pay
larger sums to soldiers, because we are
faced with- the obligation of levying henceforth from the taxpayers of the country a
further sum of $200,000,000 a year, and it
is a reproach, which I intend to maintain
and repeat, that the present Government
has not indicated in any manner where
tat $200,000,000 is to be got. We 'are about
to ask the country to subscribe to a new
loan of $300,000,000 or $400,000,000, partly
to meet the deficit of last year. Surely we
are not going to the people every year to
ask them for loans of $200,000,000 or $300,000,000 or $400,000,000 to meet our regular
annual dharges. So far we bave been going
to the taxipayer and askdng him to lend
hie money te the country. This is an easy
process, but a day will come when we shall
have to look the ratepayer in the face and
ask him to meet the annual interest upon
those loans. lit seems to me that the time
ha co'me-and it bas come before to-dayto examine the situation honestly, and to
find the sources of income in order to meet
our yearly liabilities.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I know that åt is not
quite regular to refer to wh'at takes place
in another House, 'and I arn slightly out of
order, but I just wish to call attention to
the fact that with respect to this question
,the Prime Minister some weeks ago made a
declaration which showed that his view of
the matter was the same as that taken by
the honourable gentleman ftrom De Lonimer
(Hon. Mir. D'andurand). For some reason
or other the Government, and of course the
Prime Minister, appear ito have weakened.
Wlhereas he then spoke in very deoided,
absolute, and emphatic terms with respect
to this matter, he bas now changed bis
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHDED

position. Whereas he declined to consider
the subject of gratuities at that time, the
Governent are now prepared to consider
it; and not only that, but they introduce
a Bill, one of the objects of which apparently is to enable this subject to be discussed. I think it is a pity that the Government do not stay in one place orr the
other.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I can assure my honourable friends that whatever
as done will' be based upon the ability of
the Governiment to do it; and furthermore,
whatever is decided to be done by the Government wr'll of course be submitted to
this Chamber, just as to the House of Gommons, 'and it will be for this Chamber to
pronounce upon it. Parliament is peculiarly an institution wherein representations
can be made, and should be made, upon
any subject of public interest, and rit is
only in this particular relation, I think,
that tis matter is being discussed ait the
present time in the House of Gommons.
The Bill was withdrawn.
RECENT CHANGES IN THE MINISTRY.
On the motion for adjournment:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Could my honourable friend tell us what changes have been
made in the Government of late? We have
heard certain reports and certain rumours.
I understand that the Minister of Customs
bas taken over the Department of Public
Works.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But so far as I
am aware, we have had no official statement frorn the Government in regard to
that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
unaware of any other change having taken
place since we last met than thé assumption
of the portfolio of Public Works by the
former Minister of Customs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Did the honourable gentleman announce that the Minister
of Finance had resigned and been replaced
by somebody else?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That took
place some time ago-certainly some weeks
before we adjourned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt if this
House has been advised as te the resignations of some ministers and their replacement.

57

SEPTEMBER 24-25 1919
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The House
probably knew it.
Hon. Mr. TESSI1ER. What about the
Prime Minister?
Hon. Mr,. DANDURAND: We have heard
of the resignation of the late Minister of
Finance, Sir Thomas White. No cause for
bhis resignation bas been given, and perhaps
no statement as to that is forthcoming. He
lias been a very great success in borrowing
hundreds of millions f roi the country. I
should have though.t thýat he would have
remained to finish his work, and to find
some means of levying the necessary taxation-a process which is perhaps a littie
more difficut-to meet the interest on those
loans which hie had raised.

NATIONAL LABOUR UNIONS 0F
QUEBEC.
INQUIRY.

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE inquired of the
Government:
1. ls the Minister of Labour aware that the
National Unions of Quebec represent a meinbership of between thirty and forty thousand?
2.'Is the rMnister of iLahour aware that this
union is Incorporated, and thereby the association assumes the responslbility for Its contracts?
3. Is the :Minister of Labour ln favour of the
principle of organized labour associations being
lncorporated?

.4. If not. what are his reasons against unions
being lncorporated?
,Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
1. The so-called

National Unions of Que-

bec have 63 locals with a membership of
thirty-one thousand, in the following cen-,
tres: Montreal, Quebec; Three Rivers, Sherbrooke, St. Hyacinthe, Hull, Chicoutimi,
Thetford Mines, Lauzon, Levis, Granby,
and Jonquières.

2. I assume that the question should read
"unions "instead of "'union." The answer
is: No. Two only are registered under the
Trade Union Act of Canada.
3 and 4. These two questions, being matters of opinion and not questions of fact,

able gentlemen who desired to express their
views upon the subi ect were prevented. from
doing so, because it was not proper to debate a question on an inquiry. I therefore
desire to point out that I have no objection
whatever to expressing my opinion or, giving my views in answer to an inquiry, il

the information is asked for in the proper
way.

TREATY OF PEACE BILL.
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bll 3, 'an Act for carrying into effect the Treaty of Peace between
His Majes'ty and certain other powers.
He said: It will be recalled that a resolution was submitted to this Chamber on
September 4 expressive of the approval by
this body of the ratification of the Treaty.
As I took the liberty on that occasion of
speaking at some length on the different
provisions of the Treaty, and it is not necessary for me to repeat what I said at that
time. I therefore do not purpose going into
any lengthy explanation of the Bill now,
but will only say that it will be observed
fromn the firet clause-because the Bill is
practically a one-clause Bill-that it is
desirable that authority should be given
to the Governor in Council to make such
appointments, establish such offices, pass
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

such Orders in Council, and do such things
as appear to him necessary for giving effect
to any of the provisions of the Treaty. If
honourable gentleman have the Treaty
before them, they will find most elaborate
provisions therein, beginning say on page
139, dealing with debts; on page 146, under
section 4, property, rights, and intereste; on

page 152, under section 5, contracts, prescrip-

tions, judgments; on page 160, under section
6, the establishment of a mixed arbitral
tribunal; and other elaborate provisions
dealing with the many questions which
necessarily arise out of the negotiations for
peace.
It is unnecessary to point out to honourable gentlemen that the disturbance which
took place during the world struggle is without parallel, and necessarily there must be
a settlement, not only in the countries of
the Allied and Associated Powers, but in
enemy countries, as to the relations between
not only German nationals and nationals of
enemy countries, but nationals of the Allied
and Associated countries. It will be necessary, for instance, to have an adjudication
and determination of the many questions
that will arise in the different countries of
the parties to the Treaty; it will be necessary to establish a mnixed arbitral tribunal
for the purpose of hearing and determining
the various controversies that may arise;
it will be necessary to establish clearing
houses not only in the countries of the
Allies, but in the countries of the enemies,
for the purpose of dealing with all questions
affecting the business interests of the different nationals of the various Powers
engaged in the war. This can better be
accomplished by Orders in Council, as I
think honourable gentlemen will readily appreciate, than by any fixed statute. We
cannot anticipate at the moment what shape
these organizations may take. They will have
to be adapted from •time to time to the
peculiar circumstances

and

conditions of

the many vexed questions that must necessarily arise; and whatever power i

given

must be elastic and not rigid in its character.
Provision is also made in the Bill that
the authority of Parliament should be
given for the payment of any expense incurred in the carrying out of the Treaty,
and that money for this purpose should
be provided by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURTf: Money to be,
provided, or already provided?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG-HEEO: It will
be from time to time provided, as the
necessity arises. In connection with the.

SEPTEMBER 30, 1919
League of Nations certain expendîtures wili
have to be made. by the different countries
that are parties to the covenant of the
League; and also, I have no doubt, maney
will have to be provided by Parliament for
the carrying out of the different provisions
ta which I have already alluded.
This is the object of the Bill; and, inasmuch as on the fourth of September hast
I dealt with the principle of the Bill, I
shall fot inflict myseif upon the House
further, but shahl move the second reading
of the Bull.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Can niy honourable friend give me the information which,
1 asked for the other day as ta which of the
Aliied Powers have signed the Treaty u-p
ta the present?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The oniy
officiai information I have èeen able ta get
is that Great Britain, eouth Africa, and
New Zealand haye signed. We expert
daily ta hear that Australia bas done so.
but as yet the Government bas not been
officially, notified ta, that effect.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT:

And as ta Italy?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
iinaware of any officiai advice having been
received that Itaiy bas ratified the Treaty.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOOK: Honourable
gentlemen, we are no-W asked ta deai with
a Bill which is for the purpose of supplementing the Treaty which we approved of
by resolution the other day. It is flot my
intention ta go into a discussion of the
Treaty itsehf, because I think it was fully
discussed before, *and I should be on]y
repeating what was said at that time. But,
with the permission of the House, I desire
ta bring to your attention some papers that
have been brought down ta Parliament
since the adjourrnment. and which I thînk
have considerable bearing on the way in
which this matter bas been deait with, and
show the reason why we have been asked
ta deal witfi this question in what, on a
previaus occasion, I termed a rather hurried
and unsatisfactory way, inasmuch as the
honourabie members of this House had the
officiai copy of the Treaty placed in their
hands on the second of September and were
asked ta approve of it, and did approve of
it, on the fourth of September. Considering
that the Treaty contained some 440 articles,
it was rather a large order ta ask honourable gentlemen ta deal with 1the variaus
questions and express an opinion upon
them in that short time

61

I think I drew attention ta ihe fact that
on this siie of the Huse we did not con.
eider that the approvai of the Treaty by
Parliament was absolutely necessary; that
Parliament approved of a Treaty by passing, a we are asked to pass now, a Bill
that provides that the Gavernment shall
do certain things in order ta carry out the
termes of the Treaty; that the practice that
we were asked ta foiiow was entirely new
for Parliament; and that we were estab]ishing -. precedent.

Telegram from the Secretary of State for the
Colonies to the Governor General.
London, July 23rd, 1919.
Following for your Prime Minister. Begins:
I have now consulted with Prime Minister
and the Cabinet with reference to your most
secret telegram of July 9th. Our view is that
early ratification, especially now that Germany
has ratified, is of the highest importance. In
the British constitution there is nothing which
makes it necessary for the King to obtain the
consent of Parliament before ratifying Treaty.
With perfect constitutional propriety the King
can ratify on the advice of his ministers. For
a Treaty of this far-reachlng importance, and
one embracing the whole Empire, the King certainly ought not to act at the instance of all his
constitutional advisers, the Dominion Ministers
as well as that of the United Kingdom.

I think the word

not" is a ,mistake.

But inasmuch as Dominion Ministers participated in peace negotiations, and side by side
with ministers of the United Kingdom sign
preliminaries of treaty, we hold that His
Majesty, if lie now ratified the Treaty for the
whole Empire, would have the same constitutional justification in doing so in respect of
Dominions as he has in respect of the United
Kingdom. The King by a single act would bind
the whole Empire, as it is rIght lie should so,
but that act would represent the considered
judgment of bis constitutional advisers in all
self-governing States of the Empire, because it
would be merely giving effect to an international
pact which they had all agreed to. We realize
at the same time the difficulty in which you art
placed by your pledge to Parliament. Ve are
willing, in order to meet this difficulty, to delay
ratification (which if we alone were concerned
we would desire to effect immediately) as long
as we possibly can In order to give you time

On the other point, we fully agree that the

Colonies ta the Governor Generai.
London, Sept. 19, 1919.
Most satlsfactory ta know that Treaty of
P'eace with Germany bas been appravedl by
Canadian ]Parliament. As mnatters have turned
out and owing ta unforeseen delays on the
Part of other powers, British Empire will probably be ln position ta ratify as soon as any
ather two of the principal A]lied and Associated
ýPawers. ]ParhIaments of the Union of South
Africa andi New Zealand have also approved,
and 1 hope soon ta recelve telegram announcing
that Anstralian Parliament bas approved.
Milner.

That is ail the correspondence on this
file. 1 thought it was of such interest that
probably the House Would nat think I had
taken up too mnch time in reading it. It
shows that we vere right ini the contention
which we made when we were asked to approve af the resolution in the -Brst instance
-the contention that it was not really necessary, inasmuch as Canada hald plenipotentiaries in Paris at the time the
Treaty wa.s signed-it was not really necessary, according ta the custom followed in
England heretofore-that the Treaty should
be formally approved by Parliament. But,
apparently, fron 'this carrespondence, it
has been arranged between. the Government
of the Dominion and the Government of
Great Britain that this method of approving of the Treaty be carried ont, and in
doing so we have established a new precedent in constitutional matters of this
kind.
With regard to -the Bill itself, hononrable
gentlemen who have - read it will notice,
that w-e are asked by legisiation to approve
of the Governor in Council passing Orders
in ýCouncil. We had a tremendons amount
of legisiation by Order in Council during
the var, and we had hoped that when the
war was over this class of legisiation would
be to a large extent done away with; but

SENATE

under this Bill we are asked to give the
Government power to deal by Order in
Council, with different matters arising
under the Treaty. If I understand the Bill
aright, it will give the Government the
power to appoint their representatives in
the Assembly of the League of Nations by
Order in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
not intended.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: J think the iMinister of Justice stated in another place that
it could be done.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
his statement was that it was not the intention in framing the Bill that power
should be exercised in that direction at all.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The point I was
wanting to make was that it can be done.
lon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes;
I suppose it might be done even without
that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It may not be the
intention of the Governnent so to do; but
if I read this clause aright the Government
would have the power to do so if they
wished.
It would also, I think, allow the Government to appoint the representatives that are
provided for in the clauses of the Treaty
that -deal with the labour situation. Under
article 388 it is declared:
The permanent organizations shall consist of:
(1) A General Conference of representatives
of the members, and
(2) An International !Labour Office controlled
by the governing body described in Article 393.

Then, in article 389 it is declared:
The meetings of the General Conference of
representatives of the members shall be held

from time to time as occasion may require, and

at least once in every year. It shall be comTposed of four representatives of each of the
members, of whom two shall be Government
delegates and the two others shall be delegates
representing respectively the employers and the
workpeople of each of the members.

I think that honourable gentlemen looking at that will see that those members can
also be appointed by Order in Council
unde' this Bill as it is at present drafted.
Then I would draw attention to this, that
in the first subsection of clause 1 there is
no provision that those Orders in Council
shall be laid before Parliament. The second
subsection reads:
Any Order in Council made under this Act
may provide for the imposition by summary
protest or otherwise of penalties in respect of
breaches of the provisions thereof, and shall be
Hon. Mr. 'BOSTOCK.9

laid before Parlia>ment as soon as may be after
it is made, and shall have effect as if enacted
in this Act, but may be varied or revoked by
a subsequent Order in Council.

These Orders in Council, apparently, it is
intended shall be laid before Parliament
as soon as they are made; but the Orders
in Council that are provided for in the first
subsection of that clause would apparently
not necessarily be laid before Parliament,
under the Act. I think it would be very desirable that it should at any rate be understood
that in both cases the Orders in Council
would be laid before Parliament as soon as
possible after they are passed, so that Parliament may at least be seized of what bas
been done by the Government in regard to
these matters.
We can quite understand that, in order
to carry out the terms of the Treaty, it may
be necessary to provide in this way for the
Government making appointments and
doing other things by Order in Council, but
I would express the hope ýthat this power of
enacting legislation by Order in Council
mïay be limited as much as possible.
I do not intend taking up the time of the
louse any longer in dealing with this matter. The other points that arise could probably be better discussed when the Bill is in
the committee stage. But I think it is only
fair to point out that in dealing with this
matter we have been more expeditious than
almost any of the other nations that have
been concerned in the making of the Treaty.
Our neighbours te the south are still discussing the Treaty, and, as far as we on the
outside know, they have not come to any
conclusion as to what they will do about it.
In France itself, where the people are very
much more concerned with the immediate
results of the Treaty than we are ourselves,
they have taken considerable time in discussing it, and, according to accounts that
one sees in the papers, they are likely to
take considerably longer time before they
are in a position to ratify the Treaty. Therefore I think that we have been expeditious,
and that in this matter it night have been
possible for the honourable leader of the
Government in this House to have given us
a little more time before asking us, in the
first instance, to approve of the Treaty by
resolution.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will the honourable
leader of the House be kind enough to say
what interpretation be places upon this subsection 2?:
Any Order in Council made under this Act
may provide for the imposition by summary protest or otherwise of penalties in respect of
breaches of the provisions thereof, and shall

SEPTEMBER 30, 1919
be laid before Pariamnent as soon au may be
after It ts made, and shali have effeet au If
enacted ln this Act, but may be varied or revoked by a subsequent Order ln Oouncil.
Does the latter part of that subsection
mean that any Order in Council may be
varied or revoked witnout Parliament being
consulted?
Hlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. I would
think so.
Hon. WILLIAM' ROCHE: Honourable
gentlemen, I have read the Bill which has
been presented. It is in very simiple
langulage, conveys a vast amount of liability,
and is far-reaching, under apparently explicit and plain limitations, and 1 have
heard the exposition of it given this evening
by the honourable leader of the Government. He very wisely, I think, referred to
the speech whuch he made on presenting the
resolution, and made that his pre-amble.
1 want to know where we are. By tne correspondence which has been read, it is plain
that the Dominion of Canada is, like Mahc.
met's coffin, between heaven and earth. A
gentleman very high in the councils cf
%,anadaannounced that we were a nation,
and that we had the attributes of nationality. Now, we know that we have been a
Dominion of the British Crown, that our
status was secured under the British North
America Act, that we have the Governor
General here representing His Majesty, and
that ail our laws are subject to 'the surveillance of Liie .British Government. Therefore we were a dopendency, and I would liKe
to know by whiat Act, by what public
declaration, or sanction we have been
made a nation.
It is vain to have
declamations about the achievements of
our boys at the front as entitling
us to nationality and niany other considerations whi-ch 'have been advanced.
But what is the plain fact? What are we
here? Are we here as an independent nation
of Canada, or are we here as a dependency
of the British Crown? Il, on the one hand,
we are stili, as it is said, attached by leading strings to Downing Street and rejoice
to be subjects of His Majesty King George,
or if, on the other handl, we are an independent nation. we ought to know it and
we want to, know 'it.

For my part, I am not prepared to argue
-I have neyer thought of it-which would
be the better condition: Whether we should
be a dependency of the Crown, or whether
we should be an independent nation. I
have not thought of that myseif; neither
have I heard it argued out. I know this,
EEVISE

that if this war had flot occurred, and if
Canada had had twenty years of peaceful
progress she would have been a nation,
alongside the British nation, the best ally
of the British nation, with ail hearts in
one-a buttress and defence for the great
British nation to which we belong. I do
not know what has been the reason for
desiring this change. 1 neyer hetard it expressed in any officiai quarter. 1 neyer
knew that our people were disloyai or were
dissatisfied with their relations with the
British Crown or were inveighing against
Downing Street or ag-ainst the ieading
strings or anything of that kind. It is quite
a noveity, and it appears to me that those
who were so anxious on previous occasions
to unfuri the British flag and wave it are
the people who now are iooking for independence and desire to throw aside the
British flag. So it appears to me.
This Council of the League of Nations
is erected for the purpose of suggesting to
the various Powers-and we are to he one
of them, apparentiy--what armaments we
shall provide, how much soldiery, how much
fleet, and how nuch money. It seemns aiways to coine back to that question: how
much mone~ we wiil provide for the general
fund. ThisiBill provides for an elaborate
panorama of officials and negotiations, and
banking institutions and clearing bouses
and amrbassadors, I dare say, and ail the
paraphernalia of nat.ionhood; andl, on the
other hand, ail this is to, be done through
the Governor Generai and through the
B3ritish Government. On which side are
we? This Council of the League of Nations
ought to have authority to, summon certain
Powers to carry out the mandates of the
Council, but it appears not te have that;
it has oniy a recommendatory power. I
take it for granted that the Council is the
central power and should
have
the
authority to constrairi the varions goverfi-

ments and nations that are parties to this
League to summon these forces to execute
the mandate of the Council, which is the
voice of the Powers in generai and in combination. But apparentiy it is a rope of
sand. The Council has power to recommend and suggest, and that is ail., Uniess
there i :a unanirnouis vote in the Assembiy
wherein the Council makes its recommendations, nothing can pass and nothing wili
corne of it.
The various great nations have flot totaliy
disarmed. At ita own option each one
can retain s0 much miiitary and naval
force a-s that Power thinks necessary. CerIMON

66

SENATE

tain large divisions of the armies have been
disbanded, but large forces have been retained by ail the great nations. On the
other hand, several of the nations are stili
at war. Peace bas nlot actuahly been obtained. Apparenty. the whohe of Europe
is convulsed stili, and only the dependencies of the British Government have signed.
Apparenthy other nations have held aloof.
It occurs to, nie that the view is bel.d by a
great many thinking people Ibat the League
o! Nations will neyer mature, because the
objects of the nations are dissimihar, and
each one of the great Powers wisbes te carry
out its own objecta. I think that is the
reason why great Powers hike France, the
United States, and Italy-Ieaving Germany
and Russia out of the question-have not
signed and obligated tbemselves te this
Treaty. Each one wisbes to carry out its
own designs of acgrandisenient. It is true
that a great force is to be provided and
that the nations shaîl contribute soldfers
and navies and whatever is necessary, and
ah ail endeavour te coerce inferior Powers
by refraining from trade arrangements witb
them, and by bringing te bear ail those
forces and coinpulsions outside of actuai
war; but sign the Treaty and objigate themiselves to il thcy have not dlone il.
That is one side of the question. If the
rulings of! this Council have no hinding
force, loolk at the responsibihîty we incur
under this Treaty. We shall be bound te
take part in aIl wars in Europe, in wars the
world over, and will be compelhed te contrîbute to the expense of tho.se wars; while
the Treaty hasts we shall be forced to contribut-e heyond our resources te the maintenance of the views of aggrandisement of
some o! the Powers. It is true that Great
Britain bas signed, and we on this aide o!
tbe House cont.ended filat that was ail that
was necessary. It bas been proved now
that that was correct, and I hope that
Canada in ber relations witb the British
nation wihh remain in the same position
that sbe occupies to-day, and that we wil
bave a Governor General, and will bave
King George on the Tbrone, and will be
goo(l, loyal British subjects.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemeni, I wish t.o caîl attention te one or two
things in this Bilh, and te at least one thing
tbat is not in it that I should hike te sec
in it. The tithe o! tbe Bihl is: "An Act for
Carrying into Effect tbe Treaty of Peace
between His Majesty and certain other
Powers."
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

Technically, at least, Great Britain is at
war witb Germany, Austria, Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria. I ýsupposed that the Bill
would provide for the carrying into effect
of the Peace Treaty already signed with
Gerxnany, and the one signed with AustriaHungary, and would provide for carrying
into effect any treaties that might be
signed betwecn Great Britain and Turkey
examining the Bill
or Bulgaria. Upon

Treaty that was signed at Versailles on the
28th of June, 1919, and the Treaty with
Austria-H-ungary bears a later date. If it
is wise to have a Bill to deal with the
Gerinans. I should think it would be good
legisiation to enlarge the Bill and to provide
that the Governor in Council could deal
Treaty and
with the Austria-Hungarian
with the otber treaties that are yet to be
signcd.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: We do not k-now
wbAiit tlîey are.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: it is possible, perhaps.
that it is not intended that'the Parliament
of Canqida sbould have anything to say
abouit the treaties witb those other Powers.
If that is so, 1 should like to knowv it. and
would suggest that the proper title oif the
Bill would be: "An Act for carrving into
is M-Nalcsty
effect a Peace Treaty between
and the Allied Powers on the one hand and
Germ.any on the other."
Then, section 12 of the Bill reads:

Thls Act may be cited as the Treaty of Peace
Act, 1919.
That is ail right if we are to be tied
down to dealing simply with the Treaty
w'ith Germrany, and that alone. In my
opinion. either the titie of the Bill should
be cbanged, or the words "certain other
Powers" should be changed to "Cermany,"
or else the Bill should be enlargued so as
to enable the Governor in Council to -pass
Orders in Council dealing with ail Powers.
1 think the most important tbing at the
present timne is to let the people of this
country know the war is over. As everyone
knows, this war has turned the Constitution
of Canada t1înside down. By virtue of the
exercise of the defense power, the Parliament of Canada bas heen riding rough,imd over every provincial constitution in
the countrv. It is possible that Parliament
could let the people of Canada know when,
the war is over, and wvhen provincial rights

SENATE
Reverting to the question raised by my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) and my honourable friend from
British Columbia (Hon. Mr. Bostock) as
to the necessi'ty of Canada ratifying the
Peace Treaty, there seems to have been
a clearly-defined opinion in London that
Canada's ratification was absolutely not
needed, because in Lord Milner's cablegram of the 23rd July last I find the following:

obtain the consent of Parliament before ratifying Treaty.
With perfect constitutional propriety the King can ratify on the advice of his
ministers.

We realize at the saine time the difficulty in
which you are placed by your pledge to Parliament. We are willing, in order to meet this
difficulty, to delay ratification (which if we
alone were concerned we would desire to effect
immediately) as long as we possibly can in
order te give you time te lay treaty before your
Parliament.

In other words, that means that the Prime
Minister of Great Britain alone bas the
whole power to advise or not advise the
King to sign. If we have reached the stage
where that power rests upon the shoulders
of the British Cabinet, then should not the
British Parliament claim the fuil control

It strikes me as
odd that Lord Milner in the twentieth century should appropriate to the Cabinet the
right to bind the country to a Peace Treaty
without its submission to Parliament,

Again, in his telegram of August las.t, Lord
Milner said:
I strongly advise your giving notice te summon immediately in view of severe pressure

promise that we shall be able to keep back
ratification till the eleventh of September,

Apparently the British Cabinet was notifying the Canadian Cabinet that if they
intended to call Parliarment to ratify the
Treaty they had better hurry up, otherwise

they could ratify it themselves.
The bonouràble gentleman from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Ross) said that our Constitution had received quite a wrench during the
years of the war; if we took the declarations
of some of the Cabinet ministers, it would
appear that our Constitution had been officially and regularly altered. One must net
forget that the British Constitution is an
unwritten one, and may change according
to precedents set; but ours is a written
Constitution, and, although we may do
things to-day which we were net doing yesterday, no precedent is established as to oux
rigbts and our obligations, but we stand
where we stood before the war, with the
Con.mtition of 1867.
The question is raised by the cablegram
of Lord Milner of July 23, as to the right
of the King to sign the Treaty without the

later years that right was tempered by the
advice of the Cabinet being required.
Lord Milner says:
In the British Constitution there is nothing
which makes it necessary for the King to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

There was a time when the King did not

Milner now claims that upon the advice of

that inean in the ordinary parlance of teday? It means that the King no more can
sign a treaty of his own volition, but that he
can only do so on the advice of his Cabinet.

and it

is

mîost amusing to see how slowly

Parliament is exercisinîg its full power of
directing the affairs of the country, particularly in their imost important feature, the
signing of 'such a Peace Treaty. The Bill
before the British Parliament is siemilar to
tbat which is presented to us to-day. It
involves ratification by implication only,
and does not put the stamp of official
recognition upon it. As a matter of fact,
we know very well that when the Cabinet
agrees to sign a treaty it does so with the
understanding that it bas the confidence
of Parliament and that Parliament sanetions the signature by the Cabinet ministers.
I have thought it well to make these remarks because we are apt to forget that

SECOND

READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED) moved the
second reading of Bill 11, an Act to amend
the Navigable Waters Protection Act.
Ha said: Honourable gentlemen, in 1918
we amended the Navigable Waters Protection Act, but it bas been ascertained in
the application of' the amendment which
was then enacted that no provision was
made for the removal of obstructions in
navigable waters without the authority of

that the Act should be further amended
in the manner indicated, through 'the Bill
now -beifore us. Tt is proposed Vo give Vo
the Government authority to remove any
may impede navigastructures that
tion, and that have been erected without the authority of the Governmnent.
It almoist gees wiVhout saying that iniherently the Government would have tjhat
right; but I arn not going to dis-cuss ithat
subject, as it may involrve very nice questions of law. However, it is desiraible that
there should ha an express declaration by
Parliament giving authority to tfhe Government Vo remnove obstructions of this character.
.Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend indicate what ils tihe concrate
case, or the concrete cases, w~hich have led
to the Govarnment introducing this Bill?
Tt looks to me as il the Bill were for the
purpos-e of providing a remedy for smine
specific case which the previoua amendment h'ad not covered. I should like vary
rnuich to know tihe occasion which has re-ndered this Bill necessary.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGH-EED: I arn unaware of any particular casa. In perusing
Hans-ard of the House of Cbmmons I not4ce
that that question wau suibmitted Vo the
Minister of Public Works, and I think bis
ans'we'r was that hae was unýawara of any
particular inst~ance in which it would be
necassary to apply the proposed amandment, but it was desirabla to have the ganaral law amandad se that that authority
would vast in the Dapartmant of Public
Works.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It may be that
I did noV follow my honourable friend

closely, or that.my mind is nlot as clear as
it should be; but I fail to. understand just
exactly why my honourable friand thinlcs
it desirable te have this Bill paseed. I
confess I do not understand why. and 1
hope that before vie pass this B;11 we rnay
have an axplanation.
Hon. 5fr JAMES LOUGHEED: As I understand, my honourable friend aaks me for
a apecific instance.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My horAurabla
friand has told me hae could not give any;
se 1 arn noV asking for that, but arn rather
looking for soe more explicit axplanation
oi the Bill. 1 do not know what it means.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEP: As My
honourable friand willsea in the last section
of the Bil, it is. an express authority being
given to the Governor in (Jouncil Vo remove

navigable waters without the authority of
the Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I -am afraid that
this section means the reverse of what my
ho-nourable friand says. "Approved works
not Vto deemed obstructions te navigation
ha
or to be hiable te remiov-al, etc."-I think
th-at is Vhe very reverse of what-my lhonourable friend has told us.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That legalizas them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The interpretation of that section is, I understand,
that where the authority bas been secured
to erect a work ovar or upon a navigable
water, aven though it may impede navigation, it is properly there and cannot ha
removed by reason of its being an obstruction to the navigation cf the stream.
Hon. Mr. BEL COURT: Would not that
result frorn the former legislation? Is it
necessary to provide it here? Would not
that ha a natural consequence, a necessary
corollary, cf the axisting law?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Where
the authority was givan and the work was
constructed thera would be an implied
undartaking or. obligation that auch work
shoùld not block or impeda the stream;
but in this case, under the express languageocf the Bill, if the authority bas been
givaiz for the erection of a specific work,
then it is not possible te raise the other
question. 0f course, the Governmnent could
expropriate it, or, by the exercise of its
inherent powers, I supposa, make arrangements for its removal, but at Vue expense
of the Governmant itself. But the question
as te, its impeding the streamn cannot be

SENATE
raised. As I understand the other section,
that is, section 1, it will authorize the Government to remove any structure that has
been erected without express authority.
There are two provisions: one is for the
removal of a structure the erection of which
lias not been authorized by the Government; and the other provides that if the
proper authority was secured for the erection
of the work, sucb authority shall render
it projf against the contention that it impedes the stream.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
If any
person lias filled in a large portion of a
lake or a bay, would he have to remove
the obstruction? I know of several instances of that having been done.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) is no
doubt right, but I confess I do not understand in what way this alters or affects
the legislation as it stands to-day.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
make further inquiry into it before we go
into Committee.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I think that the Bill
might have an extension, or perhaps it is
intended to cover such cases as I have in
mind. There are frequently collisions and
other accidents in which vessels are sunk
in navigable waters of harbours, and the
owners of the vessels are not disposed to
lift them up, because the process is a very
expensive one. In cases where vessels have
been in collision or have been sunk and
are impeding navigable waters, there should
he sonie provision whereby the Government
could take prompt action to have the vessels lifted and the impediment to naviation remnoved, the expense afterwards to
he borne by the party properly iable for it.
I think that, in view of the exigencies of
navigation and the extension of shipping,
that power should he vested in the Government.

MOTION FOR RETURN.

Hon. JAMES DOMVLLLE moved:
That an Order of the Senate do issue for a
return of a statement of imports of petroleum
oils and spirits for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1919, and for each month of the unexpired
year to date.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, at the
risk of being a little tedious, I wish to make
a few remîarks on this question, and shall
ask you to be very patient with me. What
I have to say will contain nothing of an
offensive nature; on the contrary it will,'I
think, be interesting not only to the members of this honourable House, but to the
public at large.
On May 2, 1918, this Chamber unanimously passed a resolution, which reads
as follows:
That in the opinion of this House, In view of
the continued world-wide increase in the consumption of crurde petroleum oil and its manufactures, including fuel oil, gas oil and gasolene ; in view of the fact that up to date Canada
has required to import the major portion of
Canada's consumption of crude oil and of the
manufactures of crude oil ; in view of the fact
that there is lnown to exist in Canada deposits
of shale containing large quantities of the said
crude oil and of Nitrogen. which latter, when
converted into Sulphate of Ammonia, is valuable fertilizer, it is desirable that the Government should give immediate consideration of
ways and means necessary to encourage the
production of crude oil and of Sulphate of Anmonia from these deposits and generally lend
such co-operation as may be found necessary
to establish permanently the industry in Canada to the enrC that its full economie value, in
its many varied uses, may, so far as may be
possible, he conserved within the Dominion.

rooin for the belief that in the reply I
received "the wish was father to the

In the year 1913 Nova Scotia supplied the
province of Quebec with 2,456,416 tons of
coal, in the year 1918 with only 134,449 tonsa difference of 2,321,967 tons. The difference
was made up by increased importations
from the States. This year the States, owing
to labour troubles and to exportations to
Europe and South America, will be unable
to supply such deficiency as before. What
will the result be?
Professor H. E. Armstrong, speaking in
London, England, a month or two ago,
states:
in view of the prospective world's hortage
of petroleum, it will be criminal folly, mark,
criminal folly, if we fail to produce al. the o
fuel we can.

If not to produce be, in the opinion of
experts, " criminal folly " in England, is
it not also criminal folly in Canada, or
does Canada and the Canadian Government
claim inunmunity froin crime and also fron

folly?
Is net that Government,
who
through the neglect of their ministers or of
their officials, or froin motives that are sinister and unthinkable, ignore the warnings
given to them, not once but many times,
and who persist in a policy that bas prevented and prevents the quick utilization
of the oil contained in the oil shale deposits
of Canada, criminally responsible, and
should not the deaths that have occurred and
which probably will occur through the lack
of fuel, be laid to their doors?
The Montreal Gazette of September 22,
1919, contained the following:
Britain securing control of most of oil supplies-U.S. almost exhausted lookçs for new
fields, but finds Britain years ahead-Is important already-America finds itself victim of own
gambling and waste and forced to pay dearly
now.
London, September 20.-Recently E. Mackay
Edgar, head of the firm of Sperling & Co., expressed confident views on the ability of Great
Britain to hold her own against American
conipetition in an article in Sperling's journal,
entitled "The Answer to Mr. Vanderlip."
In
a further article in the same journal, Mr.
Edgar makes an eoually optimistic deliverance
on the future of the world's supply of petroleum, which be is convinced lies in British and
not American hands at present.
Mr. Edgar
says it seenis impossible to overthrow America's predominance in the oil industry, but lust
as America, although thirty or forty years ago

the grip of a timber famine, so he is convincei

stores of domestic 011 and is obliged to look
abroad for future reserves, and secondly, tnat
these reserves are owned or controlled by
Frits capital.
"More oil," says Mr. Edgar, "has probably
rur to waste in the United States than has ever
reached the refiners. Improvidence, carelessness, a blind gambling spirit, have marked all
except the most recent phases of the industry.
The great oil fields of the United States are
nearing exhaustlon, and It Is not believed that
the new ones which are being proved will yield
anything like the old prodigal production.
America has recklessly and in sixty years run
through a legacy tbat, properly conserved,
should have lasted her for at least a century and
a half.
"Already, although few people realize it,
America is an importer of cil. Last year she
imported from Mexico 38,000,000 barrels of
forty-two gallons each. Like foresighted men,
however, Americans are now diligently scouring
the world for new oil fields only to find that
wherever they turn British enterprise bas been
before them.
"We hold in our hands, then," says Edgar,
"secure control of the future of the world's oil
supply. We are sitting tight on what must soon
become the lion's share of raw material indispensable to every manufacturing country and
unobtainable in sufficient quantities outside the
sphere of British influence.
" I estimate that if their present curve of
consumption, especially of high-grade products
is maintained, Americans in ten years' time
will be importing 100,000,000 barrels of oil
yearly. At £2 a barrel that means an annuil
payment of £200,000,000 per annum, most, if
not all, of which will flnd its way into British
pockets.'

I have seen a letter written by the right
hLonourable the Prime Minister, in which
the righît honourable gentleman states:
The matter can only be decided by Council as
a whole and cannot be determined by any one
minister.
This statenent, of course, is true, but the

collective responsibility does not renove the
individual responsibility which rests equally

with the Premier and with every member of
the Governmnent, because each have their
redress from any decision of the Council
that is mnanifestly injurious to Canada and
te Canadians.

The President of the Society of Chemical
Industry of Great Britain has lately stated:
He had heard it said that coal had been too
cheap.
He did not think that reproach would
te uttered any more in the future. We were
faced, not only with a great increase in the
price of fuel, but we were face to face with a
very serious diminution In the output and that
was a subject of the utmost gravity.
Such is the situation to-day in Britain.
The situation next spring in Canada as te
fuel is likely to be even more serious, because whilst Britain exports coal, Canada,

and especially Eastern Canada, has to import both coal and oil. I ask, what immediate action does the Canadian Gove3n-

ment propose to take?

OCTOBER 1, 1919
Dr. Bakerville, of the College of the City
of New York, in a paper read in September
last before the American Institute of Mining
and Metallurgica1 Engineers, sated-I quote
from the Transactions:
The retarded development of that valuable
asset (oîl-yielding shales) of the province of
New Brunswick
nvolves a pathetic hlstory,
wh!ch le lamentable. This was sepecie.lly true
when the product wes so much needed in the
prosecution of the war.

Three years ega the Canadian Government were warned that a crisis was approaching in the supply of fuel. That warning was ignored, and the only possible
adequate remedy, s0 far as Eastern Canada
was concerned, was rejected.
In the spring following, whilst the late
Mînister of Finance was enjoying the balmy
airs and genia1 climate of Southern Califarnia, men, women and children were
being frozen ta death in Canada through
leck ai fuel. Last winter, but for the termination ai the war and the accident that
the good God sent Canada an unusually
mild winter, similar or worse misery woimld

occur next year?
I have been informed that Inverness
<Nova Scatia) soft coal is now being sold
in the city of St. John, N. B., at no les
a price than $10.50 per short ton of 2,000
pounds, ex ship. If such be the price taday, what la likely ta be the price next
winter?
Mr. Louis Simpson, industrial and mining
engineer, ai this city, has made this question a special study. From work done on
the oul shale question, thia gentleman is
rapidly acquiring an international reputatian, which it would appear is casier ta be
gained by an expert than any recognition
froin the Canadian Government. He lits
for years back persistently pointed aut ta
the Government a sure and easy way by
which the present situation can be relieved
and also by the adoption ai which many
of the millions of dollars now being sent
abroad may be retained at home. The
bunker coal requirements of Canada total
2,000,000 tons per year. This coal can, with
adventage ta all concernied, be replaced
with fuel ail and thia fuel ail can be obtained in Canada. The coal s0 releaaed
would go fer ta relieve future scarcity.
Not only will a ahip flred with fuel ail carry
mare freight, but the steamers will carry
their freight ta the destination in lesa time,
and with a less coat of labour and repaira.
The present high coat of labour and consequently of ship construction makes the

relative coat of the respective fuels.

74

SENATE

The Governinent has gone so far as to permit the importation of "Articles of Metal,"
when used for the transmission of fuel gas,
at a reduced customs duty, whilst insisting
that when similar articles are to be used
for the transmission of fuel oil full duty
must be collected. Can any member of this
Chamber find'or invent-if such invention
were possible to any honourable member of
this Chamber-any plausible reason why a
favour should be granted to fuel gas, which
is refused to fuel oil?
What justification can the Government
advance for the continuance of the war tax?
This tax was authorized upon the statement
made by the late Finance Minister that the
tax was but a temporary one. The war is
over, but the tax is still levied, at any rate
so far as the machinery required for mining
and retorting oil yielding shales. For every
dollar received by the Government through
the imposition of this tax, two, and, perhaps, three dollars are taken out of the
pockets of Canadian consumers. No wonder
Canadians are complaining about the high
cost of living. The war tax, as levied, has
become a means by which the Governnent
has secured for the established industries
of Canada an increase in protection, without the consumer catching on, and to this
extent the Government is directly responsible for the present high cost of living.
No industry that expects to have to compete for its share of the world's trade of the
future, when sanity has been re-established
and the present abnormal prices have been
reduced to more reasonable rates, is prepared to accept, in the construction of new
works, the handicap of to-day's high prices,
plus the import duty of 35 per cent, plus
the war tax of 71 per cent. If the members
of the Government have lost their sense of
proportion capital certainly has not, and it
is because the Government up to date has
refused to extend to tee new, but much to
be desired industry, similar favours to
those tiey have granted and continue to
grant to old establisied industries, that
Canada is not to-day producing all its requirements of petroleum and also the requirements of Canadian shipping for fuel.
If it be desirable for Canada to produce
within her own boundaries her requirements
and who dare contend that it
of petrolesu,
is not desirable? If it be desirable that
Canada should increase the production,
within ber own borders, of fuel-and in the
face of the evidence that bas been recited,
wlso wilI dare to say it is not--then it is
manifestly the duty of the Governmssent to
so amend its laws and regulations that that

Premier, in his letter already quoted, has
tried to shuffle the responsibility on to the
Privy Council. Each member of that coun.
cil w-ill probably desire to rake some similar shuffle, but no one member of the council can escape the consequence of the acts
of the whole.
The situation is as follows:
The war and its subsequent events have
largely decreased the production of coal fuel
in England, France, Belgium, United States
and Canada.
The extended use of the motor transportation' has increased and will continue to
increase the use of products of petroleum by
leaps and bounds.
There is alre'ady a scarcity of coal and
the reserves of petroleum are being depleted.
In Western Canada, the Government has
been spend'ing a very large sum of money,
the expenditure of which has been directed
by an electrical engineer (in conjunction
with the representatives of two western provinces, which representatives are equally
little acquainted with lignite and producer
plant technics) in an endeavour to produce
out of lignite an economical boùusebold fuel.

In Eastern Canada considerable money

Elven wban the British Government sent

upon the question of the possible recovary
from the shale, after the oil has been
educed therefrom, of certain by-products.
I believe, however, that the interests of
Canada require that this Chamber and al
Canada should, ha made aware that oil is
not the only product that m-ay be economically reeoveeed from certain of the Canadian oil yielding shales. Not perbaps from
ail, but certainly from -some. It is now
known that from certain of the shales,
there can be recovered nitrogen and potash,
both important fertilizer chemicals. Every
one interested in agriculture knows that up
to now Canada has been dependant upon
foreign sources for her supply of potash.
In other, but rarer cases, precious and rare
matais in remunerative quantities, may ha
recovered, and there is a possibility that in
certain casas, it may ha possible to use the
residue for the manufacture of certain
qualities of cament. Ail these saveral re-coverias require machinery upon which
large import duties are collected by the
Government.

It has sometimes been said that the members of this Chamber did littie that was of

I have the honour to ask my honourable
friand the member from King's (Hon. Mr.
Fowlar) te second my motion.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLE.R: Honourable
gentlemen, 1 must congratul-ata the honourable gentleman fromn Rothasay (Hon. Mr.
Dom-villa) upon the masterly manner in
which ha has presented this vary important
question to this honourable House. At the

SENATE

samne time 1 arn sorry I cannot congratulate
the House upon the tremendous interest
which they have manifested in the discussien of this important suibjeet.
This is -a matter of very great importance.
There is in the province of New Brunswick
a very large deposit of what is known as oil
shale, and, in view of the fact that the fuel
of the future will be largely oil, it is of the
utmost importance that the oul rescurces of
Canada should be duvuloped, and developed
at the earliest possible moment. A very
small proportion of the cil that is used in
the Brit.ish Empire is obtained primarily
w ithin the British Empire; less than 4 par
cent of the total quantity is the product of
British countries. This is very strange,
when we consider the fact that in the province of New Brunswick we have unormous
(leposits of this cil shale which la capable
cf produ'cing annually, for many years at
least, an encrmous output cf oil. This production can be carried on at a profit, giving
to this country a tremendous industry which
wculd employ a large number of people and
bring into the country a very considerable
amount of capital. This, te my mmid, is very
imîportant te the welfaru of the country.
There are other things te which the attention cf governments are cften diructed which
fade into insignificancu xvhen compared w'itti
the subject before us. What the honourable
gentleman from Potbesay is asking- on behaîf cf bis associates and hiniseif, I understand, is that the Governiient permit the
untrance into this country free of duty cf
macbinery for the purpose of obtaining the
cil frein the siieles. The duty is ncw 35 per
cent, with a war tax of 71 per cent, making
a total tax cf 42ý per cent. That ineans that
the capitalists wlîc go intc this enterpr.se,
which, like cll new enterprises, is surrcundcd by a certain aincunt cf risk. unless
the request cf niy honcurable friend is
granted, will have to pay 42ý per cent cf
their capital, I)ractically, for the privilege
cf riskingll the other 57ýi per cent. Ncne of
tiîis mrachinery is miade in Canada, as tiiere
is no such thing in Canada at the present
tirne as the extraction cf oil frcm shale.
This is flot a -new bus'iness, however.
Scotland bas been extracting oul from shale
for nearly haîf a century, and bas been
doing it vury successfully and very profitably. These New Brunswick shales bav e
been analyzed by the best analysts in the
world, and have proved to be at least as
gcod as those cf Scotland. Therefore, we

of New Brunswick, great potuntiat wealth

to obtain to a very large extent frcm fore-ign cduntries.
Enormous amounts of British money are
invested in Mexico, a c.ountry wilth.out, a
settled Governmenit, -where they -have te
take enormous chances. Very recently the
Cowdrey interests there were taken over by
the Shell Company, I think it ýis. Tbey
have also takeri oil fromn Borneo, from
Roumania, and from many other parts et
t-be world, as well ýas cbtaining some in, the
Unitedi Statea.
!he question of the development cf these
cil shales in Canada is a very important
one, and 1 thin~k the honeurable gentleman
is te be congratulated xývhether bu is acting
from a personal motive cr not. If this
House were properly seized cf ail the circumstances, I think it would realize the
neessity of s-omething heing done. Capital
is the meat sensitive thing in the world. I
have aiways found it se sensitive that it
bas been very difficuit te touch it, and
many othur people have had the saine experience. rTc induce people te go intc an
enterprise which. is new in this coun.try ia
almost impossible. We must get the capital
frein fereig-n countries, and th1ey say that
if this tax is geing to be lcvied they will
have no hand rin it. Tlîuy say, "If your
Gcvurnment takes no more intereat in the
develepment cf sucli resources than te levy
this enormeus iinîpest, w-e will net t.eucil

but 1 trust that the members of the Gcvernment hure will take this mnatter up with
their fellews in Ceuncil, and -will try to

regarded as anything but mining machinery,
there is a specific clause in the Act which
pravides that such rnachinery, of a kind and
description flot manufactured in Canada,
shall be admitted duty free. Therefore it is
not a question of the law. The law, according ta rny reading of it, appears to be dpfinite and clear. It is a question of interpretatian, and I would advise the honourable
rneinber frorn Rothesay <Hon. Mr. I)oinville) ta investigate along that line a littie
further.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: I shall have the
privilege of replying in closing the debate,
but before doing so may I state to rny
honourible iriend ithat that, linie af action

Hion. WILLIAM ROCHE: I desire to add
a word or two to what has been said in
regard ta the duty of the Governrnent to
assist in any measure or enterprise which
wiUl tend ta enlarge the resources of the
various provinces ai Canada. We alI agree
ta that proposition. The oil question la naw
upon a new basisc with regard ta fuel for
ships. I amn nat so very i amiliar with the
utilizatian ai minerai ail in other branches
-for machinery, for fertilîzers, or for ather
uses; but I know that a very great advance
lias been made in the propulsion of ships
by the use of oil. Not oniy in ships a! the
Royal Navy is ail supersed.ing coal, but aisa
in merchant shiýps., an accaunt ai its cheapnieas, on account ai the reduced sýpace which
it occupies, on account ai its cleanness, and
also because oi the reduction in the nurnoer
of men e.rnployed in stoking. It is superseding ta a large extent the use ai coal an
routes where ail can be obtained at bath
ends.
I arn told-I do not know it ai rny own
knowledge-that there are ' large heds of
s-hale in Nova Scotia also. I think the t*overnment could very weil assist in having
that article mined, and tested as ta, its oil-

SENATE
bearing capacity by the Imperial Oil Conipany, whicu bas estaeuished extensive works
at Halifax and enploys now about 10,000
men, and also bas established a town witl
all the concomitants of very extensive
works. They import their crude oil from
Merico and from the United States. I think
that, with the facility which works of that
kind would afford, the capacity and quality
of the oil shales in Nova Scotia could be
very cheaply tested, and, if they are valuable as oil producers, of which J have no
doubt, -they would add extensively to the
revenues both of the province of Nova
Sceotia and of the Dominion of Canada.
With regard to the New Brunswick product, I have always heard that it is very
valuable and will be a great resource of
that province. I cheerfully concur with ny
honourable friend in asking the Government that they give every facility and every
assistance to enable him and others to develop that very valuable product, for otherwise it will be a comparatively barren province.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable genflemen, I wish to take this opportunity of
adding a few words to what has been so
well said by the honourable member for
Rothesay (Hon. Mr. Doemville) in the very
able speech which he bas delivered. This
subject bas been before the Senate on two
different occasions, and the facts which warrant sone further progress in the development of the shale industry in Canada have
been amply set forth.
The importance of the shale industry to
this country and to the whole world is due
to the increased demand for oil. We know
froi scientific men that the cil sources of
the world are not expected to hold out for
a very long time, and that it will be necessary eventually to turn to shale in order to
supply the great demand for oil which
exists to-day throghout the entire comnercial world. The shale industry is not a
new industry. The process of extracting cil
from shale bas been in existence in Scotland since 1818, and the industry there has
grown to very large proportions.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Domville) bas covered considerable ground in
his remarks. I was not able to follow him
very closely. It may perhaps be of some
importance and of some assistance in the
determination of the question which he has
raised to give you some information with
rerard to the demand for oil in the United
States and to what is being done there to
procure this very necessary article. May
I point out to you, honourable gentlemen,
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

that, from the first of this year up to the
beginning of July last, 5,000 new oil companies have been established in the United
States of America with a capitalization of
The fact that the combined

development.
It is because of the demand for oil. The
whole niechanical world depends upon cil
to-day. Automobiles, motor boats, tractors,
motorcycles, aeroplanes, ships, and locomotives are using oil.
So dangerous bas the oil industry become
to the coal industry of the United States,
and so likely is oil to replace coal as fuel,

United States is apprehensive of the danger

the

After fully investigating that question they
reported in favour of a duty against Mexican oil, as the coal industry, in which
they had invested their capital, was in
danger.
Oil is replacing coal to such a large extent, then, that if Canada is to keep abreast
of the times and the development in other
countries, she must turn some attention to
the question of oil and oil development.
We have no oil wells in Canada to any
great extent, but we have an abundance of
shale. My honourable friends have pointed out to you that the shale of Canada is
rich in cils and in other materials and
minerals which are of the greatest vailue.
If I remember correctly, the figures which
we gave a year ago showed conclusively
that the oil shales of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia are much richer in oil than
the oil shales of Scotland.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE:

Yes.

This bas been
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR:
proven by analyses made by experts in
Canada and in the United States as well.
The American Government has taken steps
to secure the oil shales of the United States
and to have them thoroughly examined
and tested. There devolves upon us the
duty of seeing that Canada does not lag
behind in this industry.
My honourable friend from Rothesay bas
laboured in season and out of season to
promote this industry. He bas not received
a great deal of encouragement in the past;
but if the prophecies of scientific men and
business men in the world to-day come
true, we in Canada shall some day look
back to the work which he bas done in
bringing to public notice the benefits of

OCTOBER 1, 1919
this industry to Canada and the Empire,
-as having been of the greatest national inportance.
The navies of the world to-day are using
ail ta an extent that was neyer dreamned of.
The merchant marines of the world are
using oil. The -advantages.of oil are obvious. It takeis less room an ýships than coal;
it reduces the labour expense; it is more
cheaply and more easily loaded. Mr. Edward N. Hurley, chairman o! the United
States Shipping Board, said recently:
If our shipping plans carry out and ail ships
burn on, one-tbird of the world's entire pro-.
du -tion wjll, be requi*red for American ships
alone.

The production of oul in the last ten
years bas increased enormously, owing to
the fact that new oil wells have been
opened; but the production of ail bas bardly
increased in the same ratio as the demnand.
Oïl is being largely used for beating purposes in the United -States. Some of the
largest buildings which are being erected
in New York, to-day are equipped witb ailheating apparatus. The uses of ail are se
manifold, the demands for oïl are s0 great
and will continue to increase ta sncb an
extent, that I am sure we are justified in
doing everytbing in aur pawer ta place this
industry upan a flrm faundatian in tbis
Canada of ours.
In 1914 tbe consumptian af ail in the
United States was 276,000,000 barrais. In
the year 1918 the quantity bad risen ta
360,000,000 barreis. In 1918 tbey imported
tram Mexico 15,000,000 barrels of crude ail;in 1918 the importation fram Mexico had
more than doubled, reacbing a total af
42,000,000 barrels.
To my mind, the countries that will take
a solid interest in tbis injustry and avail
tbeniselves a! the natural resaurces wbicb
lie witbin tbeir baunds ta praduce oil,' will
rank among tbe leading commercial nations
of the future. A country like ours, witb
its extensive seacoasts and splendid barbours and great 'natural resources, must

ahl tbe opportunities that are at band, ixot
only ta develap the resaurces witbin aur

interests ai the whale o!f Canada and the

Hon. JAMES DOM VILLE: Honourable
geiltlemen, 1 have sent for some papiers that
I did not anticipate I should require
sO soon-papers showing that the department declined absolutely ta consider tbis
questiion.
My honourable friend fram
Toronita (Hon. Mr. Niebalîs) was right as
ta the tariff; but there is an averriding
power, tbe commissioner and bis associatas
in charge of the tariff, who can decide this,
that, and tihe other. This machinery is
very com'plicated. Tbere as noe desire taO
deprive Canadian manufacturiers of an
apportunity ta make the miachinery required.
A new industry camiot be developed under the disadvantage of arbitrary
decisians -as ta what shaîl or shal nlot corne

from the nitrogen that produces sulphate of
ammonia they do not produce 'in Scotland
more than 50 per cent of what can be produced in Canada.
Then let us point out the urerger between
the Anglo-Persian people and the Scotch
works. They are literally abandoning the
work hecause of the expense of getting out
the oil. The refining end bas almost ceased.
The Anglo-Persian people, tirough their
acentt say tat thteir object is to import
into England rich cils to mix with the poor

water-powers were going to be the great
source of nower in tii contrytha t they
were going to take the place of fuel, and put
the factories of the middle West in such a
position that they would not require protection.
There is another point of view from whiich
this question can be looked at, nanrely, the
localization of fuel. They are to-day generating electricity and transmitting it over a

sinister nrotive. Have those ceoule power
enough to wrest this valuable asset in New
Brunswick from the people? Where do they
get their mandate? There nust be a concurrence of power soewhere to give it to
them. The United States are all that is desirable in nrany respects. We get capital
fror them, but xve are mret with this duty
on macbinery. We have shown the world
the value of this mraterial; we have shown
it by analysis, and it is athnitted all round
-in Paris, London, Edinburgh, Ottawa, and
everywhere, and we nust be pulled out of
the rut. The Standard Oil Corpany is
raising large capital for purposes of development. I have no doubt that cil will be
found in Quebec. You will find it in Melville Island and in Gaspé, and it comtes

round the world to Roumania and other
countries.
Are we not making a legitimate request?
Have we not before us the fact that the debt
of Canada bas to be met by increased
energy so that our products may go abroad
to bring back mnoney to meet the public
debt? Tiere is the creditor and there is the
debtor, and the debtor must produce more
than he is producing to-day in order to mreet
the demands of his creditor.
Soume one has said that I am greater
than Moses: ho took water out of the rock,
but I am taking oil out of the rock. My honourable friends have so fairly covered the
ground that they have left very little to
be said. I am satisfied that this inatter
will not only impress itself very favourably
on the inembers of this House but will be
spread abroad through the press and will
be cabled to England, so that every financial institution in the world will sec what
we have got, and wonder what the trouble
is. The reason nust be givein. The gentlemnan who came froin the Admiralty was not
told anything about it. This knowledge will
cone before scientists and capitalists. Capitalists are always looking to sec how they
can get a return for their money, and they
will wonder wvhy Canada bas done as she
bas done. One of two things must be true:
either the oil does not exist in paying quantities or else it does exist. It has been
proven conclusively that it does exist, as is
shown in the Blue Books of this country.

I am sorry to have taken up so mnuch

it to be my duty. Perhaps ny honourable

niake sene statenent as to why the Customis Department, as shown by the correspondence, declined to let this rmachinery

The motion was agreed to.

OCTOBER 1, 1919
TREATY OF PEACE BILL.
DISCUSSION ON THE MOTION FOR SECOND
ADJOURNED.
READING-DEBATE
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable

gentlemen, I crave the indulgence of this
House, as since I adjourned the debate
eighteen hours ago, I have not had the
time to do justice to such a mighty subject as the one with which I am going to
deal. I desire to apologize if my discourse
is not co-ordinated as it should be.
During last winter, owing to circumstances to which I will refer later, I read a
great deal about the League of Nations
and of the good that we might get from it.
The first question I want to ask is, w'hy
have we in Canada been called upon to
ratify the Peace Treaty? There is another
treaty between France, England, the United
States, and Italy, a treaty of an earlier
date, and we have net been asked to ratify
it. Why is that? In con'sidering this matter last night, I commenced to see the wolf's
ears sticking out of the sheep's clothing.
I see now why we are caJled upon to ratify
not the Peace Treaty, as I see it, -but the
League of Nations Covenant. As we shall
be bound by that, we are called upon to
ratify the Treaty containing the League of
Nations. But tie Treaty itself was ratified
by Hic Majesty the King some time ago.
If any one has any doubt on that point, I
would refer him to Hansard. The leader of
the House said that tihe Treaty had been
accepted by Germiany, and had been ratified
by His Majesty. That being so, the matter
w'as closed. Now we have before us for
second reading a Bill. The Bill is very
eleverly worded, and one would never think
an insignificant lîttle Bill, not as big as
your hand, would contain so much. Subsection 3 of section 1 of the Bill says:
Any expense Incurred In carrylrlg out the
said Treaty shall be defrayed out of moneys
provided by Parliament.
That means to say that if we are called
upon by the League of Nations-and, mark
you, I am not opposed to the League of
Nations-if we are called upon to go to the
other end of the earth, by the terms of this
Bill we are authorizing the sending of men
and the finding of money to pay these men,
and so on. So, taking the Coven-ant of the
League of Nations and the little Bill that
we have before us, we are committing 4his
country absolutely, and ac2ording to rnany
we are signing away the very last shadow

we have signed this solemn contract, when
we are party to the Covenait of the League
of Nations, whatever m'ay be the decision
of the .majority of that League, we have to
find money and men and to satisfy the
upon
demands that niay be made
us, and to honour our signature, for
it has not been the practice of the British
Empire, or of any Dominion thereof, to regard a treaty as a scrap of paper. So when
we are entering into this arrangement we
should do so with our eyes open and should
know exactly what we are doing. We are
binding this country to all the requirements,
of the Covenant of the League of Nations.
The honourable member from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) said, as reported
in Hansard, that he thought the ratification
of the Treaty by us was absolutely unnecessary. I have his very worls here. And only
last night the honourable leader of the Opposition read some most interesting communications from Lord Milner. Ànowing
that some members here would realize that
it is unnecessary to ratify the Treaty, it
having been ratifled by the King, _tord
Milner tells us, in order to propitiate us, that
it is doubtful whether the House of Conmons in England have an absolute right to
ratify the Treaty, but they will probably
ratify it, and therefore we might do likewise. It bas even been suggested how we
might ratify it: " You may pass a resolution
in both Houses, and that will be an expression of opinion that you are in favour
of ratifying the Treaty." But, with consummate ability, he refrains from saying
anything about the Covenant of the League
of Nations, which accompanies the Treaty.
I take it that there is no honourable
gentleman in this House 'who can read a
legal document better than the honourable
member from De Salaberry, and I am very
glad to see the position which he takes. The
honourable member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) holde exactly the same view. It
is a nisrepresentation te a certain extentperhaps the word is too strong-to say that
we are here to ratify the Treaty. We are
here either to approve or disapprove of the
League of Nations; that is why we are here.
The honourable member for De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and the honourable
gentleman who is called the middle member
for Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche) also spoke
in the sae way. We have very often paid
compliments to the honourable leader of
this House upon his consummate ability.
He dealt with this question very nicely.

He knows that every word I say is
absolutely true; he did it, as usual,
in so nice a way that the Bill we
were about to swallow was almost agreeable. And whilst we compliment him so
often, I think we must also compliment the
leader of the Opposition upon the immense
improvement which by his industry he bas
effected in public life during the last few
sessions. He bas given us a good example,
and last night he caused the scales to fall
from our eyes when he read that correspondence. :He is entitled to bis share of
praise, and I am sure that every member on
this side of the House will agree with me
in offering our sincere congratulations to
him for the able manner in which he ba.s
been discharging bis duty.
The other day I happened to be in the
House of Parliament in Paris. A great deal
bas been said about our hurry to ratify
the Treaty. Wel], if there is a country
that should be in a hurry to ratify this
Treaty it is France, which bas constant relations with its neighbours. Still I beard
a great discussion there, in which no less
a person than M. Louis Barthou, who was
once Prime Minister and bas been a minister in several administrations, stated that
it is very doubtful that this Treaty will
be accepted unless Article 61 of the German
constitution is amended. Article 61 of the
German constitution provides for the annexation to Germany of that part of Austria that is German, and that is absolutely
against the Peace Treaty. An ultimatum
bas been sent to Germany saying that unless Article 61 is erased from their constitution, no Treaty will be made with Gerniany.
Hon. Mr. POWER:
erase it.

They have agreed to

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I was present in
the Chamber of Deputies of France througb
the courtesy of one who was here a few
years ago, M. Viviani, who was good
enougb to send me four tickets for myself
and my friends, to enable us to hear the
debafe.
Canada was asked to sign because of Article 10, and that article, it .seemns to me,
does not apply to Canada. It declares that
ail the nations who are parties to the
Covenant will see to it that there is no
aggression against any territory.
Great
Britain possesses the territory of the Empire. I do not know that Canada bas any
territory outside the British Empire. So if
there were any aggression against any part
of the British territory, it would be England,
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

and not Canada, that would ýsee to it. I
<lo not think that Article 10 is applicable
to Canada any more than it is applicable
to South Africa, or Australia, or New Zealand, or India.
Once we have signed, as I have already
said,
we ishall
have no
discretion.
Whether a war is just or unjust in
our opinion, as God gives us to see right,
we shall have to serve and pay. There is
where the wolf's ear appears, because, while
people say you are ratifying the Treaty and
most people believe you are ratifying it,
you are instead entering into the Covenant
of the League of Nations, and in this Bill
we are providing for all the expense that
may be entailed.
We had two commissioners at Paris: the
Hon. ex-Judge Doherty, Minister of Justice,
and the Hon. Arthur Sifton, Minister of
Customns, and in the speech from the Throne
at last session it was said by the Governor
General, His Excellency the Duke of Devonshire, that bis advisers were in Paris. Now,
tbat is a vexed question.
I doubt very
much that this Government ever passed an
Order in Council appointing those gentlement to represent Canada. I think they
were rather appointed by Orders in Council
passed by the Imperial Government, and
that they were there as Imperial representatives, not as representatives of Canada,
for I do not see how they could be admitted
otberwise.
We being a colony. have no
locus standi; and that is what people will
not understand-that we were not invited,
and were not in that great assemblage.
However, the Hon. Mr. Sifton and the
Hon. Mr. Doherty went in, hanging on
to the coat-tails of Mr. Lloyd George
and Mr.
Bonar Law.
Naturally
Mr.
Lloyd George and Mr. Bonar Law were
quite pleased to bring in those who
were hanging on to their coat-tails, just as
our Catholic bishops, walking down the
aisles of our beautiful cathedraIs, are
pleased to have two or three little pages
carrying their train. Our ministers were
simply hanging on to the coat-tails of the
British representatives, xvhich I say is a
humiliating position for our people. Either
Ae had a right to be there or we had not;
and I do not think any constitutional lawyer would ever say that we had a right
to be there. Therefore, it would have been
better to stay out and trust to the Government of Great Britain and the King to
make the Treaty -as they should, and they
should stop " kidding " us--making us believe that we are a nation and have a say.
As you have heard the honourable members from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), De

OCTOBEIR 1, 1919
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), and De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) state, we had
absointely no locus standi there.
If we had any right to be there, what
about poor littie New!oundland? You do
not see a word about Newfoundland. They
have a Government like ours and they have
a-Governor like ours. Why should they
not have been invited? Is it because
they are a srnall and poor country? Could
they not have corne in behind sorneright,
any

If
body?
Newfoundland would have had a similar
right, and New!oundiand would have been
there, you rnay be sure. Smali communities are very jealous o! any prerogative
they may have. But Newfoundland was flot
represented there, and I challenge anybody
to contradict that statement. Newfoundland
being very srnall, she might bave been
brought in, just as parents who attend
festivities o! any kind may bring their
children, because the children would like
to have some ice cream and cake.
I do flot intend to discuss in detail the
provisions o! this Treaty; it la too long;
but there la one article, No. 246, to wbich.
I wouid draw your attention. That article
reads:
Wlthin six months from the coming Into
force of the present Treaty, Germany will restore to His Majestv the King of the Hedjaz
the original Koran of the Caliph Othman, which
was remnoved from Medina by the Turkish
authorities and is stated to have becn presented to the ex-Emperor William Il.
WithIn the same period Germany will hand
over to His Brltannlc Majesty's Governmeflt
skull of the Sultan Mkwawa which
the
was removed from the Protectorate of G erman
East Atrica and taken to Germnany.

This Article caused some hilarity. One
person, wbo has been a Cabinet min ister
for mny years and now ocdupies a bigh
position, was very rnuch mortified that in
that Treaty there was not a word about
Canada or oui- Prime Minister. the Hon.
R. L. Borden, and yet At speaks o! the King
o! the Hedjaz, and the Koran, and the
Caliph Othman and also of the skull o! the
Sultan Mkwawa. That ex-Cabinet minister
said: "I arn very much mortified; he
thought we would do better than that."
That gentleman was certainly not as well
posted as he sbould have been. This
matter la much more important than appears on the surface. If there was one
thing that England did well, it was to
restore these very same articles, which to
us appear to be laughable, for the very good
reason that the King of th'e Hedjaz has
in bis territory the two sacred cities o!

83

Medina and Mecca, the goal of the pilgrimages of the Sons of the Prophet. The
Xingdom of the Hledjaz, - as everybody
knows, is to, the east of the Gui! of Suez
and the Red sea, and Aden is on one skie
of it and Perirn on the other. As we are
ail aware, King George *is the greatest ruler
of Moslems that there is in the worid or
probably the greatest there ever was. There
are under his absolute sway over 100,000,000
of Mahometans or Mosiems. There are
67,000,000 of them in India alone. When
we read the other day o! England taking
possession and holding sway over Persia,
after the Russians had retired 'from the
field, we realized that that was part o!
this same poiicy, because, in order to propitiate the Mahometans, who foirn such a
large part, over one-quarter, o! the population o! the British Empire, Great Britain
bas taken a protectorate and zone of influence in that narrow part o! Persia between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian
sea. That is 600 or 700 miles at the utmost.
Starting !rorn Morocco in the west, the
Mahometans extend rigbt acros6 Africa and
Asia to the boundaries of China. It is all
pretty much in the sarne latitude. The zone
they occupy in Asia is neariy 1.000 miles
!rorn north to south, and it la 4,000 or 5,000
miles !rorn east to west. In Africa their
territory is 700 or 800 miles !rorn north to
south, and it extends ail the way acros
Northern Africa. This narrow strip is the
iink that binds the oriental and the cecidental Moslem.s. It is a most important
territory, and there England wiil be
able t-o control her subjects on both sides;
there she will hold the sieve, and only
such newvs as she chooses will be ailowed
to pass. By propitiating those people the
tranquili(y of India la assured. The 67,000,000
Mtihometans o! India are the richest and
the most powerul-the employers o! labour,
etc.; and if Great Britain has the Mahometans o! Inaja in sympathy wîth ber,
she need neyer fear any trouble in India.
The Afghans are also concerned, hecauie
Afghanistan is largely peopled by Moslems.
Let me make a prediction. The old city o!
Constantinople bas been in the possession
o! the Turks ever since 1453, under the
name of Stamboul, and ail that time it bas
beený the seat of " the Father o! the Faith!ul," although it is not a sacred city. I
predict that the Mosiema will neyer allow
the Turks to be driven from Constantinople,
and Covenant or no Covenant the Sultan
will remain in Constantinople, and those
who will keep him there are people whom
we lçnow very mwell. 1 do not blamne them

for doing so, because, after all, the British
Empire must look after its own interests
just as any other empires must do.
Now, as to the skull of the Sultan Mkwawa. He was a great Sultan, and he is
worshipped by the Moslens of East Africa.
He is a sort of saint. The removal of his
skull was just as if some one was to steal
frorn us in the province of Quebec, we
will say, the relie of Ste. Anne de Beaupré.
The whole province of Quebec would be
afire, I suppose.
As to the Koran and that particular copy
of it. The Koran was made, as we know,
by the son-in-law of Mahomet, who married Fatima, the favourite daughter of the
Prophet, for Mahomet, like our Saviour
Jesus Christ, had never written anything
hinself. When I say that our Lord never
wrote anything himself, I want to be absolutely right: I think he did write once.
When the Jews were stoning an adulterous
woman he comnenced writing on the sand
the oins of those who were lapidating this
womian. That is the only writing of His that
we have ever heard of Mahomet never wrote,
but whon Mahomet was dead his son-inlaw, with the help of his wife Fatima, commenced to compose the Koran. But there
were other persons who had listened to
Mahomet, and, Io and behold, there appeared four editions of 'the Koran, and
the people did not know which was the right
one. If you read the Gospels of the Evangelists St. Matthew and St. John, you will
find that they do not exactly agree as to
the dletails of the passion of our Lord;
there is a difference. So there was a difference in the Koran, and that would never
do, because the religion of Mahomuet is a
positive religion-it is a case of positive
religion: believe or die. And it being a
positive religion, the people said: " We
must have only one Koran." Therefore the
Caliph Othman had the four versions
brought before hin, and he said, " Now,
we are going to settle this question," and
after considerable deliberation one copy
was agreed upon. Then be said, " Give
me the other three copies," and he destroyed
thein, so that there should never be any
discussion about them. And now England,
knowing how precious that original document is, knowing that it is the Bible for
Mahometans, says that it must he returned
by the Kaiser to the King of the Hedjaz.
Once you approve of this Covenant of the
League of Nations, wbat is your position going to be? There will he other treaties;
there will he a treaty with Austria in the
near future. I wonder if we shall be called
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

upon te ratify that treaty and to have another session? There will be a treaty with
Bulgaria, and I suppose we shall be called
upon to ratify that Treaty, because, if it is
a good thing to ratify one, it must be good
to ratify them all, and we shall have to
come back. Then there will be a Treaty
with Turkey, and when we ratify that we
will say that the Turks will be allowed to
remain in Constantinople, because we have
a good many friends amongst the Mahometans. But I believe that we shall
never hear of the ratification of the other
treaties; I think we shall consider that
King George is quite able to ratify them,
and will say that it is all right for him to
do so.
I think the honourable gentleman from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made a
lapsus linguae yesterday when he said that
Canada had declared war on Germany. I
should like to know how we would go about
it. We have no nachinery to do it. How
would we do it? I suppose the nearest that
we could come to it would be to take a
street car and go to Government House and
tell the Governor General that we would
like to declare war, and ask him if he would
he good enough to let the Colonial Secretary know of our wishes. What would
come back? There would he a cable: "Devonshire, Ottawa.
Tell our children to be
quiet or we will have to go and whip them
ourselves."
',,ny, even our own little force
of militia is only for the defence of our own
territory. We are forbidden to go outside
of Canada with them, because, forsooth, we
might embroil England in a war. Suppose
we were to send a few reginents across the
border, what would happen? That would
be a casus belli. That is why in the British
North America Act it is laid down that our
militia can only act within the boundaries
of Canada and for the defence of our own
territorie.s and for nothing else.
We have heard it said for years and years
that when England is at war Canada is at
war. There is a corollary to that, and it is
that when England is at peace Canada is at
peace. It should work both ways. I may
tell you that in England they are employing their time at peace; they are trading
with Germany and are making a lot of
money, and it is a good thing they are. I
suppose that we too can trade with Germany if England can do it.
The honourable the middle member for
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche) said what I have
cten said in this House lately, that Canada

her American possessions; they even
thougýht that Canada might become independent and that Australia might go its
own way.

But since 1850, instead of that

there bas been a consolidation. The United
States are dloser togýether now than they
ever were before; noa one in Canada thinks
of seceding from the British Empire; Australia bas proved hier ioyalty. Iustead of
the Empire breaking up, the opposite bas
been the case. South Africa bas corne in.
But, with all that consolidation, there are
stiil fifty states which. are independent,little states like Portug.al, Greece, Serbia,
Montenegro, even Bulgaria and Roumania.
Those little countries cail thernseives independent, althougb lu reality tbey are flot

SHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, it will be
very surprising if the four or five cannot
find aniong therneelves one to represent
thern without having to get somebody from
outside. The honourable gentleman will
admit that there is a very long chance that
they will go outside.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But theoretically they
can do so.
Hon. Mr. CASGRPiIN: Oh, in theory, yes.
Anything can be done in theory.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: That le ail we are
working on now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRÀIN: Then, as I have
said, this is a new provision=that there
shall be no war without consent, except for
the status quo. 1 suppose that means that
a country would not have ta consuit the
League af Nations before defending itself
againet any power that wanted to upset the
status quo. .That country would not have
ta wait to ask for permission to try to put
out the aggressor. Also, in a case of
country
one
annexation-if
voluntary
wanted to be annexed ta another, if both
parties were agreeabie-it would not he
necessary ta consuit the League, and the
League would not prevent that annexatian.
But there is no dou'bt that the state
would have ta obey, and the loss ai aavereignty is what is at the present mamnent disturbing sa much the United States

not willing that any ai the prerogatives af
the UTnited States shauld be in any way

the hanaurable gentleman ham asked me
that question, because I have, right here in
Hansard, answers which are much abler
than I cauld give myself. In the firet place,
I will quate the answer given by my leader
(Hon. Mr. Bastock):
As 1 understand the Treaty, it will be decided as ta exactly what quota Canada and the
other nations are to provide In men, in money,
in shlps, and In ather ways. As far as I
understand at the present time, we would bave
been in a stronger Position If Canada had nat

able ta corne forward valuntarlly and take aur
stand at any tirne when the necesstty arose,
exactly as we did In August. 1914. We would
he free ta put forward nur greatest efforts as
we felt Inclined.

Sanie liberty would be left us, but, as I
said at the beginning, when we have signed
the Treaty every shadaw af autanamy that
we had wîll be gone.
Here is another quatatian fram the speech
made by my other leader, the honourable
menîher fram De Larimier (Han. Mr. Dandurand):
We have assumned International obligations
wlthaut obtalning In return an international
recognition. We shall neyer be represented ln
the counoil af the League, as the four representatives we could vote for, wifl nat be selected
from the British Emnpire, which will already be
one of the nine. I ciearly dee obligations of
great magnitude assumed by Canada under
Articlp 10 of the Tre'aty; and, since aur selfappointed Cabinet ministers hail obtained the
right ta appear ln the Treaty and ta append
their signatures ta this historical document, I
wlll not reproach thema for accepting, it with
the obligations comprised therein.
I think that answers the hanaurable gen-

tleman pretty well.
Hon. Mr. BRIADBURY: Na.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Oh, I think not.
That le flot an answer ta the question.
Han. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Then I will try
ta answer the question myself if the honourable gentleman does not like the answers from the ather members. I have the
answer here, somewhere.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I hope you get it
samewhere.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will quote the
honourable member froin De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique):
Therefore, I say that aur ratificatian of the
Treaty is of no consequence at aIL Whether
w'e ratify it, or wheth-r vie refuse to ratify it.
maltes no difference whatever; the Treaty becornes effective ln ail its Provisions.
Does that satisfy the honaurable gentleman?
Han. Mr. McMEANS:

No.

Han. Mr. CASGRAIN (reading):
I call your attention, honourable gentlemen,
ta the fact that the League of Nations le Part
of the Treaty. and therefore the moment the
Treaty cornes Into effect. we as parties ta the
Treaty, being part of the British Empire, are
bound by aIl the provisions of the League of

In the United States, as we observe, there
is a great. deal of trouble, and I amn sure we
ail join with the Americans in deploring
the fact that their President, Woodrow
Wilson, has been taken so iii that he has
broken down in the midst of this very important crisis.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE:
They are al
breaking down.
Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: In New York the
other day, Saturday, the papers, both Repuiblican and Democrat, were unanimous
in deploring the illness of the Chief Executive of the United States. The last time
that rny dear lamented leader, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, spoke in Montreal, at a very large
meeting held at the Monument National,
before the Fifth Sunday Association. he
spoke for an hour and a haîf and held his
audience spellbound with bis unrivalled eloquence. In the course of that address
he
said
that
the
United
States
were
a
fortunate
people,
because
in their war of independence they
had George Washington, in the war between
the North and the South they had Abrahami
Lincoln, and ini this great. world war they
had Woodrow Wilson. H1e said that it was
a great thing for the United States that
Providence had given theni such men at the
critical periodLs of their history.
One word more and I conclude. Everybody bas his pet scheme, and I bave mine.
The federation of the British comrmonwealth of nations is an essential condition
for the maintenance of general peace. When
we louve a federation of the nations iii the
British Empire, and when, as I once heard
my old colleague, Sir Richard Cartwright,
say, the United States and the commonwealth of nations of the British Empire
corne together, more will have been done
for the peace of the world than anytbing
el&e that the human mind could devise.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, 1 do not rise for the purpose of ad-

89

dreasing- the House, but I wish to ask tbe
honour4ble gentleman wbo bas just sat
down a question, in order that my present
somewhat obscured mental vision may be
enlightened. Perliaps I was moistaken, but
I unclsrstood the honourable gentleman in
the early part of bis speech to say that
when England was at war Canada was at
war. Arn I rigbtP
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. POWER: Well, for tbe application of that: if under present conditions,
without this Treaty and without the League
of Nations, Canada is always at. war when
England is at war, what difference does the
Treaty or the League of Nations niake?
Hoh. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, this discussion seems to me
to be more or less academnic, and I do not
propose to say anything generally about the
Treaty or the League of Nations. I wish, in
the few remarks that I shall make, to
speak more of our statua. It bas been again
and again repeated bere that Canada is a
colony. As I understand it, in the eye of
constitutional law Canada neyer bas been,
since it came under British rule, a colony.
A colony is usually understood to be land
which is found vacant and is taken by a
civilized nation, or land wbich is taken froni
the aborigines. Canada was taken from the
aborigines hy the French, but when
the English came
to Canada
they
came ,as
conquerors. They found here
a
white
ýrc.
a
civilized
people,
and this country was ceded to them.
1 arn unaware of any country in history
being regarded as a colony which had corne
into tbe possession of another country in
tbe saine way as Canada came into England's possession. Alsace would not be
calt'ed a colony when the German Empire
owned it. One wouid not say that the
territory of Poland, whioh was divided
among Rusisia, Prussia and Austria, constituted colonies. Ireland waa neyer called
a colony. Why shou]d Canada be called a
colony? Canada is territory annexed to the
British Empire by conquest. Blackstone is

lâw of colonies. 1 bave not bad the opportunity of consulting bum for a long while,

Hofn. Mr. LYNÇCH.STAUNTON: There
neyer wae in the history of the worid a condition sncb as existe in the British nation
to-day. There neyer befote was a nation
like the British nation. There never was
*ary constitution like the British Conutituflan. The dependencie6 o! France erithar
have representatives sitting right in the
Parhient in Paris or are what we caul
Crown colonies. But we cannot argue from
the condition of any other people as ta wbat
we mu;st do ta adapt the law ta aur condition. It is a new condition, and we
muet, as far as we can, adapt the law
ta aur naw Constitution. It dos 6eem ta
me, when one realizes that the King under
aur Constitution rules this country with the
advice of bis Parliament, that it is rnost
reasonabia ta say tnat whenever the King
deciaras war hie deciares war as the lord
ovar each Parliamant and not the lord over
one Parlianuent, and that when bie aeks the
approval of hie advisere, hie mnuet ask tha
approvai ai hie advisere in each af hie Parliarnents. It wouid be most incongruous if
hie did nat. The fact that haretafora Kinge
did not do so is no reason why it ehould not
be donc now. We know that aur Constitution bas widened out from precedent ta
precedent. We know that aur Constitution
and the inethod of governing the Empire
bas changed witliout changing any st&-tute.
In the Governrnent af to-day ans cannot
recognize the Government which existed in
England in the time of James 1, or the Government that existed one hundrad years or
fifty yaars aga. It le the custome ai tbe
people, not Parliament, that have madle
those changes. To-day, by practioe, hy new
theories, with the consent af the people oi
this, -country, with the consent af the whole
Empire, we havýe deciared that the Dominion af Canada, when a great question involving the whole Empire comaes up, shi Il
be hea.rd, that no question in which a selfgoverning member af the Empire is interested shall ha answered. ta affeçt its intarest without\ its sanction, and that she
ishahl fot hae, as the hanourable gentleman
said, a inere train-bearer.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I shouid like ta
ask one question of the honaurable gentleman. I quite agree with a great deai that
he lias said, and I speak not by way af
criticism, but rallier ta obtain enliglitenment. The honoiarable gentleman lias said,
very properly, I think, that iormeriy it
was within the power ai the King ta declare

war without reference ta hies minieters, but
that through the development of the Britishi Constitution Ait8l na-w adinitted that

SENATE
ary act of importance must be performed
under the advice of the ministry. If I
understood the honourable gentleman, that
i the thecry he expounded, and in which
i concur. Am I correct 9
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I believe that, yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable
gentleman proceeded to say that the King
declares war under the advice of his ministers. If we bear in mind the theory of
the honourable gentleman that the King
bas different ministers for the different
parts of the Empire, when he declares war
under the advice of his ministers, he is
not, as I understand it, to act upon the
advice of his ministers in the Dominions,
but only upon the advice of his ministers
in Englanid. j suppose the honourable
gentleman will agree to that.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
will not.

No, I

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Does the honourable
gentleman contend that when the war was
declared against Germany the King took
the advice of his ministers in Canada?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I will
answer the honourable gentleman. I think
the development of our Constitution has
brought us to this condition. The King
may declare a. war which will involve the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland upon the advice of his ministers
who advise him regarding that part of the
Empire; when he declares war and intends
to call upon us for assistance, he must
obtain the approval of his ministers for the
Dominion of Canada. I think that has
been the practice, because when he declared
war in South Africa he did net ask us for
assistance until our Cabinet had approved
of it. When the recent w-ar came on he did
not turn to Canada and say, "You nust
send me troops, because my Privy Council,
sitting in Londo, has advised me .to go to
war." No: when he declard war hi.s voire
was heard at Ottawa. Our Cabinet, as his advisers, s,aid.: "We approve of the war and
recommend Parliament to send the troops,"
and, as my honourable friend the leader of
the Government has said, not a dollar of
taxation would or could have ibeen imposed
upon this country, net a soldier would have
donned the King's uniform had net the
King's advisers at Ottawa approved of his
action.

ion. Mr. CASGRAIN: How could they
clothe them without our money?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am afraid the
honourable gentleman is drifting froin the
declaration of war.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do not
agree that when England declares war and
we approve that we are at war. We are at
war in theory, but not in practice.
Hon. Mr. BLIQUE: Whethèr the honourable gentleman admits it or net, I think it
is very plain that when England is at war
all the Dominions are at war.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-,'TAUNTON: England
is never at war; it is the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: When the King of
England declares war I take it that every
part of the British Empire is at war.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But he
never declares war until he gets the approval of his ministers.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I say when he declares war every part of the British Empire
is at war.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
the old theory.
Hon. Mr. BEIýQUE: That is the theory
now. The theory has changed merely in
this respect, that the King will not declare
war except under the advice of his ministers.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
the point.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: His ministers in London.
Hon. Mr. LYNGH,STAUNTON: Who says
that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I should like to have
time to say in what I agree with the honourable gentleman; perhaps he would be surprised to see how close together we are, altnough I cannot follow him to the extent to
which he has gone. For instance, when the
Treaty of Peace was made, suppose that we
had gone u.pon the theory that the King had
to act upon the advice of his ministers as
far as the United Kingdom is concerned,
upon the advice of his ministers in the Dominions as far as each Dominion is concerned, what would have been the consequence if there had been a difference between the advice given to the King by the
ministers in England, and the advice given
to him by his advisers in this Dominion?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: We would
not have senit any troops.

OCTOBER 1, 1919
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I 'a-n speaking of
the Treaty of Peace, not cf trocops.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Then we
would net sign- it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, we would not
sign it; but you would be in the same
position as if yeu had signed it. Would you
or would you net?
I repeat:
Suppose all the Dominions had said, "We
will not agree; we advise you not to sign
that Treaty; we demand another treaty
altogether," would ithe King have divided
himself? Can you contemplate such a thing
as the King makixtg one treaty for one part
of the Empire and another treaty, or half
a dozen treaties perhaps, for other parts?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
one of the anomalies of our Constitution.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Oneî
must bear that
in mind to see exactly what our pos'ition is.
I agree with the honourable gentleman when
he says that under the British Constitution
powers which were hereto'fore possessed by
the King alone are no more possessed by
the King alone; and that through the develiopment of constitutional goverrnent the
people woul-d not permit anything of that
kind or -any exercise of power in that way.
I agree also with the honourable gentleman
that our Constitution has developed, although it is a wriitten Constitution. It bas
developed, maybe not to the same extent as
the British Constitution, but it has developed. I aiso agree with the itheory that
our status ia changing from day to daythat through the .development of our Constitution or the development of the British
Constitution, we acquire rights which we
did net possess before.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: We are allowed te
do so.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, I say we acquire
rights.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, no.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable
gentleman may have his own opinion, but I have rmine.
I am expressing
my opinion
and not the
opinion of the honourable gentleman.
I am making a distinction. I claiin that
there is such a thing as absolute power,
and there is such a thing as a constitutional
power.
When we speak of absolute
power, we speak, for instance, of such
a power as that of the British Parliament
te repeal the Canadian constitution. They
have the absolute power te do se, but they

have not what I call the constitutional
power. The repeal of a law of that kind
would be an act of oppression which would
be considered unbearable and would justify
a revolution. In the development of British institutions it bas come te be recognized that although a power may exist
absolutely, it may net exist constitutionally. Therefore when we are discussing a
question of that kind we must agree unon
the ternis, as we must agree upon the tern
when we use the word "nation."
If in
speaking of a nation we mean one having
absolute independence, being absolute master of its own constitution, it is perfectly
plain that Canada is net a nation in that
sense of the word; but if we mean a country that has many of the attributes of a
nation, such as that of a fully self-governing
state. or that of being party te any Treaty
whieh affects or may affect directly its own
interests, Canada may in that sense be considered a nation.
The great difficulty to my mind is this
-and I would draw the attention of honourable gentlemen to it. The Treaty is made
by the Crown of England on the advice of
its ministers. it is the British Empire as
a whole which is a party te the Treaty;
it is net each of the Dominions, separate
from the United Kingdom. Then I say
without fear of contradiction-and this proposition has not been contradicted here
or in another place-that the moment the
Treaty is ratified by the King it is binding
upon the whole Empire. Now the difficulty
arises as te the League of Nations. The
League of Nations being in one sense part
of the Treaty, the moment that Treaty becomes binding the League of Nations becornes effective and its Covenant is binding
upon all the Dominions. But, as regards
the League of Nations, the Dominions are
acknowledged as entities separate from the
United Kingdom; they are separate members. Therefore the question arises, what
is the meaning of that situation, that, although they are all bound by the 'Treaty,
yet as parties to the League of Nations they
are distinct members of that League? I
suggest that the solution is this, that the
moment the Treaty was signed, or was
ratified by the King, under the advice of
his ministers, it became binding upon the
whole Empire, but that it was left te each
of the Dominions, as well as te the United
Kingdom, te decide whether it would remain in the League of Nations or would
withdraw from it. The Dominions could
net help being drawn into it, because it
was part of the Treaty, but they could avail

themselves of the two years' notice to withdraw from that League. That seems to
me to be the solution of the difficulty.

INTERPRETATION BILL.
SECOND ItEADING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 4, an Act to amend
the Interpretation Aot.
Honourable gentlemen, the
He said:
object of this Bill is to make the Interpretation Act applicable to Orders in Council
that have been passed under the War
Measures Act. There was an Order in
Council passed in pursuance of the War
Measures Act providing for the interpretation of different Orders in Council in the
same way as the Interpretation Act applies
to the statutes. As those Orders in Council
will expire upon flic declaration of peace,
it is; desirable that this provision should be

made by legislation, and this Bill is to
meet that situation.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: This Bill is a very
important one. It is to be read in connection with the Interpretation Act. The
Interpretation Act deals wilb laws and with
existing courts; but these Orders in Council are laws in theiselves, and create commissions and controllers for the working
out of the Orders iii Council. I am not
quite sure that this amendment to the Interpretation Act is going to meet the case
at all. 'Say you have a court to-day with
jurisdiction over a matter, and you transfer
the jurisdiction to another
court and
destroy the existing court, it works aill
right; but where you have an Order in
Council with a controller, and you destroy
the controller and the Order in Council, I
do not know that the wording of this Bill
is wide enough to enable the courts to have
jurisdiction to carry out what is provided
for in the Order in Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Unlike my honourable friend, my trouble is that the wordHon. Mr. BEIQUE

I do not know just were
that Bill would lead us to. The Interpretation Act, which interprets the whole of our
legislation, is to apply to these Orders in
Council, with all the consequences, and I
for one cannot see how far-reaching this
may be. I think we ouglt to know a little
more about it.
ing is too wide.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am not
forcing it on the Chamber. It is desirable,
of course, that it should be dealt with
during the present session. It may be said
that the Orders in Council are precisely
analogous to statutes. They have all the
power and the effect of statute law. When
we legislate to-day or six months hence, we
legislate in view of the fact that there is an
Interpretation Act on the statute book,
which automatically becomes applicable to
all legislation which is passed by Parliament. The saine must necessarily apply to
the Orders in Council which have been
passed; we must regard them as statute
laws for the time they are in operation;
and, inasmuch as the Order in Council
fixing an interpretation for those Orders in
Council falls to the ground with the other
Orders in Council, there must be some
continuity by which we can interpret the
laws that have been in force under the War
Measures Act. Probably we can discuss
thi to very much better advantage in committee.
Is there an
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Order in Council to-day which applies the
Interpretation Act to Orders in Couneil?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, but
there is an Order in Council dealing with

('ouicil, as I understand, makes the Interpretation Act contained in our statutes applicable to all the Orders in Council passed
under the War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We have been
making Orders in Council for five years.
Has it not occurred to the Government
before to pass an Act to make the Interpretation Act apply?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose
legislation could have been brought down
at flic time the War Measures Act was
passed, providing that the Interpretation
Act would be applicable to all Orders in
Council passed froin time to time; but apparently the other course was pursued, of
passing an Order in Council naking applicable tie Interpretation Act contained

My honourable friend has argued
that these Orders in Council are equal to
an Act of Parliament.
If every Act of
Parliament has to be read with the Interpretation Act, and -if those Orders in Council are equal to an Act of Parliament, what
is the necessity for so saying?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
think any doubt bas arisen upon it. This
is manifest, that ýthere is an Interpretation Act included in our statutes, which
from time to tinte may be amended or may
be brought up to any period of time,
whereas an Order in Council making applicable the Interpretation Act would become
exhausted upon the declaration of peace. I
think it is quite manifest that, with an
Interpretation Act upon our statùte-books,
it is very desirable t'hat that should apply
and have full force and effect. That is desirable, not only ,as to the statutes contained in the body of our law, but also
as to all Orders in Council having the force
of statutes.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Then I think that the
effect of Iinese Orders in Council, unless
there are new Orders in Council extending
them beyond, the war period, would cone
to an end.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
My
recollection is that there is an Order in
Council providing that all commissions
appointed, or all officers charged with any
duties, shal be empowered to proceed to
the conipletion of the duties u.pon which
they have entered.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If we could get that
Order in Council it would throw light on
the question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
try to have all that information.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
DOMINION

BY-ELECTIONS

BILL.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second reading of Bill, 13, an Act to
amend the Dominion By-Elections Act,
1919.
He
said: Honourable gentlemen, we
legislated last session upon this subject,
and in doing so we apparently failed to
give effect to a provincial statute wbich
is in force in British Columbia by which
there is a disqualification attaching to all
Orientals in that province. The object of
Hon .Mr. BELCOURT.

the Bill is to give effect to the provincial
statute, as to the qualification of voters
in that province.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, this is a measure which affects
peculiarly the province from which I
come. When we were discussing the Bill
of last session, if my memory serves me
aright, I pointed out to the honourable
leader of the Government and to this House
that this very difficulty was going to occur.
We have always had in British Columbia,
rightly or wrongly, this provision in our
provincial laws-I think, on the ground
that these people are not really qualified
to understand the conditions under which
the Government of this country is carried
on, That is probably a good provision.
My honourable friend has said that this
Bill will apply to Orientals. It will apply
to Indians also.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not understand that this affects any other province
than British Columbia.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
NATURALIZATION BILL.
SECOND

READING.

Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 14, an Act to amend
the Naturalization Act, 1919.
Honourable gentlemen, last
He said:
session, in dealing with tbe Naturalization
Act we gave exclusive jurisdiction to the
County Court in Ontario to receive appliIt seerms that
cations for naturalization.
during the last fifty years the Court o
General Sessions cf the Peace in Ontario
had power to entertain applications for
natutralization. The withdrawal of authority fromo that court was unintentional, and
if is proposed by this Bill to reinstate the
autbority which they bad fornerly. That
«s the object of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Having had sone
experience il the Court of General Sessions
of the Peace I know how desirable it is
that it siould have the power to grant
naturalization certificates. As a roatter of
fact, I think that the Court of General Sessions of the Peace in Ontario has granted
far more certificates of that sort than the
Superior Court. 1t is generally to the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace that
application is made for naturalization.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

TBREATY,0F PEACE BILL.
FURTHER DIS3CUSSION ON THE MOTION
FOR THE) SECOND READIN(G-DEBATE
ADJOURNED.

The Senate resumed fromn October 1 con.
sideration of the motion for the second
reading of Bill 3, -an Act'for carrying into
effect the Treaty of Peace between His
Majesty and certain other Powers.'
lion. R. «.T POPE: Honourable gentlemen of the Senate, I do not anticipate
adding anything new to the discussion on
this Treaty, which is o! world-wide'importance, but 1 would ask as a personal gratification the indulgence of! this House in
order that I may express certain opinions
whiçh I possess In reference to it.
We heard yesterday a discussion by the
honourable member from De Lanaudière
<Hon. 'Mr.
Ca8.grain).
I had anticipated that after his overseas trip he would
have brought back some intelligence regarding the issue. J listened attentively
to bis remnarks witb regard to the League
of Nations; and, 'while, he put the
case of the last League very well, he
did not do it as weil as is done
in a magazine article appearing in the
August issue of the Nineteenth Century,
which gees into fuller detail on this subject.
While it is interesting readinga, as ail historical writings are, yet, we have arrived
ot a period at which the world proposes te make history for itseif, irrespective
-)! the precedents o! the past. That
is true not oniy iWith reference te the League
of Nations, but also in the administration
of public aff airs in 'Canada and elsewhere.
,Precedents -which lwere absolute guides for
us to foliow ten years ago have been set
aside, and for many good reasons, and today we are to start forward te build for
thefuture, upon the new foundations of a
broader, more comprehensive democracy in
which is recogniized the equàlity o! man.
I listened te the remarks of the honourable
mnember fromn Hamilten (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) with very deep interest; and,
wvhile niot agreeing with him altogether, I.concur in much o! wbat he said. I noticed
that hie disturbed one of the traditions o!
this House, that is, the Big Four who sit
to your left, Mr. bSpeaker, and 1-who are
supposed to possess the legai knowledge of
this Senate. 'He actualiy got them into a
discussion, which I would almost coùsider
a greater violation than a violation o! the
Blritish North America Act. These legai
iiide are acute. We need.them, but we do
xiot always need them for the purpose of
splitting hairs. We will admit that it is
6-7

97

their privilege to spiit a hair once or twice,
but when they try to make it finer than
that, their efforts lose their effect, whether
in this House or any other place.
Honourabie gentlemen have referred te
the British North America Act. That is hiot
a niew document. It is not my intention
to read it fronr start to, finish, but 1 find
iii section 18 the wordýs, " privileges, iinunities, and powers." I do not think the
legal gentlemen in this bouse make a
sufficient distinction between privileges and
powers. There can be no question o! the
powers o! the King of England in certain
directions, as was both stated and contradicted by honourable gentlemen yesterday.
The King bas- the power to deciare war with
or without the consent o! his advisers; but
no sane monarcli such as occupies the
Thronie o! Engiand to-day wouid tbink o!
utilizing that power te declare war without
tlie approvai br consent o! bis advisers.
The powers that we here possess are supposed to be limited by the British North
Amieri.ca Act to those " enjoyed and exercised by the Commons bouse o! Parliament
of the United Kingdom of Great Britaîn
and Ireland at the passing of this Act."
If we were te look at-the powers and privi,
leges exercised by the Parliament of Great
Britain and Ireland te-day, as compared
with those which they exercised when that
Act was passed, we twould flnd only a few
fundamientals left. Tha British Parliament

should have imagined that the honourable
member who bas just returned from overseas (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) would discover
somewhere in his travels, either in England
or on the continent, the high opinion of
Canada entertained over there-the recognition of the fact that Canada, through enjoying privileges and freedom under this
Act, did go forth to battle without awaiting

thought that when the honourable gentleman returned we would have heard from
him to that effeot; but, instead of that, unfortunately, owing to party entanglements,
that spider's web which you cannot see
by looking over there, but which you
realize every time certain honourable gentlemen arise to speak, wrapped itself about
him and brought him back into line; so he
said what he did say.
Lloyd George, as Prime Minister of England, endorsed by every leading statesman
of England, announced that we would be
called to the councils of peaqe-that we
would be consulted in the negotiation of
the Peace Treaty; and, honourable gentlemen, we were called. Moreover, the Prime
Minister of Canada insisted that we should

honourable gentleman has said, "You cannot make w.ar." We do, notý want to make
war; what we w'ant to make is peace; that
is whiat we stand for, and that is the reason
why we made those tremendous sacrifices
on the fields of Flanders-not for w'ar, but
for peace. To say that such a self-governing country as Canada did net avail itself

half of the continent of America.
Again, some honourable gentlemen make
light of the League of Nations; not they
alone, bqt also newspapers, magazine
writers, philosophers-the odds and ends of
humanity.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE:

Preachers.

Hon. Mr. POPE: And preachers. Well,
-honourable gentlemen, let us for a moment
review it. This ie not the first Treaty of
Peace, and I do not believe it will be the
last, although I hope it will be. Previously,
when Treaties of Peace were arranged in
Europe-for that is where the important
treaties of the world have been agreed to
Hon. Mr. POPE.

and signed-the monarchs were practically
all upon their thrones. You had the German
Emperor, the Czar of Russia, the King of
Greece, the Emperor of Austria-Hungary,
and so on; and when this treaty was signed
there was not a single person representing
any of the various empires or nations who
could be held responsible for the carrying
out of the terms of the treaty. But to-day;
honourable gentlemen of the Senate, those
monarchs are practically all wiped off the
face of the earth. Instead of them, we have
these diplomats who form the League of
Nations and who have fixed the national
boundaries. We have there, though not in
a permanent condition, various forms of
Government, whatever they may turn out
to be. It would be impossible to-day to
make a Treaty of Peace on the lines on
whieh treaties were made 50 years ago.
To have gone to war and not to have made,
in conclusion, some agreement whereby the
peace of Europe could be insured and territorial lines of demarcation could be fixed,
would have been to waste in that

adians and millions of other lives.
Therefore I say, Sir, wIhether the League
of Nations is to be wha-t is prophesied for
it-and I hope it will be-or whether it is
not to consummate eternal peace, it is
well for these emperors, for these fallen
dynasties, for the world, that some organization bas been created that may deal
with it with some hope at least that a
peace of permanency may be established.

Hon. Mr. POPE: When I said that I forgot you, Sir, which shows the longevity
,of the peace of Halifax. The honourable
middle member for Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Roche) said that he felt himself wandering
around in a maze, and that he would like
te know the written law by which Canada
became a nation; he would like to see the
statute. Who could make a statute?.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I beg pardon; I did
not say that. I said that I wanted to see
the sanction ,and the authority. Now, quote
my words, please.

That is an authority 'which he 'will not

But nationhood is not, the resuit of -a

in that direction until we occupy to-day

who do not want us te grow too rapidly. We are occupying to-day in this

among the classical people, among the real
people, a position of nationhood, if yen
se like to call it, that was never occupied
before in our history. So we should. Canada
made the sacrifice. Slhe made it openly
and aboveboard. If we had not had the
representatives at the Peace Table, whether
Mr. Sifton or M.r. Doherty or sme other
ýman or *men, to represent us, gentlemen
on the other Bide o! the House would have
been the first to cry out. I have read their
magazines in which. they dictated articles;
1 have read their papers. They laughied
at the idea of Canada having members o!
its Cabinet at the Peace Table. They said
that Downing Street haed alwaye been a
bugbear te them. Why, Sir, they do not
know that there bas been a change in
Downing Street. They do not know that
we have told Downing Street in the last
five years things that they never knew
before. We have net only told them, but
we have demonstrated in the field o! battle
and in the field of commerce things that
Downing Street neyer thouglit of. They do
not 'fully realize, Sir, that before -this Treaty
of Peace was signed, before the League of
Nations was thouglit of, euT representative,

In the first place, the British Empire han
a greater population than the United States.
The British Empire lias a population in
round figures'o! 400,000,000; the United
States lias a population o! 100,000,000. In
the next place, we made the greater sacrifice in the war. The northern hlii of this.
continent made a greater sacrifice than the
other half. 'Some honourable gentleman
says, in -re!erring to 'the British Empire,
"But you are taking in India." Yen, we
are taking in a possession that sent ever
nearly a million o! soldiers and paid every
dollar o! their expenses and lent the Allis.
millions of money besides to carry on the
war. 'But, the 'United States say, they are
dark people. "Yes," I say to them, "but what
-about your negroes, what about your percentage of dark men whom you will not
allow to go into the same churcli with you.
whom you will not allow to worship the
samne God in the saine edifice, whom you

100

SENATE

awill not allow in the sarne train with you,
and will not allow in the sane schools?
Surely, under these conditions you do not
call yourselves one hundred millions of
people."
Under these circunstances, considering
the sacrifices that we have made; considering that -ve went over there more than
three years before they did, and that our
soldiers held the fort with the French and
the British and the other Allies, have we
no rights? We kept the trenches. We
waited for three long years for the people to
the south of us to be intelligently informned
that there was a great war in Europe, and
at last they came-and I am going to give
tlen credit for coming. I am going to say
that the great moral effect upônthe French
arny of the arrival of the American troops
in France was wonderful. They iad been
suffering double sacrifices day by day. It
was a discouragement to the German people
and to the Gerinan army when the
Anericans arrived, ntostly in British
they could not walk.
boats-because
They were

welcomed,

not as a fighting

force in the trenches and in the front
line; but the American nation never
can claim to have won the war. We were
glad to see thein there for the reasons that I
have mentioited. The British Empire, vith
a population of 400,000,000, whether darkskinned or white, sent men to the battleline and sent them early, and made the
sacrifice; and ·therefore we have the
right to greater representation at the Peace
Table if we denand it.
It is well that there sbould be two voices
It is better
fron this great continent.
that there should be two foris of Government on this great continent; it is wise, and
in the best interests of everybody. If- we
bad not two voices on this continent, we
would not have had an arny where it was
wanted at the right time. Two opinions
are better than one, and 1 believe that as
tine goes on the Amnerican people will
come to realize that that is true.
Now, we arrive at the point of progress.
The war is ended to a very large extent.
We are now starting on for the future.
Shall it be a forward movement or a backward one? Shall we have qualified patriotism or whole-hearted patriotism? Whichever is best in the interests of this country
should prevail.
Sone gentlemen, not onily in this louse,
but outside of it fear the future. They seen
to be afraid of the great resiponsibility that
we are about to assume. But, honourable
gentlemen, the responsibility is only such
Hon. Mr. POPE.

as it was made possible for us to assume by
the sacrifices of the boys at the front. We
are not assuming a responsibility given to
us by Parliament. We'are assuming a responsi'bility given to us by reason of the
sacrifice made by the boys at the front, and
by reason of the position in which they
placed Canada in conparison with the other
fighting nations of the world.
Now, I say to this House, and to this Parliament, and to all the Parliaments of Canada: " If you are afraid to stand up and
take your position and fill the place made
for you, you should go, and we should go,
and we should not stand on the order of
our going." The sacrifices made for us on
the field of battle mean more than is signified to-day. You have unrest everywhere
to-day, but frorn that unrest will -come a
consolidation of strong public opinion, and
that public opinion, if Canada is to advance
as she wisbes to advance, will demand progress, broader lines of trade, and recognition of the position that was made
for us. The nations who stood forenost in the great struggle and who
won the greatest recognition were thos'e
the
nations that had developed to
greatest possible extent their resources,
their manufacfures, and their commerce.
Gernany beld the world at bay because
she lad done that. England sent over a
small army, but was able to withstand the
shock. Our people worked not only in
the trenches but also at home, for we had
developed our commerce; we had a national
policy which had created industrial prosperity and made it possible for us to send
to the allied armies munitions of inestimable value, manufactured by our own people, who bad never manufactured munitions
before; and they manufactured them as
well as any other country furnishing munitions, and as cheaply. So, honourable gentleimen, industrial life means not only developmtent in time of peace, but also protection of the liberties of the world.
Under these circumstances, I say it behooves Canada to realize that, with the
mtagnificent resources that nature has given
lier, if she is to occupy the place which this
Treaty bas given lier, she must follow no
narrow policy. If we are to become within
fifteen years the nation which the world
expects us to be, as compared vith our
present small populations, we must adopt
a broad policy-for that purpose if for no
other. I need not describe the resources
of this country. It is well known that they
are unlimited. But natural resources are

OCTOBER 2, 1919
of little avail unless you have the courage
to adopt a policy for the development of
them. Take the case of Mexico. I venture
to say that there is no territory of the
saine size in the world as wealthy in natural
resources-in its soil, its minerals, etc.as Mexico. But, because she has not followed a policy of development, because she
has not adopted the fundamental things
that have made for the progress of the
world, namely, industry and transportation,
Mexico stands lowest in the list of nations.
It has been proven beyond doubt that the
foundation upon which civilization has been
built is industry and transportation.
Take Central Europe. When a battle
was fought there 100 years ago, an army
of 150,000 or 200,000 was considered an immense army. The areas are the same today as then. There is no new-found land;
it is all the saine; but the population has
continued to increase, and in the last five
years there was gathered together an army
of millions to fight on that same ground
where hundreds of thousands were fighting
as great armies a century ago. Why has
that become possible? Because of econamic and industrial development and the
development of transportation. The result
has been that it is now possible for ten
men to live where only one man lived
before.
If we are to grow and to occupy the place
which I believe we sh3uld occupy, then
I say we should look forward to unlimited
markets. We have only two industrial centres in the Empire: one is Canada and
one is England. There are 400,000,000 of
people to cater te under our own flag. Why
not have the freest possible trade and development, industrial and otherwise, within the British Empire in order that we may
expand, in order that our industries may
grow, in. order that we may manufacture
more cheaply at home the products required by our own people, and that we
may draw more closely together the ties
which soma honourable gentlemen in this
House, and persons outside of this House,
cannot undierstand. It is almost impossible
to describe in the English language that
bond which unites the various parts of the
great Empire to which we belong. It was
a puzzle, a surprise, to the Kaiser of Germany, and it is à surprise even to ourselves. It is indescribable, but we have
inherited it, we are maintaining it, and it
is producing resulte.
Reference is made to Article 10 of the
Peace Treaty. Article 10 says that if the
political independence or the territory of

101

any of the Associated Powers who are signatory to this Treaty is threatened, then
the other signatories will come forward to
its defence. Who objecte to that? But some
honourable gentleman says, "Oh, but it
will involve you in all the wars of Europe."
Honourable gentleman, this world is tied together by commerce and electricity and air
communication more closely than ever before, a:nd we in. this northern half of the
continent of America cannot sit down and
refuse te take our sihare of world responsibility whether the nation t9 be defended
be a big or a little one. The peace of the
world is as much to us as it is to any of
the central powers of Europe, and we are in
duty bound, whether we like it or whether
we do not like it--we are in duty bound
as a member of the brotherhood of nations
to take our share of responsibility by contributing men and money to defend and
perpetuate the civilization of the world.
I observe that there is to be an Assembly
as well as a Council. This question was
dealt with by the legal gentlemen yesterday. The Assembly is to be the talking
place just like this Chamber, while the
Council is executive, to put into force what
has been decided upon after discussion and
has been hahded; down to the Council. The
Council must be unanimous. That is, in
my estimation, its weakness. The Assembly may have a majority, but the Council
Well, honourable
must be unanimous.
gentlemen, to eay that the responsible
men of the world represtnting the highest and best in our civilization, who
are gathered together in Europe, or
anywhere else, and who bear the terrible
responsibility which rests upon every
nation they represent, are not going to be
discreet and wise and are not going to do
their best to avert war, would mean an
attempt to borrow trouble from a source
where it is not to be found. Man is a
troublemaker hilmself.
Not only is it
guaranteeed that -the Coundil shall not
exercise any power unless the members
are unanimous, but it has behind it the
promise of those powerful natiens that they
will give effect to the orders of the Council.
Why should they not? The Council would
not be worth anything more than the visit
of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) overseas df it did not have that
power and authority of the best nations
of the world behind it, to warrant them in
imposing an order upon any nation that
undertook to transgress beyond reasonable
limits. I see nothing objectionable in that,
or in the fact that the Assembly is formed
by representation of all the nations, whil

SENATE
the Council Is flot. But somebody who
wants to say .something objects: "Why, we
shall neyer be there; England will be
there." Then the next minute he says:
-It will always be necessary for England
to be there." Well, then, if it is always
necessary for England to be there, why
should we be there? It is the Empire that
will be represented.
But, honourable gentlemen, 'e have hiad
great questions before us in days gone by.
I remember the Behring Sea question. Who
prepared the brief in the Behring Sea question? Charles Tupper, afterwards knighited
as Sir Charles Tupper. Who ivent as one
of our representatives? Sir John Thoînpson.
Who ivas at Washington years before that
as one of the deleg-atcs tram England P Sir
John A. Macdonald. Time and time again,
long age, wh.en little was knuwn of Canada,
our representatives were delegated to undertake high responsibilities in other lands
than this. Tborelore it is not true to say
that we shall not be represented.
It is equally untrue to say that this is
a bad bargain. It is the best that could
be made by the delegates at the Pea.ce Conference in the few months that they wvere
there. It is not correct to say that the rel)resentation in the League of Nations xviii
flot be broadened. Thiere is a provision for
broadening the membership ef the Assembly,
and it may be remodelled in manv ways in
the interests of peace. Let us have faith.
Oh, ye of little faitît "-have faith.
lion. Mr. DOMVILLE: In what?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Ilave faitb in the Empire and lu the erninent nien wvho stand for
hig.h ideals.
I arn glad to observe also in this Treaty
of Peace that there is a special place for
the honest labourer of the wo.rld. In this
Treaty of Peace bie occupies a new position.
1 arn glad also to be informed on undoubted
authority that the deleg-ates troni Canada,
led by tlie Right Hon. Sir Robert Bordien,
xvere the prineipal agents lu giviiig the
men of labour a place in the world's
Treaty.
Thiat carnies with it a great
responsibility on the labour men. Just as
C.anada's representation places on Canada
a greater responsibility, iso the representation of labour places a greater responsibility on labour, and labeur must rise
equal to its responsîbilities. Labour men
mnust appreciate ýthat they have the saine
rights, the samne oppertunities and benefits, tromn the world's Peace Treatv as
have the capitalista or any others. I am
x ery sympathetie with labour-so mîuch so
Hon. -Mr POPE.

that I have been calleil socialistie in ny
views. If, 20 years ago, or leess, I liired a
man with a wife and a family at $1 or
$1.25 a day and said to that inan, "Go to
work, feed your family, clothe themn, send
your cldren to sehool, and pay your
bills," I did not think that man had any
advantage over the ýslaves who had no bis
te pay. Tijat was rny opinion and it is
my opinion stili.
But that does not mean that labour has no
limitations upon t.he aiouint it may charge
for its daily efforts. The mnoment thiat ]ab( tir
charges more than its efforts are worth,
labour gets out of exnployrnent and goes eut
o! business. 'That is bad net only for labour,
but aIse for every indusitry in the Dominion
of Canada, or the country to which that
labour belongs. Capital lias to be protected
or it will flot invest. A Conference teok
place, I understand, in this ýChamber during our recess, and at that Conference capital was represented on one side and labour
on the other. If I had the management of
that, I would have mixed up the niembers.
I would bave put first a labour delegate,
then a capitalist, ýthen another labour man,
and se on. I xvould not have allowed thein
to sit on opposite sides. That la net, goed.
I tell yen, the hu-man touch is absolutely
supenior -to any resolutions yen may pass.
I do not think it was right to allow labour
and capital te separate as t.hey did. However, that Conference is a c&mnmenceînent.
Capital must distinctly understand that it
can ne longer drive the man to the machine.
That cannot be done. The man who goes
to work goies intelligently, andl capital mus-t
understand, from this day torward, 'thiat al
rnen are born equal, and if they live rigbteous, decent lives and fulfil their duties, as
citizenýs, they are entitled te, some reward in
this xvorld before they pass over te the great
inajority.
I flnd, honourable gentlemen, that other
people are thinking of us. I was reading
some rernarks of Sir Charles Parsons, President et the Britishi Association for the Advancement, of Science, in which he said in
part:
During the present treuil of development in
harnessing water-power and using up the fuel
resources of the wonld, oue canoot but realize
that, failing new and unexpected dikcoveries

in science, the great position of EnglanC cannot

be maintained for an indefinite period. At seme
time, more or lesa remote, and long before the
exhaustion or our coal, the population will
gradually migrate te those ceunitries where natural resourcea and energy are abundant.

A gentleman who is making a scientifie
study, with men and money at bis disposaI,
in looking- over the world te ascertain where

.OCTOBER 2,1919
are the most attractive places, speaks
ai our 20,000,000 horse-power, of which
about 2,000,000 horse-power is developed.
Well, 20,000,000 is, enough, but if lie
wante it we eau give him 40,000,000.
If he wantB the great-est untouched forests
in the centre of the world, lie will find them
here. I-f he wants the greatest miner-ai
zones in the centre of the worid, he will find
±hem here. If hie wants the greatest fishery
resources in the world, he will find them
heme. If he w.ants the best agricultural
land in the world, hie will find it Jaere ini
the Dominion of Canada. It is capable of
sustaining a population twice as large as
that ci ail Engl.and or the British Isles.
He says that these young men of enterprise,
af keen spirit, sons of rich men aind wellinformed men, will mnigrate to that country.
Another man, somewhere else, says that
-for the future the centre of the Empire,
England, is not go sale -as it used to be
before the aubmarin-e and the airerait, and
that the capital of the great Empire is no
longer safe. I hope that is not true; but,
honourable gentlemenm, if it is, if the centre
of this Empire is not sale in London, then
I say, we have Jaere one-haif of a continent
belonging to the Btitisb people, and they
cari plant their new capital -in Canada,
where it will be sale from molegtation, safe
from atarvation, and will not be crippled
oy being un-able to obtain fuel or power,
dndependently.
But soinebody says, "Oh, but you will
have jealousies." There are no jealousies
in the face of a great calamity. Jealousies
disappear; they are wiped out. If the time
ever arrives when England feelj that. the
capital ai the Emipire ia not sale in England,
it can be transferred here ta Canada.
True, honourable gentlemen, there will be
nane of -us. living. But we are nat living
Io-day for to-day's sake. If we are here for
any purpose, it is for the future ai Vhls
country; it is ta guide the development of
Canada so that she inay become the greatest
of ail the possessions under the British
-flag.
Somebody said yesterday that we shall
be fit for independence. Honourable gentie-men, 'we shall neyer be fit for mare
independence thanr we possess ta-day. We
have absolute autonamy in the matter ai
,civil rig.hts; we have absolute riglits in
regard ta trade and commerce. We are
independent in our criminal law and every-thing else. When the population of this
country is 100,000,000 mwe shall recognize
that the great centre of this Empire 'was
England . that England made it possible

for us ta become great; that she cast round
us, when we were in aur infancy, the power
ai bier fleet and hier armiesf; that she took
care ai us like a baby in the ýradle until
we grew up ta manhoad and became even
greater than aur sires.
Under these circumnstances, bonourable
gentlemen, I know of no reasan why we
should -falter or hesitate-why ve should
think for one moment that in the League
ai Nations or in any other arrangement,
Canada is nat going ta be represented by
Canadians; and I know ai no reasan under
the sun why -we could not legitimately
aspire ta being some day the central figure
in the greatest Empire that the -world lias
ever know.
Hon. JAMES DOMVILLE: Hlonourable
gentlemen, I admire very mucli the warlike
spirit ai my honourable friend. It calls up
-the spirits froni the vasty deep." But 18 it
necessary ta -call them up? Accordixîg ta
niy ideas, Canada lias done well. The question now isasý ta the ratification ai the
Treaty. We may fairly ask, 'wby did not
Newioundland sigri, and why are we called
upon ta sigu a blank cheque? We have been
told that it wauld be seditious not ta sigui,
and na sedition would be allowed. Then
we had ta back down; we were afraid ai the
tower-althaugh At is burned down, 1 believe. While we should honouTably and
layally carry out what is required af us, I
think we should have a higher ambition,
and the spirit I should like ta see promulga-ted iu Cana-da is not the warlike spirit.
That is ail riglit when it is needed especially
wlieu it is remunerative. By this figlit
Canada bas lost very little in maney, but
she bas logt mucb in tbe lives ai bier people.
I do not propose ta take up xnuchi af
your time; but -I would like ta state my
vîew. I wauld rather see Canada, thîrough
ber legislators, follow tbe great principle
laid down by the Master-peace and gaod
will ou earth-peace not at the point of
the bayonet, but with liberty. We should
be daing something higher than justiiying
fighting and saying that we are ready ta
fight again. I am -for peace; I am for
haviug a happy Canad%; I am for making
this country a happy home for its people
and for the imimigrante who coule here;
I' am for the education ai the. children,
-and for teaching them the difference between riglit*and. wrang, whatever their denomination may be. I thiuk we sbauld

Canada bas doue its work nobly, there
is no-question about it, and we may prob-

ably be called upon again. But I look
upon this continent as entirely apart from
Europe. On this continent there are two
great Anglo-Saxon peoples, one in the
North and one in the South. Those in the
North have, I think, a better climate and
a hardier constitution. Look at Quebec. It
was the old settlers in that province who
opened up this country. They were the
people who made Canada; it was not our
present generation, but the French voyageurs with their clergy. Yet at times we
are inclined to find fault with the
province of Quebec, and we
aise the
question of the clergy and all sorts of
questions. But that is not what I want.
I would rather see all living together, as I
said before, in comfort and harmony. Let
us build up the two great races here-one
in the North and one in the South. There
have been brought into this hemisphere
new blood and new traditions. The old
traditions came from the East into Europe.
The people of Europe have had their difficulties. Poland lias for a long time fought
for lier independence. We have been endeavourng as far as we could to clear up
the difficulties of the Danubian principalities, but we have not succeeded very far.
The net result of the peace deliberations of
the English and the French-whom we have
been riinning down-and Italy and the
United States is that we are endeavouring
to forn an alliance that may preserve peace
anong those eastern races. Be that as it
may, we in Canada have nothing to do with
the East; we have nothing to do with the
traditions of Constantinople or of Greece.
We are not concerned in what they do. We
nust bear in mind the fact that we have
here two Anglo-Saxon peoples who must be
educated and trained, and who must lie
guided by good example, but not in the
warlike spirit. We have done with fighting.
Let us sea that both political parties and
tþe people of the whole country do what is
best in the interests of .the Dominion. If
Canada is to become noble, if Canadians
are to becomîe a great race, Canada must
by its actions set an example to the rest of
the world. That is what we want. There
have been too many disgraceful episodes
all round, but I shall not discuss then, for
I do not wish to throw dirty water on anybody. But let us eradicate the evils that
exist. There should be a new Canada. Let
the Liberals go, and let the Conservatives
go. Let there be a new party whose aim
shall lie to inake the country prosperous
and happy, and to set an example to the
rest of the world, and not to put us down
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

on a footing with Bulgaria, Roumania, or
,Serbia.
We have in Canada, as my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Po5e) has said, great
natural resources that will make Canada a
great nation in the future. Let our publia
imen-teachers, preachers, or whoever they
may be-imîîpart to the rising generation a
knowledge of the difference between right
and wrong. That would be a noble object,
instead of the heroics of olden days. We
have on this continent fresh blood, and
newer ideas, and let us establish here a new
race, that our children may be able to say
that their fathers legislated in their interests, and tauglt themn that might is not
right.
I am now speaking to the country. I want
every inan who desires to do right to listen
to my words. We in the Senate are now
passing this Bill, as we must do, although
we know very little about it. If we were
to say anything against it, we sliould be
considered unpatriotic. The best tihing that
we can do is to pass it. If there is no oither
effect, our statesmîen who went to Europe
have come back wvith gilded wings, and
they look on Canada, not as they did whien
as boys they weore following the plough,
or soinething else. They have gone overseas, and have coie hack showing learning
and feeling their superiority as statesnen
and as Canadians. They are willing to
reward anybody in Canada who plays the
gaine of holding up the flag.
We iay have to figlht anywthere in the
world, althongh we may not be directly
concerned. There should be a federation
of all the British colonies-if you choose
to call thei so. Those banded together
should be strong enough to set at naught
any nations or any conbination.
Canada
should be strong enough to do what is
right. Our great difficulty is that there
have been too many questions about French
and Englisih and Irish. All those disputes
should disappear.
We should remember
that France made Canada; France sent
over to Quebec her besst blood-and the
good work they did
was
improved
upon by others who came afterwards.
To-day we -are fighting on the side of
France, and for France; we are fighting, no
doubt, in order that by our coalition with
that great nation and the United States
we may bring about woreld peace. For the
moment the situation is quiet; but if anybody were to tell me that war is over, I
should doubt it very much. How can war
be over? Prior to 1914 we thought there

them. Then we shall arrive at the proper
conclusions.
What is a nation? "Nation" is synonymous with "nationality." We know there
may be half-a-dozen or two dozen or more
nations comprised in one state, and that
is the case with the British Empire. The
Empire composed of the British Isles,
India, Canada, and the rest of the Domin.ions and colonies, is one state, in which
we fnd many nations. What is a state?
A state is an organized community possessing sovereign power independently of ,
and being

in this House or anywhere who would
seriously argue for one moment that proper
language as being used in describing Canada
as a nation, meaning thereby a state. We
are not a state. We are a nation, one of
the many nations forming the British Enpire; but we are not a state, and, unless
and until we obtain power to make treaties
directly with other nations, ve .shall not be
a state, se recognized by other states. Of
course, they will not treat with us unless
they do recognize us as a sovereign state.
Hon. ,Mr. SCHAFFNER: Would the honourable gentleman give us a definition of
" nation"? He has given us a definition
of a state.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think the most
apt way to describe a nation is to say what
a nation is, and I cannot do it any better
than by saying " nation " is synonymous

with " nationality." Take, for instance, the
French people: France, as distinct from
Great Britain, is one nation composing one
state. There is only one nation, or one
nationality, in France: it is the French
people; and the French republic is a state.
But in the British Empire, te which we
belong, there are many nation's, but there
is only one state.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: I am afraid we are
.down to hair-splitting now.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Here is another
honourable gentleman objecting to my giving names their proper significance. He
calls it hair-splitting. Of course, if we may
not do that, if we are going to continue
talking in a loose way, or indefinitely, in
discussing very nice questions, such as the
present one, we shall go wrong. My honourable friend is the last man who
.should object that we are hair.splitting
in discussing a matter of this kind. He is
himself a litterateur, a man knowing both
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

languages thoroughly, and who prides himself on that knowledge. I think he is the
last man who should take any one to task
for giving words their proper significance.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: I was answering the
remark of the honourable gentleman when
he said that we on this side were hairsplitting.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend agrees with me.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: I was simply sending the ball back were it should go.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend did not quite follow what I said.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I do not desire to
interrupt the honourable gentleman; but,
while he is defining the difference between
"nations" and "states" would he also give
us his views as to the difference between a
nation and a colony. I gathered from arguments advanced on the other side of the
House yesterday that Canada is not a selfgoverning nation, but she occupies rather
the status of a colony, and that is wbere
I would like to sec the distinction drawn.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: "Nation" and
"colony" are not terms that have any relation to one another; they are distinct and
different terms, and are applicable to distinctly different things. But it is rather difficuit for me to understand exactly what my
hnnourable friend means. If he asks me
whether I look upon Canada as a colony
or not, I would say yes, it is a colony:
Canada is oe of the colonies of Great
Britain.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is where
we differ.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There are different
kinds of colonies, and the definition I am
making bas been recognized all along
as the constitutional one. There is the
colony, there is the Crown colony, and
there is the colony vhclh is even lower
than the Crown colony, which has no goveanment Of its own, but is wholly and
conpletely adninistered from London. We
ire a self-governing colony-an autonomous
colony.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Does the honourable gentleman see any difference between
that and a self-governing nation?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course, a selfgoverning nation is recognized as such by
the rest of the states, as a self-governing
state is recognized as such by the other
sovereign states of the world. We cannot
inake anv treaties.

OCTOBER 2, 1919
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Yes, we can. We have
nmade treaties.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I say we have
no power or authority to make any treaty.
It is true that on one or two occasions-for
instance, in -the case of the treaty made
with France--we were allowed to negotiate
the treaty ourselves;, but we had no power
to do so.
Hon. Mr. CROSsBY: What did Fielding
and iPaterson do
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Wait a moment.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I do not think the
lionourable gentlemran can enlighten any
of us by giving- us his ideas about the
meaningf of the word "nation" or anything
,of that 'kind.
Let him go on with hie
argrument.
Hon. Mr. CAS-GRAIN: The British Ambassador to France took part in that Treaty,
and he signed with Brodeur and Fielding.
The Blritish Amibassador did that, we did
net do it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think I ought
to be treated with a littie more politeness.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I was not intending
ta treat my honourable friend with anything but politeness; but there is no use
in bandying words acroas the floor, and if
iny honourable friend has a view different
from ours as to what is a colony or a na.
tion, let him go on and tell us what hie has
to Say.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But my honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMNeans) put to me a question, very politely,
and quite properly, and I answered it as
hest r couid; and why any honourable
mnember should find fault with me for
doing so is something I cannot understaud.
The other point I want to make with
iegard to this Treaty is that whether we
approve or do not appreve it makes
absolutely ne differeuce. And here again
I must call attention to the loose language
we have-been usiug- ini regard to that. What
the Parliameut of Canada is asked to do
iz not to ratify the Treaty: Canada ie calle<i
upon to approve it. The ratification has
been, macle by the Imperial Parlisament. The
Treaty has been ratified by Great Britain.
We are sinmply askçed to say whether wve
approve or disapprove; and whether we
approve or disapprove miakes abeolutely
ne difference whatever.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Why then are we
asked?

107

Hon. Mr. BELCOUIRT: If te-day the Parliament of Canada were to disapprove of the
Treaty the Parliament of Canada 'would be
bound by it to juet the Saine extent a if it
did approve, hecause the Treaty has been
ratified by GLreat -Britain, and that ratification je not only fooe the Britieh TIaes but
also for Canada, Australia, and the rfflt of
the Empire. And yet we have heard talk
about the uecessity for our approval, and
the statement that the Treaty will not
amount te anythiug se far as we are coucerned unless we do approve of it.
That is ail humbug. The Treaty dees exist
and will exist because Great Britain
has ratified it, and'we are bouud by every
provision contained lu it, not only with
regard te making- peace with Germany, but
also as members of the League of Nations.
By ratifying the Treaty Great Britain has
made us members of t he League, 'whether,
again I say, we approve or disapprove.
Another subject about which a good deal o!
misapprehieusion bas arisen is that 'which
concerns the workiýng of the machiuery devised for carryiug eut the provisions of the
Treaty. The work cf the League of Nations
is entrusted te an Assembly. AS signatoriea,
Canada and the rest of the Dominione, as
well as the Imperial authorities, are members of the Assem-bly. Canada 'will have its
representative in the Assembly and will
have the right of discussion and deliberation
and voting. Our reprosentative there Iwi11
have the right to take part iu the election
of four of the membere -whe will compose
the Council. The Council is the executive,
which, as was stated by, my honourable
friand fromn Com pton (Hon. Mr. Pope), is
the body which will administer the affairs
of the ILeague. The Council is composed o!
nine meinhers, llve of whom are represent 'atives of the five great pewers. They will permanently couetitute five out of the nine
members of the Council. The other four
members will be elected by, the 'whole Asseumbly. It is possible, but it is a mere possibility, and ise.certaiuly net a probability,
Eugland having already one member in the
Couneil, that it snay fall te the lot of
Canada te have a Canadian elected as oe
of the four. You must remember that there
will be in this Assembly the representatives
of thirty-two nations; aud it is net at ail
Iikely that a representative oi Can-ada wîll
be elected as eue of the four niembers of
the iCeuncil.
Now, let us ses just what le the corollary
of that situation. By approving the Treaty
we'become morally bound te do the things
which the Council may recemmend te the

SENATE

108

various members of the League to perform.
In other words, we give to the world,
through the League of Nations, a moral
undertaking to carry out those obligations
which we would otherwise, theoretically at
all events, be liable to perform at the ibehest
of the Parliament at Westminster. What I
mean is this: Whether we approve of this
Treaty, or do not approve of it, if the Council in a year or two should decide and
recommend to the British Empire to coniuute a certain number of men and a certain aiimunt of money towards putting down
an aggression uipon the territory of one of
the members of the League, we, as a comcould
the Empire,
part of
ponent
be theoretically-and I want to draw
honourable gentlemen's attention particularly

to

the

word

" theoretically "-

called upon by Great Britain to contribute
a share of the burden which the Council
might call upon the Imperial Government
to assume.
Let me illustrate in other words what, I
mean. Suppose that in two years the
Council should declare that, because Germany had again committed an aggression
upon French soil, Great Britain, should
contribute, say, a million men and a
certain sum of money-it does not matter
what-towards putting down this aggression
by one member of the League against the
territory of another member. Theoretically,
there is nothing to prevent Great Britain
from saying to Canada: "You, as a part
of the Empire, are called upon to côntribute
your share of this; your share will be 100,Theoretically
000 nen and $500,000,000."
Great Britain can do that, and we must
obey the law or rebel: there would be no
other alternative.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
against what?

Rebel

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Against the Empire-secede from the Empire. Otherwise
we would have to obey. My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has not
followed what I said. I say that if the
Council were to decree that Great Britain,
in the circumstances I have described,
must contribute a suin of money and a
certain number of men, then, theoretically,
Great Britain could apportion that contribution among the different parts of the
Empire, by legislation enacted at Westminster, and we would have to obey the
law or do the other thing-rebel.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Where
Hon. Mr. LYNOHSTAUNTON:
do you find that in the Treaty?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not find that
there. I am looking at the question from
the constitutional point of view. I know
the Constitution of this country, and that
is where I find it, and not in the Treaty.
We must interpret this Treaty and its
effects in the light of the Constitutions
under which we live-the Constitution of
the British Empire and our own Constitution.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But that
is not what you are doing.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: My honourable
friend does not agree with me. I am sorry,
but I cannot help it. What I am driving
as is thlis. By approving of this Treaty we
have taken upon ourselves a moral obligation to do that whicTi we are under constitutional obligation to do. That is what I
mean.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my honourable
friends will look a little more carefully at
the description of the signatories to this
Treaty, they will see there perhaps not
absolutely conclusive proof of what I say,
but very strong corroborative evidence.
How is the Empire described?-"His
Majesty the King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland and of the
British Dominions beyond the Seas, Enperor of India." There is the one state
which is the signatory; there are not
different states in the British Empire,
but just the one state, the British Empire.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me a question? In the
case of a difference between Great Britain
and the League Council, what will be our
position towards the Empire and our position towards thé League?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course, that is
quite a conceivable situation, although it is
hardly probable. One could imagine, for
instance, some difficulty between Great
Britain and the United States, and we
should have either to rebel-secede from the
Empire and join the American union in
their right, or else to fight against the
American republic. There would be no
alternative for us.
I asked my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton)
yesterday if the British Parliament could
not to-morrow wholly repeal the British
North America Act. My honourable friend

OCTOBER 2, 1919
is too good a constituti*na1 lawyer to have
denied the proposition .-,Hle said yes, that
the Parliament at Westminster could do it,
but they would flot do it. I agree with my
honourable friend. It is not at ail likelyit is I thinir, the last thing in the world that
would happen-for the British Parliament
torepealthe British North America Act.
Yet their power to do so is absolutely
undeniable. My honourable friqnd muet
admit that.
There le ainother matter which, I think,
we must try to put right, and I amn trying
to do so in my humble way, though I may
not be succeeding. 1 think tl4ese are vital
questions, which should elicit a declaration
of opinion from every member of Parliament. A good deal was said yesterday by
the honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton> and the honour.able gentleman fromt De Salaherry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) in regard to constitutional
.development. Now, I say, with ail due
respect, that those words -constitutional
-development" are a misnomer so far as
'Canada is concerned. They are not applicable to Canada at al they have no
place in Canada. You cannot talk of the
constitutional development of Canada for
the simple Ireason that we have a written
constitution. «"Constitutional development",
is a terni which, of course, has significance
in England, because the constitution of
«Great Britain is a constitution which is
madie front day to day: it is the people of
England, Scotland and Ireland, as represented 'ât Westminster, who daily make
thé British constitution. It is what the
'King decides upon, with the consent of the
iepresentatives assembled in the Houses
of Parliamnent at Westminster, that makes
the constitution. There, of course,- constitutional development is recognized. We al
know in what it consists--simply in tihe
Ring having front timte to time to give up
-some of the royal prerogatives and in Parliament being vested with them. Every
ltime there has been constitutional development iA meant that the King had to yield
a littie more.
Hon. Mr. 'CASGRAIN: And the House of
Lords.
1-Hon. Mr. BELGOURT:
Constitutional
development in Great Britain is something
that we can understand; but constitutional.
development in Canada is something which
I, at ail events, cannot understand.
When we talkc about constitutional developmepit we must remember not only
what are our relations with Great Britain
front the constitutional standpoint, but

109

also w'hat are our relations among ourselves as memibers of the Canadian Federation. There are nine provinces in Canada, and any change in the British North
America Act would require not only an
Act of the Ixuperial Parliament, but also
the conisent of every one of flic nine provinces. What is the Federal Constitution?
Ie it anything else than a partnership
agreement arnong the original provinces
ivhich were autonomous provinces at the
tine, and those which have been taken in
Sirice?
You oannot change any partnership agreement without the consent of all partners. I
cen imagine what my honourable friend
froin -Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
would .say to me if, after making an agreement of partnership with hlm, I should
go to him within a week or ten- days
and talk
te
him o! constitutional
development, and ask him if, in the
light of things that had happened
since, our agreement should not be amended. There niight be a great many convincing reasons for amending it, but if I
were to assert that I had the power Wo
change that agreement because of subsequent events, I amn sure my bqnourable
frien-d would net accepýt my proposition.
And so it is with the federal pactr-the
partnership agreement hetween the provinces of Canada. We cannot talk of constitutional development which would mean
any serious change in the relations established not only between Great Britain and
ourselves, but aiso among ourselves as
members o! this Canadian Federation.
A great deai bas been said and repeated
about our improved statue, our increased
autonomy, and eo on. Well, I feul to sepin what respect our autonomy lias be-en
affected, either for better or for worse.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Neither
is i.
It is only being explained to be.
largaer.than we used to týhink it was.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot speak
as te what mny honourable friend used to
think.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Does r.ot the honourable gentleman think that, in the making
of commercial treaties, there has been
sorte deveiopment;' and that we realiy
have more power than we had before?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. We have not
one iota of power more than we had, but
we have been allowed by the Imperial Parliament te do certain thing-s which we could
net exact from the Imperial Pairliement.
In other words, we bave been allowed te

SENATE
negotiate, for instance, a treaty with
France. We had no power to do that and
could not insist on being allowed that privilege. That French treaty, for instance, bas
been denounced. Great Britain could now
say to us: "No, this time you will not negotiate the Treaty, but we shall do it ourselves." We have no more power now than
we had before.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Is not that in the
nature of constitutional development?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. It is not
constitutional development at all. It le
simply a recognition by the Imperial
authorities that we should be allowed to do
certain things which, under our Constitution, we have not the power to do. We
should not attempt to say anything more
than that.
Hon. -Mr. CASGRAIN: But the British
ambassador signed that French treaty
anyway, and then made it valid. They let
the children scribble behind them.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: One of the
reasons that I desired to take part in this
debate was in order that I might place
on Hansard, with little or no comment,
certain parts of the Treaty which Canada
is now called upon to approve, and which
bas been ratified by Great Britain, and, I
think, by Italy, and bas been approved by
Australia and New Zealand.
Hon. Mr. POWER: To-day's despatches
say by France.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: By France. The
Treaty containa provisions on which, by
giving it our approval, we place the stamp
of recognition. I want to call attention
particularly to the article contained in the
Treaty between the United States of
America, the British Empire, France, Italy
and Japan, and Poland, signed at Versailles
on the 28th of June. Among other things I
find in this Treaty certain articles which I
wish to place on Hansard. They are articles
8, 9, and 10, and they read as follows:
8. Polish nationals who belong to racial,
religlous, or linguistic minorities shall enjoy
the same treatment and security in law and in
fact as the other Polish nationals. In particular they shall have an equal right to establish,
manage and control at their own expense,
charitable, religious, and social institutions,
schools and other educational establishments,
with the right to use their own language and te
exercise their religion freely therein.
9. Poland will provide in the public educational system in towns and districts in which
a considerable proportion of Polish nationals of
other than-Polish speech are residents adequate
facilities for ensuring that in the primary
schools the instruction shall be given to the
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

children of such Polish nationals through the
medium of their own language. This provision
shall not prevent the Polish Government froin
making the teaching of the Polish language
obligatory in the said schools.
In towns and districts where there is a considerable proportion of Polish nationals belonging to racial, religious linguistic minorities,
these minorities shall be assured an equitable
share in the enjoyment and application of the
sums which may be provided out of public
ftinds under the state, municipal or other budget, for educational, religlous or charitable purposes.
The provisions of this Article shall apply to
Polish citizens of German speech only in that
part of Poland which was German territory on
August 1, 1914.
10. Educational committees appointed locally
by the Jewish communities of Poland, will, subject to the general control of the State, provide
for the distribution of the proportional share
of public funds allocated to Jewish schools in
accordance with Article 9, and for the organization and, management of these schools.
The provisions of Article 9 concerning the
use of languages in schools shall apply to these
schools.

Parallel with these articles I want to
record the following facts. In the province of Ontario, within the last few years,
the school trustees of school No. 14 of the
township of Lancaster, in the county of
Glengarry, were fined $500 each and costs
or in default imprisonment, for having permitted 45 French ohildren out of a. total
attendance of 47 pupils in that school to
be taught the Catechism in French for ten
minutes. In the city of Windsor the Department of Education of this province has refused to two schools-one in which 65 per
the children are French Canadians,
cent oRf
and another, in which they represent 85
per cent- the right to teach a single word
of French at any time on any subject. In
Plantagenet, within a short distance of
Ottawa, in the year 1914 or 1915, 1 am not
sure which, the Department of Education
refused a teacher permission to teach
French in a school where all the children
in attendance were French Canadians.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Shame; shame.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: During the past
six years, in contrast with what has been
done with Poland, the legislature of the province of Ontario has withheld fron the bilingual schools their share of the annual
grant voted for educational purposes. I
make no comment. I desire simply to place
these facts on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Très bien.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have only a
few more words to say. I am in every respect heartily in favour of the League of
Nations. I rejoice that at last the world
has found an opportunity of endeavouring

OCTOBEIR 2, 1919
te establish world peace. I may say Jor myself that when I was younger and had more
illue ions than I have to-day, I bail dreamed
of Canada as a British deînocratic Commonwealth practicing entirely the arts of peace
and ignoring altogether the arts of war. I
had hoped that the development of Canada's magnificent resources would flot be interrupted by war either within or without;
b'ut, like many othera, I received a rude
shock. We have passed through five years
of the worst wa'r that ever aiflicted the
wooeld and we had dieunion in our o'wn
land. I rejoice, let mie repeat, that the
time bas corne when the world at lest
realizes that pence is the only thing upon
this earth that îs woieth fighting for.
To show what a believer 1 have ail along
been in the desire to establish and maintain peace in the world, I may be permitted
to indulge ini Borne personal. reminiscences.
In the year 1906, on the flrst dey of the
session, in another'place, to which I then
belonged, I moved an address, the purpose
of which was that Ris Majesty King Edward and the Queen might be invited ta
visit Canada. My object in doing so, I may
explain, was that I had hoped and believed
that the coming of King Edward, the great
pSSsoeaker, toý Canada, would. also very
likely involve a visit on hie part to the
United States; and at that time the President of the American Republic was devoting a great deal of bis tirne, bis talents
and bis energies, Vo the establishment. of
world peace. It occurred to me that a
visit to Canada by the great King who had
done so niuch to bring about the entente
cordiale would perhaps lead Vo an extension of that entente cordiale, and we might
thereby obtain, what had been so long desired by the world at large- peace. I
therefore moved that Ris Majesty and the
Queen should be invited to visit Canada.
The address was passed unanimously and
with great enthusiasm, flot only ýby the
Gommons, but by this honouraible House
as well. I would like to be permitted Vo
read nome of the observations which I
then made in the Bouse of Commons-and
honourable gentlemen will bear in mind
that lthis was in 1906:
Mr. Speaker. since the visit of hlm Rayal
Hlghnees the Prince of Wales In 1860 ta Canada
and ta the great and friendly American iTepubio
ta the south prqved to be sa Interesting, so important,- na gratlfying, how much more ImPortant, how much more gratifying, hew much
more Int'eresting, haw much more pregnant
with lasting, wide, far reaching. great and
beneficent resuits would not b. to-day the presence of hlm. who has sinoe become the Sovereign of the British Empire, an this continent of

Ili

North Âmerica, whose progress and development have cause the admiration and wonderment of the universe and which has achieve<i
so much for the cause of democratic institutiorls and liberty.
When His Majesty ascended the Throne, Mr.
Speaker, who believed that the "entente cordiale," such as It existe to-day, was probable
or even possible? And If to-day the French
Republie and the United Kingdam of Great
Britain and Ireland and Its possessions all over
the world are found allied In such a close, such
a cordial, such a lasting alliance, It ls conceded
that it ls due mainly ta the wonderful tact, te
the ever unerring judgment, ta the genius, te
the Intense love of humnanity, and the earnest
desire for peace, of His Majesty. Have we not
good reason ta hope and ta believe, Mr. Speaker,
that Hia Majesty le net content ta rest on the
laurels, however great, which the world hans e
freely accorded ta hlm, and that His Majesty
will continue ta devote his genius an-i hie ailpowerful Influence In the cause of humanity
until he bas finally attained the realization of
that so long and so ardently cherished hope of
mankind, "peace and good will ta ai men."
And, Sir, may w. flot be permittefi aa ta
Indulge the hope and the belief that a visit 0f
Bis MaJeety, the noble King of England, to that
other nobyle and very distingulshed man and
statesman, the President ef the Uniteà States,
whose own efforts, whose own successes In the
cause of pence among the nations, have gained
for him likewise the gratitUde and, the admiration of the world, would affard an opportunity
and the Mans of rendering more Intimate and1
mare cordial even the relations which exist taday between the Amnerican Republic and our
Mother Country? Nay, Mr. Speaker, may we not
be permnitted to Indulge the hope and the bellot
that such a visit at tbis time would b. the
moans of enlarging the scepe of the entente
cordiale so as ta secure the mighty co-operation
of the United States of America In the accampllshment of Its great aim and its noble abject?
For if, Mr. Speaker,' we are able ta rejoice In

nand, for peace. Why, Sir, the very atmosphere
is to-day filled with that fragrant air of peace.
The noble King of England and the noble President of the United States have devoted them.selves to the cause of peace, they are both
thorough believers in, and have constantly and
with maintained success preached, the gospel
of peace. May we not to-day indulge in peace.
May we not to-day indulge in the hope that
their recent brilliant successes are but the
augury of universal peace in the very near
future? Some may think and some may say,
Mr. Speaker, that this is but a dreani, though
a very happy dream, still but a dream and an
illusion. My answer is that dreams are not un:frequently followed by realization, and that
what seems to-day to be an illusion to some
may to-morrow he turned into a reality; my
answer is that but a very few years ago the
entente cordiale was nothing but a dream, but
to-day it is a living and vigorous reality.
For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I have very
much pleasure, and I deem it a very great privilege and a very great honour to be allowed
to inove the resolution which I now place in
your hands.

This address, as I have said, was passed
by both Houses and received the strong
endorsation of every city in Canada,
and copies of the debates and the resolutions were sent over in the usual way to
tli Colonial Office. I doubt very much
that His Majesty King Edward ever saw
anything of them. I am afraid the matter
was strangled in the Colonial Office, whîere
unfortunately on so many occasions want

of vision lias prevented the right thing
from being dona. I lappened to be in
England shortly afterwards, and was told
by gentlemen whose principal occupation in life is to manufacture and,measure
red tape, that the thing was utterly absurdthat the idea of the King leaving his kingdom to make a visit to the different
Dominions and Colonies was absolutely
out of the question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He went to India
with his wife.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1e went not only
t India but ýalso to France and other counties, and if he coul.d go to foreign countries
why could he not come to parts of his own
country? However, that was not done. I
cannot help expressing my deep regret
-and this is the first occasion on which
I have permitted myself to do so-that
so little consideration was given at that
time to

the unanimous and enthusiastic

addresses voted by these two Houses.
I believe that if they had been heeded,
if King Edward ha.d been allowed by
his advisers to visit Canada and the
United States at that time, the horrible
war through which we have passed would
not have occurred. If Great Britain, France
.and the U'nited States had formed an alHon. Mr. BELCOURT.

liance in 1906 for the maintenance and preservation of peace, would Germany have
dared ta throw out the brand of war? I
say that if what Canada wanted at that
time had been doue, there is every reason
to believe that we should have averted the
horrible atrocities .and the incalculable
losses of the last five years.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Is the honourable
horrible atrocties and the incalculable
losses of the last five years.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite. Germany
was preparing for forty years, but Germany
would have hesitated a long time if Germany had known that the United States,
France, Great Britain and Japan had
formed an alliance for defensive purposes.
In spite of all the preparations she had
made, Gerinany would not have declared
war. I indulge in these personal reminiscenses, not for the sake of vain glory, but
for the purpose of convincing my honourable friends that when I say I am in
favour of this League of Nations I am
thoroughly sincere, as-I have been for many
years.
J have been all my life-and I do not
denv it-an advocate of peace: I always
have been a pacifist. "Si vis pacem, para
pacem," has been my motto.
I have
never admitted the m.axim, "Si vis pacem,
para bellum." Yet that did not prevent
me, when war was declared by Great
Britain against Germany, from at once and
thereaifter doing everything that lay in
myv power to help in Canada's war efforts.
I have been as strong for this war as any
body has been, simnply because I felt that
Canada owed a duty to the woTld, for this
was a war against war, as I have said on
many occasions.
My honourable friend froin Compton
(Hon. Mr. Pope) said this afternoon-and
this is one of the things in which I agree
with him -that, because or lier present position, because of ber aspirations, because
of what Canada hopes to be in the future,
she cannot consistently desinterest herself
to-day of world -affairs. The time is past
when we could play the part of isolation.
Canada hopes to be in a short time one of
the states of the world-one of the sovereign
states, perhaps, or at ail events one of tha
absolutely independent Dominions in the
British Empire. Whethe3r we are independent, or whether we romain as a component
part of the Empire, for nyself I cannot
see any alternative, for the' moment at all
events: we must take an interest in what
is going on in the world. We cannot dis-

OCTOBER 2, 1919
airs or conourselves of world af!
cernas. For that reason I arn heartily in
favour o! the League of Nations. And if
ever the occasion should arise-I pray God
it neyer may-the Canadian Parlament
should, be ready with its mvoney and iti
men to assi'st 'in prederving the peace of
the world. 1 believe that 'we are under
that obligation just~ as much as the nations
which have joined the League, and 'perhaps
we are under *a greater obligation and a
greater ineentive. R[ ls only by refusing
to bave any.thing to do wdth militarism
that this country o! ours can prosper
a~nd becorne a great Power.
For these reasons I arn strongly in favour
of the Treaty which is now before the House.
1 shall have, as I would have had at any
ime within the last twenty years, the
g-rea test possible pleasure in voting for a
imeasure which I hope will, in a certain
degree at ail events, establi-sh and maintain
the peace of the world. I -arn not, however,
without some doubt or apprehension as to
just how the League of Nations is going
to work out, as to its ability to establish
and maintain peace. Notwithstanding that
peace bas been made with Gerrnany, there
are many very ugly international questiona
which have yet to be solved. *,I think I
owe it to myseif to say that I arn alarmed
when I see that both Great Britain and the
Ujnited States have engraged, and are continuing to engage, in a sort of rivalry as
to which is going to possess the biggest
navy. In the light of the words which we
find in this Treaty Mf Peace, wherein disarrnamçnt is advocated as one of the greate2st necexsities, I confess I arn alarrned when
I see this kind of rivalry between the two
greatest Powers in the. League. I arn
speaking out, as I think it is the riglit and
the daty of every Canadian to speak out
in matters of t.his kînd. We are to-"dýy
members of that League of Nations, and
we are jointly responsible for the actions
o! that League; and ive oughit to speak out
in lParliamnent, because we shahl probably
not have rnany opportunities for speaking
within the ILeague itse]f. I have ail -my
life hoped to see world peace established.
1 must say that I fear that, unless the
League, of Nations practices what it
preaches, it is not going to have the ouoes
which it ciught to have. At ail events, for
iny part, I arn prepared to trust the League
of Nations for the time being, and I arn
prepared to, advocate that, Canada should
do everyt.hing possible to help the League
in performing t.he task w'hich it bas set for

With that reservation, I have, as I say,
very much pléasure in giving my hearty
support to the League.
Hon. J. G. TURRIF'F: I will delay the
bouse but very few minutes in discussing
this question. Usually I arn in sympathy
with. the opinions advanced by my friends
opposite; but 1 must confess that, in connection with this debate on the Treaty of
Peace, more partikularly the discussion in
another place, I arn altogether out of sympathy with the carping criticismn against the
Treaty. To my mind it is a good Treaty.
It may not be perfect. Perhaps under the
circumstances it could flot be perfect. The
greatest objections urged have been against
the League of Nations. I arn very gl*ad
indeed to hear rny honourable friend who
has just taken his seat (Hon. 'Mr. Belcourt)
say that he is absolutely in favour o! the
League. There is no doubt in my mind that
it is the beat and greatest effort that bas
been made to bring about peace for the
future, and if anything can be done by the
Empire or by Canada to further that aim,
it is our duty to do it.
I think also, honourable gentlemen, that
we have every right to be a party to that
Treaty o! Peace. We have paid a tremendous price in money and a mucli greater
prices in-blood.
The greatest criticism that I have heard
regarding the Treaty of Peace and the
League of Nations is that under them we are
losing sornewhat o! our autonomy. I will
not attempt any hair-splitting, which has
been mentioned to-day, as to our position
in the Empire. I think it bas been a fairly
satisfaotory position-so satisfactory that I,
for one, do not want to see it changed at
ail. I do not want to see any dloser relations within the Empire. 'Could Canada
have done more than she has done in this
war if we had been bound more closely by
further agreements? I do flot think it would
have been possible. There is no doubt that
in joining this League of Nations we sàcrificed sornewhat of our autonomy; but is
there a tsingle nation subscribing to the
Covenant of the Leagué whicfr does not
sacrifice Borne o! its autonomiy in agreeing
to be bound by the Council appointed by
the different nations constituting the
League? France is doing so, the United
States does the same, and Italy does the
same. Why should there be any objection
on our partP

REVISED EDITION

1*

SENATE

There is one thing, honourable gentlemen,
which I have not heard imentioned: that we
gain by this League of Nations. We live
right alongside a nation ten or twelve times
as large as we are, and twelve times as
rich and powerful. While our relations
are excellent to-day, and the very best of
feeling prevails between the two countries,
the day may come when the situation may
change. Under that League of Nations we
have the absolute protection of the United
States as well as that of other members of
the League of Nations. I think that is
something worth while that may stand us
in good stead in the future. Moreover, if
we can prevent war, if we can maintain
peace in the world for a hundred years, as
we have maintained it with our neighbours
to the south, will not that be something
worth while?
Another thing, honourable gentlemen.
Suppose that we had not been connected
with Great Britain in any manner whatever. Suppose we had been an independent country, with any kind of government that you might nane, and that we
had taken part in the war as we did;
would there have been the Slightest question
of our approving that Treaty of Peace and
the League of Nations? I do not believe
there would have been the slightest objection to it. Now, if that is the position that
Canada would have taken. if she had been
absolutely independent, why should we
hesitate to approve of the Treaty of Peace
and of becoming a nemiber of the League
of Nations because we are a nation within
the British Empire?
To my mindi honourable gentlemen, this
is trt greatest forvard step that has ever
been takeni by the nations of the world.
and I have every hope that it will be su&
cessful. There will be difficulties in the
way. Human nature cannot ibe changed all
at once. The readiest way of settling a
difficulty is with your fists. There is un.
doubtedly a general tendeney to fight if
things go wrong, .and in the past, when
difficulties occurred betiween nations they
were settled by war. But now a League
of Nations is being formed which will be
so strong that there will be no inducenient
to any inember of the League to break the
rules or to bring on a war, and I think
we may look forward to nations being able
to settle their differences by arbitration
through the League, instead of by the
arbitrament of the sword. Difficulties may
arise, but those difficulties arise but to be
overcome. Consider the difficulties with
which the delegates at the Paris ConferHon. Mr. TURRIFF.

ence had to contend. The difficulties that
loonmed up seened at times to be ahnost
insuperable; but they have been met, and
by a concession here or a concession there
the delegates have arrived -at a pretty good
result. I am sure that if every meniber of
the League of Nations will do what is nearly right, the effect will 'be very satisfactory.
We may not prevent all wars in the future.
As has been stated by my honourable friend
from Ottawa (Hon,. Mr. Belcourt), there
seems to be, I am sorry to say, a disposition among inany members of the League
to keep on arming. The tendency may end
when the League has been in existence for
a wlile. I do not see how the world can
continue to bear the tremendous cost of
the upkeep of armies and navies. All the
nations that have participated in the war,
our own with the rest, have borrowed money
nearly to their limit, and the question is
how the debt is going to be 'paid off. That
difficulty rnay have the very good effect of
preventing the nations from going into further extravagance. We are now trying to
float a loan in order to keep things going.
To my mind, honourable gentlemen·, the
Government vil have a very good reason
to retrench if they do not get all the money
they want, and I think that is about the
only thing that will make them retrench.
I do not think we should be a bit better
off if the other side were in, power. Whei
a country bas had to proceed in an extravas
gant way, as we have had to do during the
war, retrenchnent is a nost difficult
matter. The other nations are feeling the
effects just as nuch as we are; so I hope,
the result will bÇ a reduction ln the size
anid stréngth of the armies and navies of
the wôrld.
In conclusion, honourable gentlemen, I
desire to say that I am heartily in sympathy with .and heartily support the Treaty
of Peace and the League of Nations, and
I look forward to a better time in .the
future than the world has ever seen in
the past.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable gentleien, I do not intend to take up the time
of the House for more than a few minutes.
I have listened with a great deal of
pleasure and with soine profit to myself to
the debate which has taken place upon the
constitutional aspect and the position in
which Canada bas been placed.
I nust say at the outset that I fully agree
with the honourable member froin Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) in his statement that the constitutiion of this country
is undergoing a gradual change. The state-

OCTOBER 2, 1919
nient has also been m9de that there is
shortqy to be held an Imperial Conference,
in which any-difficulty.in this respect may
be removed, and Canada will receive such
consideration. there as will remove all
questions as to what her standing shall bie
in the future.
The honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain>, in the course
of the speech which he delivered yesterday
afternoon, seemed to be attempting at
great length to prove that Canada was not
a nation, that she had no right to be represented at the Conference in Paris; and,
in support of those staternents, he said that
this was also the view of the honourable
member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt),
the honourable member f rom De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique), and the honourable
membez from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). A statement of his that seexned
to me very extraordinary was that the coinmi8sioners of Canada had no standing there
at ail. He would lead this honourable body
to believe that the representation of Canada was simply a stage-play and meant
nothing whatever. He went the length of
even saying that the two comniissionlers
representing Canada 'were in a position
similar to that o! two page-boys walking
bebind Lloyd George and hanging onto his
coat tails, or similar to the position of
pages in his own church carrying the gown
of the church dignitary.who immediately
preceded them. He even questioned that
those gentlemen had been appôinted as the
representatives of Canada; hie said they
were appoiùted as Imperial representatives.
Now, in order to contradict a statement of
that kind and ta give to this honourable
House. a clear proof that the honourable
gentleman was absolutely wrong in his remarks, I shall read from the commission
whieh was issued by the King to the plenipotentiaries representing the Dominion of
Canada. This is what it 9ays::

Then I must

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I had no intention whatever of saying that, and I do not

that meaning.
Hon. Mi. Mc.MEANS: I must apologize
ta the honourable gentleman, but the statement of the honourable gentleman from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain), as reported in Hansard, was that the honaurable gentleman from Ottawa concuîîed in

theoretically, and that he can make peace
constitutionally and theoretically; but his
power is no more than theoretical, and in
practice the King cannot make war and cannot niake peace that will bind the Dorninion of Canada. I think the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), with all his experience in matters
of that kind, will agree with that statement.
Now let us see what was said in the
United States Senate about this. I an quoting from the press of iMonday, September 1:
Senator Knox: May I say this: I was not present at the meeting when Mr. Miller testified.
The fact is that while it is technically true, as
the President says, that the British seI-governing colonies deal diplomatically through the
British Foreign Office, it is only true in a most
technical sense. They are absolutely autonomous, even in their diplomatic dealings, as to
matters that affect them. For instance, I renieniber that when the Canadian reciprocity
agreement was negotiated in 1911 the Celegates
were sent to negotiate the agreement from
Canada. Great. Britain did not appear at the
hearings or conferences at ail, and in every
sense Canada was just as autonornous in conducting her international negotiations as she
would have been if she had been an absolutely
incependent government.

We have apparently to go over to the
United States to learn that we in Canada
have some standing in the eye-s of the
world. I cm glad the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière has just come in.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

I have been in-

OImed.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I say that we have
to go over to the United Sta!eý to learn
that in the eyes of the civilie.i world we
have some standing and our contry receives recognition as having an independent, autonomous government, whereas in
the opinion of the honourable gentleman
from De Lanaudière we are merely a colony
and have no standing at all.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

standing.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: And no right to

the other. What surprises me is that the
honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière
was at one time. before the war at least,
a very fervent admirer and deveted follower of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier was a great Canad-ian and a great
statesman, and wbat will perhaps endear
him to the hearts of his fellow-countrymen
is the fact that from 1906 or 1907 to 1911

honourable gentleman from De Lanndière,
I might suppose that he had gone back on
his formed opinions: I might suppose it
was some deep dyed-in-the-wool Tory from
away back prior to 1867 who had made
those statements.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is rightthe Family Compact.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The work vhich
had been carried on by Sir Wilfriýd
Laurier up to 1911 has since that time been
continued by Sir Robert Borden, and I
think that when the history of this
Conference comes to be written the
greatest credit will be given to Sir
Robert Borden for the stand that hie
took in demanding that Canada have
an independent standing at the Peace
Conference that took place in Paris.
Does any one mean to say that Canada,
after spending a billion and a half of
dollars, and after raising 500,000 men, and
when 60,000 of ber sons lie buried in France,
would have no right to be represented at
the Paris Conference. Surely no one would
for a moment seriously support a statement
of that kind.
I have nothing further to say. J did not
intend to make any remarks. A discussion
of the constitutional development of Canada would involve a great deal of study.
But the institution is evolving; it is
gradually working up from what is was
prior to the war, and changes in it are
taking place. With the greatest deference
to my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt), I do not at all consider thatthe British North America is so binding
upon us that it cannot be evolved in a
parliamentary sense. What I mean is this.
Under the British North America Act we
have the same ri'ghts and the same powers
as the Parliament of Great Britain, and
every power surrendered by the Crown
changes the constitution of Cana-da to that
extent. I regret that I was not in a position
to give this matter more time; but I desired
to record my objection to the position taken
by the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) in which
I think he was not justified. I do hope
that when he went over to Paris and saw
so many important people there, and
learned about the Sultan's skull and about
the Koran, and all those things, he did not
express to the people of France and to the
people of Great Britain or to the Sultan
of that country where. the Koran was lost,
the same sentiments as he has voiced in
this House.

I regret to say that, owing to circumstances over whieéh I had no eontrol, I- had
not the privil-ege of. being present when the

that on that occasion the bouse divided on

observe that ' t divided i n a partisan way.
Now, honourable gentlemen, if there is one
miatter that has corde before this bouse at
any time since, the yeaT of Confederation,
and into which partisan politics should not
have entered, it is the que.stion of this
Peace Treaty. We did have some differences regarding the method of carrying on
the war. I- am happy to say that we were
ail desirous of winning the war; -but there
were doubts in the minds of somne persons
as to how we could best proceed, and it
was only natural that we should differ,
though we ail had the one object in view.
It was natural that there shouid be differences regarding conscription as compared
with the volunteer system. There was room
for difference of opifAion there. But, honnurable gentlemen, I can see no possible
reason why we should differ on this question of the Peace Treaty, and therefore I
regret to find, as 1 have said, that the House
was divided. If thete was to be a division,
the récord of it should have been taken,
because this is and will continue to, be a
inatter of very great importance for many
years to corne. It will be a matter of bis-

tory, so it would have been but fair and
reasonable to record the division, and I
trust that when a vote is taken on this Bill
the division will be recorded. What does
the division mean? It means purely and
simply that we divide on partisan lines,
and there is no possible excuse for that.
Every man who voted against the resolution should have been recorded as voting
against the world's Peace Treaty.
I desire to say a few words regarding
-sonie of the statements which have been
made here. For instance, the honourable
leader of the Opposition rose in his place
and read all the correspondence that had
been exchanged between the Imperial Council and our Privy Council in Canada.
When he had read the correspondence I
thought that, if ever I was to hear eloquence
from him I should hear it on that occasion.
I expected him to laud our Premier
and endorse his attitude for having
brought Canada to the notice of the Imperial Government and for having demanded the recognition of Canada's rights as
we would expect him to do. No ian would
have accused the Prime Minister sooner
than my honourable friend if he had failed
to demand the recogniLion of Canada's dignified position. Therefore I say that when
the honourable leader of the Opposition had
read that correspondence I expected from
him an eloquent tribute to our Prime Minister. However, that will be given later,
I have no doubt.
The honourable gentleman who followed
him, the honourable gentleman froi De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), was very
much exercised about our having no right
to be over there. He did say that the
Peace Treaty could be ratified and go into
effect without any action on our part.
Everybody knows that. We know that the
King has great powers if be chooses to exercise them, but we know also that the
King does not exercise all his powers. My
honourable friend said at the same time
that the British constitution was an unwritten constitution. Is it any more so
than ours? Are we not developing our constitution just as the people of the British
Isles are developing theirs? Will any man
tell me that Canada to-day stands in the
saine position with relation to the Imperial
Governient as she stood five years after
the passing of the British North America
Act, or 10 years, or 15, or 20? Now, after
50 years of Confederation, where- do we
stand? In a perfectly independent position. There is no question whatever about
our independence.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What about the
veto?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I will veto my honourable friend in good time, before I get
through he may be sure of that-if he will
only have a little patience.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hurry up. I have
to take the train soon.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: If my honourable
friend has to leave, I feel almost like asking
this House to adjourn this debate so that
I may say what I have to say to my bonourable friend when he is here. I never
go behind any man's back when I have to
say anything about him. Therefore, if my
honourable friend has to retire before my
time is up, the House might give me another opportunity; otherwise I shall have
to refer to my honourable friend's speech
in his absence. I have a good deal to say
about that.
Let me deal first with the remarks of the
honourable gentleman from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand)-I do not know
whether that is the place he represents or
not. My honourable friend seemed very
iuch excited about the standing of Canada.
I do not think there is any man more
anxious than he was to know where Canada
stood. He said that she did declare war.
Well, I was glad to hear him say that, and
I am going to tell him how she declared
war. He did not seem to understand how
she did it. He does not seem to take as
much interest in Canadian affairs as one
would think, to look at him. He was very
loud in his rernarks about the declaration
of war. The honourable gentleman on his
right, who seems to know everything and
who thinks be does too, told him we did not
declare war, but he still kept saying we
did.
As to the honourable gentleman who represents Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), I desire to say to him that I had no intention
whatever of being discourteous to him, and
lie nust not be too thin-skinned. When
we say a word or two to him, he must not
ifeel that he is the only member here who
bas feelings. We all have feelings; but when
things are said on one side or the other we
must take them in good part; we must
receive
them in the proper spirit.
If I say anything offen3*ve to my ho'nourable friend. et is not because of ti personal
feeling lhat i have :n the malter, but because we differ in regard to the affairs which
we discuss here. I have no intention --f saying anything offensive to -anybody. My honouraible friend said that we declared war,

tening to." But, as I said on one occasion,
that gentleman je far nicer to look at than
to listen to. But it would be no compliment to my honourable friend to say that on
this occasion he was nicer to look at thaný
to listen to when he made bis speech, because it would not make any difference
wbat he looked like, he would look better
than bis speech. To look at hlmn one would
expect that he would be dignified and decorous in discussing matters o! great and
national importance in this House. If he
has that dignity, lb is only-in appearance,
as we shall see when we read the speech
which. he made here on Wednesday.
Now, I want ta refer to that speech. I arn
not goîng to go aver all he said, because
I would be detaining the House too long,
and 1 want to get hlm away as soon as possible-I do not suppose any o! us will miss
hlm much.

Yesterday he told us that we were one,
eu that setties the question of nation-ality.
1 hope there will be no more queetion-s so
far as that ie concerne&t.
Now, I will tell the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimer (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),how
we declared war. A gentleman who has so
mnuch ýto &~ with. the public and wbo is so
anxious to convince the public would do welI
to bear this in mind. As soon. as Britain
deciared war, the Premier of thijs ountry
sent a telegram, to the Premier of Great
Britain and toid hîm that every -man and
every dollar in Canada wais behind 'him.
Everybody knows that is the way in which
we declared war. It -is the same taday; we are prepared -when the British
Empire takes up anything to back it
up.
We were flot called upon or as'ked
to contribute. Our Prime Minister went over
there, and told them what we were willing
to do. I do flot care who the Premier is for
the time heing, as Prime Minister he is
worthy of the confidence of the people of
Canada, not because he is a Liberal or a
Conservative, but because he is the Prime
Minister, and any man who does not stand
behind him is not a friend of this country.
When aur Premier spoke he spoke for this
country, and- spoke as the people of this
country desired him to speak; therefore we
made the declaration. I hope that 'will
make my honourable -friend's mind easy on~
that point.
Now 1 -come to my other .honourable
friend. He gat up and told us that'last winter, for some reason he was going to give
afterwards, he had read an~ awful lot about
this Peaoe Treaty. I said to myself, "Now

must have had bimself pretty well camouflaged if he expressed the same opinion over

afraid he would not bave got back.

train, and the honourable gentleman ougbt
to patronize it.
It is going to be exceedingly difficult,
bonourable gentlemen, to deal with my
bonourable friend now that he bas gone.
The honourable gentleman made a very
long speech. He told us that he bad been
in France and bad got into the House of
Deputies. He told us that dûring the
winter he had read a great deal about the
Peace Treaty, and bad followed 'it very
closely. Indeed, he led us to believe that
there was notbing in it that he did not
thorougbly underatand. He wanted us to
know that before he spoke-of course, he
would not tell us after he spoke, because
then we all knew that he did not know
anytbing about it.
He then talked about skulls and coattale, and one thing and another, and he
referred to bis late lamnented leader, wbom
we all lament, wbo bad said on-one notable
occasion in tbc city of Montreal that the

(Hon. Mr. Casgrain), who seems to think
that he should always be taken as correct,
has denied that. But we did declare war.
The honourable member from Montreal
<Hon. Mr. Casgrain) asked: -How could
we?" My honourable friend from De Loriinier answered: " But we did; of courxse, it
was a question of fact. 1 think I could lay
my 'hand on the officiai Gazette." I do not
kn-ow whether he is groping for it yet, but
I think he would be groping for a long time.
The honourable gentleman frorn Ottawa

but the day before he stood up and said
that Canada was not a nation. I arn going

question. Who among us did not pray for
peace? Who is there among us who, up to
the eleventh af November, 1918, was not
praying and wishing that peace would
come? Those of us who had friends and
connections there all prayed for it, and we
all had friends there. Where will you find
the man who was not praying for that
peace? Yet to-day we are stumbling about
debating whether or not we will ratify it.
I feel confident that there is not a man in
this House who will stand up and vote
againat this Bill.
I regret, Mr. Speaker and honourable
gentlemen, that my honourable friend is not
here, because I want to say that my honourable friend would be better employed standing on the street-corners selling a commodity that requires to be well roasted before
it is palatable than in making such speeches
as he has made. I say that hecause it is
Parliamentary, and is, as near as I can get
to expressing my opinion of any man who
stands up in this House to belittle the
Premier and the leader of the people on
such an occasion. If this were an ordinary
election camipaign, wherein the two sides
were-arrayed one against the other, I could
quite understand one doing his best to get
votes; but when he comes into this House
it is a different matter.
I do not care
whether he calls himself a British Frenchman or a French Britisher; France and
Britain are joined together, and are doing
all they can to give effect to this Treaty.
That 'being so, why do you find a man
standing up in this House and declaring
himself in such a way as the honourable
gentleman has done? There is only one
reason and that is that the spirit of
partisanship 'is so strong in him that it
would be impossible for him to do justice
on any occasion.
Honourable gentlemen on the other side
of the House no dou)bt feel that there may
be certain expenses incurred if we pass this
Bill. What does that mean? What is to
be our contribution? We shall not be askèd
to contribute .any more pro rata than the
other natione in the League. We shal. le
asked to contribute only our fair share,
and is there any man in Canada who does
not want to do that? Is there any man in
Canada who does not want the Treaty ratified and want it to continue in fqrce for all
time? How can that be if it has not got
the endorsement of the best people in the
world? Has it not got the endorsement
Sas
of the English-speaking people?
it not got the endorsement of the
French-speaking people of France, and

121

the French-speaking people of this country?
In referring to the English-speaking people
I should have mentioned also the French.
We have those two peoples united; what
more can you expect? What more guarantee
can my honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) want? What
more could be expected by the honourable
gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain), or any other honourable member of this House, or any one outside of
this House, whether he is a Britisher, or
a Frenchman; or whoever he may be?
The only man that might differ on this
point would be the Sinn Feiner, and we
have none of those in Canada; at least, I
do not think we have; we do not want any
of them anyway-that is my judgment; and
I desire to say here that I consider myself
as good an Irishman as there is in Canada.
I take back' water to no man in seeking
to obtain for Ireland her rights in the
right way. I do not think she should seek
for them in any other way or that she
should take advantage of anybody in order
to get her rights. If she plays the game
properly she will get her rights. Everybody who plays the game fairly will get
his rights. I do not want to be misunder* stood in making these statements.. No man
is prouder that he belongs to the Irish race
than I am, and when it comes to discussing
the question of Ireland I am prepared to
take that position.
My honourable friend, the middle member for Halif-ax (Hon. Mr. Roche), as he
has been described, made a very patriotic
speech. He said we are going to stand by
the King, and I know that he will stand
by the King, without any doubt. I know
that he will vote with the King, that he
will vote with the Parliament of Great
Britain, with the Union Government, and
with everybody who supports this Bill.
That is how he will vote, because that
is what he has said he will do, and I never
knew of the honourable gentleman going
back on any statement that he had made.
I have heard him make statements which
I did not like and which I tried to refute,
but there is one thing that I can say of
him, and that is that he never made a
statement that he went back upon. Therefore I know how he will vote. I would
like to see the vote of every: honourable
gentleman in this House recorded. Although the House was not unanimous
règarding the resolution, I hope that
it will unanimously endorse this BiHi.
Let us not quilible about, a few cents. The

continue in power forever; and ny honourable friends opposite feel that at the
very first opportunity the present Govern,nient will be put out of business. I say
that there is no guarantee that the present
Geovernment will be permanent. There will
be other Governments in this country; but
,whoever holds the reins of power in this
country, whichever party may be placed on
the treasury benches, we can trust them to
deal with what is provided for in this Bill
in a fair way.
We are in this league. We have heard
talk about Canada being a nation. I an
not going to discuss that question, for we
have heard it discussed by the legal gentlemen. Of course, in many things, I do not
think very much of their opinions. The
longer they discussed this question the
more complicated it became, as I have always told you would be the case whenever
lawyers discuss any point. We are in the
British Empire-why? Because we want
to be there. Otherwise we would not want
to be a part of the Empire. There would
bc nothing to hold us if we did not desire
to remain. There is no honourable gentleman who has taken part in politics at any
time during the last fifty years who does
not know that there have been times when
the British Government did not care where
we were-whether we went over to the
United States or where we went, because
we were so much trouble. But that is not
the case to-day. Our present relations have
been brought about by our love of the British flag and British institutions. Our relations to-day are better than ever before, although we have been developing our constitions, as some honourable gentleman has
said. I contend that he was perfectly right
in that, and that we have an unwritten
constitution just as much as the people of the
British Isles have. Reference bas been made
to the British North America Act, but what
does the British North America Act do for
us? It tells us how to govern this country
and how the powers are divided between
the Dominion and the provinces, but it
bas nothing to do with our Imperial affairs,
and we can deal with them in any manner
we please. We are united with the British
Empire today because of our love for British institutions, just as a man and a woman
are united who have pledged themselves
te each other. The Dominion of Canada, I
say, is part of the British Empire because
of that same love, that desire to stand by
the British flag, and I say, " Whom God

NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 11,

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Mr.
Chairman, I heg to move that in section 1,
new subsection 3, the word "tidal" be inserted between the words "navigable" and
"wiaters," in order that this Bill may not
be taken to apply to small wharves and
docks built innocently on inland streams
and lakes, where there is no reason for their
being disturbed. I wish the Bill t niake
clear that it does not refer to fresh water
navigation.
Hon. Mr. POWER: That is, that it would
not apply to navigation on the Greait Lakes?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It would
not apply to the Great Lakes. I believe
that the Government is satisfied that that
amendanent should be made.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would you read the
amendment, so that we might understand it?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I may
say that I discussed this matter with the
Deputy Minister of Justice to-day, and
afiter the discussion he authorized me to
state that it would be isatisfactory to hini
and t the Government to have the Bill
amended as I have indicated.
The CHAIRMAN: I will read the section
as amended:
(3) The provisions of this section shall apply
and be deemed to have applied to- any works
constructed, built or placed in, upon, over,
under, through or across any navigable tidal
water at any time 'before the twenty-fourth

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But the

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: This Bill

made after the enactimîent caiue into force.
It is quite clear.

the Conmittee should rise and ask leave
to sit again. When the question came up
before the Commons, apparently it was not
discussed -at any length.

Hon. Mr, BELCOURT: If a concrete case
exists which the statute is intended to
remove, it seems to me it would be the
honest thing to deal with that case and nof
interfere with a statute of this importance.

Hon. W. B. ROSS:

Unless there is a

Hon. Mr. POWER:

I quite agree with

the renarks the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt).
There art
two subsections in the section which it is
proposed to aiend, and to those it is proposed to add a third. So that the provisions of the first two subsections will not
apply to non-tidal waters. That, of course,
is really sweeping away a very great portion of the existing law.

to add, 'which is subsection 3, it will have
the effect of taking out of the statute every

MOTION.

Hon. -Mr. FOWLER (for Hon. Mr. Domville) moved:

OCTOBER 7, 1919
That, in the opinion of this House, Tariff
Item No. 4610 of the Customs Tariff, 1907, and
amendments, should be so arnended a,, to inmove any uncertainty or doubt as to whether
the machinery used for the mining and retorting of 011 Shales may, under the said Item No.
46-0,, be imported into. Canada without the payment of duty and war tax, and will Inquire If It
is the intention of the Governmenbt to make
such an amendment.

Hon. Mr. NICHOLIJS: 1 woufd 'be quite ir.
favour of the resolution if it were worded in
&uch a way as to comply -with that clause of
the Oustoms Act which it is sought ýto interpret, and which makes provision for the
importation free of duty of certain articles
when not manufactured in Canada; 'but I
rather objeet to passing in -a ýper'functory
way a resolution, under the guise of an interpretation of a clause in the 'Tariff Act,
which would have a bearin-g on the whole
tariff.
I would move in amfflment that the
words -"when not manufàetured in 'Canada " be inserted after the words " war
tax."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is not the intention to have machinery irnported to, compete
with machinery already mnanufactured in
Canada. If the machinery 'required were
inanufactured in Canada the desire of the
people going into this enterprise would be
to purchase 'Canadian manufactured machinery. The item in the tariff says that
these things should be îmported free of duty
when not manufactured in Canada; yet, by
a ruling of the Customs Department, the
duty is exacted, and this motion is only in
order to make it clear that in such cases
that irnpost should flot be levied.
Hon. Mr. NI'CHOLLS: I quite understand
thue intention of my honourable friend, and
I amn quite in sympathiy with him;- but at
the sanie time this resolution is drawn in
such a way that it la misleading; because,
if it were tarried into affect, such machinery
could be imported into Canada whether
rnanufactured in 'Canada or otherwise. The
words of the Customs Act specifioally mention mining and other classes of machinery
which may be im.ported free of duty when
flot manufactured in Canada, If the lionourable gentleman would agree to the
amendmnent I think the resolution woub4
meet with the approval of all.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do flot think it is
necessary, but I ýagree to it.
The motion, amended as proposed, was
agreed to.

SMOKY RIVER COAL AREAS.
MOTION AND DISOUSSION.

Hon. GEORGE H. BRADBURY moved:
That an Order of the Senate do issue for a
copy of the Order In Council cancelling the
leases to certain coal areas in the province o!
Alberta, standing In the namne of A. T.,Shillington and C. A. Barnard..

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I make
this motion, not so much for the purpose
of securing -a copy of the Order in Council,
as for the purpose of drawing -the attention
of the House and the Government to the
importance of conserving this coal areafor
the people of Canada. I hold in xny hand
a statement furnished to me by the Conservation Commission, giving the approximate estimiate ofthe total probable coal reserve of Canada by D. B. Dowling of the
Geological Survey. Honourable gentlemen
will realize that Dr. Dowling la, or ought
to be, the best authority in Canada on its
co.al resources, as ha has devoted years of
his time in studying and praspecting the
different coal areas of the country. The figures are very illuminating and encouraging.
They are so enormous as to be almost startling. When I say to thi- Hovi" that Canada has, according to Dr. Dowling, coal deposits amounting 'to 1,234,269,310,000 metric
tons-in other words, Canada has coal
en-ough to supply the civilized world. with
fuel for generations to come-this ought to
ba, and I am sure is, a very pleasingo state-ý
ment, and one that should make every
Canadian realize what our great national resources mean. The figures are very illuminating in that they show the immense
body of coal that, we have; they startled
me when I read them.- Honourable gentle.,men perhapi will ha surpri.sed to know that
we have over a trillion tons of coal in Canada. That is an. immense figure, and pretty
hard to grasp.
I am go4ng tao place on record the astimates that Mr. Dowling lias given of the

Hon. Mr. TESSIER: 1 suppose that is a

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: The honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Watson) bas, questioned the meturn by the Conservation Commission made by Mr. Dowling, one af the
miost competent men in Canada to speak on
this subject.
These figures, as I bave said, are very
illuminating. They show that we have
1,234,000,000,000 tons of coal.
In othier
words, Canada bas coal enough to supply
the civilized woid with fuel for generatians
ta corne. This augbt to he, and I am sure
is, a very pleasing statement, to be able to
make ta thia House, and one that s'bould
make every Canadian realize what aur great
natural resources mean ta this country; and
coal is only one af -our great natural resources.

Possessing, as we do, these enormaus coal
depasits, it is humiliating ta realize that we
are depending almost entirely an the United
States for aur domestic coal, and for a
large amaunt af aur steamn coal. We imported last year fram the United States
$70,592,357 warth af coal. I submnit, honnnrahle gentlemen, that it is anything but
satisfactory, in vîew af aur own enormous
resources, that we are sending so large a
sum of money out of this country annually
Hon.

Mr. BRADBURY,

for coal. It should and can be retained
in Canada to help in the development of
our own resources. According to the Customs Department statistics for the fiscal
year ending ]March 31, 1917, the total quanttif.y of anthracite coal which passed the
ports of Fort William and Port Arthur intoý
the western provinces was 505,715 tons,
valued at $3,054,915. The total imports of
anthracite coal into Canada were 5,320,198
tons, valued at $28,109,586, for the calendar
year 1917. The total imports of bit-minous
round and run-of-mine coal for the samne
yýear was 12,407,486 tons, valued at $33,712,894; -while th8 imports of bituminous slack,
passing over a three-quarter inch screen, for
the corresponding period were 3,129,776 tons,
valued at $8,739,877. It is estimat-ed that 50
per cent of the coal requirenaents af the
western provinces is supplied fromt the
United States mines, and that the value of
the imports of coal into Fort William, Port
Art.hur and Manitoba amounts to somie
$14,000,000 to $18,000,000 annually.
For example, 500,000 tons of bard coaI
are imiported yearly inrto Winnipeg and the
wvestern provinces, although there are 100,000,000 tons of high-grade anthracite coal
and liundreds of millions of tons of firstclasa bituminous coal ail lying und*eveloped
in what is known as the Happe leases
nortlï of Edmonton.
Regarding the quality of this coal, coinparison of an average sample of coal froma
what is known as the Hoppe leases with
rtn of mine fromn the best-known producing
mines in the United States would indicate,
the very high quality of the coal front the
Hop>e area and its exceI)tional thermal
value.

The value of a coal, other conditions
being equal, is dependent upon its thermal
value-the British thermal units. The coal
front what is knawn as the Happe beases.
taking this standard, is evidently of better
quality than the other coals, as noted.
This coal that I am urging the Government
to open up is probably of the hîghest
quality and contains the greatest thermal
of any coal deposit in the West, not excepting the Alaska depasit.
But Alberta contains, in addition to
these great deposits, billions of tons
of high-grade bituminous coal. It does
seeni ta me ridiculous that the western provinces should be depending fa;

OCTOBER 7, 1919
coal on the Unit'ed States. Instead of
*being in ihis humiliating position, we
should be large exporters of coal ta ail the
statçs lying adjacent -to our western provinces-Montana,
Dakota,
Minnesotaw'here there is a market for millions of
tons. The fact that we are not producing
in those great western provinces enough
coal for our own use is, I contend, anything but flattering to Canadian foreeight
and enterprîse. W-e should realizo that
Canada contains one of the greatest coal
reserve-s in the world-at least one trillion
tons, as I stated before, of anthracite and
biturninous, the anthracite being equal or
nearly equal in hardness to Pennsylvania
ceai. According ta Mr. Dowling, we have
over one trillion tons of bituminous coal,
and, as I pointed: out a moment -ago, a
large percentage of this immense coal deposit is of very high grade. The fact that
we are depending on -the United States for
our annual -coal aupply, to carry on 'our
great industries and to keep our people
from periýshing during the long, cold winters, is not only absurd; it is almost
criminal that such a condition existe in
Canada et the present time. 1 dlaim, honourable gentlemen, it is high time that
the Goverument of Canadr. awakened te
the real position which Canada occupies
in this respect, and realized the necessity
of developing im'mediately ýsome of oiir great
éoal resources which would enaible, our
people to obtain an abundance of coal -ai
Teasonable prices. Canada faces a serious
situation to-day. It is getting more difficuit year by year te secure supplies from
our American cousins, and the prices keep
soaring until to-day it taxes the ingenuity
of hundreds of thousands of our citizens.
to procure money enough to provide coal
to keep their families warm during -the
winter months. In addition Ibo this fact, we
are faeed with another very serious aspect
of the situation. The American coal producers, *who, after ail, are only human
and are 'in the business for what *money
they can make, may at any time find a
hetter market for theiz coal than Canadaand perhaps the time is not f ar *distant.
Just ais soon as this occurs,
we would -be lef t without a ton of
A.merican coal, and under presexft conditions the suffering would be intolerable.
Simply because we have neglected entirely
te develop our own great coal re-,
sources, we are left abeolutely at the
mnercy of the United States coal producers. Surely this is not a wise or sane
position for Canada to be in, especially
when we can produce ail the coal

19-7

we require for our own use, and millions
of tons for export purposes, if we take hold
of the situation in a businesslike way. It
ail depeiéde, honourable gentlemen, on the
application of business methode te this
great industry, and 'I trust we may prevail
upon the present Government ta apply
those business inethods. I sometimes feel
that most of our'Governments havé' lacked
the business initiative that is necessary
to develop oür great natural resources.
When-I look back over what has taken
place, or what has been neglected, during
the last 25 or 30 years, I cannat but come
te the conclusion that our different Goveraments have lacked the experience of business men, who would be able te handie a
situation of this kind.
Lest year this Ohamber, by its prompt,
action, saved the country a most valuable
coal area, in interfering in what was supposed to be done, or had practieally been
done, by one of the departments of the
Government, in leasing soine 18,000 acres
of perhaps the most valuable coal area on
this continent. After a thorough investigation, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that
the leases neyer should have been granted.
Consequently the Minister of the Interior,
respansible te the people of Canada for the
conduct of the department which has control of the coal lands, cancelled the leases
and reserved the coal deposits Par theCrown,
on the advice of this House and on the
evîdence taken before your committee. It
does seem a great pity that this policy of
reserving the coal for the 'Crown had not
been adopted yeers ego, when other great
coal areas had been allowed to pass out of
the possession of the Crown inte the handa
of private individuals. It is a noterious
f act that hundreds of thousands of very
veluable coal areas have been alienated
from the Crown and are now held by speculators, who are not developing them to any
great extent, or who, where they are developîng the properties, are exacting the pound
of flesh in almost every instance from the,
people who depend upon the products of
these mines for industries or for domestie
purposes.
I have one case in mind-a large coal
mine apera-ting 60 miles from -a prosperous
Alberta town, which is forced by the coal
producers to pay $9 a ton for coal. Is there
any honourable gentleman in this room whio
believes thet that is an honest price? Does
not any honourable gentleman feel that
that 'would be almost extortion?

The high

cost

of

128

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That is for bituminous coal lying within 60 miles o the
town of Red Deer, which is paying, I an
informed on good authority, $9.50 per ton.
This is what is taking place under private
ownership, and that is why T say that the
Governments in years gone by have not been
as active as J believe they ought to- have
been in protecting the interest of the public by conserving these great coal areas
for the people.
After ail, honourable gentlemen, these
coal areas belong to the people of Canada
and not to the Government. They are as
esseitial to the comfort and the happiness
of the people as are food and raiment. Consequently it is the imperative duty of the
Government not only to conserve these resources, but also to develop them, so that
the people inay receive the product at the
lowest possible price, and in abundance.
My purpose, honourable gentlemen, in
brininga this matter before the House is to
urge the Governient to take immediate
action in developing that great coal area
known as the Hoppe leases, lying soie 200
miles north of Edmonton. These leases, as
I said a moment ago, were taken over by
the Crown last session through the action
and by the advice of this House. It is estimated by experts that at least 100,000,000
tons of high-grade anthracite coal is contained in this area, and can be mined et a
cost not exceeding 50 cents per ton. In addition to this, it is estimated that we have
fully 400,000,000 tons of high-grade bituminous coal lying in this same area. This surely emphasizes the immense value of this
great coal deposit, and the wisdoim of the
action of this House last session. Of this
innnuense deposit, 100,000,000 tons of highgrade anthracite, superior in heating quality
to the average anthracite imported from the
United States, is available. Twenty-five per
cent of all this great deposit can be mined
and placed in the hoppers at the railways
ready for shipment, for a sum not exceeding 50 cents per ton, according to mv information. I nay say that the estimate
given to me by a man who, I helieve. kinows thie situatiIon. was .30 cents a
ton, but I have exceeded that estimate by
20 cents a ton, and I believe that nmy estimate is really excessive. I know there are
honourable gentlemen in this room who
have had something to (o with mines and
who have had to delve down hundreds of
feet into the earth to find coal, and who
would lardly realize that thiis ls possible.
But this is a gravity proposition. The coal
is lying up on the hills. All the coal that
Hon. Mr. BOYER.

is minèd
comes down hill.
I ani
informed by Dr. Hoppe, the original discoverer of these mines, thât every ton of
this coal will cone down hill. There will

be no pumping of water and no hoisting of
coal, and no timber required. So the coal
can be delivered in the hoppers at fifty
cents a ton.
The same authority informs me that he
received an estimate from the Canadian
Northern railway-it is, of course, a. prewar estimate-that this coal could be delivered in Vancouver for $2.50 per ton railway haulage. This means that this coal
could be delivered to the city of Vancouver
for a cost of about $3 per ton, and as far
east as the city of Winnipeg for $4.50 a ton.
This, of course, is the actual cost without
provision for interest and profit; but, after
allowing liberally for all this, I contend

that this coal could be sold all over the
three western provinces for one-half what
the people are paying for coal at the present
tiie.
The saving to Saskatchewan and Alberta
would be much greater. on account of the
fact that imported American col has a
much longer haul, which increases the cost
to the Saskatchewan and Alberta users of
hard coal. If the people of Manitoba and
Saskatchewan can buy their hard coal for
one-half of what they are paying for it at
the present tine. and Lave been paying for
it, what a boon it would be ! They import
over 500,000 tons of lard coal each year. 1
elaim tbLat they can save fully $7 a ton,
wiîîli would niean a direct saving to the
people of $3,500,000 annually. This refers
onmlv to tlie hard coal. On the bituminous
coai that coies into the western country,
including the head of the lakes, the saving
would be much greater because of the
greater quantity. So it would be a reasonable estimate to say that if the Government opened up this ,great property on a
business basis anmd supplied the coal to the
three western provinces and to the head of
the lakes. at the cheapest possible cost,
we could save to those provincer directly
$7.000,000 or $8,000,000 a year and give
All this
them an abundance of coal.
coes 'to show tLe iecessity of immediate
action on the part of the Government
in developing this great coal deposit whici
must be opened in the interest of the people
at the earliest possible moment.
To accomplish this would require a considerable outlay. There would have to be
built seventy miles of railway, from the
present National Railway System at or near
Entrance. in Alberta, into what is known
a-s tle Hoppe leases.
It is estimated by

OCTOBER 7, 1919
railway authorities that the railway would
cost from $15,000 to $20,000 per mile.
To
put it at the outside figure, $20,000 a mile,
that would mean an expenditure of $1,400,,.
000 for the railway. In addition to that, Dr.
Happe, who is. I believe, a good authority
on this question, assures me that this
property can be opened Up so as to deliver
in the hoppers 1,000,000 tons of coal annual]y
for an expenditure not exceeding 3200,000.
That 'would ýmake a.total outlay of about
$1,600,000 ta 'make this great coal deposit
a warki-ng mine, ta provide a railraad, and
make available for the people of the three
great 'western provinces an a'hundance of
highgrade coal at one-haîf the present cast.
.I contend. honourable gentlemen, that
the Govern'ment could well afford ta advance
this maney.
Say it cast $2,000,000.
The
Governiment cauld recoup itself in twa or
three years if it desired ta do sa, and could
still furnish ta the peaple af these three
western provinces an abundan-ce of highgrade coal at ane-haîf the cast that the
people of the West are paying for coal
ta-day.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Cauld the hanaurable
gentleman eay whether or flot it wauld be
expedient ta madify the tariff in order t
encourage the coal industryF
Hon. Mr. BRADBUIRY: That, of course,
wauld be a question far the Government
ta decide. I do not think there is any duty
an hard coal anyway. I think it cames in
free.
Anather important factar is the financial
canditian af Canada. The balance of trade
is very heavily against us at the present
time, affecting aur exchange t'a the extent
of nearly five per cent. The development
of this great coal praperty would make il
unnecessary ta impart one tan of coal inta
these three western pravinces,j including
the head af the Great Lakes, thereby saving between $ 18,00,000 and $20,000,000 annually, which goes out af Canada ta pay
for the coal af these western districts. This
in itself wauld materially assist in correctîng the balance af trade.
But, in addition ta keeping this large
amount of mnondy at home, we ought ta
develop a great expart trade in coal ta the
United States lying along aur soiithern
boundaries-Minnesota, Dakota and Montana-where there is a mnarket for a million
tans of coal annually; and I am satisfied
we ýcauld supply a large percentage af this
demand, and in doing sa build up a great
industry in Alberta that would employ
thousands of men and incidentally create
S-9

129

a largeo home mnarket for the products of
the faim and the faotory.
In view of ahl these facts, I have noa
hesitation in urging the Government ta
cause this 70 miles of railway ta be constructed at the earliest passible date, and
this great coal property develaped, with
ample provision for the supplying of an
abundance of coal ta the western provinces
-and preparing for a large export trade
which lies at oYur door. I am firmly of the
opinion that an exïport trade in coal could
be developed, which would mare than offset
the great balance of trade which appears
againat us at the present time in Canada.
Honourable gentlemen, this, ta my mind,
is a very important question. It is a question that affects the comfart ai thousanda
and hundreda of thausands af people all
over this country. I arn firmly'of the
opinion, naw that we control thase great
railway systems, the Canadian Northern
and the Transcontinental, that it would be
possible, ance these great caal praperties
are operated under business methods by
the Government, ta send this coal as far
east as Montreal and ta séll it at prices
that wauld make it practically impassible
for American coal ta came into aur markets.
As I painted out a few moments ago, we
are ta-day accupying a very dangeraus pasition. We are living in almost a foal's
paradise. We are at the mercy ai the coal
producers ai the United States, year after
year. That this shauld be sa is humiliating ta a great cauntry like this, when we
know that we could supply at least aur
great western provinces with an abundance
of first-class coal.
If the coal areas of the lower provinces
had been developed in the interests ai the
masses ai the people instead af in the interests of private individuals, therei is no
reason why that coal shauld flot have been
shipped west as far as Ontario, and in that
way have taken the place ai a large amount
of American coal. That this bas not been
done is due ta the policy of all gavernments up ta the present time. I da trust,
honourable gentlemen, that we are going
ta have a change. I arn very hapeful that
the action ai the Minister af the Interior
in cancelling these leases and reserving
these great Happe coal areas for the Crown
is an indication that the Government intends ta hald these great coal reserves for
the people ai Canada and not hand them out
ta private individuals.
As I pointed out, these naturel resources
belong ta the people ai this country, and
should be developed for the people and in

should like some honourable gentlemen to
tell me what it is. Fuel is just as necessary,
to the peace and prosperity of the people
of this country as is the wheat that is taken
off our western farmis. Why should we
place this great natural resource in the
hands of private individuals, who secure
the coal areas for a song, and develop them
for the purpose of exacting their pound of
flesh from the people of Canada? Can any
one tell me or suggest for a moment that
these great western properties are worked
with a view of giving the masses of the
people coal at reasonable prices? That
would not be a business proposition.
These mines are worked to give to the

dends.
we have reached the stage when we sbould
ask the Government to intervene. I was
told in the other House when I was pleading
along these lines in another matter that I
was .advocating paternalism-that I was
the
asking the Goverirnment to become
parent of socme industry. In my opinion
the time bas come when we have got to have
a paternal Government, a Government prepared to take hold of any of the great resources of Itbis country and develop them
for the people, instead of allowing an individual or a company to secure and control what bas becone an absolute necessity
of life.
A great hue and cry bas recently been
raised all over this country because the

packers have !been
meat markets and inflate the prices of many
things that are necessary for human sustenance. Coal is just as necessary to the
lives of the people as the meats and other
products that these people have been
dealing in. The same argument applies to
everything used by the human family in
Canada.
With these remarks I am going to .allow
this question to rest, and shall ask
this Chamber to taike some notice of the
serious position which we in Canada occupy
at the present time. I claim, honourable gentlemen, that if this mine is properly developed and business methods are applied
to it, the people of Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta will secure anthracite coal at
one-half of the 'price of coal to-day. I do
not think there is any question about that,
and I have gone into the matter very carefully. But beyond all that is the outstanding fact that we are at the present time at
the mercy of the coal producers on the

other side of the line. I believe that the
United States have been generous to the
people of Canada, and that there bas been
a fair distribution of coal. I am told that
this coal is selling in Regina for $17 or $13

suffered indescribable hardships from lack

pelled te burn their ouýtbuildings and even
their furniture in order to keep their children from freezing; and all this in spite of
the fact that we have the greatest coal depos.its in the world right at the doors of
these people who are alrnost perishing.
This, is not flattering to any government.
It is not flattering to the foresight of the

all these great coal areas and opened them
up in such a way that the people of the
western provinces could have secured coal
at the minimum cost. Surely I am net asking too much in the interests of the masses
of the people that our natural resources,
which belong to the people, should be conserved for their benefit-those resources
which were placed where they are by sone
great Power and for some good purpose.
Surely that purpose was not that some individuals should become millionaires while
the poor should freeze for the want of fuel.
I have no hesitation in urging that this
matter be pressed home to the Government
in such a way that it will see that the
tirne 'as come for the developnent of these
great coal areas. I would not confine this
development to one area alone, I would ask
the Government to develop other areas and
to put coal on the market so that the people
of the West could secure it at a minimum cost. I know that as soon as it is
sugges'ted that the Government should produce coal the private corporations will raise
a howl, and say that they are unable to
compete with the Government. All I can
say is that every private company that is
in that position should go out of business.
This coal should be sold to the people at
the lowest possible cost, without any regard
to the companies who are operating mines
in the West to-day. The people's necessi-

OCTOBER 7, 1919
ties in this regard must be the first consideration.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, like most men of deeply
philosophie mi,
the honourable gentleman is woefully deficient in logic. Like
others who are strong supporters of new
economie theories, he -bases his argument
upon very few facts.
The bonourable gentleman bas, spoken
about the crime it has been that this particular mine in this particular locality of
the Dominion bas not been opened up. He
bas charged everybody in sight except himself with laches in this. matter. This mine
that bas flot been sending forth its product
broadcast over the wide plains of the Nortwest was in the course of being developed
by a strong combination, and the littie
children that hie depiets as weeping from
coki and bunger in the bamiets of Saskatehewan'would have bad that cause of grief
removed if this strong company or coinbination that was prepared to, take this mine
and d'evelop it had 'been allowed to go to
work. But this was prevented very large]y
by the eloquence of my honourable friend,
and this vast treasiure that was deposited
underneath'the ground during the eons of
the l)ast still rerpains undeveloped,! and
stili the small Saskatchewan child cries for
coal.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: 1 am well satisfied with my achievement.
Hon. Mr. PÔWER: The hon ourable gentleman says that the Government should
do this. My honourable friend is a strong
advocate of government ownersbip.
Hon. Mr. BRADBUUY: Not always.,
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
My honour4b1e
iriend compares the importance of coal toý
the importance of wheat. Because it is juat
as important that the public should be kept
warm as that they should be fed, my honourable friend says that the Government
sbould operate the mines and warm the
people. If my honourable friçnd la logical,
as he ought to be, ail the wheat farms of
thia country sbould be operated by the Governinent. It la just as important that that
which produces food should be operated by
the Government as that which produces
warmth. Yet my honourable friend, I think,
will flot go quite so far as that, because
then bis position would appear as ridiculoua as it really la.
My honourable friend speaka about how
easy it is to operate this coal mine, because of its peculiar situation. Wby, it

131

would almost operate automatically. Ac-r
eording to niy bonourable friend, a sort of
lodestonte migbt be arranged outside the
mine yvbich viould draw out the minerai.
My honourable friend seema to think that
that is the only case of a coal mine being
located ini the side of a bill; and in that be
shows hia ignorance. My honourable friencl
should know that in any hilly country that
is where coal mines are located. The situation of this coal mine la not different from.
that of others. I have neyer seen it, neither
has he, se we have an equal knowledge in
that regard.
I had -once some stock in a coal mine.
We had the samne conditions as those whi-ch'
nmy honourable friand dlaims exist in this
case, but we did not find that we could
mine the coal for notbing. We did not find
it se cbeap to mine as my honourable
frîend says it woquld be-and when hoe deals
with the Miners' Federation, hoe will findbis fifty cents multiplied by at least four.
That la the difficulty of the situation. Yoii
eau compose a beauttMul story if you manufacture ycur facts as you go along; but
wben you are confined to realit-y, your story
is quite a different thing. Now, it seems
to me that this Government bas on ita
bandas, in the operation of. the railways
which it has taken over, sufficient to occupy it for sanie time; and, untýil this Government. or any other Government that
may suc-ceed it, bas demonatrated to the
people of Canada that governiment ownerslip -as regards railways is an absolute succes," I think we had better wait' rather
than expeet the Govern'ment -to operate -the
coal mines or the-wheat fields of this country or any other thing. I believe in government supervision of ail these great
enterprises, but- I do net believe in gov-r
erniment ownership and government operation.
Hon. EDWARD MICHENER : Honourable gentlemen, I would like, in support
of the motion, to a.dd'a few words to what
bas already been said by -the honourable
member wbo had in'troduced this important
question. *The honourable member from
Selkirk (lHon. Mr. Bradbury) bas submitted to this House some very interesting
data wh-ich ghould, I think, oommand tbe
carnea-4s attention of this honourable body
as Weil ae the immediate consideration of
the Governanent. The honourable member
gave us somte figures as -to the coal areas
and reserves of our Dominion. He ststed
tbat the province of Alberta alone had one
trillion tons -of coal. This bald statement,
does not in itself eonvey a very adequate

SENATE
idea of the immense coal reserves of that
province. On a former occasion it waa myr
privilege to say that in the province o!
Alberta, the province which 1 have the
bonour to represent in -this honourabie
Chamber, we have 85 per cent of the coal
reserves o! the Dominion of Canada, over
50 per cent o! the coal raserves o! the British Empire and 15 per cent of the coal
reserves of the world. We have in the provin-ce of Alberta alone, sucb a quantity o!
ceaI that it would take 100,000 min-ers,
working 300 days a year and mining an
average of five tons e.ach, over 6,000 years
to exhaust, the coal reserves o! the province.
The honourable member !rom Selkirk bas
brought this question te, the attention of
the House, -and I hope of the Government,
nt a very opportune turne. I observe that
,one o! the recommendations submitted by
ithe Great War Veterans' Association to, the
(Committee of 'the House of Gommons
lfor consideration refers to the developThe
iment o! our naturai resources.
.ýa.rguments which have been adv.aneed
'by both of the honourable gentlemen who
have spoken before me on this question
involved the broad issue of government
ownership or government control of our
naturai resources. The honourable member from Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) spoke
on the opposite side; but 1 tbink bis speech
but accentuated the importance of the
question which. the honourable member for
Selkirk lias brought to our attention. The
honourable gentleman from New Brunswick
criticised the logic of the honourable mcmber who introduced the question; but perlîaps his own logic was somiewhat fallacious.
The honourabie member from Sussex
said thaýt the people of Canada have on
their hands to-day a great raiiway problem,
and that it was sufficient for the Government to solve that great problem before
Now,
mndertaking any other enterprise.
lionourable gentlemien, I submait that if the
Governnîent, would undertake the opening
up and development o! some of our great
îîoturai wealth in Western 'Canada it would
hielp to solve at the same time the problem
of our railways. We have, as you know,
two transcontinental lines now controlled
by the Dominion Government and running
aIl the way to the Pacifie. For a large part
of that distance there is not productive
traffic; and, in order to make these great
national bigliways profitable and productive
to the people of Canada, we must create
trafflo for tbem. The coal area in northern
Alberta contains the highest grade of coal
klîat bas yet been discovered in the DomHon. Mr. MICHICNER.

inion of Canada. It is an anthracite grade.
1 submit, honourable gentlemen, that if the
Governmient did undertake to open up this
coal area and to bring the coal for distribution, not only to the western provinces
but aiso to Ontario and Quebec, a great
part of the railway problemn which is noff
upon our hands would be solved. By the
creating of traffic for our national highways, not only would this problem be
solved, but coal would be brought to the
people of Ontario and of Quebec much more
cbeaply than they are getting it fromn the
United IStates to-day.
We will say for the purposes of argument
,that the figure.s -submitted by the honourable member who introduced the subject,
as to the cost of mîning coal on the Smoky
river, are too low; that the mining would
cost more than 50 cents per ton. 1 uniderstand that the property is situated most
favourably for low cost of mining. But we
will say that it would cost one dollar a
ton to mine the coal, and another dollar
a ton to load it op board the cars.
As the honourable gentleman stated,
the mines are only 60 or 70 miles fromn
the Canadian National railways west of Edmonton. We 'could put the ceai on board
the cars for $2 per ton, at about 100 miles
on the other si-de of Edmonton. Let us allow
$6 per ton for carrnage, which. assuming
that there are on the average 40 tons of coaI
te the car, would make $240 per car. As we
have low gradients on both our national
railways, we ýcould carry a large numiber of
cars, and the -coal hrought, from that area,
even tbough it were hauled a long distance,
would supply a very remunerative traffic
for our great national railways, and wouild
at the same time lening the coal down to
Ontario at a much lower price than we have
to pay at the present time for Pennsylvania
coal. The $2 a ton which it would cost to
put the coal on board the cars and the $6
for bringing it to Ontario woulýd inake $8,
and, if tAie overhead charges are placed at
$1, the cost to the consumner in Ontario
would be $9 a ton. 1 understand that to-day
the price paid in the city of Ottawa for
Pennsylvania coai is $12 a ton. So there
would be a saving of $3 per ton to the
people of Ontario; there would be a profitable traffle created for our national railways; and you would be to a certain extent
settling the unrest in the country by dex-elop)ing our own resources for our own
people and keeping the money in our own
country instead of sending it out. I submit, honourable gentlemen, that it does
seemn iniprovident for the Dominion of Can-

OCTOBER 7, 1919
*ada, possessing as it does quch a large peroentage of the coal reserves af the world, to
be importing coal at such a high price from
the people of another country.
i
This whole question af government ownership is, as 1 have said, a very broad question, and one which needs to be very carefully examined, and I do believe that, if the
Gove.rnment wauld undertake something af
a constructive character along the lines of
the development of aur great natural assets,
we should solve ta quite a large extent the
unrest in the country to-day. The people
would see that the Govern:ment of the country was earuestly desirous of doing something in their interest. It would provide
employment in *Canada for aur surplus
labour, and it would at the same time reduce
considerably the cost af living by reducing
the cost of one of the essential coinmodities
of the people of this country.
Personally I arn soniewhat of a believer
in publie ownership and. development af
our resources, in theory; but I do not
believe, that it would, be practicabie, or advisable for the Goverument tô undertake
the develupment af our coal areas, that ie,
ta take over all the coal development, af
Canada. 1 do believe that if the Government would aperate some of our coal -areas
it would'pravide a healthy campetitian with
the private concerns which are now operating coal mines in Canada, and would
have the goad. effect ai regulating the price
of coal andi making it more reasanable ta
the consumer. I believe it is a goad thing
for the Government to create a healthy
campetitian in variaus lines of industry
for the public good; and, if -the Government wauld undertake, in the near future
the development of such a coal area às lias
been spaken of by the honourable member
from Selkirk, the effeet 'would be, generally
speaking, very beneficial. to Canada, in
the way of reducing the, cast of living,
developing aur natural resources, cr.eating
wealth ta pay off our public debt, keeping
aur money in aur awn coun'try, praviding
employment for labour, praviding trafflo
for aur great national railways, and thus
helping ta a considerable extent in the
solution of the railway prablem, and last,
but not least, in allaying the unrest in the
country. 1 believe that some such constructive measure on the part of the Government
cf the day -would Ibe ai great benefit in the,
development af industry and would not
affect, as my honourable friend i rom Sussex'
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) seemed ta think, the
private interests which have undertaken
the development of coal mining in Canada.

133

It would provide a healthy campetition,
and -would thus regulate ta a reasonable
extent the prie 'which the people have ta
pay for coal. There, is no doubt, honourable gentlemen, thoet, in some in-stances at
least, we are paying too high for aur coal
to-day. I believe that it is a rat'her dangeraue palicy ta appoint commissions -ta regulate the prices of commoditiee. It interferes 'with the law cti supply and denîand,
ît throws out af balance -the laws of trade
and commerce, and At is bound ta entangle
and hamper and jeapardize the financial
interesté of the country. 1 believe it is mare
ýreasanable 'that 'the 'prices of coal and
other commodities shauld be regulated
by the Government offering a healthy
competitian along different lines of develupment, rather than 'by the unnatural restrictions cf' a commission interfering witli the
natural laws of trade and of supply and
demand.
Ba, vàèwing hils question from whatever
standpoint we .msy, I 'believe the time has
camne and is now opportune for the developnment oi the great assets of Canada. Whmile
it may not be desirable or advisable, as I
say, ta undertake in :any bread way goverriment ownership and development of our
great resources, yet I believe 'that the 'Governmient could well afford 'ta undertake the
develoipuent of some of our great natural
assets in the interest of the people of
Canjada.
Han. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, I 'have listened witha great deal
of intere8t ta the speeches that have been
made by the hanourable gentlemen who
have spoken on this matter. 1 think that the
information that has been given ta us by the
honourable -member fro-m Selkirk (Han. Mr.
Bradbury) la very valuable, -and shows us
that we have great resaurces in co-al in this
Dominion ai ýCanada. The great difficulty
that I have found with regard ta thm'is question of developxmnent has been, esfpeci'ally in
the case ai coal, that tihe enarmous resources

of the -country have made it very

diffleult ta bring 'about the develaipment.
Private enterprises, in progpecting, have
discavered co-al in -a 'large number of places.
After it 'has been discovered in one place
ather coai deposàs af a higher qu-al'ity have
been disoovered elsewhere. That l'as militated againat the apening up ai variaus
mines.
The question ai the regulatian ai, the price
of coal is nat a new one. Goveruments in
this cou~ntry have been trying ta deal with
it for a gaod many years past. Hanourable
gentlemen wlll remeniber that a special ar-

134

SENATE

rangement was made with the Ganadian
Pacific Railway Company respecting the
Crowsnest coal develo:pment, for the regulation of the rates on the railway. When
those coeal lands were turried over to private
interests a large area was reserved to the
Government in order that'if the price of coal
became exorbitant, i.t might be regulated in
some way by Government development. It
was thought wise that the Government
should be in a position to take over coal
lands and develop them, in order 'to place
coal on the market in competition with
private owners.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Will the honouraibl gentleman permit me just one question' Does the honourable gentleman happen to know whether that coal reserve to
whicl he refers still remaiins in the Crown?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I could not answer
that question at the time, but I should
imagine that it does.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I hope it does.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I never heard of it
being parted with. I should hope ithat it
still remains in the Crown. As I understand, there is a large area of valuable bituminous coal. It was, I think; a wise move
on the part of the Government to retain it.
In regard to this particular area which
my honourable friend from Selkirk has
dealt with, during the inquiry last session
it was developed that very valuable coal
was to be found. We all know that in the
West and in Ontario coal of that quality
is very desirable and is in great d.emand.
To my mind, however, the question is
whether it is advisable for the Governmnent
to take hold of the development of these
areas. At the present time the Government
railway is the nearest railway to these particular deposits, and the ,question which I
think the Government should seriously consider is the building of a road into that
part of the country for the purpose not only
of supplying their own roads with that class
of coal, which I understand is mosit valuable for the purpose, but also with the idea
,f placing this coal on the market for the
benefit of the public. But I think the Governmenit should be very careful in dealing
with the question of taking hold of the actual
development of these areas, because what
would apply to coal to-day might at some
other time apply to some other mineral resource of this country, and the Government might find themselves confronted with
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

demands in every direction to take action
towards 'the development of the resources
of the country, and I do not think it is
really a function of the Government to do
that kind of work. If they were to undertake work of that kind, I think they would
be interfering very greatly with the enterprise of the people, and the result, instead
of being for the benefit of the people, might
be to the disadvantage of the whole country.
It would appear to me that the proper policy
for the Government to pursue would be
to exercise control over the mines, a control which they could exercise by reason
of 'the fact that at the present time they
have the railway in their own hands. By
that means they could give the people the
benefit of a low rate on the railway and to
a great extent should be able to control
the cost of production of coal at the pit's
mouth. But I do not think that the country is prepared for any such policy as that
of the Government actually operating the
ceal mines or undertaking other work of a
similar nature in connection with the natural resources of the country.
Hon. Mr. MeMEA-NS: May I ask the
honourable gentleman from Selkirk if he
has any information as to the quantity of
coal used by the Government of Canada,
or to what extent they are purchasers in
the coal markets?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: In reply to the
honourable
gentleman
fromi
Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans), I may say I
T
but
information
that
not
have
know that a tremendous aimount of coal
is required by the Government railways
in the West alone. I understand that when
the Government took over the Canadian
Northern railway there were some coal
mines operated for the benefit of that road.
I do not know whether or not the Government secured those coal mines; I think
at the present moment the Government is
purchasing every ton of coal used on those
systems. If that is so, it emphasizes more
than anything else what J have been trying
to bring to the attention of the House,
namely, the necessity in the public interest
of the Governnent opening up some of
these great deposits. It does seem to me
that it is more than ridiculous that we
should have a transcontinental railway running through coal areas, and still be purchasing coal from private individuals for
the operation of that railway.
The motion was agreed to.

INTERPRETATION BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 4,
an Act to amend the Interpretation Act.
Hon. Mr. Brad'bury in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Can any honourable
friend say if he has the Orders in Council
that he promised to bring down to the
House?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
some Orders in Council. When this subject
was up a few days ago I think I promised

135

that I would bring down a copy of the
Order in Council by which the Interpretation Act as we have it on the statuteÀbook
was made applicable to the Orders in Council passed under the War Measures Act.
I hold in my hand that Order in Council
which reads as follows:
His Ercellency the Governor General in Coun-

cil, under and by virtue of the authority conferred by the War Measures Act, 1914, is
pleased on the recommendation of the Minister
of Justice to order and doth hereby order and
declare that every provision-of the Intepretation Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906,
shall extend and apply to every order and regulation heretofore or hereafter passed by the
Governor in Council in execution of the powers
conferred by the War Measures Act, 1914, except in so far as any such provision (a) la inconsistent with the intent or object of such
order or regulation, or (b) would give to any
word, expression or clause of any such order or
regulation an Interpretation repugnant to the
subject matter or the context, or (c) ls in any
such order or regulation declared not applicable thereto.

As I mentioned the other day, upon the
declaration of peace this Order in Coancil
will cesse to exist, and therefore there will
be no rule of interpretation applicable to
the Orders in Council which have to-day
been passed.
The honourable gentleman from Middle-

ton pointed out the desirability of considering any proceedings that had been instituted by way of inquiry and action under
any of the Orders in Council. In reply to
him I inay say that probably the only commission that really entrenches upon what
I might term private interests would be
the commission appointed to inquire into
the paper and pulp business. Last session
we passed substhntive legislation by which
the jurisdiction of that commission has
been continued; therefore provision has already been made for that condition: Under
the circumstances I eau see no objection
that can be raised to the Interpretation Act
practically taking the place of or superseding the Order in Council to which I
have just referred.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I assume that the
object of the Bill is to apply the Interpretation Act only for the time during
which these Orders in Gouncil, by virtue
of the powers derived from the War
Measures Act, can làst; and there is no
intention of making Orders in Council similar to these?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Section 8 of th
Interpretation Act provides:

136

SENATE

Act may be amended, altered, or reby an Act passed in the same session of
Parliament.
Any

Pealed

If you substitute the words " Order in
you would
Council " for the word "Act'
have the strange anomaly that any Order
in Council might be amended, altered, or
repealed, which, manifestly, would not be
the intention.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would be by Parliament itself.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, I do not
think so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It says:
Any Act may be amended, altered, or repealed by an Act passed in the same session of
Parliament.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes; but by this
Bill you are providing that the Council
shall have the powers that Parliament bas;
so in that case it is quite clear that the
present Orders in Council, though made
only to last during the war, might to-morrow be altered, amended, or repealed by the
Governor in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me that it is quite manifest that these
Orders in Council cannot be continued
after the declaration of peace, except in so
far as, say, under the Interpretation
Act a continuing act is being performed in pursuance of the power embodied in 'the Order in Council itself.
But let us assume for the moment that
these are Acts of Parliament. Is there any
good reason why this should not be done?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Well, unless it is
intended o continue indefinitelyHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it is
not intended; it is simply to give continuance to any Act that of nècessity is in
the course of performance under the Orders
in Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I dare say that
is the object, but I am afraid the language
used would carry us much farther than that.
If this Bill passes, then the Governor in
Council may amend, alter, or repeal any of
these Orders in Council and substitute
therefor anything he chooses.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
these substitutions should operate only
during the life of the War Measures Act.
The War Measures Act itself falls to the
ground upon the declaration of peace.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourahle gentlemen, I have no objection to this Bill so far
as it goes, -and I would have no further objection to it if the Government are sure
that there is no Order in Council involved
other than ithe one that was dealt with by
statute last winter-that is, the one in relation to paper-and .that no injustice may
be done to any subject on account of his
remedy being taken away although his
right remained in existence. But I do not
see any reason why there should not be
added to this Bil.1 the clause which I am
about to suggest. I would in the first place
refer bonourable members to the last half
of section 5 of the War Measures Act, which
provides:
But any and ail proceedings instituted or
commenced by or under the authority of the
Governor in Council before the Issue of said
last-mentioned proclamation-

That is, the proclamation of peace-the continuance of which he may authorize,
may be carried on and concluded as if the said
proclamation had not issued.

The statutes under this Act are dealt with

by the judges. When rights and obligations are continued that have existed under
a law which has been repealed, they are
dealt with by the courts. Now, under Orders in Council there may be rights and
obligations arising that have to be determined, or may be determined, by
commissions. What I sec is that it is just
possible that one of these Orders in Council might be continued under that section
5. and then, at soie later date, the commission might cease to act. For instance
the cominissioner might die and there wiud
be no person appointed to fill his place.
Furthermore, some rights and obligations
are created without the appointment of
commissions, or the commissioners are appointed by a separate Order in Conncil.
Such Orders in Council might drop, snd I
can sec the possibility of a mon having a
r:ght under one of these OrdJers in Coancil
which you are by this new Bill continuing,
and yet having nowhere to go ta obtain his
remedy. That is quite possible, in my
view, although we have the assurance of
the Government of the day that there are'
no cases such as these. But I do not know
that, and what I would suggest to the Governnent would be to add this provision.
It will not interfere in any case that is now
provided for. It will serve as a blankcet
clause to cover any possible loophole that
there may be in existing legislation, in
order to give a remedy to a man who would

OCTOBER 17, 1919
not have Ai otherwise. I would suggest
that the following clause be added:
And -the Exchequer Court of Canada shall
have power and jurisdiction, on petition, to
InquIre Into and determine (in cases where
there is no exlsting provision for compensation)
what sums ought In reason and fafrness to be
pald out of public funds to persons In respect
of loss Incurred or damage sustalned by reason
of Interference with their property through thue
exercise by the Crown of its rights and duties
under such orders and regulatjons.
I may say that in England a commission
was appointed by an Order in Council, the
greater part of the language cf which is
contained in this suggested amendment of
mine. Over there, as in Canada, they have
a great many statutes providing methods
of assessing compensation when property
is taken; but it was seen that under the
confusion created by the war and owing to
the arbitrary steps that had' to be taken
in defence of the realm, there might be cases
.for which none cf the existing acts provided compensation.
They constituted a
commission. The only substantial differen-ce
there may be between ýthe English comnpensation. measure and this amendment of
mine is that in England the commission
is authorized simply to assess dam ages
and to report. 1 do not think that that is
qui-te suitable te jour circumstances.
I
think .i't is far better to, give the Exchequer
Court
juriscliction,
and
let
the
Exchequer
Court determine the
mater. I feel inciined,, then, te. move:
that ýthis clause which I hav 'e suggested be
added te the Bill. If the Government are
not quite ready te deal with that to-day perhaps it could stand oveýr.
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGCéHEED:- I am not
prepared te say that the ýGovernment will
reject any suggestion which isa made along
this lime; but provision has already been
made un-der section 7 cf the War Measures
Act whereby any property, or the use thereof, may be compensated for by reference te
the Exchequer Court. To what extent this
would create a new obligation as against the

have takcen, place in pursuance of the powers
contained in the War Measures Act before
being able te pronounce with any intelligence upon the scope of the amend-ment
which has been moved by my honourable
friend. I arn quite satisfied that the Coinmittee rise snd report progress, an-c that we
make inquiry into the, soundness of the
proposai which. he has made. Inasmnch as
it is lot intended te inte-rfere with the

137

clause before us, I should like the House
te -puss upon this clause. Then the Coinmittee can rise. We can give consideration
te this .propesed amendment when the Bill
is before the Com'mittee at its next sitting.
Hon. Mr. POWER: There are one or two
things ýthat occur to me with respect te this
clause as we have iA here. The proposed
clause reads:
Every provision of the Interpretation. Act
shall extend and apply to every order a nd
regniation heretofore or hereafter passed by
the Governor in Counil-

As I understand it, the objeat cf this
clause as we have it is to provide that as ta
the Orders in Council passed under the
authority of the War Measures Act the provisions of the Interpretation Act shaîl apply;
but the Cominittee will sea that under the
wording ef this clause, those provisions will
apply te other Orders, in Council that have
ne connection whatsoever-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, but
the honourable member has not read far
encugh. Let him read the following words:
-by the Governer In Cauneil In the execution
of any powers delegated'by statute.

That is the qualification.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Yes, I had noticed
that, and I was geing to refer te it: " In
the execution cf any powers delegated by
statute." There may be, and there have
ýbeen, various powers delegated to the Governor in Council by statute; but, as I understand, the desire cf the Governmnent
is that the powers delegated by the War
Measures Act are the only cnies te be covered by this enactment, and I think that
in order te make that clear this clause
should be amended se as to substitute for
the words " delegated by statute - the
words " delegated by the War Measures
Act." Then ne question could arise as te
whether the power was delegated by the
War Measures Act or by some other statute.
When yen say " heretofore"- there is ne
restriction: "Every prevision shaîl extend
and apply ta every order and regulation
heretofore or hereafter passed by the Gevernor in 'Council in the execu tion cf any
powers delegated by statute." I think that
you should restrict that te the pcwers delegated by the War
Measures Act.*
Hon, W. B. ROSSE: 1 think the honourable gentleman wifl find that there are
a great many Orders in 'Council that were
passed by virtue cf other statutes, quite
independently cf the War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. POWER. That may be.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: And there may be
more need for this legislation with respect

Hon. ARTHUR BOYER: Could we not
try to agree upon something which would
give this Bill a more angelie countenance?
Line 13 contains the words "or would give
to any word, expression, or clause thereof
an interpretation repugnant." , Is that word
"repugnant " generally used in law? ,
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is a good word.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: I had never seen it
used for such a purpose as this.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
used very frequently in the statutes.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Very well, if the
lawyers are satisfied.
Section 1 was agreed te.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Committee rose and reported progress.
BOARD OF COMMERCE BILL.
SECOND READrNG.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 12, an Act to amend
The Board of Commerce Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it will
probably be recalled that at the last session of Parliament we passed an Act for
the constitution of a Board of Commerce.
It was then provided that the salaries of
the members of the board should be fixed
by Order in Council. It is thought undesirable to -do this-that they should bo
fixed by statute. The principal provision
of this Bill is that which fixes those salaries. The other sections have to do very
largely, if not altogether, with procedure.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, as I understand it, this is a
Bill anending a Bill which we passed in
the dying hours of last session. The original Bill was a rather long one, with
Its purpose was the
several clauses.
creation of a board known as the Board of
Commerce. This board has been sitting
now for some time, trying to arrive at a
solution of the question of the high cost
of living. I have noticed that the board
bas corne in for considerable criticism in
various 'parts of the country, as to the
action the board has taken, especially in
trying te fix prices. On looking at this
Bill, which we now have had more time
t
to study · han we had at last session when
it was introduced here, we find that the
board is largely overridden by the GovHon. Mr. POWER.

ernment: Any order that it makes can be
rescinded or amended by the Government.
So the powers of the board are entirely
under government control and the usefulness of the board in determining questions
of prices and the high cost of living is, I
think, limited very much to inquiring into
such questions. 0f course, the board may
fix the price of any article; but the Governinent can immediately rescind or amend
the order. I dJoubt that the work of this
board is doing very much good. In the
present condition of the country we should
probably be able to obtain better results
for the people by leaving the question of
prices to the natural law of supply and
demand. Whenever you try to interfere
with those laws you find, I think, that
considerable difficulty and hardship occur,
by reason of the fact that you cannot provide for every case, for when you are fixing
the price of one article you do not see
what the effect of that is going to be on a
large number of other articles.
One good feature of this Bill is 'that,
whereas in the statute of last session it
was left to the Governor in Council to fix
the salaries, they are now te he fixed by
statute, and we are to have an opportunity
of knowing exactly what the salaries are.
Another question that has been raised
in regard te this matter is, where the orders of the board are to be registered, so
that the public may know what they are.
In looking over the Act of last session, I
do net sec that it contains any provision
making it necessary for those orders to
be registered in any particular place. I
presume that the honourable leader of the
Government can tell us where the head
office is supposed te be located, and that
in accordance with the ordinary custom,
the orders of the board will be registered
with the secretary at the head office, wherever it is.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Under
section 42 of the Act provision is made
for general rules, and the head office will
be at Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is the position at the present time?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Under section 15 of the Act the secretary
shall reside in the city of Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: When we are considering the matter in committee I should
like my honourable friend to produce the
instructions issued by the Government to
this board, if such exist.

OUTOBER 7, 1919
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THE TREATY OF PEACE BILL.
CONSIDERED IN CoMMITTE.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into committee on Bill 3,
an Act for carrying into effect the Treaty
of Peace between His Majesty and certain
other powers. Hon. Mr. Boyer in the Chair.
On the preqmble:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A suggestion was made when this Bill came up
for second reading, that it should be more
comprehensive than it is, and should be
made to apply to the other treaties which
necessarily will have to be negotiated with
different enemy countries. A treaty bas
already been signed between the Allies and
Austria, and treaties-are also being negotiated at the' present time with different
enemy countries. I therefore ask that the
House concur in the following amendment,
namely, that in the recital of the Bill the
following should appear:
And whereas a Treaty of Peace between the
Allied and Associated Powers and Austria has
since been slgned, on behalf of His Majesty
acting for Canada, by the plenipotentiaries
therein nàned; and whereas other treaties of
peace
between
the Allies
and Associated
Powers or some of them and the other nations
with whom His Majesty Is or has been at war
may be signed on. behalf of His Majesty acting
for Canada.

And that where the word "treaty" appears
the plural form, " treaties," should be substituted. This will give the necessary
authority to the Government to do what is
specified therein as to other treaties that
may be negotiated from time to time, and
thus obviate the necessity of again calling
Parliament for the purpose of considering
a Bill ratifying those treaties.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In that way I presume we shall be impliedly agreeing to these
treaties? The Government has no intention
of bringing down a resolution asking us
to approve of the treaties?
.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Government would only be too glad to bring
down those treaties and to give Parliament
the fullest information on the subject.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not suppose
it matters so very much whether the treaties for the next year or the next twenty
years are provided for in the fashion which
my honourable friend now suggests. These
treaties have been or are going to be ratiflied by the British Parliament, and we.

139

especially on this side of the House, Who
want to be consistent and logical, claim
that any approval on our part is like the
fifth wheel t0 a coach. The treaties with
all the other peoples with whoam we have
been at war are approved of in anticipation, and I think it is a dose that it is
almost impossible to swallow ta ask Parliament .to approve in advance of treaties
of which they know nothing-treaties which
have not even been pub before us, let alone
considered, and some of which -I do not
think have been reduced to writing. Personally I do not care, because I think it
matters not at all whether we approve or
do not approve, because that is a function
which is going to be exercised by the British Parliament with all the binding effeeta
that ratification implies. Has this amendment gdne through the Commons?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, this
is an amendment to the Bill, but it is being
introduced at the instance of the Government, and of course will go back to the
Commons, and the preamble will be accepted by the Commons. If the position taken
by my honourable friend is constitutionally
correct, that it is not necessary that these
treaties should be submitted to Parliament
for ratification, but in any event would be
ratified, then no har is done.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Except that I
think it is putting Parliament in a very
ridiculous position. I strongly object, not
because it affects the matter, but because
it affects the dignity of Parliament. If it
were a matter of Canadian concern only,
it would not be so serious; but we are
going ta be quoted all ov'er the civilized
world as having approved in advance a
treaty that we have not seen.
Hon. Mr. POWER: f understand from
,the leader of the Government that the
Treaty with Austria has actually been
signed in Europe.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable
friend say what other treaties this will
cover?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
cover the Treaty with Turkey and the
Treaty with Bulgaria. I am unaware at
the present moment what other enemy
countries it is necessary to negotiate treati.es with; but whatever treaties are entered
into growing out of the recent struggle, this
Bill of course would apply to.
The amendment was agreed to, and the
preamble, as amended, was agreed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Government, under section 4,. will exercise its
own discretion as to when that proclamation
should issue. That is the only way. The
machinery is already providedi there.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The answer to that is
that that may be 15 years from now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Government bas te assume the responsibility
of that.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Tfhat is all very well.
The Government may assume the responsibility; but in the meantime there are many
persons who have to assume the responsibility of carrying on their business, and
who find this questtion as to whether we are
at war or net interfering very much with
them.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I do not think
my honourable friend need worry. Does ho
not consider that when the proclamation is
made by the Imperial authorities the courts
of justice in Canada will consider themselves bound by that, notwithstanding any
action the Government may take in the
matter?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But why should a
man have to go te the courts? Why does not
Parliament tell the people off-hand?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does the honourable gentleman from Middleton know
wbether or not the date for the declaration

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No reference to the

Hon. W. B. ROSS: The statute that was
passed in November, 1918, is, beyond a
doubt a result of a report that was made
by a commission of nine judges and lawyers
as to the meaning of the words "the termination of the war," "the end of the war," "the
declaration of peace." It was pointed out
that there were eight or ten different ex.
pressions used in the legislation, and they
advised that a statute be passed fixing the
date. I have no doubt that this statute,
passed in Novenber, 1918, by the Imperial
Parliamenit, was enacted in order to get

of any law or action or anything else, even
by 'the British Government.
There was another case in question. The
Railway Department of ithe 'Dominion Government expropriated two wharves of mine
in the city of Halifax, on which pier No. 2
and pier No. 3 are now built. Very naturally I sought sme compensation from the
Government. My honourable friend from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) will bear me
out in this. In the trial the Government
set up the contention that my remuneration was to be dimini'shed on the ground
that I had not been in possession of the
land and water lot in question for 60 years.
Well, I was able to demonstrate by witnesses that we had been in possession of it
for 60 years, and the judge -decided that that
contention was to be struck out of the case.
My honourable friend from Middleton did
ie the honour on that occasion to defend
nie. I was opposed by very eminent counsel, .Sir Robert Borden and Mr. Cahan, the
leader of the Conservative Opposition in
the legislature; but, notwithstanding all
that, the eloquence and legal knowledge of
my honourable friend from Middleton prevailed, and I obtained a verdict against
them. Therefore I say that this legislation
is improper under the circumstances.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend point out in a more
specifie manner the way in which this
world interfere with the interests which he
has mentioned? Under the law of 1918, there
had to be authority for the building of the
structure, for which we now propose making further provision. If my honourable
friend's structures were not in acçordance
with the law of 1918, this would in no sense
fuirther interfere with them.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I do not think there
is any restriction whatever against any
person attacking the title of a property or
inducing the Government or any department of the Government to pronounce it to
be an obstruction. No matter when it was
erected, it is now by this law, if we pass
it, an obstruction, and is liable to be renioved, although it lias been in the possession of the owner maybe 100 years or
more. All the wharves and stores in the
city of Halifax would cone under this Act
-and, I daresay, all the wharves in the
whole province of Nova Scotia. I do not
know about the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: May I point out to
the honourable menber for Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Roche), that this amendment to section 5 has to be read in connection with
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

section 6 of the Act, which is chapter 115
of the Revised Statutes as amended by the
statutes of 1918. Under section 6The provisions of the two sections last preceding-

That is, sections 4 and 5-shall not affect any bridge constructed before
the 17th day of May, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, which hereafter requires
to be built or repaired, if such 'bridge, when
so rebuilt or repaired, does not interfere to a
greater extent with navigation than on the
said day or theretofore.

I think that covers the point that my
honourable friend has raised.
Hon. Mr. POWER: But honourable genteiien will see that this subclause 3 really
does away with that contention. It says:
The provisions of this sectionThat is, section 5apply and be deemed to have applied to
-shall
any work constructed built, or placed in, upon,
over, under, through, or across any navigable
water at any time before the 24th day of May,
one thousand nine hundred and elghteen.

I am not going to deal with that question
which has been placed before the Government already; but I shall call attention to
this point, which I think is more important.
Subclause 3 means, as I take it, that the
provisions of this section shall not apply to
works in non-tidal waters. This will take all
the obstructions in fresh water out of the
jurisdiction of the Governor in Council. I
should like to bear what the honourable
gentleman from Middleton (Hon. W. B.
Ross) thinks of that. When you say the
provisions of this section shall apply, you
practically say that the provisions of subcl-ises 1 and 2 shaH not .anply to works
other than those specifically mentioned
later on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the point
which I raised the other day, and which I
think, on reflection, is well taken. Let me
put it in another way. Sections 4 and 5 of
the original Act, chapter 115, require that
the Government shall approve the erection
of any bridge. In 1918, by section 2 of
chapter 33, we said that sections 4 and 5
of the Navigable Waters Protection Act are
repealed, and the following substituted
therefor:
No work shall be built or placed in, upon,
over, under, through, or across any navigable
water unless the site thereof bas been approved
by the Governor in Council, nor unless such
work is built, placed, and maintained in accordance with plans and regulations approved
or matie by the Governor in Council.

OCTOBER 7, 1919
Then, subsection 5, which it is no* proposed to amend, reads as follows:
Any work to which this part applies-which would be in tidal waters as well as
non-tidal watersHon. Sir JAMES LOtTGHEED: That is
the only one we are dealing with.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT (reading):
Any work to which this part applies whIch is

buit or placed upon a site flot approved by the
Governor In Council, or which is flot built or
placed In accordance with plans so approved,
or whIch, having been go built or piaced, is
flot inaintained I accordance with euch plans
or regulatIons. maiy be removed and destroyed
under the authority of the Governor In Couneil
by the Minister of Publie Works.

-and so on. We -say there that any work
of that sort may be removed by the Crown.
Now, we go on to say that will not apply.
If the amendment of the honourable gentlemnan from Hamilton. (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) is adopted, that wiIl not apply to
non-tidal waters, go any one can erect a
bridge in defiance of chapter 115.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG'HEED: No. We
are passing a specifie provision. simply as
to tidal waters, touching the works enumerated in that section. That does not disturb
the law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Bill says that
the provisions of the statute of 1918 shall
apply to ti-dal waters. The necessary iýmplication is that they shahl not apply to nontidal waters.
Hon.. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend will read sub-clause 3 he
wiil observe that this amendament is to be
applicable to a condition, that existed before
the 24th of May, 1918; and that particular
provision shahl apphy only to navigable
tidal waters; it will not apply to the other
general provisions.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I used rather
loose language. I ishould have said it wil
apply te future bridges, but to any bridge
that -was erected before the 24th of May,
1918, if the* obstruction is erected over a
non-tidal water, it dosa not matter to what
extent it infringes on the Act; it does not
matter to what extent it obstructs navigation iA is-not liable to be removed.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I shauld. like to hear
from the honourable gentleman ftoin Middleton (Hon. W. B. Rosa> on this point. He
probably lias thlought it.over.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, I have not.

Hou. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I inight
further say for the in-formation of the
House that what the Government bas in
view is this particular clsass of obstruction
erected over or through a navigable tidai
water.

Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I believe I know
what the Government is after. There is a
place somewhere around Hamilton, I believe, wbich to-day infringes chapter 115.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I submit in all
seriousness that the aîmendment will have
the effect of releasing wholly lrom the
operation o! chapter 115 all bridges ereeted
in. non-tidal waters 'before the 24th of May,
1918 , and to-day it does not matter to what
extent navigation has been obstructed, the
Governimnent will net have the power to
remnove the obstructions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
miay be something in the contention as to
the Government exercising the special
mnachinery designed by the Act for the removal of these structures; but it would
not give the right to a trespasser who had
erected a structure over an inland navigable
stream. This simply deals with a special
class of rnachinery to be put in'motion by
reason of navigable water being impeded.
It dosa flot interfere with the juriadiction
of the courts.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: If it is only with
regard to the matter o! executing the Government's wishes in the matter, why make
a difference between tidal and non-tidal
waters? Why apphy a remedy in one caseand refuse it in the otherP
1Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: One'
wrong might be very much greater than
the other, the trespass might be manifestly
greater; and in the public interest it might
involve some more radical machinery for
its removal.
Subsection 3 of section 1 was agreed to.
Subsection 2 was agreed to.
The preamble and title were agreed to.

CANADIAN

NATIONAL
INQUIRY.

RAILWAYS.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Government to the Act 9-10 George V, Chapter 13,
intituled, ".An Act to incorporate Canadian
National Railway Company and respecting
Canadian National Railways," and will inquire:
1. Has the organization of the Canadian National Railways been completed under the said
Act?
- Is the operation, further extension and
crnstruction of these railways being carried on
under the power conferred by the said Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to make a few remarks with regard to
the inquiry which stands in my name. I
think that, now that we are approaching
the end of the session, it is in the interest
of the country that we should know what
is the exact position with regard to the Act
which was placed on the statute book last
year, the Canadian National Railway Act.
The Bill, which was brought down in
another place, was passed with considerable haste. The Government, apparently,
were so anxious to get this Bill enacted
that they thought it necessary to introduce the closure in order te put the legislation through as quickly as possible.
That closure was really introduced before
the whole Bill was printed. Some 45
clauses were aidded to the Bill after the
closure rule was introduced. I mention
this to show the haste with which the
Government had this legislation passed.
The Bill came up here, was put through
the Senate, and was assented to on the 6th
of June; but, as far as I have been able to
ascertain, no action has been taken with
regard to the further incorporation of this

company, the formation of the Board of
Directors, and the placing under this Act
of the railways which it was intended to
include in it. As honourable gentlemen
may renember, provision was made in
clause 11 of the Act that the railways sbould
be brought under the control of the com-

pany by Order in Council.
read:

The clause

The Governor in Council may from time to
time by Order in Council entrust to the company the management and operation of any
lines of railway or parts thereof, and any property or works of whatsoever description, or
interests therein, and any powers, rights or
privileges over or with respect to any railways,
properties or works, or interests therein, which
may be from time to time vested in or owned
controlled or occupied by His Majesty, or such
part or parts thereof, or rights or interests
therein, as may be designated in any Order in
Council, upon such terms and subject to such
regulations and conditions as the Governor in
Council may from time to time decide; such
management and operation to continue during
the pleasure of the Governor in Council and to
be subject to termination or vdfriation from
time to time in whole or in part by the Governor
in Council.
Any such Order in Council shall
be laid before Parliament within ten days after
the opening of the next ensuing session, or if
Parliament be sitting at the time such Order in
Council is passed, then within ten days from
the date of said Order in Council.

So far I have not been able to find that

any Order in Council has been
under

the

ternis

passed

that clause to bring

of the Canadian National Railway Con-

OCTOBER 8, 1919
pany, and 1 think it is in the interest of
the country that the people should know
the present, situation of this railway. ,A
large amount o!f construction ie being carried on in various parts of the counitrýyby
the different rallways of the Canadian Northern Railway system, and, if 1 understand aright this Act, Chapter 13 of the
Statutes of 1919, its clauses 'would come
ixito force as soon as those railways -were
brought under the Act.
Honourable gentlemen may remember
that a change was made with regard to the
expropriation of land under the Canadian
National Railway Act, and it is quite possible that considerable hardship and difficulty might occur to individuals in cases
where one of the newly constructed *railways is running through their property.
There was brought to my attention during
the recess a case in which consiiderable
hardship is apparently being caused to individuals through the action that we took
last session in amending the Consolidated
Railway Act. At that time, as honourable
gentlemen will remember, we changed the
conditions under which arbitration proceedinga were to be carried out under the
Aot. In the case brought to my attention,
on account o! that change, certain mnatters
relating to the taking o! land for the railway had ail to be gone over again. Aithough the expropriation proceedinga had
been started before the new Consolidated
Railway Act came into effect, it was held
that, on account o! some alterations that
had to be ma dé and some new questions
that had arisen, the whole matter must be
taken up de novo before a judge o! the
County Court. lit seemed to me that that
was a hardship on the public. I think that
no honourable gentleman in this House ever
anticipated that such a condition would
arise alter that general Railway Act was
deait with. ýWe ail agreed, I think, that
the change respectiiig the C.oqnty Court
judge was a good change to make; but I
was mysel! under the impression that axjy
action under the old Act could be continued
before a Board of Arbitrators. I desire to
suggest to the Government that, if such
difficulties as 1 have indicated are possible
under the Canadian National Railway Act,
they should, in passing Orders in Council
under clause il of the Act, provide if possible that conditions of *this kind should
not arise when the various railways are
transferred fromn their present status and
broug-ht under the Canadian NTational Railway Act.

4

There is another point with regard to that
Act. As honourable gentlemen will rememl
ber, there was in that Act a clause which
took the auditing of the accounts of the Government railwàys out of the hande of the
Auditor General, and under the present.cii,cùmffstances we do nlot know exactly how
that matter stands. I presume that, had
the organiza *tien been proceeded with, and
had these railways been transferred to the
Canadian National ]Railway Company, the
auditing would be carried out under this
clause in the Act of last session; but in the
present situation the 'Goverument railw«ysý
I take it, would be subject to the General
Audit Act, and the accounts of those railways must now be kept under thé terme of
that Act, the accounts of the railways in
the Canadian Northern system muet be
kept according to the system to which they
have for a considerable time been accustomed.
At the end of last session the Minister
of Railways gave some figures with regard
to the amount of money that hie expected
would be required in connection with -railway construction and improvements this
year. Those figures were, I think, enough
to givé everybody who saw them cause for
refiection. The minister stated that the loss
on the Government railways for that fiscal
year would amount to $28,00O,00O. That represented the loss on the Canadian
Northern system, the Intercolonial, the
Transcontinental, and the other roàds.
Thien hie went on to show that for equipment, for betterment, and for construction
on these roads this year, a further sumn
amouiýting to about $52,50,000 would be
required, making a total sum of,$80,OOO,OOO
required for rail-way development at the
present time.
In view of the condition of the finances
ot tihis country as they are to-day, with the
.heavy «liabilities we have te meet, it is a
very sericus matter that we shauld have to
f ace a loss of this kind. .I do neot thin< any
honLurable gentleman in thi-s House was
aware o! tihose figures, beeause they were
brought down only art the very end of last
session'; and I have quoted themn here in
o.rder that we may be seized of the statement mnade by the Minister o! Bailways.
I do not intend 'to take up the time of the
House any longer tihan to say that I think
that tlhis is a very important matter, and
tihat we s'hould know what the position is
w'th regard to this question of! the organization of the Canadian National Railway.
and whether 'mny steps have been taken to
put this company in the way of being able

SENATE

to operate these railways under the Aot of
last session.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I hope to
be able to answer the question of my honourable friend to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, perhaps, strictly speaking, even
though the honourable gentleman has called
attention 'to this matter, it might be held
that after the leader of the House had given
an answer there should be no furtlher discussion. I do not think that is the general
uinderstanding; but I should like to make a
few remarks after the leader of the House
has spoken.
•
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
not have the answers to 'the questions until
to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Of course, in the form
in which the honourable leader cf the Opposition gave the notice, the whole matter
can be discussed, and the present is perhaps
a good time to say a few words about it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: One
would fancy that it would be desirable to
get the information first. However, it may
not be material to what my honourable
friend has to say.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I feel that I am in a
position to make certain statements, no
matter what the information may be; and
further, I think it well that the members
of the House should understand just what
the position is when 'the honourable gentleman brings down his answer, as ilt may be
held then that it is too late to express any
opinion. I am the more driven to that conclusion by reason of the fact that there is a
rumour, I do not know how well founded
that the Government -are on the eve of concluding an arrangement under which they
will take over the Grand Trunk railway
and its belongings.
Experience in the United States bas
shown that government ownership and
operation of railways is not a desirable
thing. The results there have been greatly
increased expenditure and lessened efficiency. We have had some experience in
Canada, and the figures which the honourable gentleman beside me (Hon. Mr. Bostock) bas referred to show that there bas
been a very heavy loss in connection with
the operation of railways by the Governnient. I say by the Government because,
as the honourable gentleman bas pointed
out, the Government and the corporation
which was created last session are practically the same thing-they work together.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.?

I leave out of the question altogether the
roads which were controlled by the Canadian Northern, and take those roads which
were, strictly speaking, Government roads.
The return which the honourable leader of
the Government laid on the Table the other
day shows that for the year ending the 31st
of March last the deficit on the Government
railways was $2,070,000-that is, on the Intercolonial and the road from Quebea to
w innipeg. Honourable gentlemen will bear
in mind that last year, owing to war conultions, the number of men transported over
the Government railways was enormously
increased, and the quantity of freight which
went to and fro between Halifax and St.
John at the one end and Montreal or other
western points at the other end was *much
increased; and we cannot expect te have as
large a revenue when we get back to normal
conditions.
If the Government take over the Grand
Trunk railway, as it is said they purpose
doing, they will have te meet, not only the
cost of operation-and our experience in the
Government operation of railways goes to
show that there would be no profit on that,
but prob-ably a loss-but they will have to
pay interest on the debt of the company.
Further than that, the Government will
have to pay the company large sums yearly.
As far as one can gather, the company's
claim is that they should be paid $4,500,000
a year by the Government. 1 understand
that the Government have gone so far as
to express their willingness to pay $3,500,000 a year. We have been dealing with such
very large figures during war time that
people look upon that as a very small thing;
but when you come to add a deficit of over
$2,000,000 to $3,500,U00 you will have $5,500,000 a year which the country will have to
pay.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am very
sorry to interrupt my honourable friend,
but do I understand that he seriously contemplates discussing the question of what is
to be donc by the Government as to the
Grand Trunk railway? That, apparently.
is w'hat he is proposing to do.
Hon. Mr. POWER: No.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My bonouraible friend is. discussing that question
now. I should like to know by what
authority ny honouraible friend is discussing anticipated legislation. He will have a
full opportunity to discuss it at another
time.

OCTOBER 8, 1919
SHon. Mr. POWER: I amn no't undcrtaking
to say whether or not -the Govéînn'ent aie
going to introduce such legisiation, but I
think it la possible they may; and, although
my voice is a very humble one, I think that
as a member of the 'Senate, I have a right
to express my opinion on this action, even
though it la only proposed. I thiink it would
be a very extraordinary thing to gay that the
merntbers of this HRouse should neyer express any opinion of a government measure
untdil that measure has been practically
pàissed. I think it is desirable that the
House should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion on a matter of great
public importance at such a stage that it
may be of some value.
Hon. Sir JAMES ýLOUGHEED: Would
flot it 'be desir able to put a motion on the
Motion Paper? Is my honourable friend,
out of a clear sky, going to diseuse a question that is not 'before the House, and a
question wvhich 'honourable gentlemen have
not in any way prepared themeelves to discuss? 1 think my honourablè friend opposite cannot complain, that I have ever
sought to place any restriction upon the
freedore o! debate; but to proceed under
this question to discuss -the acquiring of the
Grand Trunk Railway systemn is rather inposing on the H.ouse.
Hon. Mr. POWER: We are d'iscussing the
action or non-action of the Government
under the Act of ]ast year. Underthat Act
the Government woudd have the right to
tal<e over the Grand TrunIk railway; and I
think 1 have a perfect right to express my
opinion with respect to, the desirability of
that action.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE ÉD: I raise
the point of order that the matter is not debatable upon the inquiry on the Motion
Paper.
The Hlon. the SPEAKER: The point o!
order bas been raised that this question is
not debatable. I rule tihat 'the remarks of
the honouraible member for Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Power) ought to be confined to the inquiry now before the House.
Hon. Mr. POWER: «Under the circumstances, I suppose Hia Honour the Speaker
will allow mue to give notice o! a motion for
to-morrow or the day alter.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Before the
Orders of the Day are called, you may give
notice.
Now that the question bas been put and
discussed. if ther& is no motion for the ad-

journnerit o! the debate the question là
dropped.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I understand tuait
the leader o! the Government will answer
the question to-morrow.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
answer to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: *Do I understand that tbis inquiry remains on the
Motion Paper at the suggestion of tlig
leader of the GovernmentP
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If any honourable member o! this Flouse moves the adjournment o! the debate the question maybe d¶scussed to-morrow; but if nobodymnoves the adjournment of the deliate, nyruling is that the question drops.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Thewhole trouble arose from -ny honourable
friend who made the inquiry being preina-ture in discussing it. He placed a questiont
on the Motion Paper, and proceeded to discuss a very.wide question in a very wide
manner, notwithstanding that 1 had said
that I was flot prepared to answer it until
to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BELCO-UET: If my honourable
friend answers the question there will be
no discussion. If any discussion is to take
Place, it musi take place now.,
Hon. Mr. TESSIER.- I understand that
no discussion is allowed on a question. I
understood that His Honour the, Speaker
decided that there was no debate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Under
the inquiry, framed as it is, there could not
have been a debate, because my honourable
friend simply made an inquiry which I
could have answered bad I the information.
But, instead o! waiiing for the answer he
proceeded to debate the question, and to
attack the Government on its policy in reference to the Grand Trunk railway, although I had said that I would nQt be able
te answer the question until to-morrow.
My bonourable friend does not say in the
lnquiry that be wiil direct attention to so
and so.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Oh, yes; it saysWiil call the attention of the Goverument ta
the Act.
Under the ruies of the Senate a member is
ailowed to discuss the mnattei.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not >by
simply cailing the attention of the Govemnment to an Act. However, I arn quite con-

TRADING

OORPORATION.

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. FREDERIO NIOHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, by leave of the House, and
as a question of privilege, I should like to
Honi Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Finance Canadian Export Trade Through a
T
i
Corporation-This suggestion will be
made to the Government by Lloyd Harris, who
has sailed for this country.

The despatch reads:

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired:

1. No.

draw the attention of the House to a special
cable despatch to the Montreal Gazette,
which is headed:

London, Oct. 3.-Lloyd Harris, chairman of
the Canadian Trade Mission in London, and
John Younge, also a member of the Mission, are
sailing for Canada. It is understood they will
discuss a number of matters affecting Canadien
export trade with the authorities at Ottawa.
It is well known that Lloyd Harris believes
the future financing of the Canadian export
trade should be done through a trading corporation rather than by the Government, and
this will probably be one of the most important
matters he will discuss with the Prime Minister.

Honourable gentlemen will remember
that two years ago a special Committee on
the Extension and Conservation of Canadian Trade after the War was appointed by
t
this Chamber; ·hat they met on several
occasions; that they made a report to this
House; that the whole matter was debated
in this House; and that the report of the
Committee was unanimously approved and
forwarded to the Government. I may perhaps be permitted to refresh the memories
of honourable gentlemen by reading the report of that Committec. It is dated Thursday, July 9, 1917, and reads as follows:
The Special Committee appointed to inquire
into and report upon the best method or methods
of conserving and increasing our domestic and
overseas trade to the end that our present
prosperity may not unduly suffer when the
stimulus resulting from order for munitions
and other war supplies is removed, beg leave to
make their Second Report, as follows:Your Committee bas had under consideration
for its first objective the best means of meeting
the needs of Canadian trade after the war, with
particular reference to
1. Securing orders for overseas trade to replace in part the great volumes of orders that
during the war have been received for war
munitions and supplies.
2. The financing of large overseas contracts.
After due inquiry your Committee are of
the opinion that the organization of a trade
bank to be known as The Canadian Trade
Corporation would best meet the object.
In
arriving at this conclusion due regard has been
paid to the evidence submitted before a committee appointed by The British Board of
Trade "to consider the best means of meeting
the needs of British firms after the war."
As
a result of the report of the British Committee
the Government of Great Britain bas granted a
Royal Charter to a trade bank known as The
British Trade Corporation, having for its object
amongst others the following:-

Then there are certain objects set forth
in the report. The report concludes:
Your Comnittee have after inquiry ascertained that the chartered banks. or some of

OCTOBEIR 8, 1919
them, and ieading Industrial and commercial
companies and individuais are willng to favourably consider undertaking the organization and
operation of a Canadian corporation somewhat
similar to the British organisations, and having
for its obJect the conseryation and extension of
Canadian trade alter the war. TYour Committee
have taken into consideration that the British
Trade Corporation, aithough not directly operated under the control of the, British Government, was nevertheless organized directiy at
the Instigation of that Government, which, has
accorded them -certain priviieges and extended
to them a certain measure of assistance and
official recognition.
TYour Committee therefore recommend:
1. That the Senate of Canada forward to
The Right Honourabie the Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Borden, G.C.M.G., a copy of this Second
Report of the Speciai Comrnittee .on the Conservation of Canadian Trade, with the request
that due regard and consideration be given to
the Importance and advisabiiity of aiding In
such manner as mnay be deemed prudent and
advisabie the formation of a Canadien Trade
and Banking Corporation which wiil meet the
requireýments set forth.
Ail which. Is respectfully submitted.

This zecçmmendation, with the report of
the committee, was duly laid before the
Federal Cabinet, and, I assume, received
a certain amount of consideration.
The
Government, however, in their wisdom decided that they would grant votes of $25,000,000, I think, to Roumania, a similar
amount ýto Greece, and various amounts to

other countries, making a total of $100,000,000 or more to be setmaide for the purpose orf
financing the trade with these allied countries, to enaýble them to purchase Canadian
goods. The committee, at the tîme they
met and made this recommendation, were
of the opinion that this method o! doiing
business, which had already been discussed,
would not be found atis! sctory. 1 simply
rise, on a question cf privilege and by
leave of this bouse, te point out that once
more the Senste has made recommendations whicb have not been given a reasonable amount of consideration, but whîch,
At appears, will sfter ahl have te be sdopted
by the Government iu order te bring about
the results which they have sought te attain by other means.

BOARD Oý COMMERCE BILL.
CONSIDERD IN OOMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 12,
an Act to amend the Board of Commerce
Act. Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
On section 1-salaries of Chief Commissioner and other com.misBioners:
Hon. Mr. POWER: With respect to this
first clause, thjs question occurs to me. As
I understand, the Chief Commissioner is
now a judge of the Supreme Court of Manitoba.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. He
was a judge of the Supreme Court, but resigned some years ago, for the purpose, I
think, of accepting the Commissionership of
Public IJtilities in the province of Manitoba; and I understand that he has since
resigned from that position.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I was not objecting
to the aimount of the salary. The other
commissioners are to, have an annual salary of $8,000. One of the others is a member of the Civil Service 'who is receiving
now quite a respectable salary, and what
1 wish to ask is whether this $8,000l is to
ha paid in addition to bis present salary,
or whether it is to cover everything.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It ia to
cover everything. 1 understand that he
has re.signed from the other positions.Hon. Mr. POWER: Well, he is a good
man and he is worth the $8,000.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to ask
the honourable leader of the Government
whether in addition to, their salaries these
men are paid ail their travelling and hotel
expenses.
Non,. Sir JAMES LOUG-HEED: I understand that the same rule would be applic.able to them as would apply to, say, any
judicial functionary, or any officiai -of the
Government, when away £rom bifs place
of residence, he would be entitled to his
travelling expenses and living expenses.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Their place of residence is not fixed under thi. Act. The
on-ly place of residence fixed is that of the
secretary.
Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOUGHEED: I presume it would be Ottawa. Under the Act,
the office of the board is at Ottawa; consequently I think that when the members
are a-way from Ottawa.they would be entitled -to their expenses.

152

SENATE

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Well, honourable
gentlemen, I want to say, regarding these
salaries, I think they are too high. These
men are paid larger salaries than are paid
to judges of the Superior Courts, and at a
time when money seems to be pretty
scaree in Canada and is very much needed.
It does not seem to me to be quite proper
to fix these salaries so high. I do not
know what the views of other members
of the House would be, but I think the
salary of $10,000 ishould he reduced to
$8,000, and the salaries of $8,000 reduced
to $6,000.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We have no
authority here to touch them.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: We have perfect
authority to do it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Salaries?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Paid out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: We cannot increase
them, but we can decrease them if we
choose to do so. I do not know what is
the mind of the House on 'that point, but
I just want to express my opinion publicly about it-that I think those salaries
are too high.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In view of the
good they are going to accomplish?
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: It might not
be improper to .point out that the Chairman of the Board of Commerce receives
from this Government $5,000 a year less
than he was receiving from his previous
employers, and that the third member of
the Board of Commerce, recently appointed.
is receiving exactly the same compensation
as te was paid in the position that he lias
left.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Mr. Murdoch?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What was his
position?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Vice-President
of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.
As far as M.r. O'Connor's compensation is
concerned, I am not just sure what the
change is; but as to the other two members
I do know that one is receiving the same
compensation and 'the other a 50 per cent
reduction.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I doubt very much
that that bas anything to do with the
question. The question is, for what salHoni Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

ýaries could you get three men as competent
to discharge the duties of these offices as
these men are?
Hon. ROBERT WATSON: I think that,
in view of the positions which those men
occupy, the salaries allowed are not too
much, if they are to do their work properly.
I believe that the Government make a great
mistake in trying to get men at low salaries
for important work such as that which
these men are doing. Judge Robson is a
western man. He tas been in the West a
number of years and has, I think, the c'onfidence of all the people of the West. I
t
doubt if ·here could have been a more
popular appointment than that of Judge
Robson to the position which be now occupies. He is a man who is above suspicion
and who,

I think, cannot be reproached

by any person in trade matters. 'For a
man of that description, occupying such a
position as that of Chief Commissioner of
the Board of Commerce, the salary proposed
is not out of proportion with the responsibilities of the work. You hear it said
occasionally, regarding an appointment
made to a responsible position, that a man
cannot be honest and work in such a position for a salary of $2,000 or $3,000 a year.
I believe the Government ought to select
the best available men and to pay them
sufficient to put them above any suspicion
of having to add anything to their salaries
in order that they may obtain a good living.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-power of Governor in Council to determine above salaries repealed:
Hon. Mr. POWER: What is the clause
that is repealed?
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
s.imply deals with the salaries of the coinmissioners, providing that they shall be
fixed by the Governor in Council.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-who is to preside:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Supposing that the
Chief Commissioner, who is a lawyer, were
not present and he had named a commissioner who was not a lawyer, then you
would have the opinion of a layman predominant on a point of law, when there
was a lawyer on the board and present.
This section says:
•

The opinion of the Chief Commissioner or the
presiding commisioner upon any question arising when such Chief or presiding Commissioner
is presiding, which in the opinion of the commissioners is a question of law, shall prevail.

OCTOBER 9, 1919
That is, if the Chief Commiasioner cannat
be present and he appoints a layman as
presiding comrnissioner in his ab.-ence, and
if a question of 1aw cornes up, the opinion
af this presiding cornmissioner, -vho inay be
a lt.j, nan, shall pievail over the opinion
of tihe cther commissioners, who may be
lawyers.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Why lotP It -may be
ag good.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hiar, hear.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I aoked my honoura-ble friend <Hon.- Sir James Lougheed)
yesterday if, when the Bill was before tJhe
com.mittee, he would flot produce copies of
the instructions issued by the Government
to this board. I would like to have those,
if my honourable friend can furnish thern.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have not
yet been able to get thèm up. I had intended doing so. I will make a meinorandum of ýhat and wilýl see t¶hat they are produced bèfore -we dispose of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: W.hat does the honourable leader of the Government eay with
regard ta th-at point?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: It4hink it
is a matter that we mnust leave to the Chief
Commissioner. If it is a question of law,
it seems to me that it would naturally occur
ta him that one of his colleagues who is a
Iawyer is the one that should 'be called
upon ta preside.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But he would not
be there when the question of law arose.
He could not antici-pate, peThaps, thait a
question af law would arise.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The question -would have ta stand until the Chief
Commiasioner deait 'with it, I shauld thînk
0f course, there might be this .situation,
,that the other two comnmissioners might net
be lawyers and the Chiel, Commissioner
might be a lawyer. In faiet, I arn unaware
of any provision in the Act whereby any
commissioner muet necessarily be a lawyer.
Han. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think the Chief
Comrnissioner under the Act has to be
either a judge or a barrister of cten yeare
standing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.: Yes, that
is the case. I find that under subgection
2 af section 4.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.: Why nat say the
Chief Commissioner shall decide questions
of lawP I do net think the Act ahould say

that a layman should decide a question of
law, and that bie decision should be final.
His decision might be good, but it would
be accidentai.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED': I understand that that is very frequently the rule
adopted by courts in arriving at a decision
on a question ai law.
Section 3 was agreed ta.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed ta.
The preamble and the tiLl-e were agreed ta.
The Bill was reported without amendment.

MILITIA BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second rea(iing cf Bill 19, an Act te amend

the Mihitia Act.
Ho sai<h: Honourabie gentlemen, the
Miiitia Act makes provision for the appointment ot certain efficers, such as-the Geucral
Officer Commanding, the Chief cf the Gemerai Staff, the Master General cf the Ordnance, the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster Generai, and se on. It is proposed te
reduce the numiber et staff positions. Tha't
change in the militia bas new praýcticaiiy
been carried eut. In the roorgaanizatien cf
the forces it is propoýsed that inýstead cf thore
beinr twe inspocters general, as thero bavc

been, thiere -sbooild be only one, and tbat hoe
shouhd ho tbe officer comimanding.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is the effeci cf tbat

te wipe eut the position cf Generai Lossard?
Hon. Sir JAMES LUUGHEED: No; hie
was superannuated somne timo ago, I undoerstand. These changes involve ne turtber
expenditure. In tact, I understand, the roduction in staff wvill resuit in a decrease of
expendi turc.

Hon,. Mr. BOYER: Thon we bave nothing
te do witb it.

Hon. Mr. BELCOIJET: The Bihl dees net
seem te provide for wbat my benourabie
friend (Hon. Sir James Lougboed) says.
This deais îxitb pay and aiiowances eniy,
and is neot fer the pcrposc et reducing or
incroasing the staff.
Hon. Sir JAMES IOIUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It repeais
sections of the Militia Act which create
offices such as I have mentiened. Thon it
provides:
The pay and allowances of the officers of the
general staff, headquarters staff and district
staff, including officers seconded for duty ln the
,publie servie of Canada, shall be fixed by the
Governor in Council.

As I unders.tand, those officers have been
seconded for duty and wiii be brougbt under
Ibis amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But in the past the
pay and aiiewances of efficers were aiways
fixed by the Governer in Council. That is
provided for in the statute. I do not sec why
wxe are making this amendment at ail. This
deals merely with the pay and ailowance of
the efilcers, net with t.he number Qf officers,
nor with the positions they hold, nor anything of that sort.
Hon. ýSir JAMES L'OUGHEED: It gives
authority to the Governor in Counicil as
expressed in the section. Let us assume
that that authority is not on the statute
book at present. ýSome authority is required for the fixing cf their salaries.
Hon. .Mr. BELCOURI:
But there is
autbority undor the statute now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIIN: The authority was
given in thoso sections w hich clause 1 rope ais.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We repeal those sections which deai with that
phase of the subject, and we substitute section 37 as it now appears in the Bill. That
is as I understand it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I quite reaiize
that At wili ho necossary te ropeal the sections under the autbority of which the Master cf the Ordnance, the Chiof of Staff, etc.,

derive their functions. I quite sec the necessity for that, but I do not soc the necessity
for saying that the pay and aiiowances
shail be detormined by the Governor in
Council, because the pay and aiiowances
of the officers who romain after you repeal
those sections have been dcterinined by
Order in Council in the past, and the
authority for that is ln the statute.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Woii, I
shall bo vory giad te look inito this question,
and when we go into Coinmittee 1 shaii have
a full expianation on the subjeet.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourahie
gentlemen, this Bill, as I understand, is
a Bill for a certain reorganization cf the
iniiitia.

11on. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.

OCTOBER 9, 1919
Hon. Mr. B06TOCK: I hope that my
honourable friend will be able to give us
some information as to the present policy of
the Government with regard to the militia.
The whole organization of the nilitia was
very much upset owing to the war. The
policy adopted by the Government, when
the war broke out, of ignoring the organization of the inilitia as it' existed, has, J
think, very seriously upset the whole organization. The policy that the Governhient intends to pursue in reorganizing the
militia is a question of great importance
to the country, and I think this would have
been a good opportunity for the Government
to give us some information regarding it.
At present, as I understand, we have in addition to the militia the organization remaining of the battalions which composed
the Canadian Expeditionary Force. The
question is whether the Government are
going to disband those battalions that were
Exthe
Canadian
raised to
form
they
whether
Force, or
peditionary
will continue them and will drop the whole
militia organization as it existed at the
beginning of the war. During last session
we passed legislation providing for the increase of the permanent force and also the
Royal Northwest 'Moufted Police. It does
seem to me that for the purpose of maintaining law and order throughout the country
the militia is not of much value; that a well
organized force, properly officered and maintained, like the Royal North-west Mounted
Police, is a much better force for the Government to call upon. The whole question
is a very important one and ought to be
considered at the present time, because so
long as we maintain two organizations there
will be a greater expense to the country,
and we ought to try to curtail expense in
every possible way. From what little I
know about the subject, it seems to me
that much of the money which is now
being spent on the militia might be spent
to better advantage in the training of the
younger generation, possibly by providing
better training facilities in the schools
throughout the country, so that boys, as
they grow up, may be drilled and xnay learn
to appreciate the necessity and value of
discipline. Such training would also develop their muscles and \vould teach them
the laws of health. The lessons that are
learned by the young, between the ages of
18 and 21, or even before that period, last
throughout the whole of their lives. Such
a training would be of great advantage to
the country and would bring a. greater
return than what is obtained from the

155

money which we have been spending in the
past on the militia. I do not purpose taking
up much of the time of the House on this
matter, but I am rather disappointed that
we have not heard more from the Government as to what their policy is in regard
to the organization of the militia.
Hon. GEORGE H. BRADBURY: Honourable gentlemen, I would like to ask the
honourable leader of the Government if
there is any intention to perpetuate in any
way the C. E. P.-the men who organized
battalions for overseas and who enabled
this country to place itself in an' exalted
position before the world. If the raising of
the forces to take part in this war had been
left to the old xuilitia of Canada, we would
not have had 400,000, or 300,000, or 200,000
men overseas. Many of the men who did
undertake to raise battalions spent their own
good money, perhaps thousands of dollars.
Are they to receive no recognition at allnot even mention? I do not know that an3
attempt is being made to perpetuate the
C.E.F-the mén who did the work. I have
no quarrel with the militia, but it must be
apparent to everybody that many trained
officers, young and old, instead of hastening
to the front or taking part in organizing
battalions to cross the seas., secured good
positions at Ottawa and all over Canada.
Some of the men who are to-day oocupying
the highest positions in the militia, and
who when the war started were trained
men, did not go overseas or did not raise
battalions to go overseas. That was left to
be done by civilians, men who, like myself,
were not soldiers. It does seem to me
strange that there should be no recognition given or no attempt made on the part
of the Government to recognize the men
who have made sacrifices overseas and men
who have raised battalions.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I am in sympathy with tbe
honourable member from elkirk (Hon. Mr.
Bradbury), who has stated that some recognition should be given te men who have
been on the other side. If it is possible to
give such recognition while reorganizing our
militia in such a way as to help this country to meet its obligations, I have no objection. We have won the war, but we have
still to win peace. As we all know, European countries which were deeply engaged
in the war realize that they cannot save
themselves from bankruptcy unless they reduce their military and naval establishments to the utmost limit. Not only m'ust
we reduce our military and naval establish-

ments, but we must retrench in every department. I have made in this House
the statement, which no one can controvert, that we shall need to impose taxes
this country to the tune
upon the people owf
of $200,000,000 a year, in addition to what
they are now paying. Shall we be able to
do that? If we are not able to do it without showing a state of inferiority to the
status of the United States, this country
will suffer. If, as Sir Thomas White stated
yesterday in his evidence before the ReEstablishment Committee of the Commons,
we are sailing close to the wind-as we all
know we are-should we not adopt the alternative of retrenchment? While it is quite
refreshing ta hear my honourable friend
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) state that this
little Bill will not increase the expenditure, but will, on the contrary, reduce it, yet we must expect the pruning knife to be inserted more deeply
than in this case; it should be applied radically. I am convinced that if
the X-rays were turned in every nook and
corner of this country as they seem to have
been applied to the Printing Bureau, we
could reduce our expenditure by $50,000,000
or $100,000,000 a year. When we are asking
the people for supplementary taxation
amounting to $200,000,000, we must justify
our action by retrenchment.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
WHEAT CROP GUARANTEE BILL.
SECOND READING.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 20, an Act to continue
in force the powers of the Board of Grain
Supervisors of Canada so that it may conclude its businesis, and to continue in force
a guarantee given by the Governor in Council with respect to the 1918 wheat crop.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in pursuance of certain legislation which we
passed at former sessions, the Board of
Grain Supervisors of Canada entered upon
certain duties. TIhose duties they have not
yet concluded. The purpose of the Bill is
to extend the time for the continuance and
conclusion of the unfinished business which
they have in hand.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Would the
honourable leader of the Government be
able to give us information about those
Orders in Council when we go into Commi ttee?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: They extend over
two or three years. It is rather hard to
find them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Whici
Orders in Council-the ones referred to ini
the Bill?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In the first clause
of the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The motion was agreed and the Bill wus
read the second time.
EASTCOTT DIVORCE PETITION.
CONCURRENCE IN COMMITTEE'S REPORT.
Hon. W. B. ROSS moved:
That the Third Report of the Standing Committee on Divorce, to whom was referred the
petition of Arthur LeRoy Eastcott, together
wi-th the evidence taken before the said committee be concurred in.
Hon. A. B. CROSBY: Honourable gentlemen, I asked on Tuesday last that the consideration of this report be deferred, and
the Chairman of the Committee on Divorce
very kindly consented to allow it to stand
until to-day. The printed evidence has just
been distributed. This is a very important
matter, and there is a danger of our passing
a divorce without giving it much consideration. The reason for that, I suppose, is that
we have an excellent committee who deal
with divorce petitions. I must say they
give them very careful attention. I cannot
speak too highly of the manner in which
the honourable gentlemen composing that
committee perforn their duties. Nevertheless this is, I think, a case in which it
would be well for every honourable member to read the evidence before voting. I
w o uld therefore ask the chairman of
the committee if he would be good
enough to let this matter stand until

number of members who may be leaving
to-morrow for the week-end, and in order
that the matter may be considered by a
full House, it ought to be deferred till Tuesday. I think it would be only fair to the
House for the chairman of the committee to
agree to that postponement, in order that
honourable gentlemen may have an oppor-

tunity of reading the evidence.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I join with
my honourable friend from Halifax in asking that this order be allowed to stand, because the evidence has been distributed
only to-day and I have not had time to look
at it. I am told that this is a very doubt-

OCTOBER 9, 1919
ful case. There are points in connection
with this which ought to be examined very
carefully. I would like to see it put over
until next Tuesday if possible.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I am not taking up
any position with regard to the passing of
this measure, but I wish to direct the attention of the House to the fact that if this
report is put off until next week, that means
that the Bill is killed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not necessarily.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, the Divorce Committee' having reported back to the House, are now done
with this matter, and it is for the House to
deal with it; but it is perfectly regular for
me to say on behalf of the committee that
we were unanimous in our report. There
was no dissenting vote. As you will see, the
evidence is somewhat lengthy, but it would
not take very long to read4# over. To put
this matter over till next'>Tuesday would
result in killing the Bill, ànd it' might do
an injustice to the petitioner. Even if
there was a little doubt about the petitioner's case, the committee who heard it considered that before making their report.
On the question being put:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yeas and nays.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will not insist
on that, I do nqt want to cause the House
trouble; but I really think this report
should be put over. I am given to understand that there is grave doubt on several
questions connected with the case-I may
be misinformed-and I have been asked
to read over the evidence; but I have just
received it.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: If we concur in this
report, and then, upon reading the evidence, find good reason for defeating the
Bill, can we do soP
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman can divide the House on the
Bill when it comes before us. A Bill can
always be voted against on its second or
third reading.
The report was concurred in, on division.
HUDSON BAY ROUTE.
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN
Fowler) moved:

(for Hon. Mr.

That the report of the Special Committee
appointed to inquire into the navigability and
fishery resources of Hudson bay and strait he
concurred in.

I

Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, as I understand it, this report recommends that the committee be made permanent, and be authorized to sit during the
recess of Parliament, to examine witnesses,
hear opinions, and to go on ad infinitum.
This committee sat during last session and
did a great deal of work of moire or less
value; it has sat again this session, and
there is nothing new to be found out about
the Hudson bay and strait. We are just
ý'vhere we were thirty years ago. I do not
see why the time of Parliament should be
taken up, and publie money expended in
further inquiry which is absolutely useless
and unnecessary.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The report speaks
for itself. Some members of the committee
know of people in the Hudson bay region
who, upon their return; may be able to give
some valuable evidence. I do not eee any
harm in concurring in the report. It is
not the intention of the members of the
committee to come from their homes and
sit here while Parliament is not sitting.
The 'object the Committee have in view is
to save money instead of spending it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I did not know that
this notice was on the Order Paper for today, and I regret that I was not in the
House when it came up. I do not know
what objection there can be to the report.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the honourable gentleman will permit me, I will state
the objection formulated by the honourable
gentleman from Halifax, unless that honourable gentleman wishes to do so for himself. The objection of the honourable gentleman from Halifax is that the action proposed by the committee involves an unnecessary expenditure of money during the
recess.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Economy is always
commendable, particularly at the present
time. I can assure the honourable gentleman from Halifax that if this report is concurred in, the additional expense will be,
comparatively speaking, nothing. The expense of this committee has been and will
be small when com.pared with the im.portance of the work that has been done. When
we get to our final report, I think the Senate will bé satisfied that the committee has
done very valuable work for the country.
Our only desire is to bring in a report that
will be intelligible and that will have some
good effect. There has been a great deal
of evidencé taken, about 250 pages, and
about twenty-five or thirty pages more will
be added to that. We do not anticipate

158

SENATE

taking very much evidence, but we wish
to compile a small compendium, consisting of twenty-five or thirty pages, which
will give the whole gist of the evidence. I
think it will be in the best interest of the
country to permit the committee to pursue
the course which they have mapped out
for themselves in this matter.

Hon. Mr. BOYER: I will pair with my
honourable friend.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, the
14th of October, at 8 p.m.

SENATE

of opinion in the Senate during recent
years in favour of giving this right to the
commissioner in all cases where there has
been a failure, and that this has
justified the bringing in of a Bill.
The opinion has often been exipressed that
the commissioner should have the right to
extend the time, or to accept the money
of the patentee, when for some good reason
he has failed to pay the fee. Every year
applications are made to Parliament for
relief in cases in which the fees have not
been paid in time, and these applications
have usuafly been granted on the representation that the delay was not due to the
applicant himself, but to his agent. I think
a m'ajority of this House at all events have
felt that this matter could -well be left to
the commissioner to deal with.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I think proper to say,
in support of the views expressed by the
honourable gentleman from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), that two years ago,
before the committee, Mr. O'Halloran, the
chief officer of the Patent Department, adnitted that the law should be amended as
suggested by the honourable member.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
the object of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But only in so
far as the patentee has been unable to fulfil his obligations, "by reason of active service or enforced absence from the country,
or any other circumstances arising from a
state of war, which in the opinion of the
minister wonuld justify such extension." I
have not read the whole Bill, but it strikes
me, from the explanation of the honourable
gentleman, and from clause A, that the Bill
does not empower the commissioner generally to extend the time where there is a
justifiable reason given for the extension.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do net see in this
Act any limitation of time for which it shall
bc applicable. As I take it, it is meant
to apply to cases which occurred between
the 4th of August, 1914, and the signing
o) peace; but there is no provision in the
Aet for its termination.

Hon. Sir LOUGHEED: The Patent Act
would prescribe that.

Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
this peculiarity a&bout the Militia Act, that
there is a statutoîy provision fixing salaries
for certain officers; then, in section 37 of
the Act, it is provided:
The pay and allowances of the officers of the
Geiieral Staff, and Headquarters Staff, and Dietrict Staff, flot provided for by this Act, ehall

The salaries of thýose not specifically

Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEÀED: 1 think'
iny honouraqile friend is laibouring under a
delusion. General Currie has been appointed
Inspecter General for the whole of Canada,
and will absorb ail the dluties of the Chief
of the 'General Staff. Hie is now preparing
a report for the reoiganization, o& the militia,
which, I presume, will require legîsiation
at an eaîly date-not during the present

next session of Parliament. 'My honourable friend can very well appreciate that the
disturbance which took place during the
war has gîven xise to investigation; and 1
have no doubt that the knowledge and experience which our forces gained on the
other side will afford ample opportunity ta
prepare a scheme for the reorganization of
the militia in Canada that will appeal very
strongly to the people.
'Hlon. Mr. DANIEL.- Why is the officer to
be called Inspector General instead of General Officer Commanding?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I understand that
General Currie bas not yet 'been appointed.
I presume that is because this legisiation
is necessaiy before that can be done?
Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not necessarily. The office of Inspector General did
exist-there were two Inspectors General. I
understand that those two offices have been
pîactically fused inito one, and that General
Currie bas been aippoînted to the office of
Inspector General.
Hon. 'Mr. OASGIRAIN: We paseed a Buill

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable friend say whether any consideration

allowances? Will they be increased?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand they will be substantially increased,
but I cannot give any definite information
at the 'moment.
Hon. Mr. DAN;DURAND: My only objection to the Bill is that certain salaries
which ;previously were paid under statutory
enactment will now be fixed by Order in
Council. That is an appropriation by the
executive of the powers -of Parliament-a
policy which I think runs counter to democratic institutions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The fixing of salaries by statute is se rigid as not
to permit of adjusting conditions to the circumstances which may arise; but my honourable friend will readily appreciate that
notwithstanding that the salaries must
necessarily be voted by Parliament; consequently, if Parliament is dissatisfied with
the salaries fixed, it bas its remedy in refusing to vote the supplies.
Section 1 was agreed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I could

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We seem to be
rather carrying this on without knowing
exactly what we are doing, before we have
had an oipportunity of looking at these
Orders in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As my
honourable friend will observe, the legiýsilation is simply to permit the board to conclude its business. It in no sense gives the
board additional powers, nor does it authorize the exercise of the powers vested
in it except in so far as those powers are
exercisible in the conclusion of the business upon which it had entered. However,
if my honourable friend desires it, I will
have the Committee rise and report progress.

EASTOOTT DIVORCE BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY (for Hon. Mr.
Blain) moved the second re,ading of BiH C,
an Act for tihe relief of Arthur LeRoy Eastcott.
Hon. A. B. CROSBY: Honourable gentlemen, I asked that the report of the coinmittee should be held over in order that

I have examined very carefully the evidence of both the petitioner and the respondent. The ipetitioner does net give a
single bit of evidence to prove 'his case
except to state that his wife made an admission to him; 'and she absolutely denies
that.
There is some suggestion or impression
that I oppose the grant'îing of this divorce
simply hecause of my religion. That is not
the case. Lilke every other member of this
House, I am sworn to carry out my duties
here, and I intend to do that conscientiously
and to thâ best of my judgment. I do

OCTOBER 14, 1919
think, honourable gentlemen, that we should
be exceedingly careful with cases of this
kind. If we granted a divorce in every case
in which, by some mischance, somelbody
happened to kiss another man's wife, we
should soon have a queer state of affairs
in this cuuntry; and as in this case there
is no evidence of anything further than
that, I do inot think the divorce should
be granted.
I want to say for the Committee on
Divorce that I have been present at the
hearings on many occasions, and have read
the evidence in nearly every case, and I
believe we have as efficient a committee
as we could possibly have. But there are
times w'hen even the very best of men go
astray;-

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon? Mr. CROSBY:-and, as I have to
deal with the man in this case, I want to
say that he .may be one cf those men. There
is hardly ever a case in which the woman
goes astray; but if a woman does happen
to go astray, the whole world seems to be
down on her. It frequently happens that
men go through this world as they please,
and misbehave here, there and everywhere,
and yet everybody seems to think they have
a perfect right to do what they like, where
they please and when they please; but the
poor, unfortunate woman, who happens ta
do something ithat people think she should
not do, is down and out forever.
Horourable gentlemen, if you have read
the evidence in this case, you are familiar
wàith the fact ithat every gentleman this
woman met was a personal, intimate friend
of her husband's.
i
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is generally
the way.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I hope my honourable'friend bas had no experience. In this
case Mr. Harrison was a bosom friend of
tahe petitioner. Mr. 'Harrison died, and the
petitioner had to get another friend. He
got him and brought him to his home, and
they had a good time every night playing
cards together. And this friend went so
far, the evidence indicates, as to say to the
wife of the petitioner: " Here is $30 of ;my
winnings." He put the $30 on the mantelpiece, -and the husiband was so delighted
that he added $10 more. He contributed
only $10 while the other man contributed
three times as mnuch, and he said, " Buy a
$40 present for yourself." Evidently, a little
later on, as he was going down to the
cellar-where he belonged and should have
S--11

163

stayed-he discovered this man in the kitchen kiseing his wife.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: For $30?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: He finds Cockburn
kissing his wife. He does not complain
about it-does not say a word about it. He
does not say to his wife, " You did wrong,"
or, " That is a thing you should not do;
although that is a particular friend of
mine, I do not want you to go that far with
him." The man himself intimates that he
did not indicate to her that he was displeased with it. It would never have happened again; and there is no evidence that
it did happen again except once.
As I have said, the wife in her evidence
absolutely denies the offence on which the.
husband bases his petition. On the otherhand, after he has had detectives watchingthis little woman for about two or three
months, after getting a telephone and every
facility he possibly can to try and catch
her doing wrong, he cannot catch her. He
has some of his friends try to see if in some
way they can get the evidence which he
desires to get. He f ails to get that evidence.
And after he has come to the conclusion
that his wife has done wrong, his friend
Cockburn comes and says to him: "Why,
my dear friend, you don't think I am a
snake in the grass? I am a good, decent
tellow. You wouldn't think I would do
anything wrong?" The petitioner says that
up to March 15 he was very uneasy and
very much excited about the situation, but
on March 15, be says, he felt relievedwhy? Because Cockburn bas spoken to
him. A little later on Eastcott gets some
idea-although he does not get any more
evidence-and he comes to the conclusion
that he must get rid of his wife. After
coming to the conclusion he pretendE te
take a trip down to Ottawa. He boards
the train, but slides off at the other side
and goes back home, in order to watch his
wife. He watches her for two or three
hours. It happens that Mr. Cockburn is
there. He sees nothing more than an ordinary kiss.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY:
My honourable
friends have read the evidence. Some of
them may consider it an extraordinay kiss.
I consider it only an ordinry kiss, because
it did not excite this man to any extent;
he did not worry about it; he looked on for
two hours at his own wife and this particular friend, whom he had brought i.to the
bosom of his family. He stayed watehing
them and did not interrupt them until about

He sai: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill

body shah 'become a Dominion body. The
headlquarters of the force, in ahl probabllity,
will be moved to the capital, 'but -provision

te any members of the present Dominion
Police Force.

Provision is aise, mati

whereby members

of .the Domninion Police who serve five years
or more May take advantage of the pension
system untier the Royal Northwest Mounteti
Police Act.
I think lionourable gentlemen, wilh concur in the statement whidh I make that iA

SENATE
is in the public interest that there should
be an amalgamation of these two bodies.
Broadly speaking, they are charged with
the same duties-that is to say, with enforcing federal laws throughout the whole
Dominion. It is thought that the amalgamation of the two bodies will render more
effective the services of both and will result
in greater efficiency than if the two bodies
carry on their work separately, as in the
past.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Under which minister
will the force come?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no provision in, the present Bill .as to that.
At present the Mounted Police are under
the President of the Privy Gouncil and the
Dominion Police are under the Department
of Justice. At the present moment I cannot say authoritatively whait department
they will come under in the future.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Did I understand
the honourable gentleman to say that the
Dominion Police would come under the
Northwest Mounted Police Pension Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I said
that provision is made whereby members
of the Dominion Police who serve more
than five years may take advantage of
the pension provisions of the Northwest
Mounted Police Act.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That would apply
to the older members. In the reorganization of the Dominion Police it is likely that
a number of the older men will retire.
Would they participate?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, if
they serve more than five years.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Would their pension cover all the time they have served?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
give all the details.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I am making
that inquiry because I have been asked
to do so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When we
go into Committee on the Bill I shall be
able to give further information.

my opinion the working out of this nes
system, which I think the Government is
to be conmended for bringing into effect,
would be more satisfactory if the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police were under the
President of the Council, rather than under
the Department of Justice. I understand
that up to the present time a large part of
the work of (the Dominion Police has been
done by officials of other departments. I
understand that heretofore officials of the
Immigration Department have done a great
amount of the Dominion Police work at
different times; but I suppose that under
this arrangement that will be changed
to some extent.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I understood the
honourable gentleman to say fthat the Gommissioner of Police would be moved to
Ottawa; but I do not understand that the
large body of the force will be moved East,
because a great deal of their work is confined to the West.
The question bas already been asked as
to what minister they will 'be under. In

kingdoms.

Honi Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I omitted
to say that the large body of the police
will probably be kept west of Lake
Superior, and will, to a great extent,
if not altogether, perform
the duties
te which they have been accustomed.
The whole body will not necessarily be
mounted. There will of course be a mounted
section of the police, such as that which
at the present time is engaged in western

work.

There will be but the one force, and

the work at present being performed by the
Dominion Police will go on uninterruptedly.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I suppose if they
were really needed in the East, in case of
riots or anything of that kind, they would
be available.

bodies in Canada; furthermore, it ought
to be one of the best military bodies in the

OCTOBER 15, 1919
GRAND TRUNK PACIFIC BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 23, an Act to amend
an Act to confirm two Orders of the Governor General in Council respecting the Grand
Trunk Pacifie Railway system.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, last session we passed certain legislation dealing
with the elevator system of the Grand Trunk
Pacific Railway Company. At that time
Parliament omitted the word "terminal" in
the Act to which I have referred. This Bill
is to correct that error, and to insert the
word "terminal" where it belongs.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: As the Grand Trunk
arrangement is now the order of the day in
the other House, would it not be well to
defer all legislation of this kind until the
whole question is under consideration? We
are now dealing with the question piecemeal,
and it seems to me that it lwould be well to
defer this matter until the *main proposa]
is brought before us.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would the honourable the leader of the Government tell
us what these two Orders in Council are?
Have they to do with the appointment of a
receiver?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
This Bill simply has to do with terminal
elevators. The word "terminal" was left
out of the Act. It will not cost the country
anything to put it'in.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow

THE GOVERNMENT'S RAILWAY
POLICY.
INQUIRY AN) DISCUSSION.
Hon. L. G. POWER rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call attention to the defective
character of the Government'S policy with re-

spect to existing railways, and will inquire if

the Government proposes to improve such char-

acter.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I think
it is desirable at this point to say just a
word as to practice. In this House we
have a practice which is borrowed from
the House of Lords, under which the rule
respecting questions lae modified. Our rule
provides that if a member wishes that a
question shall be discussed he may give
notice that he will call attention to the
matter and will make certain inquiries.
That practice bas been in operation now
for forty years.
I regret, honourable gentlemen, that I
do not feel up to the point <that one ought
to be at in dealing with a matter so important as the general railway business of
the country. I am proposing to deal, not
merely wi.th any one particulax 'aspect of
the matter, but with the whole scheme of

government railways.
I do not think it necessary to point out
that experience bas

proved that govern-

ment ownership and operation of railways
is not a desirable thing. That has been
the experience in England; it has been the
experience in the United States, where the
Government are handing the railways
back to the companies that formerly
owned them; and it bas been our experience in Canada. The experience bas been
pot only that the expenditure in connection with the railways has been very
largely increased, but that the efficiency
of the railways has been very much
diminished. I am not going to go over all
the railways

now known as government

railways; but if one takes the original Intercolonial railway, which bas been in
operation now for forty odd years, and
whidh runs through what is, on the whole,
a fairly well peopled country, he will find
that the deficit for the year ending the 31st
of March last was about $2,000,000-and there
does not seem to be very much prospect of
any reduction.
We gather from the newspapers and the
reports of proceedings in another place that
the Government have in contemplation the

taking over of the Grand Trunk Railway.
If the Government do that they will not

SENATE
only have to meet the cost of operation and
to pay interest on the debt of the company,
but they will also have to pay the company
a large yearly sum.
I do not quote, but honourable gentlemen
who look at the debates of another place
will find that the minister who had charge
of the matter said that the latest terms made
between Mr. Smithers and the Government
were substantially the same as those which
had been laid down by the Minister of the
Interior in a letter dated, last July; and, as
I understand, the minister practically admitted that there would be a charge of between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000 a year.
We naturally ask, honourable gentlemen,
when we are called upon to make an expenditure of that kind, what are we getting
for it? What I wis1h to call the, attention
of this House to is the fact that we really
are not going te get anything that we have
not already got. As it is. now, the Grand
Trunk Railway Company operates the roads
which belong to the old Grand Trunk Campany, and the country practically has to
pay nothing. During the year closed a few
weeks ago there was, really on the working
of the road a small surplus, of about $1,000,000, I think. That, of course, is a surplus
which, if the road were run by the Government, would disappear; and the Government
would be paying in the neighbourhood of
$4,000,000 a year for nothing w'hatever. That
is a point that I think ought to sink into
the minds of honourable gentlemen here:
you are going to get nothing that you have
not already got. Why we should pay $3,000,000 or $4,000,000 a year for that is something tihat I really cannot understand. It
strikes me, honourable gentlemen, that it
would practically mean that the Government would be paying a lot of money to purchase a deficit.
I notice that the newspapers and gentlemen in public positions are asking for an
alternative to the government scheme.
They say the government scheme may not
be good, but what can we get in exchange
for it? I think, honourable gentlemen, the
wiser course and the fairer course would
be to relieve the Grand Trunk Company of
all liabilities arising out of the construction
of the Grand 'Trunk Pacifie, and to allow
the Grand Trunk Company to revert to the
position which it occupied before the contract made in 1903. If that were done the
Grand Trunk people feel-and I think there
is not much doubt about it-that they could
carry on, that they could maintain the old
Grand 'Trunk system without any permanent
aid from the Government.
Hon. Mr. POWER.

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Could the honourable gentleman tell us what that would
amount to?
Hon. Mr. POWER: I am glad the honourable gentleman has asked the question,
because it enables one to bring forward another view of the matter. If the proposed
scheme is adopted, the country will take
over all the expense of operating both the
Grand Trunk Pacifie and the Grand Trunk
systems. Now, the whole deficit, practically,
is on the Grand Trunk Pacifie system; and,
whether we release the old Grand Trunk
or do not do se, it makes no difference
in the amount the Government have to pay.
The Government have to meet the expenses
of the two systems, and my idea is that
you can get rid of the responsibility for the
deficit on the old Grand Trunk system, and
you will then have the same deficit that
you would have had if the original government scheme had been carried out.
I am not undertaking te deal with the
matter of law, honourable gentlemen, because as a matter of technical law there is
no doubt that the Grand Trunk Company
are in a pretty tight place and are liable for
several millions on account of the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
But if we look at the history of the matter
I think we shall see that at any rate there
is a sort of equitable view which may be
taken and which will put it in a different
light. The Grand Trunk Railway Company were anxious to get access to the
.prairie country, and they proposed, as I
understand, to 'build from North Bay to
the prairie. The Government of the day
,felt that that arrangement would not bo
satisfactory to the country at large, and
that the railway, instead of stopping at
North Bay, should run on eastward to
Quebec. That gives, of course, a very much
larger back country, so to say, to Canada
than it would have had under the other
scheme.
The company vielded to the
pressure from the Governnent and agreed
to the Quebec addition. Of course, that involved a very considerable expenditure.
Then, when the Bill to incorporate the
Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway Company was
going through the House of Commons, an
amendment was made te it at the instance
ofthe Government, adding on the line from
the Quebec bridge to Moncton. That was
something that the company strongly objected to, but they were to a certain extent
in the hands of the Government and they
yielded and acce-pted it.
Another thing that the company would
not naturally have expected was that large

OCTOBER 15, 1919 -eg

-

subsidies were given to a company whieh
competed in the prairie country with the
Grand Trunk Pacifie. My own feeling is
tthat if the Grand 'Trunk Company had
known when the negotiations began, or before they 'began, what the upshot was, going
to be and what was to be the burden that
would ibe laid upon them, they would not
have entered upon the contract. I think
that, inasmuch as the 'Government of the
day were responsible for these great.additions to the cost of the undertaking, tiey
should te quite willing to pay for these
additions and let the company out, and I
am satisfied, as I said a while ago, that
if the company are relieved from their liabilities on account of the 'Grand Trunk
-Pacifie they 'will be able to carry on without
Goverument help.
Honourable gentlemen, I am not going t
discuss the various features of this proposed seheme, or the various objections to
it; but, as a member from the province of
Nova 6ootia, I desire to call attention to
one fact which apparently has been lost
eight of by the Government and by most
of the members of both. Houses, and that
is that if the Government take over the
Grand Trunk railway and make it part of
the government system, then Portland will
become the winter port of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: No.
Hon. Mr. POWER: We know that a great
many millions of money have been spent in
an attempt to make St. John and Halifax
the winter ports; but, if this proposed contract goes through, then Portland will become the winter port of, at any rate, all
Canada west of Montreal. If honourable
gentlemen wi'll just look at the figures they
will see that that is a thing that must
happen. The distance from Montreal to
Portland by the Grand Trunk railway is
297 miles. The distance from Montreal to
Halifax by the Intercolonial is 841 miles;
that is, about 550 miles farther.
By the
Intercolonial to St. John the distance is
741 miles, that is, 400 and odd miles farther.
Then, by the Canadian Pacifie railway from
Montreal to Halifax the distance is 755
miles, and to St. John it is 580 miles. So at
the best, if we take the Canadian Pacifie
with its' 580 miles, that is, double the length
of the Grand Trunk froin Montreal to Portland. Honourable gentlemen, I think, that
when the people of the Maritime Provinces
get to understand the position thoroughly
they will find it diffBcult to approve of the
proposed agreement.
I shall not say anything more about this
particular transaction, but I should like to

say a few words on the government management of what is now called the Canadian
Government railway, but what was in old
times the Intercolonial railway. One point
which I think is deserving of notice is that
nowadays this road is managed from Toronto instead of Ottawa. It would strike one
that the government railways ought to be
managed from the seat of government and
not from another city 400 miles away. One
of the effects of this change, which has
made itself felt already, is that if one has
any business now in connection with the
Intercolonial he perhaps writes to Ottawa,
and, although it may be a matter that requires an early answer, the officials in the
department here at Ottawa are in no position to give an answer until they have consulted the management in Toronto.
The
management in Toronto, I fancy, is practically the management of the old Mackenzie and Mann roads. Of course, honourable gentlemen, if the Grand Trunk railway
is taken over, the fact that the management
is in Toronto will be still more objectionable than at the present time. That is one
thing with respect to the management of the
Intercolonial.
Another point is this, that the time-table
for the lines east of Montreal is not reliable.
The time-table says that you shall leave
Halifax at 20 minutes to 8 and you are due
in Montreal the next morning at about 9
o'clock: that is, on the fast train. As a
matter of fact, I think the train rarely makes
ceonnection. The truth is that the service
on the Intercolonial to-day is rather worse
than it was 40 years ago. Mind, I do net
blame the minister for this, because he has
to be guided by what his subordinates tell
him. The excuse given for this failure to
make connection ie that the Ocean Limited
has to stop to often-that it is more like
an ordinary passeriger train than a fast
express. Well, honourable gentlemen, I do
not think that is *a good excuse. If it is
found impracticable to make the connection at Montreal, or at Halifax in the case
of the eastbound train, then the right thing
is for the board of management of the Intercolonial to alter the time-table, so that
people will not be misled and find themselves landed in Montreal for several hours,
say on their way to Ottawa.
The right
thing, I think, is to make the time-table
to correspond with the time actually made
by the train.
Then, as to the province of Nova Scotia,
I think we have reason to complain. The
road from Prince Rupert on the Pacifie
ocean 'to Moncton in the province of New
Brunswick is supposed te have no grade

SENATE

170

above 34oths of 1 per cent. Between Moncton
and Truro there are grades as high as 1 per
cent. Honourable gentlemen, I do not need
to enlarge on the effect of tha;t. On the
road west of Moncton an engine can draw,
say, 50 -cars. The same engine on the road
between Moncton and Truro cannot draw
25 cars. That is a very important matter.
If things continue as they are, when the
St. Lawrence is closed and the canals are
frozen over, Hal-ifax and St. John should
be the ports for shipping to and fro across
the Atlantic.
I may say that when troops had to be
transported and speed and safety were of
great importance, Halifax loomed quite
large; but at other times Halifax dnes net;
and I think that the Government should
take steps to give fair play to the province
of Nova Scotia.
I do not wish to be understood as finding
any fault with the arrangement in New
Brunswick; I am simply stating the facts:
the people at St. John have the Canadian Pacific short line, they have the
Intercolonial railway, and now they have
the St. John Valley railway connecting
with the Transcontinental. In Halifax we
have nothing but the old Intercolonial,
which bas been there for 50 years and bas
not been improved during all that time,
and we have the steep grades.
Two things, I think, are absolutely necessary: the elimination of the excessive grades
east and south of Moncton, and the double
tracking of that portion of the old InterI know it is stated-and
colonial.
it is, I believe, partially true-that a single
track is able to cope with the traffic. As
proof of that, attention is called to the
fact that there was so much traffic over
the road, in the way of both passengers
and freight, during the war and immediately
afterwards. Well, there is a good deal of
force in the lesson of that experience. But
special arrangements were made with respect to the troop-trains. Pains were taken
to have the road cleared and the way made
open to them. The experience of general
traffic on the Intercolonial does not harmonize with the experience of the troop trains.
The road from Halifax to Moncton dates
back to 1872. It is the best paying part of

the whole Intercolonial, and is therefore,
I think entitled to consideration. Crossings
on a single track often involve considerable
delay. There is no gentleman here, who
bas travelled over the Intercolonial, who
bas not been rather annoyed at the train
being kept waiting anywhere from five
Hon. Mr. POWER.

minutes to half an hour to cross another
train. That delay is of course avoided in
the case of a double track.
Then there is another thing: the elimination of the high grades would more than
double the hauling capacity of the engines.
A double track would lessen the congestion
and increase the speed. There is no reason
at all why it should take more than 24
hours to -come from Halifax to Montreal.
I have mentioned Halifax two or three
times, but I do not think the people there
are unreasonable. The Government are
putting in long sidings at some placesone near Truro. Long sidings are good, but
they do not shorten the journey for the
wolie distance. If the Government, instead
of putting in long sidings now, had doubletracked the road from the neighbourhood
of Moncton ýto Amherst, ,say; it would
have benefited all the traffic to and from
the province of Nova Scotia. I hope that
the Minister of Railways, whom I ibelieve
to be anxious to do his best for the Intercolonial, will sec his way clear to doubletracking at any rate that part of the road
next season.
I conclude with the question.
Hon. Sir. JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I have to congratulate my
honourable friend upon the ingenious
character of the question which he bas
submitted:
That he will call attention to the defective
character of the Government's policy with respect to existing railways, and will inquire if
the Government proposes to Improve such character.

It reminds me very much of a sharp
cross-examining counsel who on one occasion was cross-examining a clergyman
who was noted for his -deep piety. He
submitted to the clergyman this question:
"Do you still beat your wife?" If he answered yes, he admitted the charge; and if
he answered no, he likewise admitted it. My
honourable friend has submitted to me a
somewhat similar question. Notwithstanding the insidious invitation which he bas
given me to discuss the Grand Trunk Paefic, and the acquirement of the Grand
Trunk, and the double-tracking of the Intercolonial, and other railway problems of
that character, I do not propose to
enter upon any -discussion of those subjects,
particularly in view of the fact that next
week we expect to have before us a very
important railway problem which will call
for all our ability to discuss it fully.

COMMITTEE.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL moved concurrence in
the second report of the Standing Committee on Internai Economy and Contingent
Accounts of the Senate.
Hon. WILLIAM DENNIS: Honourable
gentlemen, in connection with 'this motion
I should like to read a letter which I have
received from the Chairman of the Editorial
Committee which was established for the
purpose of economizing in the public printing. This letter, which. bears some relation
to the report brought in by the Chairman
of the Standing Committee on Internai
Economy and Contingent Accounts, reads
as follows:
The Editorial Committee bas noticed with
great Interest therecommendation of the Standing Committee on Internai Economy andi Contingent Accounts which appears on p. 96 of
the Minutes of yesterday's proceedings of the
Senate.

This ls cjulte In line with the policy whlch. the
Editoriai Committee ado4Pted when It was estabIlsbed two years ago, and has been carried out
by the-Distribution Branch of this department
ever since. The only trou~ble Is that many
members of Parliamnent pay Uttie or no attention to the circulare which the Dstribution
Office sends them.
We are now engaged In printing the bluebooks for the fiscal year ending 3lst March
last. To arrive at an approximate estirqate

Then, judging f romn the demanfi of last ye2Ér, if
there be a surplus stock, we make a reduction
of edition, allowing a fair margin
ifi the side requirements.
for future
Since the Editorial Committee commenced lis
labours we ha~ve reduced the number of printed
volumes by several hundred tbousand copies.
The bulky Sessional Papers, whieh have gone as
high in one year as 32 volumes, will fcr the past
year be only 10, while the actuai number of.
sets printed and bound has been reduced from
75e to 20,0 English, and 3,50 to 7.5 French. On
binding alone, with this reduction In the number
of volumes, and the great cut In the number of
0f

sets, the egving ls a most substantial one. Notwithstanding these economies there bas not
been a single complaint.
Adverting again to the report of the Internal
Economny Committee may I mention that after
conversation with Hon. Mr. Power and yourseif
in the closing days of iast session upon the
suibject deait with in the committee's report, I
requested the Chief Clerk of Distribution to
send out a notification to each senator and
memnber before prorogation.
This was dpne.
For the information of the Senate 1 att.a
copy of circular forwarded to every senator
and. member of Parliament. And what do you
think is the resuit?
There were 92 members
of the Senate last session, and requests for tha
annual reports were received from oniy 20.
There were 'but two senators who asked for all
Government publications. The othere vary from
one to, a dozen.

That is the reason there has been so much
waste in the printing in previo.us years.
Out of 2830 memibers of the Commons last
session only 60 replied. Not one member of
the Lower Hous asked for ail the reports.
Wlth these figures before us it is gratlfying
to note the sentence in the report of the Internai
Economy Committee that " it shahl ba bis duty
(the duty of each senator and offIcer of the
Senate) to return to the proper office such list
so marked as to show the reports with which he
,wishee to be supqhIed." If this recommendation
be falthfuhly carried out It will be very helpfuI
to the Editorial Committee, and will materiaily
assist us in revising from year to year our
estimates of the number of copies of annual
reports whicb we should order to be printed.
Slncerely yours,

Fred Cook,
Chairman.

I desire to have this letter appear in

an Act to amend the Dominion Lands Act.
Hon. Mr. Thompson in the Chair.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

OCTOBER 15, 1919
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The real purpose
of this amendment is to enable the matter
to be gone into more thoroughly-is that
the idea?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. For
instance, under section 16 of the old Act,
the -applicant had to be a British subject.
Now we have increased the difficulty, so
to speak, of obtaining naturalization, and
he may make application before a judge
showing that he las the qualifications
necessary under the Naturalization Act.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why should an alien
be permitted to take out a patent? Why
should lie not become a British subject?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Ho must
become a British subject, as I read it. 1He
may not have secured his naturalization
papers at the time, but lie has to show that
he has all the qualifications permitting
him to secure his naturalization.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why not compel him
to secure his naturalization before giving
him a patent? If he has all of the qualifications, why does he not get hie naturalization before he gets the patent? It will wait
for him.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My reading of it is this. He need not be a British
subject when lie makes his entry, as it is
not necessary; but he should proceed, if
called upon at any time to protect his
entry, to show that he hais the qualifications
necessary to b'come a British subject. He
does not get his patent until he becomes a
Britisli subject.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think so.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: No, nor until lie
establielies to the satisfaction of the judge
that.he is a fit and proper person to receive
a patent. That is the object of this amendment.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Exactly; but lie
might have all the qualifications and yet
never, take out his naturalization.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But one of the
qualifications is that lie must be a British
subject.- If my honourable friendi will read
the next following paragraph lie will see
that his question is answered: " The entrant
shall establish qualifications similar to those
required under the provisions of The
Naturalization Act, 1919."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is where I do
not understand it. That just proves how
necessary it is to have the Act made clear.

173

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
further point out to my honourable friend
that under paragraph B of subsection 4 of
section 8 of the Act there is a provision
which " forbids the issue of a certificate of
naturalization 'before the expiration of a
certain period, after the termination of the
war to any subject of a country which at
the time of the passing of the Act was at
war with His Majesty." That would prevent him from getting his naturalization
papers.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 'That applies,
though, only to nations that were at war
with us.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This provision applies to an entrant of any such
nation.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, but why should
it not apply to all aliens?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
others take out their naturalization papers.
But lhere is a man who by a specific provision of the Act is prevented from becoming naturalized, and yet is at the same time
qualified as an entrant for the land. Therefore the statute says that if he establishes
before a judge that lie possesses all the
qualifications under the Naturalization Act
lie may be entitled to his patent.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is, lie may be
entitled to his patent, and will get his
patent though lie does not take out naturalization papers?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But lie
cannot take out naturalization papers on
account of that provision in the Act, if it
is enforced, namely, that forbidding the
issue of a certificate of naturalization before the expiration of a certain period after
the termination of the war to any subject
of a country which at the time of the passing
of the said Act was at war with His
Majesty.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then you grant
the patent without his taking out naturalization?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Because, if it were
not for that section, he would be able to
take it out?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. His
right to naturalization has been postponed
by statute, and yet at the same tme lie has
to make application for his patent, otherwise his land may be cancelled, and lie may
be in the peculiar position of not being

able to get a patent to his land, and at
the same time not able to get his naturalization papers.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: To give him his
patent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Upon his
establishing that he can qualify as a naturalized British subject.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Although he does
not qualify?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
although he qualifies in fact, he cannot
get his certificate.
Hon. Mr. FÔWLER: Exactly. Then this
is simply a device to give an alien entrant
whose nation bas been at war with us a
patent before he can be naturalized.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is what it is.
I do not know why we should be so tender
towards these people.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A good
deal may be said about that. I shall be
very glad to make further inquiry.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think that ought
to stand.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am satisfied that that clause should stand pending our getting further information upon
it. But I can see the difficulty which bas
arisen in the first place. As I have said,
h nmust make ont an application for his
patent within a particular time. He would
possess all the qualifications for naturalization papers or certificates, were it not for
the statute which says, " Because your
nation is at war with our nation, you are
not entitled to naturalization." At the same
time, his entry is subject to cancellation.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Is it subject to
cancellation if he bas performed his homestead duties?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, I
think he has to apply for his patent.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think

My honourable friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) stated that he thought
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

it was not necessary to make the application. My honourable friend will find under subsection 3 that it is apparently necessary that the application should be made
for the patent.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It is, under this
Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes:
If any alien entrant, who has resided in
Canada for five years, fails to apply for a decision of the court within sixty days after the
agent of Dominion Lands has notified him-

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Which subsections
are you going to allow to stand?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
let all those subsections stand that have to
do with subsection 2.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They are all interwoven.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Does subsection 4 stand?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsections 2, 3 and 4 stand.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Honourable gentlemen, while we must be very particular
about restricting aliens if they have shown
any signs of being enemies of Canada, yet
I think it is the duty of legislators to try
if possible to facilitate these foreigners becoming good citizens and getting their patents as quickly as possible. I think it is
the business of the legislature to afford as
much facility as possible to any good immigrant in the country whose intentions are
all right, although he may have come from
an enemy country, and who has shown no
signs of hostility. I think obstacles should
not be put in the way of such immigrants
becoming good citizens as quickly as possible if they comply with all the regulations.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: A great many of
them did show signs of hostility.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite apart from
the question of extending sympathy to
aliens from enemy countries, there may be
another reason for subsection 2 of section 4.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: That stands.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I know, but we
are discussing these subsections:
The entrant shall establish qualifications
similar to those required under the provisions
of The Naturalization Act, 1919, chapter thirtyeight of the 'Statutes of 1919, and amendments
thereto and regulations made thereunder, save

paragraph B of subsection four of section eight

of the said Act which forbids the issue of a
certificate of naturalization before the expiration of a certain period after the termination
of the war to any subject of a country which

OCTOBER 15, 1919
at the time of- the passing of the said Act was
at war with His Majesty.

If you look back to. the Naturalization Act
you will find that that subsection provides:
<B) No certificate of naturalization shall,

before the expiration of a period of ten years

after the termination of the present war, be
granted in Canada to any subject of a country
which at the time of the passing of jhis Act
was at war with His Majesty. . . .

The -title would be held up for possibly
ten years and would be uncertain during
that time. I think it very desirable that
some means should bo provided whereby
the question of the title might be settled
one way or another; or the title might be
cancelled so that somebody else might apply
for the land and get it, instead of having
the title hung up for ten years. I mean
that, apart from the question of sympathy
or want of sympathy, it is quite important
for us not to have titles to homesteads held
up for a period as long as ten years.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Could not a person
come in and purchase land on the open
market and get the title to it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. 'McMEANS: Then, what is the
difference. A man takes a homestead; but
another man may buy a piece of land and
thus get a title to it, for unless he does
he cannot mortgage it 0 deal with it. I
o
do not see where the di erence comes in
between the purchaser and the homesteader.
Why could not the homesteader get a title
to the land as well as the main who obtains
it by purchase?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A safeguard is provided fby subsection 8 of the
same clause that we are considering. That
is to say, after the judicial decision is made
upon the application of the entrant:
The Secretary of State of Canada may thereupon, In hie absolute discretion, issue a certificate in form C that the said allen entrant is
or te not qualified to receive a patent, and shall
send the same to the Minister of the Interior.

Form K will he found as a schedule to
the Bill. I suppose the purpose is to overcome that difficulty. In fact,, everything is
done except to issue the naturalization
papers.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There is a very wide
difference between a man purchasing land
in the open market and a man getting a
homestead.
A homestead is something
which s given by the country.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The applicant has
to work for it.

175

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He has to work for
it, but it is an inducement rwhich is held
out to him as a reward for coming here.
The case is quite different when a man
goes and buys land in the open market
and pays the market price.
I do not agree with the honourable
gentleman from Portage la Prairie (Hon.
Mr. Watson) that it is the duty of
this legislature to facilitate the making ci alien enemies into citizens.
I think that it is the dîuty of the legislature
to erect barriers or obstacles in the way
against a too hasty naturalization of those
people. That has been our fault in the
past. That is why we had certain sections of our country filled with men who
were disloyal to the flag and disloyal to
the country, who cared more for the land
they came from than they did for the land
they came to, and in which they were receiving so many benefits. I would like to
see the period of probation extended, and
very materially extended, so that a man
should prove what his calibre was and
what his regard for this country was, before being able to obtain naturalization.
We have here a melting pot, and let us
take care that the fires under that pot are
hot enough to melt and fuse what goes into
the pot, so that the result will be pure

pnetal.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That l good.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is what we
want to do in this country. The honourable gentleman from Portage la Prairie
gays we should do everything we Gan to
facilitate the making over of those people
who come to this country with ideas altogether foreign to oui ideas. Let us take
time te educate them. Let us see besides
that they are not planted in communities
thrôughout this country. Let them be
scattered so that they may be subjected
to the true Canadian -influences of those
people who belong to Canada and who all
their lives have lived in Canada and under
Canadian institutions. We have a very
difficult task ahead of us. We have here
a territory that is very extensive and very
valuable. In order that the resources of
this country may be developed, we require
population; but it is better far that it
should remain in the primeval wildernese
than that we shôuld bring the wrong classes
of people here and try to assimilate them
to rapidly. That is my view.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Does the honourable
gentleman from Sussex propose that the
same period of probation should be ap.
plied to English immigrants?

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I would like the bonourable gentleman to answer me himself.
. Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Certainly not. Il
my honourable friend finds it necessary to
ask that question, I am afraid I fail to
reach his intelligence.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The reason why 1
asked the question is this. At the time of
the unfortunate difficulties which arose in
the city of Winnipeg, when the names of
the parties who were the ringleaders and
were most active in connection with the
disturbances came out, they were found to
be, not the names of foreigners, but the
names of Englishmen.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: But their followers
were foreigners.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Just one or t4vo
cases of that kind have occurred. My
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Power) is
proud of his Irish ancestry. He would
not put up Roger Casernent as a representative of Irish manhood. There are
dirty, renegade Englishmen, as there are
dirty, renegade Dutchmen, as there are
dirty, renegade Canadians. My honourable
friend is arguing from an individual to
the mass.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I do not know what
the honourable gentleman from Sussex
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) was driving at when
he referred to the remarks I made. We
have to be specially guarded in our legislation as to who shall receive patents for
land. I say that it should be the business
of this Parliament te facilitate the issue
of a patent to any person who is entitled
to it under our laws.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is not what
the honourable gentleman said.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: If the honourable
gentleman will look in Hansard he will see
what I said. I am net here to defend
aliens who have shown that they are
enemies of Canada. I do not think they
should receive patents at all. Instead of
issuing patents to them, we should drive
them out of the country. I am in full sympathy with that. But men who have been
in the western country know that there are
thousands of persons on homesteads who
were classed as alien enemies during the
war, who came from Germany or Austria,
but who are good citizens and good Canadians. They have been barred during ·ìhe
war from receiving their patents. I say
that if such persons appear before a judge
Hon. Mr. POWER.

and show good reasons why they are entitled to patents, the court should make an
ordler for the issue of the patents. I think
that is perfectly riight and just.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Does net the honourable gentleman draw any distinction
between citizenship and loyalty?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: No. J would net
draw any distinction. I think that a disloyal citizen should be deported from the
country.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If they have been
alien enemies, I do not see how they could
be good citizens.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Thousands of people
in the West have been classed as alien
enemies under the War Measures Act, because they came fTom Austria or Germany, but they were net in sympathy with
the enemy at all. In fact, I know of a
number of persons who would have gone to
fight for Canada, but were deprived of that
opportunity because they came from Austria. I do net sec why such people should
be looked on as enemies after the war is
over, and should net be entitleO to the
patents which were promised them when
they came te this country.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The honourable
gentleman means Czecho-Slovaks, Poles
and persons of that sort?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I do net care-who
they are; if those people have up te date
shown thenselves to be good citizens, they
should receive consideration.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I would like the
honourable gentleman from Portage la
Prairie to tell me« of any man who is a
thorough German and settled in Ganada
who is a loyal citizen.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I did net say Germens. I do net know very many Germans,
but I know a number of Austrians.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I do not think
any member of this House would accuse
me of being over friendly te the alien
enemies. I have said enough in this Chamber perhaps to inform the House where I
stand on the question. At the same time, I
appreciate the fact that we have in our
country quite a number of aliens who have
earned their patents and have not received
them. Some of those persons at least are
entitled to fair consideration.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: At the same
time, I would like to emphasize what J

OCTOBER 15, 1919
have said on other occasions, that the
quality of our citizenship is far more important than our numbers. As to granting
homesteads to aliens from enemy countries,
if I understand the Act aright, it provides
that enemny aliiens cannot secure a homestead. If my understanding of the Act is
not correct I would urge the Government to
make it so. I do not believe that at this
stage we should encourage immigration
from alien enemy countries. I agree with
what has been said by my honourable
friend from Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) regarding the quality of our immigrants. It
would be a suicidal policy to try to fill our
vacant northern lands in Manitoba, for
instance, with any more of that class of
citizens. We have a large number of them
in Manitoba, and there is no doubt we have
failed to assimilate them. We have the
evidence on every hand. We had it during
recent strikes. My honourable friend from
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power) referred to the
fact that al of those who were arrested and
whose names were published were old
countrymen-Englishmen. I think that is
probably quite true. A great many of the
strikers were Englishmen, but we who
know what was going on there know that
these men were put into office and kept there
largely by the votes of the thousands
of foreigners who are behind them.
Despite what anybody may say to the contrary, I say the alien enemy in Winnipeg
to-day is a menace, and I know wh.at I am
talking about. This country cannot be too
particular in giving land to people of that
kind; at the sane time, no injustice should
be done to men who have proved themselves loyal. Some men here have had the
same experience that I had when I was
raising a battalion. Dozens of these people
tried to join the battalion to go to the Old
Country to fight; but they were the younger
element, and not the real Austrians. As
you can well understand, the Austrians and
the Germans were anything but friendly to
the British cause. I contend that in framing amendments to the Dominion Lande
Act some provision should be made which
for years to come would debar such people
from eecuring free land in this country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Since this
discussion commenced,' I have had an opportunity of looking into the statute. Its
meaning is this: The entrant will have had
hie- naturalization papers, but under section 4 of the Naturalization Act provision
was made whereby any certificate of
naturalization issued during the war could
be revoked by the Secretary of State. ConS--12

177

sequently we are dealing now with the cause
in which the entrant has his certificate of
na!turalization. He now must confirm, before a judge, the qualifications which before entitled him to tlie issue of naturalization papers. The decision oi the judge is
then forwarded to the Secretary of State,
under section 8 of the Act. The Secretary
of State then decides as to whether these
letters of naturalization should or should
not have been revoked during the war. If
he certifies that it is not a case for revocation, -then the patent issues.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then section 4 of
the Bill applies only to -cases like that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, only
to cases of that kind. If my honourable
friend wil trace up the statute he will find
that it deals with that sort of case. Then,
provision is made whereby no certificate
of naturalization shall be issued to any
enemy alien for ten years; consequently
'that clase of entrant would not be entitled
to a patent at all, because he could not establish that he was entitled to naturalization, as provided for by the Naturalization
Act.
New subsection 5 was agreed to.
New subsections 6, 7, and 8 were agreed
to.
On new subsection 9 of section 4-entry
may thereupon be cancelled, or order issued for letLers patent:
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If a man bas made
an entry and has had his homestead, say,
for three years, bas made improvements,
built a house, cultivated the land, and
fenced it, would his entry be cancelled
without his receiving any com.pensktion
whatever?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No provision is made for compensation, but there
is a provision of the Dominion Lands Act
by which the new entrant will have to pay
for the improvements upon the land; and
what he pays for the improvements may be
applied for by the person who made them.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They are appraised
by an officer?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
New subsection 9 of section 4 was agreed
to.
New subsection 10 of section 4 was agreed
to.
Sections 5, 6 and. 7 were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.

IN

COMMITTEE

AND

REPORTED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The law
with reference to concealed wea-pons will
apply to all.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: It does now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Whether
aliens or nationals; but in the case of aliens
it is now provided that they shall not be
permitted to carry any weapons of the
character mentioned in the Bill unless a
permit is issued.
Hon. Mfr. BELCOURT: If I had my way,
honourable gentlemen, I would make that
provision apply to everybody.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
that would be a good law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What reason is
there for anybody going about with a pistol
or a revolver or ýany other offensive weapon
on his person?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: He cannot under
the law as Lt is now.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This provision is
applicable only to aliens; so anybody who
is not an alien may go about with a pistol
or a revolver or other firearms in his possession.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 24,
an Act to anend the Criminal Code. Hon.
Mr. MeLennan in the Chair.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He may have a
whole arsenal if he displays it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Whether be displays it or not, he may have it in his house,
or his office drawer, without any permit.

On section 1-aliens not to have firearms
or weapjns without a permit:

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He must not carry
it if it is concealed.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I sbould like to ask
the leader of the Governinent if he can give
us arry information as to the kind of permit
that is ýto be issued in this case. I do net
quite sec why aliens should be allowed to
use firearms at all.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: "Being an alien,
bas in his possession any pistol," etc. I
say I would apply that provision to everybody. I do not see why anybody should
have on his person, or in his office drawer,
or under his pillow, a pistol or firearm of
any kind. Of course, it is different as to a
rifle or a shotgun, because they are used
for the purpose of hunting.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
might be circunstances warranting the issue
of a permit. As I explained the other day,
the present Act simply forbids concealed
weapons. Of course, this measure will prohibit the carrying of any weapons by aliens.
'Hon. Mr. FOWI.ER: Was
formerly absolutely forbidden?

not

that

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The law
as it stands prevents aliens carrying concealed'weapons; but it was thought*desirable that it should be extended to all kinds
of weapons.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That applies to all
persons.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BOYER: Recently four young
men were brought before the criminal court
in Montreal. The oldest was only 19 years
of age. They had started from Montreal
after stealing an automobile, and had gone
about the country, and just from deviltry
had killed a man. All they found in the
bouse was $9 or $10. The four of them
have been condemned to death. When arrested they had in their possession not
Why
only revolvers but daggers as well.
should suh persons be permitted to carry
firearms? They were al] Britishi subjects.

OCTOBER 15, 1919
1 think the law should provide against anybody carrying a weapon without a permit.
Hon. Mr. THOMPS ON: It does now.
Hon. Mr. BOXER: We should flot allow
every Tom, Pick and Harry to carry firearms. A boy of'nineteen years of.age may
not really ilndeistand the gravity of the
crime he is committing. In a moment of
anger or foliy he may shoot and kili.
The victim in the case which. I have mentioned was the father of a large family, a
perfectly honest farmer, who has left a
widow and four or five children. Why
should we flot provide against such cases?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: We do.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I may point out
to my honourable friend that under an
amendment to the Criminal Code which
was made in 1913, section 118 was repealed
and ànother clause substîtuted therefor.
The amended clause reads:
Svery one is guilty of an offenoe and liable,
on sumxnary conviction, to a penalty flot exceeding one bundred dollars and costs, or to
Iinprlsonment for three months, or to botb fine
and costs and imprîsonment, -who(a) flot having a permit In Form 76, bas
upon bis person a pistol, sheath knife, 'bowie
knif e, dagger, stiletto, metal knuckles, skuli
cracker or otber offensive weaipon that may be
concealed upon the person or any air gun or
any device or contrivance for muffling or stopping the sound of the report of any firearm.
elsewhere than in bis own dwelling bouse, sbop,
warebouee, counting-house or premises.
Therefore anybody carrying any of those
articles is liable according to the law as it
standsat the present time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My objection was
that nobody should be allowed to have
firearms in his dwelling or anywhere on
his promises-flot- only on bis person. 1
do not see why it is allowed.
Hon. Mr. POWER: 1 think that the law
as read by the honourable gentleman on
my right (Hon.,Mr. Bostock) is just about
the correct thing. I do flot see that we
need this amendment.
Section 1 *was agreed to.
The preamble and the titie were agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
PATENTS 0F INVENTION BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMIMITTEE.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill
25, an Act respecting Patents of Invention.
Hon. Mr. Watson in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
S-121

179

On section 2-minister to have power to
wajve requirement to manufacture, etc.,
invention within prescribed period:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In what respect
is this provision new? How does it differ
from the present law? My recollection is
that section 44 of the present Act covers
the same ground.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
think the minister has any discretion at
ail about extending the period or waiving
any of the requirements under the existing
Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUIRT: Under section 44,
if I remember correctly, the minister could
on applicationi dispense the- manufacturer
for a definite period.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
based entirely upon the circumstances
which have taken place during the war.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Section 39 of the
Patent Act reads:
Whenever a patentee is unable to commence
or carry on the construction or manufacture of
bis invention within the tWo years hereinbefore
provided, tbe Commissioner may, at any tim.-j
flot more tban tbree montbs before the expiration of tbat term, grant to, the patentee or bhs
legal represenatives an extension of tbe term of
two years, on bis proving to the satisfaction of
tbe Commissioner tbat his.(allure to commence
or carry on such construction or mnanufacture à,due to reasons beyond bis control.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
for reasons beyond his control. 0f course,
that w&uld not apply under clause 2 of the
iBill; that would be for reasons within his
control.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: That is the difference.
Hon. Sir JM1ES LOUGHEED: Yes,
there would be that difference.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-saving rights of persons
who have used, etc., invention while patent
was void:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would cail the
honourable gentleman's (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) attention to section 3. I tbink
that whenever a person has commenced to
manufacture after the patent bas hapsed,
as contemplated in section 3, he bas an
acquired right and should be alhowed to
continue to manufacture, not only without
paying any royalty, but without having to
get permission from the minister. I o.bject
to the hast portion of the section:
and moreover the minister upon bearing tbe
parties after sucb notice as be mnay deem re-

180

SENATE

quisite and sufficient and considering all the
facts and circumstances of the case may impose such terms and conditions (including if he
seo deems advisable, permission to continue such
manufacture, use or sale), to which his order
shall be subject, as the minister may deem
reasonably necessary for the protection of persons who have commenced lawfully to manufacture, use or sell the invention covered by the
patent.

I would replace that by saying merely,
"and may continue to manufacture such
article."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend will observe that this is making provision for extraordinary conditions
that occurred during the war, and it seems
to me that, because of the disturbance of
the rights of the patentee during the war
by reason of the war, any one intervening
should not be permitted hereafter to enjoy
all the rights of that patent. The person
who availed himself of the patent during
the interregnum is protected in wbat he
did during that particular period; but it
seems to me that it would be a manifest
infringement of the patent to say that because he had acquired a right during that
particular time it should flow on without
any interruption.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would not this
patent right apply to the case of alien
enemies who had patents in this country
when the war commenced? Does this mean
that those patents can be resuscitated?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is covered by
section 4.
,Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In that case, will
there not be great trouble over the question
of dyesP I understand that during the war
the dyes which had been made in Germany
were being manufactured in other countries.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would be governed by Orders. in Council
passed under the War Measures Act dealing with the (patents of enemies. Furthermore. the conditions under the Treaty of
Peace would have to be recognized. The
Peace Treaties with the enemy countries
have made provision for the regulation of
those rights; to what extent I am not quite
prepared to say; but section 4 provides for
the recognition of the provisions which are
made in the Peace Treaty. This simply
gives the minister authority to extend the
time for compliance with the Patent Act
in cases which have been interfered with
by the war. It does not go outside that. It
deals with a limited class of cases. I might
by way of illustration take for instance
the cases we deal with from time to time,
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

in which applications are made to Parliament for the extension of the rights of
patentees. That condition still obtains and
will not be interfered with by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course, the
number of those Bills will be very seriously
diminished.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Because in future
application wilýl be made to the minister
rather than to Parliament.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The applicant rnust show that it is by reason of the
war that the lapse occurred.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That would not
apply to section 1, would it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, and
it would apply to section 2. In fact, that
principle is the fundamental principle of
the Bill; the lapse must be attributable to
the war.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But I would call
the attention of the honourable gentleman
to clause 4. It seems to me that the first
portion of clause 3 is all right and covers
the point which the honourable gentlenan bas made:
In any case where an order Is made by the

minister under the authority of the last preceding section, or where a patent which has
become void under the terms of the Patent Act
in consequence of the non-payment of fees or
failure to manufacture, or because of the importation of the patented Invention, has been
subsequentIy restored and made valid by the
operation of any order made under the authority of this Act or under any Order in Council
or regulation heretofore lawfully passed, and
during the period when such patent was voit
any person has commenced lawfully to manufacture, use or sell the invention covered by
such patent, the patentee or proprietor of the
patent shall not be entitled to any claim, action
or demand in respect of such manufacture or
sale, or the use of the article so manufactured
or sold.

Then the section goes on to say that the
minister may allow the party who has commenced to manufacture to go on manufacturing on such terms as the minister may

prescribe. The honourable gentleman (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) will see that his contention is borne out by the first two lines
of section 3, but the following lines go
much further and are general in their
terms. I therefore submit that it is not proper legislation to interfere with vested
rights that have been acquired, because the
patent bas become publie property, and I
cannot see the wisdom of giving to the minister

the

power to

probibit manufacturp

OCTÔBER 15, 1919
from being continued by the party who has
been manufacturing in good faith.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: In ail the legislation that we have passedý in respect to,
lapsed patents, we have provided that anybody who had manufactured the patent during the time of the lapse ehould be entitled te continue manufacturing, although
we restored the patent rights te the patentee afterwards. But this seems to me to be
an entireiy different proposition. This section reads: " During the period when
such patent was void," when the patentee
could not exercise any rights, owing to certain conditions. Suppose that I, knowing
that, step in and commence to manufacture
the article patented. It is a question of
equity whether I should have the right te
continue manufacturing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Do I understand my honourable. friend's recoilection to be that we give the ri'ght to continue manufacturing to those who have acquired the right in the iheantime?
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON:" Invariably.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Invariably, in reviving patents from year to year. A number of Bis have corne before this House,
and it has been the invariable practice to
save the rights of those who have comrnenced to manufacture in the meantime.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
be in error, but my recollection is that we
protected whatever was dons in the interval, but that we did not continue the right
of .the infringer, so to speak, of the patent.
However, I am perfectly willing that this
should stand, in order that we may look
into At.
Hon. M1r. DANIEL: It gives the minister the right, alter hearing both parties, if
heq deeme iA proper, to allow a person te
,continue the manufacture or te sale.
Hon. Mfr. THOMPSON: As I said belore,
I 1think it is entiTely different from. the ordinary restoration of patents. In ail thie
other cases we' have had here, in renewing
patents, wve have protected the man who
Qtarted the manufacture during the lapse
of the patent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A point which I
think la worthy of consideration is that,
whilsi the Bill is predicated altogether on
absence, from the country because of war,
that principle Vodeparted from, or forgotten
in section 3.
,Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
lhere is eomething in that contention.

181

Hon. Mfr. BELCOURT:
The section
reads:
in any case where an order la made by the
minister under the authority of the last precedlng section, or 'where a patent whieh has
become vold, etc.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall
be very glad, to make further inquiries regarding thie Bill, and therefore move that
thsecommittee rie and report progress.

On section 1-name changed:
Hon. Mr. POWER: There is just one
point that I should like te mention in con-

SENATE

182
nection with this inatter.

I flnd that the

present Dominion Police,

who are an in-

fantry force, are te be included under the
title given here, namely, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. That name is not
applicable te foot policemen.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We shal
not insist on their being niounted. The
great majority of this new body will be
mounted. 0f course, it does not necessarily
follow, h4ecause they are called monnted
police, that every inember must be a
mounted man. The nam«e Mounted Police
is possesýsed of great historie interest, and
it is desirable that it should ho continued.
The namne is a very effective one, and is
recognized froxu the Atlantic te the Pacifie
as standing for the very highest standard
of police efficiency.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I know that; but the
Bill dees not carry out that principle. The
Bill says that wherever the words " Royal
Northwest Mounted, Police " ceur they
shahl ho changed, to " Royal Canadian

Mourited Police."
I-on. Mr. FOWLER: It is'a pity that they
could vnt kepep the old nanie, bocause tlîe

best constahulary in the world. The only
constabulary that cotupares with it in any
way is the Irish constabulary.

of Conimissioner and Financial Comptroller:
Hon. Mr. POWER: Is there a Commissioner and a Co.mptroller, too?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.

The

Comptroller is the deputy minister; the
Commissioner is the commanding officer.
Hon. Mr. MCSWEENEY: Who is the
Commissioner now?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Colonel
Perry. Mr. McLean is the Comptroller.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is the Commissioner

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is ex-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Not

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In that case his
position really would not be as good financially as it is at the present time. Then,
aocording to subsection 1 of this section,
the Comptroller is a deputy minister. I
think the salaries of the deputy ministers
are now $6,O0 a year.
Hon. Sir JAMES .LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is it right that the
Commissioner, who is the head of the whole
force, should be receiving a smaller salary
than the Comptroller?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am not
prepared to say that certain allowances
may not be m-ade to the Commissioner. I
have not enough information on the subject
te speak definitely as to that.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Is not that the case
now?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, he
is furnished with a bouse, heat, water,
light, and so on. Whether they would be
furnished to him here is doubtful.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It seems to me
that it would be rather a hardship to be
brought down here.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose he will make his stipulations before
coming.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Will his salary be

could not ride would be a very useless adjunct to the police authorities if he were
after a criminal.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: There are two

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I know; but here it
is provided that that is not to be a qualication.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That can
be enforced by regulation.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why not say that
candidates for the mounted section must
be able to ride, or must pass an examination in equitation? That would cover it.
The legislation looks silly in this way.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: He will not be
mounted if he èannot ride.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I have seen men
mounted who oould not ride. They did not
stay mounted very long, perhaps.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
have thought that that was an unneces,sary provision even when the Act was first
passed, because it is entirely in the hande
of the officers controlling the police to de,termine the qualifications of every man
who becomes a member of the police. Notwithstand-ing the fact that we are striking
that out, that qualification as to those who
are joining the mounted section can be
just as readily enforeed as if it were

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, it will be recalled that
this Bill was practically pa'ssed by the
Committee of the Whole House, but my
honourable friend from Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross) rnoved an amendment thereto.
Han. Mr. BEIQUE: Where is the amendment?

.Hon.. Sir >JAMES LOUGHEED: The
amandment, which is to ha found at page
78 of the Minutes, reads as follows:
And. the Exchequer Court of Canada shal
have power and jurisdlction, on petitlon, to
Inquire Into and determine 4in cases where
there ls no existlng provision for compensation)

paiS out of public funds to persons In respect
of inss Incurred or damage sustained 'by reason
of interference with their property through the
exercise by th~e crown of its rights and dut1,3s
under such orders and regulations.

I have taken this up wi'th -the Government, and there are two objections to the
amendment. 'In the firet place, it can
scarcely ba saîd te be germane, ta the Bill.
I quite concede that it is ini order ta amend
a Bill, once it is before Parliament, in any

185

way that Parliament anay choose ta do;
but in tihis particular case we have brought
down -a Bill providing for the interpretation
of Orders in Cauncil which 'were passed
under the War Measures Act, and iLt ie
now proposed to tack on to the Bill a provision creating a new obligation on the
part of the Crown by which damages may
ha recovered in tha event of -a patitioin
beiug filed and a fiat issued. Section 7
of the War 'Measures Act already makes
provision for -the obligation of tha Crown
in cases where property has been acquired
or used by the Crown in pursuance of the
Act. But that recourse against the Crown
is limited ta tihat partiicular clase of case.
If lwe create a new obligation as rwide and
ais sweeping as is proposed by my honou-rable friand from Middleton, it throws upon
the Crown an obligation the scope of which
can scarcely ba foreseen. There is no good
reasanwhy the Crown should be compelled
at the present tima to acknowledga an
obligation of that character, for this reason:
if there is a manifest claini3 againat the
Crown because of soma, a-ct whihlihas been
dons in pursuance of tihe War Measures
Act, there is at present nothing to prevent
those who hava suifered damage from, seeking compensation st the hands of tiha
Cra'wn 'but that right should not ha made
obligatory. We cannot at the moment foreses what class of casa might ari-se, that
wouId create an obligation af a very serious and sweeping character. Let me illustrate. For instance, as I understand, the
Hydro-Eleetric organizatian of Ontiario le
already claiming very large damages from
the Dominion Government by Teason of
certain orders which rwera made during
the war, and tihere ara other claims
of that kind which -are- undefinable,
but which. at tihe saima time are almoat
irnmeasurable
as to the extent ta
which
damage
might
be
claimed.
Under the extraordinary conditions which,
arose during the carrying on of the war
and under the extraordinary conditions
which the Gavernment Ïhad ta face for the
purpose of meeting ahl its obligations, flot
only internai but external, it would certainly be very bad policy, with respect ta
those engaged in extensive enterprises such
as we know were carried on, and carried on
at a very subetantial profit ta .them, ta
give recognition ta the dlaimi that, notwithstanding, they did suifer damages which
shoruld be compensated by the Crown. My
position is this: that, if damages af that
kind have been suffered by any persan
or any organization, they can approach the

SENATE

186

Government, and, if there is an equitable
basis for their recognition, I have no doubt
that the Governient will gladly entertain
any claim so based. Under the circumstances I have to oppose the proposal which
is made by my honourable friend from
Middleton.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I think I gave some short explanation
of the amendment at the time I moved it.
There are two ways in whicb the Crown
can claim, and has been claiming, the
right to take property or to interfere with
the property of the subject. One of these
ways is under the Royal prerogative. You
will find, on reading quite a number of
Orders in Council-I will not say all, because I have not examined them all-that
the
in many cases they say, "under
statute," or " under the prerogative power."
It mîay turn out that there is no authoritv
to take or to interfere with property by
statute; but during the time of the war
the Government could fall back upon the
Royal prerogative. The difference betwoen
taking property under the Royal prerogative
and taking it under statute is this. If it
is taken under the Royal prerogative, you
have no action against the Crown, eitli
by petition of right or by any other forin
of action: vou simîply have to take anything that the Crown chooses to give you,
and if it says, " We will give you nothing,"
you have to go without. That is the position of the Royal prerogative, which is said
to be founded on necessity. There has been
a big battle going on in the courts of England this year as to whether a thing can be
donc under the Royal prerogative when a
statute provides for doing that thing. It
bas been decided that the prerogative right
is merged, and that there is no necessity
to exercise that prerogative.
When you come under the statute, one
of two things may happen. The statute
may provide that there is to be compensation, or it may say nothing about compensation at all. In England, in 1915, when
they hiad to deal with this question, and
when they were taking a great deal of
property under statute, the courts said:
The Crown bas no prerogative right at
all; you can go to the courts, as provided
by the statute." But they recognized that
there were a large nuiiber of cases in which
there was no provision at all, either for
compensation or as to how compensation
was to be assessed. A judgment was given
in the House of Lords, in wbich Lord
Wrenbury said:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

By Royal Proclamation of March 31, 1915,
there was created a Royal Commission of
Inquiry to inquire and determine and to report
what sums (in cases not otherwise provided
for) ought in reason and fairness to be paid
out of public funds to persons in respect of
loss incurred or damage sustained by reason
of interference with their property through the
exercise by the Crown of its rights and duties
in the defence of the realm.
The difference between what is stated

there and what is proposed in the amendment that I submintted to the House is practically, as I pointed out at the time, that
in England they institutel a commission,
whereas I sougbt to avoid that and to send
the matter to the Exchequer Court, where
there are two judges. What they have provided for in Engiandl is the very thing that
I think we ought to provide for here,
iameily, that if any property bas been taken
under the Royal prerogative by virtue of
these Orders in Council, and no provision
bas been made for compensation, or no
mîethod lias been devised for assessing coinpensation, tlien the subject should not be
deprived of his property.
There was anotlier case known as the
Keyser Hotel case, which is, perhaps, the
mîîost celebrated case which has been argued
in Eiglan(l for years. That case went to the
louse of Lords, and all throug'h the judges
and the lawyers as-erted the saine thing,
namnely, that no British subject whose property was injured or taken from him by the
Royal prerogative, or by any other process,
was called upon to forego any fair claim
for damages that be nmiglt have. In the
clien time, under the Royal prerogative, a
mian got nothing at all. If the kingdom
was invaded and an army found it necessary to camp on his ground and dig up his
farm, the man had no recourse, and all the
burden fell on him. That was three or four
hundred years ago. The unfairness of that
condition was recognized in England, and it
was changed so that the man got compensatin and the loss was distributed among all
the subjects of the King.
If you look at section 7 of the War
Measures Act you will find that it is very
narrow. It simply provides:
Whenever any property or the use thereaf
has been appropriated by His MajestyThe first essential is that it is to be ap-

propriated. If His Majesty bas given A the
right to interfere with the property of B, it
cannot be said that the property lias been
appropriated, so the Act does not cover a
case of that kind. Then the section goes on
to say:
-has
been appropriated by lis Majesty under
the provisions of this Act, or any Order in

OCTOBER 16, 1919
Council, order, or regulation made thereunder,
and compensation la to be made -tberef orIf the Order in Council does not provide

proceed 'by petition of riglitP
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No.
*Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAND: Does the honourable gentleman intend to provide by his
amendment that the subject may sue
without a petition of rightP
Hon. Mr. ROSS: He miglit or lie miglit
not. I may say that I do not know of any
existing dlaims at ail; I ar n ot dealing
with any known case; I arn looking at the
statute and tlie Orders in Council, and I
can see a great gap in tlie existing procedure with regard to co mpensation. The
a'mendment is effective only wlien tliere is
no existing metliod of claiming compensation. If there la another way under the
statute, or by petition of riglit, then my
amend.ment does not apply. It deals only
wlth tlie class of cases that are not
provided for, but whicli may very well
exist. I shall be surprised if some cases
of that kind do not arise under tlie existing
Order in Council.
If the Government
knows that there are no cases of that kind,
I do not see wliy they should object to the
amendment. As I see it, tliis is simply a
matter of justice between man and man
and between the aubject and the Crown.
The ýCrown has a right to sue a subject:
wliy bas not n~ subject a riglit to sue the
Crown? It will be said, no doubt, that this
will open tlie door to a lot of bogus dlaims."
The same tliing can be said about cases in
the courts; but, as we know, not one case
in fifty thousand is. struck off the records
because of tlie dlaim being false or vexatious. If a man were to bring an action of
-that kind against the Crown, the penalty
would be the samne as it is in any court,
namely, that lie would be mulcted for costs,
4 unless lie established bis dlaim; or if the
dlaim was a frivolous dlaim it -could be
struck off.

187

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Tliere is provision foi
sending a certain class of cases to the
Exethequer Court, but there may ibe a
large class of cases for which no provision
is made. Supposing a property is taken
nnder the Royal prerogative, the owner lias
no action at commion law or by statute.
Hlon. Mr. ROCHE: I will give a concret.
case. I own docks in Halifax next to the
railway wliarf whicli was used extensively
by transports. The railway people built
their wharf out covering almost ail of the
water, and le!t very little dockage room
for ahips., I liad steamers in at my wharf,
and the premier naval officer ordered tliem
to go ont to. make room for the transports
that came in. I went o liim and shoyed
him a rnap and told him that the vessels
at my -whiarf were entirely in my water.
He said that lie was acting under thie Wai
Measures Act. I do not know who lie was
representing-whether it was tlie Dominion
Government or thle British Government:
hie was an officer in the Britishi navy. I
said to liim: -I amn disposed Wo aid you
in every way possible; il you 'want accommodation, I amn very willing to give it to
you; but you ouglit to exercise no riglit to
deprive me o'! the use of my own property
wben you bave access to the whiarf in
other ways." I do not know whether lie
was acting under the Royal prerogative
or an English statute or a Dominion
statute; lie said lie was acting un-der the
War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Thie honourable gentleman may possibly very mucli need the
assistance of this amendment.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was not present
when this discussion was opened, but I
heartily -support tee amendýment of te
lionourable gentleman from Middleton. The
only existing provision whieh can be taken

if they wish.

188

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see no harm
in adopting the amendment proposed and I
think that considerable advantage may accrue to the people from its adoption. The
only difficulty is to understand why it
should be tacked on to the Interpretation
Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
venture to say, honourable gentlemen, that
the time is premature to create an obligation of this character without having very
full information as to whether there is a
class of claim not yet presented to the
Government, and concerning which there is
good reason to suppose that compensation
will not be made. I think it would be very
unwise for the Government to recognize a
class of claims which may run into millions
of dollars, claims which up to the present
time have not received recognition, and of
which they know nothing. It seeme to me
that it will be seon enough to pass legislation of this character when we proceed to
wind up the many transactions which have
arisen during the war, which will put us
in possession of information of a very much
more articulate character than we have at
the present time. It is very undesirable at
this time, when the Government is struggling with financial difficulties, to open up
a new avenue whereby millions of dollars
may be claimed from the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The obvious
answer to that seems to be that no one
would like to put the Government of
Canada in a position different from
that
occupied
by
any
individual.
The courts are open to individuals for the
assertion of their claims of any kind against
other individuals, and the tribunal decides.
That is where I beg to differ with my
honourable friend. In establishing a privileged status for the state when an injury
has been donc, or is claimed to have been
doneHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
War Measures Act already makes provision
that where property has been taken, appropriated, or used by the CrownHon. W. B. ROSS: It does not say
used."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Permit
me to read it:
Whenever any property or the use thereol
has been appropriated by His Majesty under
the provisions of this Act, or any Order in
Council, order or regulation made thereunder
and compensation is to be made therefor and
has not been agreed upon, the claim shall be
referred by the Minister of Justice to the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

That opens up a sufficiently wide avenue,
it seems to me, through which persons assert
their claims against the Crown. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Ross) 'has dealt with
the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown,
but that bas long since been exploded, so
far as concerris denial of compensation by
the Crown. I do not think it will be contended by any one that the Crown strictly
exercises its prerogative in appropriating
property or in refusing to compensate those
who have in good faith sustained damage
by reason of sone action by the Crown. The
whole trend of legislation during the last
twenty-five years bas been along the line
of placing the 'Crown in precisely the same
position as an individual. But here is an
extraordinary situation arising out of the
war, and it is not desirable that the avenue
for asserting claims against the Crown
should be further opened out until we have
some information. I am bound to say this,
that in any case in which a person or a
corporation has been damnified by reason
of the intervention or the action of the
Crown the Government would give every
consideration to the claim. I fancy I am
justified in saying that every honourable
gentleman in this Chamber would have full
confidence that if there were a bona fide
claim submitted to the Crown for damages
sustained by an individual that claim would
receive every consideration. It is another
matter, however, to create an obligation
by statute and to confer jurisdiction upon
the court at once to enter upon the determination of the question.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think it is a fact
which is notorious all over Canada, as regards every Government that has been at
Ottawa, and every provincial government,
that the right to sue the Crown by petition
of right has not been exercised as it has
been, almost time out of mind, in England.
A man gets a petition of right in England,
as a matter of course. Any man who applied to the Attorney General of England
for a petition of right and did not get it
within a reasonable time would be able to
wreck any government that could possibly
be formed in England. But the Government
at Ottawa-I am speaking not of this Government, but of all the governments that
have ever existed here-and all the Provincial Governments, will tell you: " If your
claim is good we will not give you a petition
of right, because you would win; if it is bad
we will let you have a petition of right, because you cannot win.' That is about the
position. You have to go with your finger
in your mouth-

asks-the right to test the opinion of the
Department of Justice before the tribunals.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Ross was
negatived: yeas, 18; nays, 27.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the honourable gentleman who has expressed the
opinion that the amendment which has just
been negatived might be so general in its
application that it would lead to unknown
fields, give this Chamber some explanation
as to the reason which has prompted the
Department of Justice to bring forward this
amending Bill? I confess I am somewhat
diffident about -supporting this Bill, because it looks as if it were brought in to
cover a special case, and J am always afraid
of a general Act brought in to fit a special
case. I think my honourable friend (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) will not deny
the reasonableness of
bthis contention,
that Parliament has the right to be told
what has prompted a departnent to bring
before it an anend:ment to a general Act.
This amendient to the Interpretation Act
may cover a multitude of Acts which have
been done under the general Orders in Council and may lead us to the absolutely unknown-perhaps mnuch farther than we
would go if we knew exactly what bad
prompted *the departient to propose this
Bill If my honeurable friend would give
us the concrete case which has led the department to suggest this amendment to the
present law it would be far more satisfactory.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend was apparently not present when I moved the second reading of
the Bill, when I did make an explanation
as to the reason. I would say to my honourable friend that, as he' already knows, a
great body of Orders in Council have been
passed under the War Measures Act. That
body of Orders in Council is practically
statute law, so far as their effect is concerned. The Interpretation Act did not
apply to Orders in uouncil; it was therefore
necessary to pass an urder in Council under
the War Measures Act mnaking applicable
the Interpretation Act te all the Orders in
Council which had been passed under the
Act. That Order in Council was passed on
the 26th day of June, 1917, and read's as follows-I omit the formal words:
Doth hereby order and declare that every
provision of the Interpretation Act, Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1906, shall extend and
apply to every order and regulation heretofore
or hereafter passed by the Governor in Council in execution of the powers conferred by the
War Measures Act, 1914, except in so far as
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

any such provision (a) is inconsistent with the
intent or object of such order or regulation, or
(b) would give to any word, expression or
clause of any such order or regulation an
interpretation repugnant to the subject matter
or the context, or (c) is in any such order or
regulation declared not applicable thereto.

This Order in Council furnishes an interpretation for all Orders in Council passed
under the War Measures Act. But immediately the Proclamation of Peace is issued
this Order in Council will fall to the ground,
and there will be no interpretation provision
for the Orders in Council which have been
passed under the War Measures Act, and
in pursuance of which certain business will
have to be concluded. It is therefore necessary to supersede this by statutory legislation, and we are simply embodying this
Order in Council in the Bill which is now
before us. It simply applies the Interpretation Act in the Revised Statutes to the
Orders in Council which will survive, so far
as the conclusion of Acts or things' done
under those Orders in Council is concerned.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I wish at this
stage to renew my protest against the Bill.
I called attention on the second reading to
clause 8 of the Interpretation Act, which
reads as follows:
Any Act may 'be amend'ed, altered or repealed
by an Act passed in the same session of the
Parliament.

Now, this Bill must be read in connection

with other setions of the Interpretation
Act, including section 8, which I have just
read. The present Bill perpetuates for an
indefinite time the power of the Goverrnment
to legislate by Order in Council, even after
the Proclamation of Peace. You must read
section

8

as declaring:

" Any

Order

in

Council may be -amended, altered, or repealed." We are to have the Declaration of
Peace in a month or two, or possibly within
a week, when the War Measures Act will
All the Orders in
cease to have effect.
Couneil which have been passed iby virtue
of the War Measures Act will also, fall to
the ground, as my honourable friend (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) has just told the
fHouse. The effect of this Bil, if it becomes
law, will be to enable the Government to
amend, alter, or repeal any one of these
Orders in Council, which would otherwise
be void. In other words, the effect of this
Bill, if it is passed, is to perpetuate government by Order in Council, which we have
had for five years. I do not know that
the Government is going to do that. I hope
it is not going to have recourse to such a
desperate trick, as I would call it; but it
is possible for the Government to do so.

OCTOBER 16, 191919
* Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will the
honourabke gentleman be good enough te
read the whole of the section?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I will read it al:
.Any Act may be amnended, altered, or repealed by an. Act passed in the same session
of the Parliament.
Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOUGHEED: Yes,
passed by the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that cannot
apply to the Orders in, Council. My honourable frie'nd knows veoey well that the on-ly
provision of section 8 which should be
looked at with regard to this Bill is the
first part cf the section:
Any Act may be amended, altered or r-pealed.
That is, " Any Order in Counicil may be
amended, altered, or repealed." The words
which follow apply only to an Act of Parliament and do not apply to Orders in Counicil.
Therefore 1 say that the Orders in Couneil
themselves may be amended, altered, or
repealed, notwithsytanding that the po.wer to
pass Orders in, Council will have completely
lapsed iby reasoni of the Proclamation of
Peace.
I made that protest befoSe, and I want
to renew it now. I do flot suppose my
protest will have any resuit, but,' sitting
here as a lawmaker, I think it is my duty
at least to point out the use that may be
made of this Bill, and I do net know 'but
that it is the intention to make such use
of it. At aiýl events, I want to point eut
its possible application.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I toek the
liberty on a former occasion of ex3pressing
my d'issent from the interpretation placed
by my honourable friend. on section 8, and
I avail myseif to-day o! this further opportunity Vo say that I dissent se much from
his opinion on that section as to consider
lihat opinion Vo be without founidation.
There would have to be an Act o! Parlisment before the Bill could operate in the
way my honourable friend has indicated;
and I think my honourable friend feels
just as asisured as 1 do, that once peace is
proclaimed, there is no intention Vo perpetuate those Orders in Council, and thu8
violate the whole spirit actuating the Parliameut by which the Act was passed. No
governmeut could for a momeent survive
the evasion indicated by my honourable
friend.

Hon. Mr. POWER: There is perhaps miore
force in the argument of my honourable
frieud from Ottawa <Hou. Mr. Belcourt)
than the leader o! the House seems Vo thinàk.
My difficulty wiVh respect Vo this rueasure
is, that, while it is no doubt desirable that
any Orders in Council made under the War
Measures Act should be treated as though
they were statutes, I do not thiuk that the
power should go any further. The clause
before us goes a good deal further. It says:

I think the honourable gentleman from
Middletou (Hon. Mr. Ross) and the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.

by the War Measures Act. Ais it is uow,
we do net know just what wie are proposing

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable

the

amendment made by the House of Coinmons to the amendmnent made by the Senate
to Bil 3. an Act for carrying into effect the
Treaty of Peace between His Majesty and
certain other Powers.-Hon. Sir James
Lougheed.
iHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourablé gentlemen, I beg to move:
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that louse that the Senate
doth agree to the amendment made by the
House of Commons to the amendments of the
Senate to Bill 3, an Act for carrying lnto effect
the Treaty of Peace between Ris Majesty and
certain other Powers.

Hon. Mr. POWER: Would not it be more
regular to take the sense of the House first,
and to pass the resolution afterwards?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would be done on the resolution. I presume
this is the only way the question can be
raised, and for that reason I have moved
the resolution. It may be recalled that the
Bill was amended, probably inadvertently,
at the instance of the Government, so as to
give the necessary power for the ratification
of the various treaties that imay be enter.ed
into between the Allies and the enemy
ceountries. As, that amendment would involve the ratification of treaties with which
Parliament had not been made acquainted,
it was thought in the House of Commons
that it would be inadvisable to go to that
length; but inasmuch as the Austrian
Treaty has been ratified, it w'as thought
desirable that the Bill should cover that
treaty as well as the German Treaty. Consequently, the Bill has been limited to those
two treaties.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think the Government, as represented dn the House of
Commons, are rather to be congratulated on
the stand they have taken. The honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) raised the point that it was not wise
for us to ratify treaties which we knew
nothing about. Apparently there has been
some difference of opinion between the Government as represented in this House and
the Government as represented in another
place.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why should we
not be consistent? We have the example
of the House of Commons with regard to
the treaty with Turkey; why not apply the
same rule with regard to the treaty with
Austria? We have not seen it any more
than we have seen the treaty with Turkey.
We are told that the treaty with Austria
has been signed, but that is ail. I think
the Government would, be entitled to further commendation if it *further -amended
the Bill by confining it to the treaty with
Germ any.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
it was pointed out in the House of Comnions that the Austrian Treaty, as far as
Canada's interest is concerned, was practically a replica of the German Treaty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has it not been
signed by Canadian representatives?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is exactly the
same, is it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am told
that it is, so far as Canada is concerned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Can the bonourable gentleman tell us whether the
treaties with Bulgaria and Turkey have
been signed?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I amn un-

aware of their being signed.

INTERPRETATION BILL.
THIRD READING.

Bill 4, an Act to amend the Interpretation
Act.-Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
S-13

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 21, an Act respecting
the Canadian Wheat Board.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the object
of this Bill is to continue the powers, duties,
and rights of the Canadian Wheat Board for
eighteen months from the date of the Bill.
This board was appointed by the Governor
in Council under the provisions of the Order
in Council recited in section 1 of the Bill,
for the purpose of dealing with the grain
crop of the present year. It is estimated
that to adjust accounts and finish up the
business, arising out of the purchase and
sale of the 191.9 wheat crop will take at least
a year and a hall. This continuation of the
powers of the board will simply be along
the line of dealing with the crop of the
present year, and does not continue their
rights to deal in any sense with any future
crop.
Hon. Mr. MaSWEENEY: What is the
price of the 1919 crop to be?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: $2.15, I
understand, plus any surplus that may te
realized after the expenses of the board are
satisfied.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Can the honourable
gentleman give us any idea as to the price
the farmer is likely to receive? Most of the
1919 crop is now marketed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
inform my honourable friend as to that. I
should think it would be very largely governed by the price of wheat in the European markets. The United States for the
wheat crop of 1919 has fixed an arbitrary
price per bushel, which is in excess of the
amnount we have fixed. Whether the crop
will realize that it cannot at the moment
be said; but the farmer will have the advantage of any surplus which the crop may
realize beyond the minimum amount we
have fixed, namely, $2.15 a bushel. It is
to te hoped that a surplus may be realized.
The United States Government, in fixing
the price-I thin'k it is $2.26-estimated
that the Government itself would have to
defray a substantial amount in the handling of the crop at that price; but it would
be premature to venture to say what
amount will te realized on the Canadian
crop.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I see by press reports that in Southern Saskatchewan the

RVED EDITION

SENATE

194

farmers are at present teaming the wheat
across to the United States, where they
get from $2.80 to $2.85 a bushel, with the
result that the elevators along the southern boundary of the province are closed
because of no trade being done. Evidently
the Canadian farmer is teaming his wheat
30 or 40 miles and getting a very fair price
for it.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Is that a fair price?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I suppose it is a
fair price when it is the market price.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I understood
the leader of the Government to say that
the Un.ited States Government price was
an arbitrary price.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is an
arbitrary price, in so far as the purchase
of wheat at that price is concerned.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I understand
that $2.26 is not an arbitrary price, but is
the minimum

price, and that wheat has

been selling at from $2.60 to $2.80 and $2.90
per bushel.

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, it is very well to dilate and express
great satisfaction at the very high price of
wheat obt.ained by the farmers, as if they
were the only class in the community.

An Hon. SENATOR: It looks like it now.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I should like to ask,
wbat about the consumer, when flour is

$10 or $11, or $13 a barrel, or whatever it
may be, based upon this minimum price
of wheat? The consumer bas very great
objection to it soaring so high. If the
function of this board is to continue the
very bigh price of wheat, and consequently
the very high price of flour, wbich people
of all classes have to consume, I do not
know that it is an object of benevolent
legislation to continue these soaring prices.
or to continue the function of the Wheat
Board either. There should be some regard
paid to the feelings and pockets of the consumers as well as to the aggrandizemnent
of the farmers.

Hon.

Mr.

SCHAFFNER:

Honourable

gentlemen, according to Mr. Barnes, the best
authority on this question, in Anierica at
any rate, even -with the price of wheat
at $2.60 or $2.80, bread is the very cheapest article of diet which goes on the table
of either the poor man or the rich man.
Mr. Barnes further says-and this perhaps
raises a point that may not have been generally considered, and is a reply to what
Hon. Mr. WATSON.

my honourable friend from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Roche)-states that, in order to reduce
the price of the loaf by one cent it would
be necessary to reduce the price of wheat
62 cents. So the argument that the high
price of flour adds very much to the high
cost of living does not stand. I want to
repeat that statement, that bread is the
very cheapest article of diet that goes on
the table of any man in this country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: For the
purpose of clearing the minds of honourable
gentlemen as to the difference between the
two systems, may I refer to a statement
made by the Minister of Trade and Com-

merce, who is chargeable with the administration of this Act. The statement shows
a comparison between the systen adopted
by- the Canadian Government and that adopted by the United States. Dealing with the
fact that the United States bas fixed a price
of $2.26 per bushel for American wbeat, it
shows what the Canadian farier will get
for his wheat:
If the wheat nets $2.26 the original sellers
will get

$2.26;

if it nets $2.30

they will

get

$2.30; if it nets $2 they will stili get their $2.15
and the Government will pay the difference.
That is to say, if the wheat roalizes less
than $2.15, the Canadian Governient will
pay the difference.
They get what a com)etent wheat-selling
board gets for the produet on the markets of

between the two systems.
So I have to accept the statement of the

Minister of Trade and Commerce, who is
chargeable with the administration of this
Act, as to the operation of the United States
law in fixing an hrbitrary price.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: It fixes an arbitrary price, but that is the minimum price.
The United States farmer oan sell his wheat

OLEOMARGARINE BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 28, an Act to permit
the temporary Importation, Manufacture
and Sale of Oleomargarine in Canada.
'He said: Honourable gentlemen, the ob-

OCTOBER 21, 1919
jeet. of this Bill is to permit the temporary
importation, manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in Canada. It is proposed thaet
those rights sihall be continued until the
lst day of March, 1921. It will be recalled
that under the War Measures Act this
class of product, owing to the price of butter, has been permitted to be imported ito Canada. I need not say that there has
been a very great difference of opinion
among different classes in Canada as to
whether this product should be allowed to
be, flot only imported into Canada, but
also manufactured in this country. It may
be of interesýt to the Chamber to be made
aware of t.he volume of importations and
of manufactures, of oleornargarine since this
law was passed. There have been îmported
into Canada from. December, 1917, to September 30 of the present year 8,7'06,937
pounds; and there have been manufactured
in Canada in the same period 13,927,265
pounds. From this volume of importation
and manufacture it. is fair to reason that
the -Government is warranted, under
present conditions, in permitting the importation as well as the manufacture of
this food produet. With this explanation
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I cordially endorse
the motion made by the honourable leader
of the Government, but I think it has one
alight defect, in 'that. its oper-ation is to
cease on the 3l.st of Mar.ch, 1921. The average man, I assume, would not consume
oleomargarine if he could afford to use butter; but at the prices now charged for butter a very large proportion of the population would have to take their bread dry.
They cannot afford to purchase butter, and,
but for the changes which have been made
in the law, they would flot be afflowed to
purohase oleomargarine, which. is, as I understand, a very satisfactory substitute for
butter. I think that the farmers of this
country have, on the whole, been very prosperous cruring the las-t few years and have
had great. opportunities of accumul-ating
profits, and I agree wîth my junior colleague from Halifax <Hon. Mr. Roche) that
the average man, the ordinary consumer,
sbould not be penalized for the purpose
-of enabling any class to, make more than
a reasonable profit. I think that the limitation is the only objectionable feature in
this measure.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: WiIýl the honourable

the notice being holidays, and the respondent having changed her address in Toronto, the notice reached her rnly on Tuesday afternoon. There is an affidavit that
she immediately attended at her solicitor's
to ask for an arrangement for funds to permit her to come to Ottawa, and that her
solicitor here was notified that she had been
unable to get funds and could nrot. he present
on Wednesday. The local solicitor appeared
before the 'Committee on Divorce te ask
that the hearing be postponed until the
respondent could attend. This application
was refused, and the evidence was heard.
The evidence, 1 must say, having read it,
is very bad, but it appears also that it, is
the evidence of the originator of the charges
in this case. Now, I ask that this matter
be referred back so that the committee
may hear the evidence for the defence, in,
the interest not only of the respondent, but

in the interest also of somie of the co-respon(lents, all of whoin are stiginatized by the
appearance of their naies in print in this
evidence, without their having any opportunity to be lheard as to whether or not
the charges are truc. I have in my hands
two affidavits, which I do not propose to
read, because I assume tiat this application
for reference back will be granted. Tiese
affidavits are froin two of the persons named
as co-respondents, and they totally deny
that they bad any such conection as is

My honourable friend from New Westminîster (Hou. Mr. Taylor) has said that
bhe lias affidavits of 'two of the co-respondents. There are about a dozen other corespondents; so he has a very sriall
ninority anong all those that were cited.
I am instructed that this application is
made only for 'the purpose of delay. The
petitioner is a returned soldier, a man wlio
had a very creditable career in Canada,
and who, as I am informed, went to the
war as a private and returned with the
rank of captain, having been promoted on
the field. While he was bravely venturing
his li'e for his country, bis 'wife was taking
an entirely different line. Probably mîost
of those co-respondents were slackers, who
cared nothing for the country except perhaps to propagate a breed as poor as theimselves. It seems to ie that of ail the
cases that have come before the eomnînittee
this is the one in which delay-for this is
only for the purpose of delay-should
least be granted. I trust that the House
will not pass this motion.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: As a matter o!
privilege, I desire to state that the honourable gentleman has no 'warrant whatever
for saying that I make this motion for the
purpose of delay. There is not the slightest
fourndation for that. I knotw nothing about
the case except from the evidence that -was
placed in ny hands an hour ago. I make
this motion in the interest of justice. It
would be granted by any court in the land,
and the respondent would be heard before

that she has a defence. The least she should
do when applying for funds is to file an
affidavit witl the committee denying the

conmmittee the probability of ber establishing a good dýefence. She did not do so,
and we refused the application. No defence

CIVIL SERVI-CE BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED movod the
secondl reading cf Bill 18, an Act te amnend
the Civil Service Act, 1918.

He said: Honourable gentlemen,
inr
moving the second reading of this Bill, m.iay
I bie perînitted te say that in the session
of 1918 we passed what was known as the
Civil Service Act. Under section 52 of that
Act -this provision was mnade:
The Commission shall, as soon as practicable
after the passing of this Act, after consultation
with the several deputy heads and other principal officers and employees, prepare schedules
contalnlng lista of the positions and the duties
and salaries attached thereto, and the salaries
and Increases or other remuneration thdt in the
opinion of the Commission are necessary and

l)roper for the Outside Service or any portion
or branch of the Outside Service of any depart-

ment and of any other branch or Portion of
the Outside Service, and, upon the approvsl of
the saine by the Governor in Council, and by
resolution passed by both Houses of Parliarnent,
such schedules shahl corne into operation.

There are other provisions in this Act
looking te the reorganization and the classi-

fication of the public service with a view of
stanýdardizing the different positions, the
salaries and the duties which ail go te mnake
Up the public service of Canada.
The
present Bill is simply giving effeet to the
principle aud the policy then adopted hy
Parliament. LAt the last session of Parliament,' there was -presented a classification cf
the service, such, broadly speaking, as we
have before us for consideration during the
present session; but, owing to the fact that
there was not then sufficient tinme for proper
consideration of the very large volume cf
study emibraced wit.hin the four corners cf
that classification, the matter stood over
until the present session. Unfortunately, it
reaches this Chamber at a tinie wvhen the
prorogation of Parliament is practically
within view, and I can very well understand ýmy honourable friend opposite criticising the Goveninment for bringing before
Parliament at the eleventh heur this very
important piece cf legisîstion. It bas been
before the House cf Gommons, and bas
apparently received iuch consideration
there as warranted that House in giving a
third reading to the Bill and sending it te
this Chamber for final consideration.
Whbher time will permit cf proper consideration being given te it I cannot at
the moment say. The Bill is before us,
however, and although prorogation may he
a very short period ahead of us, it is our
duty to enter uýpon the study of the legislation and te give every attention te it.
I need net enter into any lengthy explanation of what this legislation involves;
but I might with advantage read -a short
extract from a statement which -was propared by the Civil Service Commission. I

think for the last session of Parliaument, as
to the scope of the work which they had
undertaken. This will give you some idea
not only of the magnitude of the work but
of its importance and the necessity of it
not only being entered upon, but bein soriously considered and adopted by Parliament. In speaking of the classification
which accompanies the Bill, the conmnission states:
The classification accomplishes six distinct
desirable ends, thus furnishing six reasons why
it should be adopted. They are as follows:
The state of

develops in any service administered under a
decentralized system and without regard for
sound and scientific employment principles.
(a) In many cases highly qualified employees
were found to be as a class underpaid.
(b) In other cases employees were found who
had no scruples in holding sinecures and drawing salaries large or small for doing nothing.
(c) Throughout the service there was serious
la k of uniformity in salaries for persons performing the same work. Tn one branch of one
departmient of seven employees doing identically
the same w-ork, two received $600, one $900, one
$1,200, two $1,300, and one $1,350. In another
branch where duties, responsibilities, hours of
work, and personal qualifications were found
to 'be identical, one employee was receiving $600
per year, and another $1,800.

be as effective as it will hereafter become
to place in a proper condition the public
service of our country. It stands to reason
that this Ohamber can scarcely grapple
with the many considerations involved in
dealing with this subject; therefore it
occurred 'to me, and it vas also suggested
to nie by the minister who had charge of
the Bill in the House of Commons, that
it should be sent to a special comnilttee,
vhich could exercise its discretion in hearing whomsoever it chose, as to any explanatiens which might be souglit, and as to the
facts which the conimittee wished to consider. Therefore, -after the second reading,
I ani going to take the liberty of suggesting
that a special eonmittee be appointed by
this Ohamber. to vhon this Bill will be
sent for consideration.
I should like to direct the -attention of
honourable gentlemen to the very lengthy
classification attached to the Bill. To what
extent the comnittec will sec its way to
recommend to the House the acceptance of
that classification, which has been prepîared by experts, I an not prepared to
say. Nor ai I prepared to say whether
the eommi'ttee will sec its way clear to
delegate to any tribunal the revision of
that classification. These are subjects upon whicli the coimittee -will no doubt remnaking whatever
port to this House,
recommendations 'they deem best.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, the leader of the Government has referred to the late hour of the session at
which this legislation has been brought
before us. I think we all agree that it is
rather la-te to ask the House to de-al with
a question of this kind at this time. We
were brought hore this session for the purpose of givinig our approval to the Peace
Treaty, and I do not think that any bonourable niember of this House, wien lie came
here in Septeiber, expected that he would
be ýasked to deal with an important question
like the Civil Service Act.
The proposal to put the Civil Service of
Canada on a fair and equitable basis I am
sure appeals to every menber of this House.
We hope that the legislation will be of a
kind that will place the Civil Service of
Canada in such a position that a man, on
entering the service, could feel that lie had

a career before him in which he could do
his very best in the interest of the country,
and that when the time came when he was
no longer fitted to do his work he would
be placed in a position to retire with a
comfortable maintenance for the rest of his
life. I understand that it has not been
found possible under this Act to deal with
this latter question.
My honourable friend has referred to the
classification with which we are asked to
deal. If honourable gentlemen have seen
this classification they will observe that it
is a very cumbersome piece of work. I do
not think any one of us would feel able to
grasp the whole of the information that is
printed in this book. It contains some 850
pages and deals with an enormous number
of positions. But I happened, in glancing
through it one day, to notice in one particular case a classification which struck me
as net being on a proper basis. I hope that
the whole question will be examined by the
special conmmittee to which my honourable
friend has referred. The item to which I
particularly allude is one that affects the
Senate. At page 294 appears a classification
dealing with the " Editor of Debates
(Senate)." He is apparently put in a class
by himself and his compensation is started
at the suin of $200 a month, or $2,400 per
annum, and increases to $225 a month, or
$2,700 per annum. Just above that we find
the position of " Editor of Debates." Presumably this refers te the Editor of Debates
of the House of Commons, for the definition
of his duties are that " during the sessions
of Parliaient he is to b responsible, under
direction, for the reporting, editing, and
printing of speeches and proceedings of the
House of Comnmons and its committees."
The compensation for the Editor of Debates
of the House of Commons starts at $290 a
month, or $3,480 per annum, and rises to
$350 per month, or $4,200 annually. Honourable gentlemen will see that the maximum
salary whichl the Editor of Debates of the
Senate can receive is less than the minimum
of the Editor of Debates of the House of
Comnimons. Any honourable gentleman who
thinks about this matter will realize that the
Editor of Debates of the Senate bas to be as
highly educated and as well trained as the
Editor of Debates of the House of Coumons,
and it seems to me an anornaly that a
classification of this kind should appear in
this book. I have net had time to examine
it more closely to sec whether there are
other anomalies of that nature, but I think
that this is a point which should be very
earefully conîsidered by ftle commilittee. It

199

would appear from a reading of this classification that more attention has been paid
to the number of reporters who are doing
the work of the House of Commons, as compared with the number employed by the
Senate, than to the actual education
and training that the editor himself
must have. I do not desire to cast
any reflections, but I think that in
classifying a position of this kind more
attention should be paid to the training
and education of the man occupying it
than to the number of persons who are
employed under him. I was speaking the
other day on this subject with a gentleman
who claimed that in another department a
somewhat similar condition existed. Therefore I think that the Government are to be
conmended for referring this matter to a
special committee, se that we may investigate ,all such questions.
Another question occurs to me in regard
to this Bill. The honourable leader of the
Government himself referred the other day
to the way in which Bills are drafted.
When honourable gentlemen look at this
Bill they will see that the manner of drafting the Bill makes it very difficult to understand how the clauses fit in and how
they apply. I think this is almost a stronger instance than the one which was mentioned the other day, of the necessity of
our having a commnittee appointed for the
purpose of considering the drafting of Bills,
to see if we cannot have thei drafted in
such form that it will be casier to understand exactly what is meant-what clauses
are struck out and what other alterations
are made. I think that when honourable
gentlemen come to examine this Bill they
will find great difficulty in understanding
what is meant by the alterations that are
made in the Act of 1918.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I express great reluctance in differing from the honourable
leader of the Opposition with regard to the
object of summoning the Senate and the
House of Commons. He said it w-as to approve of the Peace Treaty. Now, if there
is any subject on which a Peace Treaty
ought to have been passed and for which
Parliament ought to have been summoned,
it is the Civil Service above everything
else; because if there is any question about
which members of Parliament have been
at war, it is that of the Civil Service.
It appears to me that the defect in the
scheme elaborated by the experts is this.
It is arbitrary and metaphysical to some
extent; that is, it is based on the supposi-

202

SENATE

That language is rather vague, and I
must confess my inability to quite understand it.
Then, a very important point is embodied
in clause 5, which says:
The following subsections are add'ed to section 28 of the said Act:
The subsection with which I am dealing
is a short one, and reads in this way:
An employee holding a permanent position
that is to be abolished, or which is no longer
required, siall be laid off and his' salary discontinued but his name shall be placed, In the
order provided by the regulations of the commission, on the eligible list for the class of
position from which he was laid off.
That seems to provide a very summary
way of g-etting rid of a man who may have
been for thirty years in the service of the
Government. He holds a permanent position, and the position is not thought necessary; he is laid off, his salary is discontinued, and he gets no retiring allowance.
I think that clause of the Bill needs further
consideration.
Under clause 10, on page 6, a new section,
number 45, is proviaed for. The first subsection deals with promotion. It says:
Promotion is a change from one class to
another class with a higher maximum compensation, and vacancies shall be filled, as far as
Is consistent with the best interests of the Civil

Service, by promotion.

That is something which I think needs
to be made a little more definite. While I
do not believe in promotion by seniority
altogether, I think seniority should count.
I suppose, honourable gentlemen, considering the short time at our disposal,
that I have troubled the House long enough.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, it seems, a strange thing that the
honourable the senior member for Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Power) ha forgotten the legislation that was passed after his party came
into power in 1896. Previous to that time
there was a superannuation scheme, whereby servants of the Crown who had performed their duties £aithfully and well for
a certain number of years were provided
for in their olid age. The friends of my
honourable friend saw fit to do away with
that echeme. The abuse that he is persistently heaping upon this Government would
be better bestowed upon the people who were
responsible for that scheme being withdrawn. My honourable friend has not said
a word as to that, but has staunchly supported those gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. POWER

The leader of the Government pointed out
some anomalies in the Civil Service, and I
presume it is the intention to remedy those
by the present Bill; but even in the present
classification there are some anomalies. For
instance, in the Department of Indian Affairs there are inspectors who have charge
of large districts where there are numbeis
of Indian agents. The classification provides that an inspector's salary shall go up
to $2,280-I think that is the limit, and
there is no provision for any promotion. The
salary of an agent, however, goes up as high
as $2,800; and there is provision that a man
may be promoted from the position of agent
to that of inspector. It is a sort of Dutch
promotion. A man would get a considerably
smaller salary if he took the position of inspector than if he were to remain as agent.
So apparently there is something for this
committee to do.
I was struck by what the middle member
for Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche) said with regard to the service.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: The upper middle
member.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Have it to suit yourself. There is no doubt that the service is
over-manned; I think every one is satisfied
of that; but it is easier to say the service
is over-manned than it is to say in what
respect and how you are going to get rid of
the surplus timber.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The derelicts.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The derelicts. If we
had a superannuation system it might be
easier of aocomplishment; but it is not always the older men who are the most useless. I think there are too many women in
the service. Some women are very capable
civil servants. I know some who are as
valuable as a good many men; but, as a
rule, they are not. I think if some remedy
along this line could be found it would be
of great benefit to the public service.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I quite agree with the
suggestion of the leader of the House that
this Bill should be referred to a special
committee; but when one takes into consideration the Bill and the classification
which it is intended to confirm, I cannot
imagine that the committee, if it is to report
back to this House within three days,
should, would, or possibly could, make as
valuable a report as this Chamber bas a
right to expect. When one takes into
consideration the great amount of work
contained in the classification-a book,

OCTOBER 21, 1919
the Government have persistently refrained
from introducing a Superannuation Act.
The result is, honourable gentlemen, that
there is in every departiment a considerable
proportion of men and women occapying
positions, some of them being paid very
high salaries, who are practically unable
to give value for the money that they receive, and who should be retired froi the
service in the interest of the public. But
the Government feel-and I ai not fading
fault with the Governient because of this
-that if a man tas been serving the public
for thirty or forty years and doing his work
conscientiously, it would be cruelty to throw
hi
out on the world. On the whole, I
rather sympathize with the Government in
that respect. But it ias the duty of the
Government to have long since-not this
year or last year, but long since--passed a
superannuation measure. If that had been
donc we should have got rid of those comparatively ineffective and in some cases
highly paid officers, and then your Civil
'Service Commission would have had a
chance to make a classification that would
have been iuch more satisfactory than
any that ican be made now.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend if he contends that the
classification ought net to be dealt with or
passed until a Superannuation Bill is
brought down?
Hon. Mr. POWER: I ama going to give
I
mîy opinion about that in a moment.
am not now referring to our duty with
respect to this Bill, but I ýsay it was the
duty of the Government to have introduced a proper measure for retiring servants who are too old or are incapable,
without serious injury te the service and
without cruelty to the men themselves.
I know that civil servants are not, as a
rule, favourites with the public generally,
but there is this to be isaiýd. A young iman
or a young womaan enters the service, serves
conscientiously and faithfully for thirty or
forty and in some cases fifty years, and
then has to retire, if the law is carried out
strictly, without receiving anything. If a
man dies in harness, his widow gets an
allowance of two nionths' pay.
Now, I wish to call the attention of honourable gentlemen te the great difference
that exists between the care that the Governmient have taken of the -men who have
gene overseas, have been absent for a
year or two and have coae back and resumecd their avocations, and thei negligenîce
with -which their own direct, permanent

service lias been treated. I do not undertake to quarrel with what has been done
for the returned soldiers, but I do think
that those whose whole lives are given to
the service of the public should be dealt
with a little more liberally than they have
been.
Wi.th respect to the question that bas
been put by the honourable Minister of
Labour I wish to say this. I think that
this classification measure in its present
fori is very ioperfeet; but the service
have been given to understand that this
measure, or something like it, would be
put through-ln fact, before this session;
and even though the measure be imperfect in its present fori, as it certainly is,
and although it may not lie nearly perfect
when the committee report on it, still I
think that, taking it altogether, perhaps the
faith of the country is in a certain way
pledged to the civil servants, and, as I
understand that a great majority of them
are anxious that this measure should pass,
I for one shall net be disposed to vote
against it.
I may be permitted before closing, to say
a word with repect to a matter mentioned
by the honourable the leader of the louse,
and dealt with by the honourable the leader
of the Opposition, that is, the mode of
amending Acts and the language used in
making aimendments. There are two systems
of dealing with amendments: one, if you
wislh to alter two or threce words in a
section, is to strike out the whole section
and to reinsert the section in its corrected
forai. Tbat, I think, for those who have
te use the statutes afterwards, is perhaps
the more convenient plan. The other plan,
the one generally followed now, is to insert
in the existing section the change, whatever
it may bc. It may be said with regard to
the latter system, that it enables those who
-are dealing with the Bill with a view to
its passage to sec at once just what the
I do not
change is that is being made.
undertake to say which is the better systema.
I think, on the whole, that for permanent
purposes the first systei is the better;
but there is also a good deal te be said for
the other systein.
I mîay venture to say a word about one
or two points as to which the comnittee
night look for information. In clause 4
of the Bill, at lines 1i and 12, J find the
following:
For this purpose the commission shall establish lists of persons eligible for such temporary
employment.

OCTOBER 21, 1919
as the leader of the Opposition has
already said, composed of 700 or 800 pagesI really am unable to see how this committee would be able to go over the whole
of that classification and make a real and
equitable report upon it. However, it bas
been my experience, all .through my parliamentary life, that the most important legislation is generally brought in at the end of
the session, and I imagine that the practice
followed out this session will be the same
as in the past.
There is one question that I should like
to ask the leader of the Government, and
that is whether, if they consider it advisable to do so, the Civil Service Commission
have any discretion whatever with regard
to altering the classification as it is brought
before us to-day? Have they any power to
alter it or is this to be a hard and fast
statute which they cannot pass by under
any circumstances?

203

Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: The whole thing
can be discussed then.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If we are not
to be here a month or two studying this
classification, there is no question that the
work of the committee, which will have
but a few sittings, will not amount to very
much; but, at all events, the committee
can listen to whatever representations may
be made either in person or by memoranda
sent to the committee. I may say that I
have received two or three documents from
persons who are opposed to the present
classification. I do not intehd to read
those representations here; I will send them
to the committee. The Civil Service Commissioners, or one of them, naturally will
be in attendance on the committee; and
the deputy ministers could perhapa be
called in case the representations made
were considered to be of a sufficiently serious nature to justify that course. I do not

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I should like to
draw my honourable friend's attention to the
answer. One section of the answer to the
first question is: " Proceeds of notes sold to
-public, $52,000,000." Could my honourable
friends give us some more information as to
what those notes are?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I know
nothing about them. If my honourable
friend will signify what further information
he wants I will try to get it for him. 1
fancy those would be temporary loans.. There
were temporary loans issued by the Canadian Northern and afterward redeemed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But these would be
still outstanding. It says: "Sold to public." Then, with regard to the answer to
the second question: " Expenditure on construction and betterments, also purchase of
equipnent, $56,000,000,' could the amounts
be shown separately instead of being lumped
in one sum?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: May I make a suggestion? Perhaps the leader of the House
may see the propriety of it. I would suggest that when a question has been asked,
the answer should follow the question immediately, instead of being some distance
from it, and being numbered 2, 3 or 4. It is
difficult sometimes to know exactly what
the question was. Would it be too much
trouble to have the answer put after the
question?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
suggest that that be done hereafter.

SALARIES OF POST OFFICE
EMPLOYEES.
INQUIRY.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR called the attention
of the Government to an Order in Council
of the Sth January, 1918, respecting salaries
of postmasters and assistant postmasters,
and inquired:
1. What are the names of the post offices in
respect of which refunds were demanded or
diminution of salaries took place under the
authority of such order?
2. What years were covered, in each case, bY
such demand or diminution; and what, in each
case, was the amount reclaimed or stopped?
3. To what salary did each postmaster or
assistant postmaster remain entitled for each
year affected by such Order in Council; and to
what maximum salary had he been entitled, in
each case, in the years-preceding those affected
by the order?
4. What has been the range of general increase through -bonus or otherwise, in pay of
employees of the Post Office Department at
Ottawa since 1914? What was the salary of
the Deputy Postmaster General in 1914? What
is it now?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I desire to
take up this Bill with the Minister of Justice, and would therefore move that the
Order be dischargedi and be placed on the
Order Paper for Friday next.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When this Bill
was up for second reading I suggested that,
perhaps, its scope could be extended to all
cases in which a patentee bas neglected to

dues in time to the department.

absence from the country, or any other circumstances arising from a state of war, which, in
the opinion of the minister, would justify such
extension.

As my

honourable friend is not going on with the
Bill, could he not take up that question with
the department? It would be a very easy
matter to extend the scope of the Bill.
Clause 1 reads as follows:
The minister may at any time extend the,
time prescribed by the Patent Act, or any rules
made thereunder, for don1g any acts, paying
any fee, or filing any document, upon such

terms and subject to such conditions as he may

were struck out it would read:

By reason of active service or enforced absence from the country, or any other circumstance, which, in the opinion of the minister,
would justify such extension.

The Bill bas the effect of allowing an applicant, patentee, or proprietor an extension
of time for doing a certain act, if it is shown
that he was prevented from doing the said
act by reasons arising from a state of war.
I am asking that the minister should be
given the authority to accept the fee when
the patentee has sone good, valid reason
for having failed to pay the fee in due time.
Very often we are flooded with requests for
Parliament to authorize the applicant to do
within a certain tine what he had failed to
do before a certain date. I wonder if the
department could not be clothed with such
authority and thus save Parliament the
trouble of investigating each and all o!
these cases? The Bills that come before us
from patentees, in nine cases out of ten,
allege that the agent in Ottawa bas failed
to pay the fee, or that the proprietor of the
patent bas died, and that the heirs have
failed to notice that the fees should have
been paid by a certain date-and I can
hardly remember a case in which we failed
to grant what was requested. If a certain
class of excuses have satisfied Parliament
they have satisfied Parliament for
-and
the last twenty years-why should not the
minister be authorized to act upon such
representations?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shall be
very glad to discuss this matter with the
Minister of Justice. Within my limited experience I have never yet seen a department
that was not willing to assume all the

authority

Parliament

might give

to

it;

and I fancy, if it is suggested that the
department or the minister should exercise
this authority, that they will have no objec-

tion to assuming it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE. I do net agree with
the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I think that what

he as suggested might lead to a good deal
of abuse. The department is dealing with
very important matters, and the rights of

the public are involved in a great many instances. I think it is but proper that the
power which heretofore bas been exercised

OCTOBER 23, 1919
by Parliament should continue to be exercised by Parliament. I think it is the duty
of the patentee to maintain his patent; but
if lie fails to do so, either through his own
neglect or that of his representatives, the
least penalty should be that lie should come
to Parliament for the purpose of getting
relief.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Another remedy
has been suggested-that the system which
has prevailed in the United States should
be adopted in lieu of our own law. Our law
allows two or three terms during which the
patentee may extend his patent; in the
United States a greater term is allowed, but
the payment is made once and for all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will take
the matter up with the department.
The motion was agreed ta.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

OPIUM AND DRUG BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 34, an Act to amend
the Opium and Drug Act.
He said: The object of this Bill is practically ta give legislative effect to certain
Orders in Council which were passed at
the instance of the Imperial Government,
who asked us to co-operate with t'hem in
enforcing miore restrictive measures as to
the import and export of opium. The Bill
is a very short one, and simply makes
provision that in the matter of import to

207

or export from Canada of any class of the
different drugs mentioned in the Bill, a
license shall be obtained from the Government.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Is there any limitation of the quantity of drugs to be imported?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That will
be subject to regulations w'hich will be
passed, I presume, by the Department of
Health, which will administer the Act. I
have a very lengthy explanation before me
of the reasons which have led to this Bill,
and of the international nego-tiations or
communications which have taken place in
pursuance of a certain conference held between different Governments on the subject, but I think it is unnecessary for me
to read it to the House.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I think that we all agree with the
principle of this legislation. I only rise
for the purpose of drawing the attention of
the minister to the way in which the Bill
is drafted. It is referred to as "An Act to
amend the Opium and Drug Act," but the
section does not refer to any section of the
Opium and Drug Act which is now in our
statute-books. It simply says:
This Act shall be read as one with the Opium
and Drug Act, chapter 17 of the Statutes of
1911.

Will this be considered as section 1 of
the Opium and Drug Act? It is rather
curious drafting. Perhaps my honourable
friend will look into the question and let us
know about it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
before we go into committee.

The mo'tion was agreed to and the Bill
was read the second time.
MEAT AND CANNED FOODS BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 35, an Act to amend
the Meat and Oanned Foods Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the objects of this Bill are, first, to define more
accurately the term "dry lobster meat,"
and to extend the definition to all kinds
of canned shellfish, as in the canning of
shellfish of, all kinds, liquid is added;
second, to require in the case of canned
fish, that the label shall show, amongst
other things, the weight of the contents of
the can instead of the net weight of the fish
contained therein; third, to modify the
sizes of lobster cans; and fourth, to require

SENATE
that cans containing canned fish and shellfish imported into Canada shall be labelled
in such a nianner as to show, in addition
to the information now required, the weight
of the contents of the can in the case of
fislh, and the weight of the dry meat in the
can in the case of shellfish, as is required
on cans packed in Canada. Last year a
Bill was introduced te deal somewbat similarly with the same subject, but it was not
reported back frein the committee to the
House of Comnions, and consequently did
not reach this Chamnber; therefore it was
thought desirable that it should he taken
up at this session anid passed.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Probably this Bill
can be 'better discussed in committee. Apparently it is intended to change the Act
of 1917, which provided that a pountd can
should consist of 14 ounces, se that a can
nay contain any quantity. It does not say
that it is to be a pound can. I (o not know
the size of the can that is usually used in
the trade; but it bas been suggested to me
that it holds about 12 ounces of fish.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And sells
for 16?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not know
whether it is actually sold as a pound can
or not; but fron the casual attention I
have been able to give to this Bill, it rather
looks as if a canner was going to buy fish
at 16 ounces to the pound and sell it at
12 ounces to the pound. Probably some
honourable gentleman who is more familiar
with the business than J an may be able
to give us some information on that point
when we go into committee.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: This is a subject
that seems to be perennial. We had it bofore us last year; we had it before us in
1917; but the ideas of the department on
the matter were net accepted by the Senate. The men who are in charge of the
Department of Fisheries should know something more about this matter than every
Tom, Dick and Harry who wants te put his
nose into an affair that he knows nothing
A Bill was brought in recomabout.
mending 12 ounces, but fault was found,
for the same reason as my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Bostock) objects, because it
meant selling a twelve-ounee can for sixteen ounces. I know that my hono-urable
friend is perfectly honest in his remarks;
but most of our lobsters are sold in the foreign market-they are sold in France and
in the Scandinavian countries to-day, and
were sold in Germany before the war-and
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

there is a well-understood regulation as to
what weight a lobster can should contain,
and there is no reason for us to be finicky
in trying to force on people what they do
not need. It is all right to provide that
Canadians shall get sixteen ounces of lobster meat for themselves, but it is absolutely impossible to put sixteen ounces ot
lobster meat, with the necessary brine, into
an ordinary can. So a weight of twelve
ounces of dry meat-that is, twelve ounces
after allowing it to drip for so many hours
-bas been accepted as standard by all the
pachers, and accepted by the market. A
weight of from twelve to thirteen ounces of
lobster meat was usually put into the can.
But provision bas been made for a con
containing sixteen ounces of dry lobster
meat, and any person may get sixteen
ounces if ho so desires. The cans have to
be labelled three ounces, six ounces, nine
ounces, twelve ounces or sixteen ounces.
Nobody will be deceived, as the weight of
the contents is marked on the can. Therefore, as I say, I do not sec why we should
be finicky as to what the market accepts as
the standard.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

the interests of these people.

The motion was agreed to.
MORNING SITTINGS OF SENATE.
MOTION.

,Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That commencing on Saturday, 25th Instant,
unless differently ordered, there shall be two
distinct sittings of the Senate every day, the
first sitting ta commence at 11 o'clock, a.m.,
until 1 o'clock, p.m., and the second sitting ta
commence at 8 o'clock, p.m., and that all
Standing and Select Committees of the Senate
be permitted ta sit while the Senate is in
session, notwithstanding anything contrary in
Rule 86.

He said: However, we shall not appropriate Saturday, and we hope there will not
be another Saturday intervening. We shall
not exercise the privileges embodied in the
motion unless it is really necessary to do
so.
The -motion was agreed to.
SUSPENSION OF RULES.
MOTION.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved:
That from and Inclusive of to-day, and until
the end of the session, Rules 23f, 24a, b, d, e,
and h, 63, 119, 129, 130, and 131 'he suspended
in so far as they relate ta the Public or
Private Bills.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would ask my
honourable friend if, as there is really
nothing for us to do, he could not postpone this motion until Tuesday or Wednesday?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We may
find this necessary to apply to the Grand
Trunk Bill when it comes in.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But that has not
yet come before us, and it cannot be introduced until Tuesday evening. If we pass
this motion now it goes into effect at once,
I understand.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not necessarily. I cannot see any reason why the
motion should not pass.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: We adjourn until
Tuesday.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: At the
end of every session, as is well known, if
there is any private Bill legislation before
us, it is very desirable that it should be
accelerated in every possible way; and the
same would apply to public Bills. The
public Bills that will be before us are well
known and I shall see that this motion is
not subject to any abuse.

Hon. Mr. POWER: There is a question
which suggests itself to me. Unless I am
mistaken, I have seen it stated in the press
that the daylight saving iaw goes out of
operation on Sunday, the 26th, and the
question is under what time we shall meet
on Tuesday?
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: New time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 0f course,
there is no statutory daylight saving law
in operation. We have simply adapted our
meeting to the railway time. I do not know
when the railways change their time.
Hon. Mr. MaSWEENEY: I think they
change on Sunday night at 12 o'clock.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Every train is put
back one hour.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then I
would suggest that we meet on railway
time.
The motion was agreed to.
PATENTS OF INVENTION BILL.
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEETHIRD READING.

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 25, an Act respecting Patents of
Invention. Hon. Mr. Thompson in the
Chair.
On section 3-saving rights of persons
who have used, etc., invention while patent
was void:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, the phraseology 'f this
Bill warrants me in saying that it is entirely governed by war conditions, or what
was done in pursuance of Orders in Council
passed under the War Measures Act, and
thgt it is not intended to depart from the
well-established principles or practice which
we have been observing in relation to the
renewal of patents requiring a special or
a private Bill, in cases where there has
been a lapse of time owing to non-payment,
or in the exercise of the manufacturing
rights.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: A question was
raised with regard to the saving rights in
clause 3. Has -my honourable friend looked
into that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
There are two kinds of conditions ,dealt
with in section 3. One is governed by the
preceding sections, and the other conditions
are those which have arisen in pursuance
of certain things done under Orders in
Council passed under the War Measures
Act. This Bill deals entirely with conditions that have arisen during the war, and
it in no way entrenches upon ýthe practice

which has been observed under the Patents

Act generally.
Hon Mr. BOSTOCK: But the conditions
that are provided for under this clause
would appear to be somewhat different from
the conditdons that are usually provided for
in the patent law.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It has been found
necessary to arrange it in this way?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. I
have gone into the matter carefully with
Lthe Minister of Justice. There are some
consequential amendments. At page 2, line
4, strike out the word " last " and substitute the word " sections " for the word
"section."

The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
that the words " any such " be substituted
for the word " his ' in line 22.

The amendunent was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
that after the word " order," in line 23, the
following words be added: " heretofore or

hereafter made."
The 'amen-dment was agreed to.
Section 3 as anended was agreed to.
Sections 4 and 5 and the preamble and
title were agreed to.
The Bill w-as reported as anended, read
the third time and passed.
OPIUM AND DRUG BILL.
CONSIDERED ISN COMMITTEE-THIRD
1EADING.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 34,
an Act to amend the Opium and Drug Act.
Hon. Mr. MeMeans in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
1 requires that a license shall be taken out
for the import or export of opium.
I desire to amend the Bill by adding
another section:
2. This Act shall come into force on a day to
be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in
Council.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Did my honourable friend look into the question which I
raised as to the form of the Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. I
sent for Mr. Gisborne, Parliamentary
Counsel, who informed

me that this is not

a unique form of drafting, but that it has
been followed on other occasions. The particular clause in the Bill does not fit into
any clause in the present Opium Bill; but,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

upon the revision of the statutes, when they
are consolidated, this provision will be properly inserted. The same thing was done,
I am told, in the cases of the Election Act
and several other Acts.
The Bill as amended, was reported, read
the third time and passed.
MEAT AND CANNED FOODS BILL.

OONSIDERED

IN OOMMITTEE-THIRD

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,

On section 1-dry lobster meat and dry
meat:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable
friend say what is the meaning of the word
"processed '' in the 9th line?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose it means having gone through a certain process by which the liquid is extracted from the meat.
,Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: It has nothing
to do with increasing the weight?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You vill
have dry ineat instead of liquid.

FRASER RIVER SALMON FISHERIES.
APPROVAL OF CONVENTION.
The Senate proceeded to the considera-

tion of the message from the House of
Commons requesting the Senate to unite
in passing the following
with that
resolution:
<House

Ilouse of
Resolved by the
Commons:
That it is expedient that Parliamnut do alprove of the Convention between ais Majesty
and the United States of America providing
effective measures for the protection, preservation and propagation of the salmion fisheries of
the Fraser River system, wvhieh was signed at
Washington on the second day of Septeiber,
one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, a
copy of which has been laid before Parliamnent.
and which was signed on behalf of His Majesty,
acting for Canada, by the plenipotentiaries
therein named, and that this House do approve
of the same."
and requesting that their Hlonours wilI unite
with this House in the said resolution by filling
up the blank therein with the words " Senate
and."

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I beg to
move, seconded by Hon. Mr. Poirier:

OOTOBER 28-29, 1919
That the Senate unite with the House of
Commons in the said resolution, by filllng up
the blank therein with the words, "Senate
and"; and that a message be sent to the House
of Oommons accordingly.

This is a treaty which has recently been
entered into between His Majesty and the
United States of America providing effective measures, as set out in the resolution,
for the protection, preservation, and propagation of the salmon fisheries of the Fraser
river system. It provides that the Federal
Governments of Canada and of the United
States-not the state of Washington, as
heretofore-will be responsible for the enforcement of the regulations under it. A
commission to be known as the International Commission, consisting of four persons, two from each country, shall be appointed, who shall conduct investigations
into the life history of the sockeye s'almon, hatchery methods, spawning grounds,
and other related conditions; and who will
recommend for the consideration of the two
Governments any modifications in the regulations that experience under them or
knowledge gained may indicate as desirable. Other species of salmon may be
brought within the ecope of the regulations
later on by consent of both Governments.
The treaty shall remain in force for fifteen
years, and thereafter for two years after
either party gives notice to the other of its
wish to withdraw from it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This matter is one
that -peculiarly affects the Pacific coast. I
think that the Government are to be complimented for having brought about this
treaty, and I hope that we shall see better
results from it than we have seen from
some that have formerly been made. There
have been, I think on two occasions, arrangements for treaties made between this
country and the United States for the purpose of dealing with ithis fishery question;
but, so far as I know, they have had no
practical results. The difficulty has been
that some of those interested in fishery
matters in the United States have been
able to hold up the legislation that was
necessary to put the treaty into force, and
consequently there has been no practical
effect from the arrangements entered into.
The question of the salmon fisheries, as
the honourablé gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor) very well knows,
is a very serious one in British Columbia.
The salmon in the Fraser river have been
decreasing very rapidly for a number of
years, and in the interest of Canada, and
also of a certain section of the United
S-141

211

States, it is most important that something
should be done to enable the salmon to
increase their numbers. I notice that the
department bas recommended that steps
should be taken to inquire into the condition of the Fraser river in the interior of
the country, because it seems to be feared
that certain parts of the banks of the river
may be falHing into the water, and in that
way interfering with the fish in getting up
into the spawning grounds in the higher
portions of the river.
I understand that considerable fishing is
done in United States waters by men who
are using what are called the purse-seines.
If there is opposition to the treaty when
it goes before the Senate in Washington,
and if these gentlemen are again successful in opposing the treaty, as was the case
when it came up in Olympia, in the state
of Washington, I presume the Government
will take some steps to see that the recommendations regarding the banks of the
Fraser river in the higher reaches shail be
attended to, so that the fish that escape the
purse-seines will have a better chance of
getting to the spawning grounds.
The motion was agreed to.

GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY
ACQUISITION BILL.
INQUIRIES.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: I wish to
read to the House a telegram which I have
received fron the Commissioner of the Regina Board of Trade, and which reads as
follows:
We respectfully submit the following resolution duly passed by the council of the Regina
Board of Trade:
That, in the opinion of the Council of the
Regina Board of Trade, the best interests of
Canada will be served by deferring final action

on Bill No. thirty-three, known as the Act re-

specting the Acquisition of the Grand Trunkz
Railway, until announcement is made of the
permanent policy of the Government relative
to the management of the National Railways
and the opinion of the people has been ascertained in regard thereto;
And that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to Sir George Foster, Acting Premier,
Hon. Mackenzie King, Hon. Senator Sir James
Lougheed, Hon. Senator Bostock, and W. D.
Cowan, M.P., Ottawa.

I thought it right to place this before
the House, and would ask my honourable
friend if he can give us any information as
to any simnilar resolution having been forwarded to hlim.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes;
I received a resolution similar to that. It
bas not perturbed me very much, though.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Were there any
telegranîs exchanged yesterday, or the day
before, between the Montreal Board of
Trade and the honourable leader of the
House?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The president of the Montreal Board of
Trade telegraphed me that a delegation
was desirous of coming up to address the
senators. He telegraphed me also to-day
that it was inconvenient for them to come
as indicated yesterday. Senators in their
individual capacity may possibly have an
opportunity of listening to the Montreal
Board of Trade on the subject.
Have they
.Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
asked for a date that would be convenient
for the Senate?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
And no date
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. I
have suggestedHon. Mr. BOYER: Six months hence?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -that it

the Bill comes into the Senate; that then
we shall see what its contents are, and,
I am sure, individuai senators will be very
glad to have their comments upon the
Bill.
THE PEACE TREATY WITH AUSTRIA.
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL.
The Senate proceeded to consider a message from the House of Commons requesting the Senate to unite with that House in
passing the following resolution:
House of
Resolved by the
Commons:
That it is expedient that Parliament do ap-

prove of the Treaty of Peace between the
Allied and Associated Powers and Austriic

signed at St. Germain on the tenth day of
September, one thousand nine hundred and
nineteen, a copy of which has been laid befo-e
Parliament, and which was signed on behalf of
lis Majesty, acting for Canada, by the pleni-

potentiaries therein named, and that this House

do approve of the same.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I beg to
inove, seconded by Hon. Mr. Robertson:
That the Senate unite with the House )f

Commons in the said resolution by filling u
the blank therein with the words, " Senate
and "; and that a message be sent to the House
f Commons accordingly.

The Austrian Treaty is substantially the
same as the Gernan Treaty, of which we
have approved.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Of course, we
all desire to join in this resolution and
are very glad to know that this Treaty
lias been signed on behalf of the Canadian Government by the Hon. Sir A. E.
On this occasion, apparently, it
Kemp.
was necessary to have only one plenipotentiary to sign the Treaty, in place of the
two who signed the Treaty with Germany.
The terms of this Treaty seem to be very
mnuch the same, except that of course there
are clauses dealing with certain matters
which affect Austria and which did not in
the saine way affect Germany.
There is the further question of the labour situation. I understood that under
this Treaty there was to be held at Washington this week an International Labour
Conference, but I see my bonourable friend
the Minister of Labour here. I thought he
was going to take part in that meeting.
Perhaps he can give us some explanation
as to whbat is being done with regard to it.
I think we are all interested to know what
steps have been taken towards carrying out
the arrangenient reached under this Treaty
and the former one, for the purpose of dealing witlh labour questions.

OCTOBER 30, 1919

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In reply to my
honourable friend's inquiry, I may state
that the International Labour Conference
was called to meet in Washington at 12
o'clock noon to-day. I have reason to
think that the business of the convention may not be proceeded with for a few
days, by reason of the fact that the delegates coming from Germany and from
Austria will not arrive in Washington until
November 4, and I felt that perhaps it was
not entirely necessary that I should be in
Washington, at least until that date.
The motion was agreed to.
EXCHEQUER COURT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 30, an Act to amend
the Exchequer Court Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it is
proposed to give the Exchequer Court exclusive jurisdiction in the hearing and determination of questions of enemy debts,
as provided for in the Treaty of Peace. The
Exchequer Court is logically the proper
court to determine questions of this kind.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Now that you
are extending the duties of the Exchequer
Court, would not this be a good time to
give that court jurisdiction to deal also,
for instance, with the purchase of railroads
by the Government?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think the
Exchequer Court has that jurisdiction now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is a very
good law which was, I think, introduced
in the Senate many years ago by the honourable member from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique), and which has been found to
be very useful in cases where railways are
insolvent or in difficulties. It provides
that the Exchequer Court shal have powers similar to those of the High Court of
Justice in England, and the judgment cf
the Exchequer Court bas the same force
and effect as an Act of Parliament. A railway company that is in difficulties may
apply to the Exchequer Court, and that
court arranges everything as to the creditors, the stock, etc. I do not want to anticipate any discussion that may take place
in this House, but when we are dealing
with a Bill respecting the jurisdiction of
the Exchequer Court it would be well to
.amend it by adding the provision that
wben railroads are to be purchased the
Exchequer Court shall be the arbitrator.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read thë second time.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I was
promised that information for to-day, but
it has not come down from the Railway Department yet. I will have it here at the
next sitting of the House.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: By leave of the
House, I may say that I have been reading
the Hansard of another place, and I find
that that question bas been asked over and
over again and nobody there bas been able
to answer it. So I do not blame the honourable leader of the Government. I know
it is not his fault.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Of course,
if my honourable friend is asking an im-

possible question, he will have to excuse
me from bringing down an answer to it.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK inquired of the Government:
What are the names of the railroads includai

What is the arnount of the bonds, debentures,

What is the amount of the above shares an]
securities of each of the railroads in the hands
of the public and of the Grand Trunk railway
respectively, giving details?
What dividends have been paid on the shares

ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS EXCELLENCY

The Hon. the SPEAKER presented the
following message from His Excellency the

Devonshire.
Honourable Gentlemen of the Senate:
I have received with great pleasure the
Address that you have voted in reply ta my
speech at the opening of Parliament, and thank
you for it sincerely.

Ottawa, October, 1919.

EXCHEQUER COURT BILL.
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE-THIRD
READING.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into coimittee on Bill 30,
an Act to amend the Exchequer Court Act.
Hon. Mr. Nicholls in the Chair.
On subsection 1 of section 1-exclusive
jurisdiction of Exchequer Court extended
to enemy debts, etc.:
Hon. Mr. POWER: Perhaps the honourable leader of the House will just tell us
briefly xxhat this means.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
to give jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court
to hear such claims or demands as may
arise out of the Peace Treaty between
Canada and the different enemy countries.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course, it does
not refer to national disputes, but disputes
in regard to subjects only?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, in
regard to subjects.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What are the
claims referred to?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Debts.
They are all in the nature of debts. Under
section 3 of the Treaty, article 296, it is
provided:
There shall be settled througli the intervention of clearing offices to be established by eah
of the High Contracting Parties, within three
months of the notification referred to in paragraph e hereafter, the following classes of
pecuniary obligations:
(1) Debts payable before the war and due
by a national of one of the contracting powers,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

resiling within its territory, to a national of an
opposing power, residing within its territory.
(2) Debts which became payable during th,
war to nationals of one contracting power residing within its territory and arose out if
transactions or contracts with the nationals of
an opposing power.

It goes on to mention specifically the
many classes of claims which may arise
Of course,
between different nationals.
seme tribunal must have authority or jurisdiction to hear and deterniine those claims.
It is therefore proposed that this authority
should be given to the Exehaquer Court.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I do not remember having seen any sanction in the Treaty
of Peace. Supposing that such, claims are
referred to the Exchequer Court, and the
Exchequer Court finds that a subject of
Canada bas a claim against Germany for
so much. What sanction will there be?
How will that judgnment be enforced? What
is the international provision whereby
effect will 'ha given to it? Perhaps my
honourable friend bas not had an opportunity of looking it up.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
it would come under this clause:

Unless

The Allied and Associated Powers who have
adopted this Article and the Annex hereto may
agree between themselves ta apply them ta their
respective nationals established in their territory
sa far as regards matters between their nationals and German nationals. In this case the
payments made by application of this provision
will be subject to arrangements between the
Allied and Associated clearing offices concerned.

,I fancy it will have to be worked out by
mutual arrangement between the conflicting
interests as to the claims which niay be
sought to be enforced. Has my honourable
friend a copy of the Peace Treaty?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
fortunately.

I have not, un-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I presume that the judgment of the court, subject to the clearing machinery which must
necessarily be established between this
country and the enemy country, or the
enemy nationals, will be given effect ta.
I cannot say with exactitude how it will
be done.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This will not put
the Exchequer Court in the position of acting as the clearing offi'ce referred to in the
treaty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
not think so. This is intended only to give
the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to hear
and determine those cases.

NOVEMBER 3, 1919
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Paragraph c of
Article 296 says:
.The sums due to the nationals of one of lie
High Contracting Parties by the nationals of
an opposing state will be debited to the clear-

Ing office of the country of the debtor, and pail
to the creditor by the clearing office of the
country of the creditor.

That is the way it will work out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Yes.
The whole thing will be done in the aggregate between the two countries.

GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY ACQUISITION
BILL.
REPRESENTATIONS FROM BOARDS OF
TRADE.
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: I should like
to ask the leader of the Government what
is the object of the notice which I have in
my hand of the calling of the Railway Committee to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
The other day, in answer to a question, the
leader of the Government said that possibly
it might be desirable to grant an interview
to the Montreal Board of Trade, which, I
think, had asked for an opportunity to present its opinion before the Senate. Has
this meeting of the committee anything to
do with that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is for
the purpose of giving to the Montreal Board
of Trade, and likewise to the Toronto Board
of Trade an opportunity to address the committee and such senators as may attend,
upon.the Grand Trunk Bill. It is probably
the only opportunity that will be afforded to
any outside party to appear before the committee, inasmuch as when the Bill comes
before this Chamber, as we expect to-morrow mornifig, I presume the House will con-

217

tinue in session upon the Bill until it is disposed of.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If there should be
a large number of gentlemen coming, would
it not be advisable to hold the meeting of
the committee in this Chamber?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not il
it interferes with the sittings of the House.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: Have you given
notice to the Boards of Trade?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
PUBLIC PRINTING.
THE AGRIOULTURAL GAZETTE.

Hon. Mr. POPE (for Hon. Mr. Dennis)
moved concurrence in the first report of the
Joint Committee of both Houses on the
printing of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I am a member of
the committee, and am not opposed to the
report; but, as this is probably the last
occasion when the subject of the printing
of Parliament will be before us this session,
I wish to call attention to one particular
publication which I think should be discontinued. I refer to a monthly pamphlet
issued by the Department of Agriculture.
It is printed on thick paper and has numerous illustrations-it is a very expensive
publication. That might be tolerated if the
thing itself were of practical value; but I
am satisfied that any honourable gentleman
who has been in the habit of looking over it,
unless he has looked at it from a scientific
or professional point of view, will not feel
that it is of any value to the farmers of this
country. I have on more than one occasion thought of sending copies to farmer
friends of mine, but I could not see that
there was anything in what one might call
the magazine that would be of any value or
interest to practical farmers; and I think
the printing and distributing of this document is an utter waste of money. The King's
Printer, or the minister who is in charge o
the Printing Department, has the power,
I think, to discontinue the printing and distributiôn of this pamplet.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Does the honourable
gentleman refer to the Agricultural Gazette?
Hon. Mr. POWER: Yes.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: One would hardly
call that a pamphlet. I think the honourable gentleman is taking the wrong view.
I admit what he says about the value of
the Gazette to the average farmer; but
it is really the organ of the agricultural

SENATE
stations, and I am not sure but that the
publication of that paper is the cheapest
way in which the agricultural stations
can exchange their views, keep up their
organization, avoid duplication, and, in the
long run, save themselves a great deal of
correspondence.
There is one thing appearing in the Agricultural Gazette that is of value to the
practicaI farmer, that is, the notes which
honourable gentlemen will find at the end.
At one time the notes of the International
Institute of Agriculture, which bas headquarters in Italy, were published separately.
Now we get a short summary, taken from
the journal of this institute dealing with
anything new or important in the agricultural line, which is very valuable. I do
not think you can drop the Agricultural
Gazette and save any money; you would
certainly lose a good deal, particularly
among the agricultural stations.
Hon. Mr. RATZ: Has my honourable
friend any idea how many copies of these
Agricultural Gazettes go to the farmers? In
my section of the country I have not yet
discovered one farmer who gets it. I get
a copy occasionally, and hand it to any
farmer I happen to meet, but I think very
few go to the farmers. If this publication
does not reach the farmers it cannot be of
much benefit to them.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Probably not many
do go to the farmers, but they go to the
Government officials and to all who are
working at the agricultural stations carrying on experiments.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I am not surprised
ýthat the honourable gentleman f.rom
Middleton should undertake to defend the
printing and publication of this Agricultural Gazette, because the honourable
gentleman is a scientific farmer, and is not
like nineteen out of twenty of the farmers
throughout the country. I am satisfied
that, as the honourable gentleman behind
me (Hon. Mr. Ratz) has said, the practical farmers either do not receive this Gazette, or, if they do get it, do not read it.
I am not much of a farmer myself and am
not personally interested in the matter.
The motion was agreed to.
CIVIL SERVICE BILL.
REPORTS

0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved concurrence in the second report of the special
committee to whom was referred Bill 18,
an Act to amend The Civil Service Act,
1918.
Hon. Mr. ROSS.

The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved concurrence in the third report of the same
committee.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill
with which *we are dealing has had its
third reading in the 'Bouse of Commons.
The recommendation set out in this third
report is that the Commons reconsid-er the
question if it deems it desirable to do so.
This certainly involves a money grant, and
we would be offending under Rule 70 of
ýthis House if, without a recommendation
from the King's representative, we attempted to make a money grant, or recommended
it. But it was the sense of the committee
that the Bill, instead of becoming effective
on the firsat of April next, should have
been made retroactive to the first of
April last, in accordance with what we
believed to be the understanding of representative committees that appeared before us. We realized, too, the practical
difficulty of working this out, the Bill having passed the third reading in the Lower
House. Without being an authority on
bicameral procedure in Parliament, I presume that another Bill would have to be
brought in to make the appropriation
neoessary, if this recommendation were
adooted. That view may not be shared by
other members; but we felt it was desirable in any event that the uncontested
portion, that is, the second report, should
be adopted, so that nothing might interfere with the prompt passage of the Bill
by Parliament, and that this question
shoulid be presented in a separate report.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I rise to a question
of order. Referring to our Minutes, I find
that the second report cf the committee,
which we have just undertaken to pass,
was placed on the Orders of the Day for
consideration "at the second sitting of the
Senate on Monday next,' and the report
the adoption of which the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) has
moved is in a similar position; it was
placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration at the second sitting of the Senate on Monday. So I think the honourable
leader of ýthe House had better move to
have the two items stand over until our
next meeting. We cannot consider them
now, because it would be unfair to gentlemen who are not here and ho would perhaps take part in the discussion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
would involve our rescinding the motion
which has just been passed, adopting the

NOVEMBER 4, 1919
second report. I am quite content that
these matters should stand until the next
sitting. I do recall the fact that they were
put down for consideration at the second
sitting to-day. So it will be necesary for
us to rescind that motion, inasmuch as it
was made in error, and to put these items
down for consideration at the next sitting
of the House.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Our rule with respect
to rescinding makes an exception in favour
of the correcting of errors. You can always rescind for that.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the motion adopting the second report of
the committee was rescinded, and it was
ordered that the consideration of the two
reports be placed on the Order Paper for
the next si.tting of the Senate.
On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I am disappointed that the
Grand Trunk Bill is not before us this
morning, as was anticipated; nor is there
any probability of our receiving it to-day.
It is confidently felt that it will pass the
House of Commons today and be before
us to-morrow. I would therefore move the
adjournment of the House until to-morrow
morning..
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate adjourned until to-morrow at Il a.m.

IMMIGRATION TO CANADA.
DISCUSSION.
bon. Mr. CASGRAIN gave notice:
That to-morrow he will inquire of the Department of Marine and Fisherles:
1. Is the department aware of the arrivai in
Canada of the under-mentioned steamers, each
carrying a large number of steerage passengers:
October 24, 1919, the Grampian; number of
steerage passengers, 70S;
October 24, 1919, the Metagama; number of
steerage passengers, 962.
October 24, 1919., the Melita; number of
steerage passengers, 1,211.
October 28. 1-919, the Megantic; number of
steerage passengers, 978.
October 28, 1919, the Empress of France;
number of steerage passengers, 939.

219

2. How many Of these steerage passengers
are new immigrants; that ls, how many are
persons who did not live In Canada before?
3. Is it the policy of the Government to encourage Immigration to Canada at present?
4. I the Government, like the United States
of America, willing to check immigration until
industrial conditions become normal?
He said: If the honourable leader of the
House bas no objection, I will add a few
words. I may say 'this inquiry was sent
to me from Quebec. I understand that alt
these steamers have arrived in Quebec.
The passengers, as you will observe, number nearly 5,000. This inquiry was sent
to me from Quebec because the officials
down thffre who have to look after immdoigrants never expected so large an inflow
to arrive so soon, and they really do not
know what to do with these people or where
to advise them to go. The person who sent

this inquiry to me is the head of a large
rimigration society in Quebec.

Since the war we have been trying to
eo!ve the problem of providing work for
returned men. le it wise to allow so mnany
immigrants to come

to

Canada

at

the

present time? Of course, it is at the port
cf embarkation that action should be. taken;
it is of no use to turn people back after
they arrive here. The United States some
months ago-I think the Minister of Labour
will bear me out-decided not to allow any
immigration for a certain period of time;
I do not know for exactly how long. Therefore the whole flow of unemployecd from
Europe is likely to come to our shores. I
think it would be well to have these inquiries answered as soon as possible, and

I am sure the honourable leader of the Gov-

ernment has no objection to the suspension
of the rules of the House for a few minutes
while this very important question is discussed. We are not pressed with work this
morning and we might profitably spend a
few minutes on this urgent matter. I might
have brought it up before the Orders of the
Day instead of makring it an inquiry, but
perhaps it would be as well -to ascertain
what the Government intends ta do about
it and whether or not it is the sense of the
majority of this House that it is advisable
at ithis season Ito allow such a large influx
of unemployed to come to Canada looking
for work.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED: My honourable friend seems to presuppose that
the volume of arrivals coming into this
country is made up of immigrants. My
own impression is that these people are
chiefly soldiers' dependents who are returning from Europe and who belong to Can-

220

SENATE

ada. It is well known that nearly all the
steamships arriving at eastern ports for
many months past have been practically
filled with soldiers' dependents returning
particularly froin England. Consequently
it would be impossible to discuss this question intelligently without having the information that my honourable friend asks
for, and no good purpose would be served
by discussing it upon a hypothetical basis.
I shall be very glad to obtain from the
Minister of Immigration the information
which my lionourable friend seeks.
CIVIL

SERVICE

RECLASSIFICATION.

INQUIRY.

Hon. Mr. LEGRIS inquired of the Gevernment:
1. On what date was the classification now
submitted to this House for adoption, to-gether
with Bill No. 18 of the House of Commons,
completed?
2. Are the experts of the Arthur Young &
Company, of Chicago, still in the employ of the
Canadian Civil Service Commission?
3. How many of those experts are still working for our Civil Service Commission, and what
are the salaries paid to each one of them?
4. Have the Arthur Young Company or any
one of the experts employed by our Civil
Service Commission sent any account for overtime wvork? In the affirmative, on what rates
has such bill been based for overtime work?
5. Now that the classification has been ended
and submitted to Parliament for adoption, what
is the nature of the work in which these said
experts are now engaged?
6. Have the Government the intention of soon
dispensing with the services of those American
experts?
7. What is the total cost, up to date, of th3
whole expertise and re-classification of Civil
Service in Canada?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
1. The revised classification on September 3, 1919.
2. Yes.
3. On classification work, five, with one
man half time; on printing work, one. The
Government of Canada does not pay salaries to the individual mnembers of the staff.
The firni of Arthur Young & Company
is paid a certain fee for performing the
work, and that firm assumes responsibility
for getting out the work and to that end
assigns certain members of its staff whom
it holds responsible.
4. The firm of Arthur Young & Conpany tas rendered accounts for overtime
work. The rate for such overtime work is
$3 per hour.
5 The work now consists of fitting of the
classification to the individual positions by
departnents. This work is done in consultation with the varions branch heads
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

and is all subject to the approval of the
deputy minister. Such classifications as
may not be approved by the deputies are
referred to the Civil Service Commission
and by it to the Board of Hearing for adjudication.
6. When the work for which they have
been engaged has been completed the services of the firm of Arthur Young & Coinpany will terininate.
7. Total cost of classification to July 31,
1919, exclusive of printing anid stationery,
$60,013.89.
THE BUSINESS OF PARLIAMENT.
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. F. L. SCHAFFNER: Honourable
gentlemen, if I am -in order I would like
to call the attention of this House and of
Parliament to a grievance which in my
humble opinion is becoming unbearable;
that is, the fact that real business is done
in only three days out of seven. It is absolutely unfair to the members who cone here
from a distance anid remain here fron the
opening to the close of the session. It is
due to the fact that Ontario and Quebec
members in both Houses insist on going
home on Friday, sometimes even on Thursday, returning for business on Tuesday.
We have never had a better illustration
of this than with regard to the Bill which
is now 'before the House of Commons. We
are not permitted to criticise the House of
Conmons, I know. Nevertheless they criticise us and sometimes call us very bad
nanes. I am simply naking what I believe to be a fair and just criticism of Parliament. The Grand Trunk Bill, undoubtedly, would have passed the Honse of Commons on FridayHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no; it will
never go through without the closure.
Hon. Mr. SC'HAFFNER:-aud would
have been in this House on Monday, had
it not been for the fact that some members
wanted to go home. I have no objection.
to members going home, but not only is
ttis delay a disadvantage to the members
of the two Houses, but it also adds very
much to the expense of Parlianent at a
time when the people of this country are
trying ta economize.
I do not know what can be donc, or
whether anything at all can be donc. The
situation is so serions that one of the members from Quebec in the other House criticised very severely his own colleagues,
menibers of the Opposition, because, having
gone away on Friday and returned on Tues-

NOVEMBER 4, 1919
day, they wanted all the information that
had been given during their absence repeated. We have observed the same thing
here. The member became dissatisfied, and
rightly so.
I say .again that this practice is unfair,
and I would suggest to the honourable gentleman who some time ago made splendid
suggestions as to the improvement of the
Cabinet and of Parliament that he should
call a meeting of. the committee and try
to have this difficulty overcome.
So far -as the Grand Trunk Bill is concerned, I am not going to discuss that; I
will keep in order; but I have not yet heard
any very good reason why we should have
had that Bill at all. We came to this
session for a specifie purpose, the approval
of the Peace Treaty, and a promise was
made that prohibition legislation would also
be taken up. I want now to suggest, if I
may, with all due respedt to the honourable
leader of this House, that when that Bill
does come here he will keep us in session,
morning, afternoon and night, every day,
including Saturday, and, if necessary,
Sunday.

CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION.
THE CASE OF THE

gentleman as being an exceedingly objectionable condition of things. We are paying
out and preparing to pay out millions for
men who have been overseas and have come
back enjoying fairly good health and good
prospects; and here is a widow of this civil
servant, and ber children, with nothing
whatever.
I call attention to the matter because I
think it is the duty of the Government, who
are so considerate of the claims of other
people, to do something for the dependents
of this faithful -civil servant. I understand
that another estimate is to corne down; and
it does seem to me that when that estimate
is framed it would be only right for the
Government to place in it an amount to put
the dependents of this Mr. Lemieux in a
better position; I do not mean to say that
they should be paid the superannuation for
a length of time, but I think they should
get something.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What he has paid
in.
Hon. Mr. POWER: As the honourable
gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) suggests, I think that at the very
least, as a matter of justice and humanity,
a sum should be put in the estimates which
would be sufficient to refund to the dependents of this man the money that he has
paid in to the superannuation fund.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: With interest.

LATE MR. LEMIEUX.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I do not intend to say anything about
the matter brought up by the honourable
gentleman who has just taken his seat, but
I think the House will allow me to say a few
words in the interests of humanity. Honourable gentlemen have probably noticed that
on Saturday last a gentleman named Lemieux, who for some thirty-three years had
been a member of the Civil Service in the
Department of Militia, was suddenly accidentally killed. No doubt we all felt regret;
but honourable gentlemen have probably
not considered what the ·position was. This
Mr. Lemieux had paid into the old superannuation fund for thirty odd years. Unfortunately, the old superannuation law made
no provision beyond a man's own life, and,
if he :died, his widow or other dependents
were entitled'to get nothing.
This gentleman bas died suddenly; he bas
left a widow, and, I think, four children;
and all they get is two months of his pay. I
think that must strike every honourable

CIVIL -SERVICE BILL.
REPORTS OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved concurrence in the second report of the Special
Committee to whom was referred Bill -18,
an Act to amend the Civil Service Act, 1918.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved concurrence in the third report of the same
committee.
Hon. iSir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gerrtlemen, my honourable friend the
chairman of the com'mittee, who introduced this report explained to the Chamber
yesterday why the recommendation was
made. I must say, with all due deference
to the committee, although I am a member
thereof, that I think no good purpose will
be served by making this recommendation
to the House of Commons.
The report recommends to the House of
Commons that the classification be made
retroactive-that .it relate back to the fiscal
year commencing April 1, 1919; whereas

222

SENATE

in the Bill itself, I understand, it is proposed that it should come into operation
at the beginning of the next fiscal year.
The House of Gommons gave every consideration to this proposal and disapproved
of it, and so framed their legislation, which
was sent up to this, House, that it should
come into force at the next fiscal year. It
was quite imanifest to honourable gentlemen upon the committee that the Bill
could not be amended by reason of its involving money provisions, which, in any
event, entirely apart from the question of
this House not interfering in such cases,
would involve an estimate being brought
down providing for the additional supplies
which would be necessary to put the classification in force since the beginning of the
present fiscal year. Inasmuch as the Conwith it, inasnuch
îdealt
mons has already
as it is a *money question, and inasmuch
as when the Bill has received its third
reading -in the Commons it cannot be
am-ended, necessitating another Bill being
brought down by the Commons, which of
course will net he done, a recomnmendation
from this Chamber would be perfectly useless, and would bring us into conflict with
the House of Commons on the subject.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman says that because this is a mnoney
Bihl there would have to be a niw Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
present Bill could not be amended in the
House of Commons, because it has received
its third reading there. The only anendnient that could be made to the Bill, it
having received its third readinz in the
House of Commons, would be an amendment made in this House.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Because it is a
money Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. It
is conceded that we should not intervene,
making provision for an additional payment; and, as we recognize the futility of
making a recommendation to the House of
Commons, it seems inadvisable to adopt this
report.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I an a little surprised to hear my honouralble friend's objection to the 'Senate expressing their opinion
upon this matter. I think it was represented
to the members of the committee that there
was sone misunderstanding in regard to this
whole question. At any rate, certain men
in the service were under the impression
that the minister had undertaken to have
the classification come into effect at the end
of the fiscal year 1918-19, and that it was
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED

almost a question of the minister keeping
faith in that regard. It was largely because
of that representation being made to the
conmittee that a member of the committee
moved an amendment to the Bill, which was
afterwards put in the ferm of a recormmendation on the part of the committee. If such
a promise has been made by a member of
the Government, it is very desirable that it
should be carried out, because if the Civil
Service feel that faith has been broken with
them on a question of this kind it will have
a very bad effect. I believe it was on that
account that the members of the committee
thought it fair and right to make this recominendation to the House.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say to honourable gentlemen that I have
seen Hon. Mr. Maclean since the report of
this connittee was prepared, and he, of
course, approves entirely of what was done
in the House of Commons, and intimates,
with all due deference te the recommendations made by the Senate, that the House
of Commons will proceed along the lines
which have already been followed.
lHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I amn sorry to be
troubling the House all the time, but I really
<lo not understand. All the Bills that come
here have 'been read a third tine in the
louse of Commons. Does this mean that
we cannot amend a Bill that has been read
a third tine in the House of Commons,
because it is a money Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A Bill
must necessarily be read a third time in
the House of Commons before it comes to
the Senate. If an anendmuent to a Bill be
made in the Senate, the Bill goes back and
can be anended accordingly if the Hou-se
of Commons adopts the Senate amendment.
But this is a money Bill, and the committee,
recognizing that it would be improper to
bring in any amendmuent to the Bill, have
The recommade this recommendation.
imendation would necessarily bc the subject of another Bill, because the House of
Commons has net the authority to amend
a Bill the clauses of which have not been
anended in the Senate.
lion. Mr. ROCHE: I should like to say
a word on this subject. Until we had the
explanation of the minister, the House, I
think, did not know what the report was.
It was proposed for adoption by the House,
not being read, and without the members
being apprised of its contents. It has frequently seened to me an anonalous proceeding for reports, not having been read,

NOVEMBER 4, 1919
to be passed upon by the House. I think
that course was taken when we were pressed
with business,- and had not time te consider what was done; but certainly an important report like this should be read to
the House, and the members should be
apprised of its contents before being called
upon to vote upon it.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, J really do not see the force of the
objection. The report does not undertake
te deal directly with the money question,
but expresses the opinion of a committee of
the Senate-and, if the report is adopted,
the opinion of this House-that a certain
thing should be done, namely, that the
classification should go into operation as
from the 1st of April, 1919, instead of the
lst of April, 1920. I do not see any objection te the Senate expressing its opinion.
That would bring the matter directly to
the attention of the House of Comnions. If
we have in any sense misapprehended their
views, they will decline te pass any measure providing for this thing. I think probably it would not be necessary to have a
new Bill. An item might be put in the
Estimates which are te be brought down.
The motion for the adoption of the report
was negatived.
NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION
BILL.
THE

SENATE

INSISTS

AMENDMENT.

UPON

ITS

The Senate proceeded te the.consideration
of the message from the House of Commons, disagreeing te the amendment made
by the Senate te Bill 11, an Act te amend
the Navigable Waters Protection Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill bas been before
the Senate se frequently and bas been so
much discussed that I hesitate te address
myself te the House any further on the
subject. I may just say, very shortly, that
when the Bill came up from the House of
Commons they proposed te put the provisions of the Bill in force in all navigable
waters. The Senate qualified that by inserting the word "tidal"; se that the
machinery outlined in the Bill, which
would have been put in operation in regard
te obstructions in navigable waters, would
be confined te, and would operate against,
obstructions in tidal waters only.
The
House of Commons refused te concur in
that amendment, and accordingly by message intimated that fact te this House.

223

For the purpose of deciding the matter
one way or the other I move:
That a message be sent to the House ot
Commons to acquaint that House that th3
Senate doth insist upon its amendment to Bill
11, intituled an Act to amend the Navigable
Waters Protection Act.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill, with the amendment, having been returned to this House, I am of
opinion. which I think some others share,
that this would be a favourable opportunity
for disposing of the whole thing by not
allowing such a Bill to pase. I shall give
one or two reasons for this. In the first
place, it would bring the Dominion Government into conflict with the local governments. The local governments have
made grants of land, upon which there
have been erections, and grants of land
and erections were held by other tenures
before Confederation, and the local governments must support the guarantees of
those tenures. That will involve litigation. If litigation should arise because
some obnoxious person or an enemy of
a person should stir up the Minister of
Justice te expropriate or destroy property,
a poor man whose property was destroyed
would have no redrese; and if a person
with sufficient means had a case of that
kind, and took it before the Privy Council, this law would be found to be not
worth the paper it is written upon, because it contravenes the Act of Confederation and counteracts all grants made by
the British Government; and that power is
not allowed the Dominion Government.
Therefore an opportunity bas fortunately
been afforded to us te dispose of the Bill
by not allowing it te pass.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend has moved that we insist on our
amendment. I am very much afraid that
the result of that may be that the Bill will
be killed. I have been given te understand that this legislation was required
because the Government found themselves
in an awkward position in regard te a cer,tain matter in British Columbia, and on
that account I rather hesitate about supporting the motion. I do not see exactly
what is going te happen. It may be a
very serions matter se far as the province
of British Columbia is concerned if this
Bill should be dropped in consequence of
our agreeing te the proposal of my honourable friend. Of course, if the motion of
the honourable leader of the Government
is carried, it will still be open te both
Houses te hold a conference te see if

224

SENATE

some agreement can be come to. I understand that the strong objection raised
,against this Bill., when it was in thi.s
House before, was that it was going to
apply to all navigable waters, and therefore the amendment proposed to the Bill
by my honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) to insert the
word " tidal " in order to con-fine .it to
the waters of the ocean. But now, if
we insist on our amendment, I am afraid
that the Bill may be lost altogether, and
that the effect may be serious in the province of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I do not myýself think
that we should adopt the motion made by
the honourable leader of the House.
If
there is an obstruction to navigation, what
difference does it makie whether that obstruction is in tidal waters or in non-ti(lal
waters? An obstruction in the Great Lakes
is just as objectionable as an obstruction
in the gulf of St. Lawrence, and an obstruction in one of the large rivers is really more
of a danger to navigation than an obstruction out in the open sea. I think that the
House of Commons were perfectly right in
refusing to accept the amendiient made by
this House, and I think it is foolish and
unfair for this House te undertake to limit
the liàbility to tidal waters.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: The honourable gentleman who has just sat down
seeus to be under the impression that these
obstructions-if I may use that word, which
is not perbaps the proper one-which are
placed in navigable waters are necessarily
obstructions to navigation. The law a few
years ago was this, that the minister had
power to remove any obstruction to navigation in any navigable water in Canada,
either tidal or non-tidal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Natural or artificial obstacles?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Artificial
-obstructions
placed there by man. The
Dominion Government had power to regulate navigation and to prevent persons froin
puttilg structures in navigable waters so
as te interfere with their navigation. Subsequently, only three or four years ago, the
law was changed so as to give the minister
power to compel any person to remove any
obstruction which lie liad placed in navigable waters without, the consent of the
minister. Now tbere is a great difference in
the law. In the first place, you could put
a structure in navigable waters provi(led
that it was located in such a place that
it did net interfere with navigation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCê.

Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
Pardon
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUN'TON:
nie a moment. Now, under the law you may
not place a structure in any part of any
navigable body of water, whether that part
is navigable or not. For example, if in a
little bay running off a lake the water is
two or three feet deep, and if without the
consent of the minister you place an obstruction there, lie may make you reinove
it, although no vessel has gone within ten
miles of the place since creation. That is
the law to-day. The effect of the present
Bill is to allow the minister to remove froin
waters, not only structures net injurions to
navigation, which have been put down after
the passing of the Act of 1918, but also
structures whbich have been placed there at
any time heretofore, whether they injure
navigation or not. In my judginent, it is
unjustifiable legislation: it is retroactive
and it interferes with vested rights. I know
of cases where structures have been placed
in water which is part of lake Ontario, but
Those

structures have been standing for 20, L>, or
30 years, and the minister never dreamied
of objecting to them, nor did the legislaturc ever dream of giving him power to
object. But now, because in the harbour
of Vancouver sonie man bas erected a dock
where he bas been carrying on his business
for 25 years, and because the city of Vancouver bas broughit an action against him
to comupel him to remove that strurcture and
lias fruitlessly carried the action to the
Privy Council, and bas learned tIat no
court of law would give it the riglt to reinove the structure without compensation,
tfis Bill is brought in for the purpose of
compelling that man to remove the structure.
It is said, he is asking too muchi
money fron the city of Vancouver for the
remioval, and in order to reach him, it is
necessary that every person in Canaci wio
is in a like position shall have lis property jeopardized, and at the whini of any
official in the Pubie Works Departient or
the Marine Departient, it may be renoved
and lie is to have no remiedy, citler in
damages or by recourse to the courts of
law. I am interested only in inland navigation, and I have introduced the amendment
for the purpose of protecting those who have
structures in inland waters. There is no
reason, so far as navigation is concerned,
why this Bill should pass. Navigation will
not be interfered with or injuriously affected if this Bill does not pass, because the
Bill is net intended to prevent obstructions

SENATE

228
MOTION FOR SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 33, an Act respecting
the acquisition by His Majesty of the,
Grand Trunk Railway system.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in moving the second reading of this Bill may J
be permitted to say that we have looked
forward net only with interest but with
anxiety for some days to the introduction
of this Bill. Now that it is before us, and
realizing to the full the responsibility which
rests upon us, I am satisfied that not only
the fullest consideration-but the very best
judgment of this Chamber will be given in
dealing with this very important measure.
I might preface what I am about to say
by making reference to a report which has
been for sone time in circulation, which
no doubt was calculated to injure the prospects of passing the Bil., that the Prime
Minister of the Dominion, who unhappily
has been absent for sone time through illness, was not in sympathy with the Bill,
but that owing to those circuinstances of
illness an-d of absence, other members of
the Government had taken this inatter ln
hand and had proposed to force it through

Parliaument.
from the Prime Minister as to his attitude,
and as to his responsibility, touching not
only the negotiations that have taken place
regarding this measure, but aiso his responsibility as Prime Minister of this Dominion
in having this Bill introduced into Parliament during the present session. He writes
to tue on the lst of November:
My dear Sir James Lougheed:
It has just corne to my cars that a most astonishing and utterly unfounded report is being
circulated among members of the Senate respecting my attitude towards the pending Grand
Trunk legislation. Some of the senators supporting the Government have been falsely told that
the legislation in question does not command
my approval. If that were true it would not be
before Parliament. But, as you know, I personally initiated the negotiations with the Grand
Trunk directorate at least two years ago; as,
after a careful study of the situation, I was convinced that the acquisition of that system was
essential in the public interest. Without going
into details, I eniphasize two considerations. In
the first place, our present system of national
railways is so incomplete as to seriously jeep-ardize, if not absolutely prevent, its success-ful
It has in the West a developmert
operation.
which gives promise of splendid results; but
those results ùannot possibly be attained without the necessary complementary system in
the East. That necessity can only be met by the
acquisition of the Grand Trunk, which will give
to the Canarlian .people a well-rounded systemi
of state railways, capable of holding its own ;n
c-ompetition with private interests and of givIn thc
ing inestimable service to the country.
Hon. Sir JA31ES LOUGHEED.

second place, the only practicable alternative
to the Government's proposais is to hand over
the national railways of Canada to a private corporation. There is little doubt but that would
lead to control by a single corporation of practically all the railways of Canada.
Such a
corporation would necessarily be invested with
power and influence so extensive, far-reaching,
and dangerous as to constitute a public menace.
The Government, so long as I am at ifs head.
will never listen te such a proposal.
I most earnestly hope that the members of th'
Senate will realize the importance and cogency
of the considerations upon which this legislation is based. It embodies the results of most
careful and prolonged study of the problems
involved. Its sole aim is to conserve, promot.
and advance the public interest in assuring the
successful development and operation of a great
system of national railways. I appeal for its
support and approval by the Senate.
It is most unfortunate 4ind regrettable that
the condition of my health has prevented mn
from remaining at my post and from taking the
part which I greatly desired to take in the
debate In the Commons.
Faithfully yours,
R. L. Borden.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is not the
rumour that reaches us. The only one that
bas reached my ear was that the honourable
gentleman bimuself was supporting the
measure with a faint heart.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Who?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The bonourable
gentleman hiinself, net the Prime Minister.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Perhaps
my honourable friend will change his
opinion by the time I get through with mîy
remarks.
Honourable gentlemen, one of the first
objections with which the Goverunment was
met during the present session was that insufficient tine had been given for the consideration of this mteasure; that it bad been
thrust upon Parliament unexpectedly; that
Parliamuent had been called together for the
purpose of conside-ing another public
neasure, and not for dealing with the one
now before us; and that, in view of the fact
that we have been so suddenly eonfronted
with so important a subject, delay should
take place and the legislation shouli be deferred until next session. Permit tue to say
that this is net

a matter which has been

suddenly thrust upon the attention of the
people of Canada, nuch less tbat of the
Parliamient of Canada. It has been a subject
of public discussion, particularly by members of Parliament, for almost two years
past. Not at the preseut session, but during
the last session of Parliament. the Prime
Minister, in naking a statement upon the
floor of the House of Comuons, said:

NOVEMBER 5, 1919

that road should, be taken over by the Federal
Government. It is a national enterprise to

ing into consideration the all-important fact
that this was a transportation problem,
thought there was a more transcendent
question, namely, that it was a gigantie
political problem -whicb would keep the
Government in office for an unlimited time.
Instead of working out the problem along
transportation lines, the Government worked
it out along political lines, to which the
Grand Trunk Company became a consenting
party, thus sacrificing its financial future
and its very existence.
And now, honourable gentlemen, we are
facing the logic of events. It could have
no other result. If any of you had paused
to think at that time what it meant to
construct a transcontinental system from
Moneton to the Pacifie coast, and expend
thereon in principal and interest on the
main line almost $400,000,000, and 'saddle
a cost of 120 odd millions of dollars on the
Grand Trunk system, which almost from
its very inception had been struggling with
financial difficulties, you would have realized that the results were inevitable. Notwithstanding this, the Grand Trunk Company and the Government of Canada comnidtted themselves to the project, and to-day
we are dealing with the aftermath of that
legislation, and the problem now 'before
the people of Canada is: what shall we do in
view of the blunder that was committed
in 1903?
Now, honourable gentlemen, what shall
we do? In view of this blunder having
been committed; in view of our having
spent in hard cash, upon the National
Transcontinental no less than $160,000,000
-without interest; in view of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie having ceost the Grand Trunk
practically $120,000,000 and the Government
of Canada about $100,000,000; shall we now
abandon that enterprise? It is 'manifest to
every intelligent man that a line of rails
running from Prince Rupert to Monctonwithout any feeders, cannot he operated.
Is the Government of Canada to proceed
for all time simply to run through itrains
from Moncton to the Pacifie coast over a
line of rails without any feeders, without
anything to give vitality, to give life and
existence, to the system which we have
built up at the enormous expenditure which
I have just menitioned. We are thus placed
in the position of accepting the alternative,
of practically abandoning a scheme upon
which $400,000,000 in round figures have lbeen
spent, or proceeding., as any intelligent
business nien would, to acquVe other property which would give life and vitality
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

to the enterprise which was then undertaken.
Moreover, honourable genitlemen, during
the lifetime of the Government to which
I have alluded, namely, the Laurier Government, they not only committed the
Government to the construction of this
system, which was admittedly a mistakein fact, the most colossal blunder upon
which the people of Canada ever entered
-but they proceeded further to accentuate
the mistake and the blunder to which they
had committed the people by converting
the Canadian Northern system into a
transcontinental line. In the first place,
they entered upon an undertaking by which
they ruined the future of the Intercolonial
railway, by paralleling it with the National
Transcontinental and, in the second place,
not being satisfied with that blunder, they
further conmitted thèmselves to the additional blunder of further ruining the Intercolonial and the National Transcontinental
system by converting the Canadian Northern into a transcontinental line.
Consequently, the people of Canada have
upon their hands a threefold problem, the
most complicated railway problem that
ever confronted the people of this continent. If the Government of Canada and
the provincial governments had not been
so committed to and interwoven into the
scheme, the problem would. have been
comparatively easy of solution; but, unfortunately, practically all the governments
of Canada are committed to those enterprisee -and to the disaster which must
necessarily follow in the wake of an unwise solution of the problem. According
to the logic of events, the Governmeot
of Canada was compelled to take over the
Canadian Northern. There was no alternative. I believe I an justified in saying
that both political parties in Canada recognized the fact that the Government of Canada had to assume the responsibilities
,associated with the Canadian Northern enterprise. The Government of Canada had
proceeded upon guarantees which they
would have to make good; the provinces
of Canada had assumed guarantees which
they had to make good; and Parliament in
its wisdom passed legislation by which we
took over the Canadian Northern system.
Now, having taken over the Canadian
Northern Railway system, we have converted it into a national system, recognizing, as we do to-day, that in the National Transcontinental and the Canadian Northern systems. and in the
local system in the western provinces.

which it faces to-day.
Now, honourable gentlemen. 1 do with
full confidence appeal to this Chamber. to
give the Government of Canada a reasonable chance to make the nationalization of
our transportation system a success. 1 say,
in the first place, it muet acquire the
Grand Trunk system, and, in thse second
place, having -acquired that system, we shail
put into operation. the legis.lation which
we passed at. st session to organmze a
Dominion Railway Compeiny. Honourable
gentlemen wiil recali that at last session
we placed upon the statute book an Act
looking to the conisolidation and reorganizatiom of all the different, ra-ilways owned by
the, Governmen.t in. Canada. Up to the
present time, no'twithstanding our having
acquired the Canadian Northern railway,
we have -not organized as is contemplated
under tlhe legislation of st session. Iminedîately this ro-ad isa acquired, the company will be reorganized; at least, thse
different sysatems will be put under an
organization in conformity with the provisions, of the statute and I venture to aay
that the systemi will be placed on a businesLke basis of which the people of Canada
wi-l be proud. il is monstrous Wosay that
this great Dominion of Canada, that bas

accompiished so much, cannot succeed in
this undertaking.
No eight millions of
people in thse civilized world have accomplished more than the people of Canada
have done. Will Canada prove recreant to
the duty cast upon it of placing its rail-way
systems upon a proper basis? 1-t is, incomprehensible, inconceivable, unthinkabi e,
that the people of Canada, who faced thse
responsibilities thrust upon, Vhem at tise
beginning of this war in such -a way as to
excite the envy of Europe and of America,
will to-day be, unequal Wopiacing upon a
busiliess hasis this 20,000 miles of rai'lwai
and operating ýit in the public interest.
Honourable gentlemen, we fail to appreciate the ability, the genins of the people
of Canada as #do other people. Canada
stands higher in tise estimation of tise
people of Europe and the people of thse
United States than it does, in tise estimation
of ita own people. Only yesterday I read
from the New York Sun a most glowing
tribute to tise oapability, particularly to
the financial ability of thse people of Canada,
by one of the big financiers of the United
States, and with the permission of the
House I shall read it. He goes on to saya
It ls pretty nearly a year since the wax
closed, but In these latter months of peace, as
in these months of war. Canada bas gone on
supplying Europe with hundreds of millions of
goods and has gone on fixing the Canadian
position as a world creditor nation. In spite
of the fact tbat our 'balance of trade against
Canada for the nine months ending witb
Septeinber last, was some $268,000,000, Canada
had a favonrable net balance of trade amounting to some $374,000,000.
Outside of Canada's record with the United
States, In other words, ber international trade
balance was no less than $642,000,000.
Th'is
is a pace, Wbicb. continued for only a few
years, mnust put Canada in the front rank of
creditor nation.
It
mnay be indeed,
that
wjthin the next generation Canada as a
creditor nation wili 'be second in the wbole
world only to the United States, and by the
same token sncb stupendous financlal power as
must corne to Canada in that way wiil make
her a potential cuetomer of tbe United States
of greater and greater magnitude.
When Canada can. draw drafts in favour of
anybody on the financl capitale of the old
world for many hundreds of millionsof dollars
a year, she can settle ber accounts In this
country, she can settie ber accounts in any
otber country, wlth the sanie ease as Great
Britain settled hers for a century and more.

men, such is one of the tributes paid by
a great New York paper and one of the
great New York financiers to the ability
of the people of Canada. Let us not be
little or minimize our ability to handle

problems of thi.s kind.

Honourable gentle-

men, the acquisition of the Grand Trunk
is a bagatelle in comparison with the tremendous questions which we have solved
within the last five years; and, as we have
solved those questions, and have solved
them so successfully, so siall we solve
this question and place the transportation
interests of Canada upon a basis that will
stand to our national credit.
There is another question which I ap-

proach with some trepidajion, and that is
as to the attitude which this Senate should

While I

freely admit the greatest neasure of freedom in regard to questions of this kind,
yet it is a question whether the Senate
may properly challenge the general policy
of the Government, for which the Government lias a mandate froni the people. I
say the Government of Canada as it is
to day has a mandate fromn the people of
Canada for the acquisition of transportation
systens which, through circuinstances that
cannot be overcome, we nust acquire. This
Governnent is fairly fresh from the people,
and this question of acquiring the Grand
Trunk wias before the people before the
elections of December, 1917. The public
knew that the Grand Trunk in time must
be acquired by the Government of Canada,
and, whbile no one can controvert for a
moment the freedon of the Senate to rejeot a measure of this kind, yet there is a
question of policy as to whether the Senate
s-hould not be governed to sonie extent by
the mandate which the Government of t.e
day lias from the people upon large questions such as that which we are now considering; and I do sayHon. Mr. POWER: Will the honourable
gentleman excuse me? I would like to ask
the honourable gentlenian if he neans
seriousily to tell this House that this question of taking over the Grand Trunk was
before the electorate in 1917?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; I
say that it was before the people and discussed even before the last general election.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

that it was before the people. Honourable
gentlemen, this Senate would not think of
questioning the ýpolicy of the country on the
tariff, for instance.
The question of public ownership of the
different transportation systems of this
Dominion is a question very much in importance on a parity with the tariff, and I
say that the question of the acquisition of
our railway systems has been before the
country for years. We were committed to
the acquisition of the Canadian Northerus
system before the last general election; we
were committed-and it was well known and
inevitable-to the acquisition of the two
transcontinental systems'I have mentioned,
and the logical out.come of that situation
wras that we must of necessity acquire the
Grand Trunk railway. However, I do not
say for one moment that the Senate is fettered in any sense in taking any position it
may choose, but I say that the Senate
should give sonie consideration to the mandate of the people as delivered to tbe Gov'rnment of the day.
It is proposed, honourable gentlemen, tbat
an arbitration shoul- deternine the value
I
of the stock which we are to take over.
need not enlarge upon that, because lionnurable gentlemen are as familiar as I amn
with the process which we intend to adopt.
Having done that, the stock passes to the
Governmîent o Canada, a non-voting stock,
or certificates representing the value fixed
hy the arbitrators will be handed over to
fho shareiolders.
In
the Commons an
amendment was introduced and was imported into the Bill by which, although the arbitraton board may consist of three members, one representing each of the parties,
the umpire is practically the arbitrator; and

I venture to say to this House that the arbitrator named in the Bill, the senior judge
of the Exchequer Court, will have the confidence of the people of Canada. Consequently there is no uncertain factor as to
the reliablity and ability of the unpire who
will determine the anount that Canada will
have to pay.
My honourable friend from [Hamiltor
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has given notice of an amiindmient to the Bill. It is very
mucli alona the lines of an amendient that
was maie by the Senate in regard to the

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
I think received*the hearty approval of the
people of Canada, and which, I have no
doubt, was a restraining factor in determin,ng the armount to be paid for the Canadian
Northern. I have no doubt that when my
honourable friend moved his amendment it
will be discussed at greater length, and its
imerits may commend it to us. It is possible
that the Government may see its way to
nccept an amendment of this character.
I need not further elaborate this subject.
I have occupied a longer time than I purposed doing, but may I be permitted to say
that the logic of events having forced this
situation upon the Government of to-day,
compelling theni to take over the National
Transcontinental and the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, and having obliged them, through
circumstances over which they had no control, to take over the Canadian Northern
system, and thus ultimately to establish a
complete national transportation system.
The Government has no other alternative
than to complete and round out that system
by taking over the Grand Trunk . system.
Then, honourable gentlemen, having taken
.over these systems and having assumed the
responsibilities and the obligations which
may be attached te the duties thrown upon
them at this time, this Government, which
has assumed great national responsibilities
and discharged them successfully and I
venture to say te the credit of the people of
Canada, will be prepared to enter upon this
responsibility and carry it te a successful
conclusion.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: I am sure that
we have listened with a great deal of interest
to the leader of the. Government's exposition of the Bill. He has expressed hiniself
forcibly, and hastraversed the whole history
of the railway development of this country.
My honourable friend read a letter from
the Prime Minister stating his position in
this matter. I am sure we all very much
regret that the Prime Minister himself has
not been able to be in his place during the
discussion of this subdeet, because, according to the correspondence that has been
placed before us, he took a considerable
part in the negotiations which preceded
the bringing of this Bill before the House.
My honourable friend has dealt with the
history of the railway situation of this
country, and, to a considerable extent, at
least to my way of thinking, he has tried
te saddle the Liberal party with responsibility for the condition of things that exists
in the country to-day. It is not my intentien to go into that question at all, because
1 do not consider that that is the question

237

which concerns the country to-day. The
questionwe want to deal with is the question of whether or not the proposal before
us to-day is a good one for the country.
My honourable friend referred to the
agreement, and said that the proposai with
regard to the Grand Trunk Bill and the
agreement had been before the country for
a considerable time, and he quoted a general
statement. Although Parliament and the
people of this country have known that
some negotiations were going on between
the Government representing the people and
the directors of the Grand Trunk Railway
Company representing the shareholders of
that company, it was not until the 10th
of October, when the resolution was introduced in the House of Commons, that the
people of the country and the members of
Parliament had any knowledge of the terms
of the agreement which it was proposed to
place before the people, and which, apparently, were considered satisfactory by
the Government and the directors of the
company. Therefore, although my honourable friend has said that this matter has
been before the country for seme time, the
exact terms were net placed before the
people until the 10th of October, and it is
only when you know the terms of the agreement that you can really discuss the question.
My honourable friend has said that a
great deal of money has been put into these
railways. He states that the Grand Trunk
Railway Company, has put some $120,000,000 of guaranteed stock and cash into the
Grand Trunk Pacifie, and that the Government of Canada has also put a large amount
of noney into it. As I understand it, at the
present time the country does net know
exactly in what position it stands with
regard te the Grand Trunk Pacific-whether
we have assumed all the liabilities of the
Grand Trunk Pacifie or net. My honourable friend in his remarks referred te the
Grand Trunk Pacifie as if we had practically taken it over. Of course, it is in the hands
of the -Government, the Government having
appointed a receiver; and from the remarks
of my honourable friend I would consider
that he thinks that we have practically
assumed all the liabilities of that system.
My honourable friend talked about a mandate from the people. He attacked the
Liberals because of the amount of money
they had spent, and the policy they had
adopted with regard te the National Transcontinental and the building of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie; but that arrangement in 1903
was made with the directors of the Grand

Trunk of that day. They, I think, were considered to be thoroughly competent and
capable business men, men who had just as
much ability in looking to the future railway development of this country as any
man in Canada to-day. They went into the
question with their eyes open, and made
an agreement with the Government which
they must have considered at that time was
a good agreement for their company, and
one which would give them an opportunity
of getting business for their railway in the
West. A difference arose between the Grand
Trunk Railway Company at that time and
the Governmient because of the fact that the
Grand Trunk wanted to build its line from
North Bay westward, while the Government
desired to have a line which would pass
through Canadian territory only-a line that
would develop the ports of St. John and
Halifax, on the Atlantic, and Prince Rupert
on the Pacifie, so that Canada would have
outlets for her trade both in the East and in
the West. One of the strong arguments advanced at that time was that the building
of the National Transcontinental would obviate any difficulties that might arise between
the United 'States and Canada over the
question of the bonding privilege. The Governient, thierefore, considered it advisable
in the interest of the country that the
National Transcontinental railroad should
be built, so that we should have a railway
which would be entirely on Canadian soil,
naking Canada entirely independent of the
United States.
The question of a mandate froua the people was before the country on two occasiens, and on both these occasions the Governmient of that time was upheld. The
people had the whole situation before them;
they considered it and apparently were quite
satisfied with the policy that was pursued
at that time, for they returned the Government of the day to power. Therefore, if it
was a question of a mandate from the
people, we eau assuime that the people were
fairly satisfied witl the policy then laid
down.
My honourable friend spoke of the present
policy as having been before the people in
1917; but the only way in which that question could have coie before the people in
1917 would have been through the DraytonAcwortl report, and I have no recollection
of any mention being made at that time
of the proposals contained in that rehonourable

to take the view that the report was not
accurate, and that certain questions had

matter; therefore rny impression is that
the Drayton-Acworth report was not then
held in as high esteem as it appe-ars to be
at the present time. I do not think my
honourable friend can maintain, as te has
tried to do, that the Government of the
day h.as a mandate from the people to deal
with this railway question in the manner
proposed at the present time. I think that
what we have to do is to consider the
whole question

from the point of view of

what is in the best interests of the country to-day.
My honourable friend tas referrei to the
question of the nationalization of railways. He bas shown that we have in
Canada to-day a very large system of
Government-owned railways and railways
operated by the Governient. Therefore I do
not consider that the general question of
nationalization or government ow nersh.ip
of railways is before the people to-day.
For the tinie being we are connuitted to it,
and, as I have already said, we have to
consider this question froin the point of
view of the best intere.sts of the country,
and whether the proposal placed before us
by the Government is the wisest and best
one that could be made under existing
conditions.
Mv honourable friend referred te the,
fact that Canada had put one billion dollars or more into the railways of this country. Now, the Government proposes that
we should take over the Grand Trunuk
system and become responsible for its
operation. My honourable friend did net
tell us what amount of money we would
have to put into railways in the United
States hv reason of that action. I listened
very attentively to his speech to see what
te would say as to our position in dealing
with the question of those roads in the
gentlemen
Honourable
States.
United
who have considered this question have
protably realized that the t-aking over of
the Grand Trunk railway necessitates the
taking over of some 1,065 miles of ,railwayin flie United States, whi-ch mnay entail
Ihe expenditure of large sums of mioney to
be put up by the people of Canada for the
operation, upecep, and development of
those roads; and when we consider the
country to-day, and

r menber that we have already put up the
larre suma wh!ch my honourable friendi
has mentioned for the building an-i main-

NOVEMBER 5, 1919.
tenanoe of railroads in Canada, we may
well pause and very seriously consider the
proposai that we should enter upon such
.a policy as that which is proposed.,
I ýshould like to refer to a few considerations in regard to this matter. The
<ther day the ex-Minister of Finance,
àn speakingy
before
a Committee of
the House' of Commons, pointed out
the very serjous condition of the cauntry from a financial point of view.
The position that hie took there was that
in the interest of the country we must be
very careful in watching the country's expenditure at the present time, and in considering how we spend our money and the
return that we are going to get. He pointed
out that the expense under which Canada
was labouring at the present moment is
a very heavy one for a country witb a
population of 8,000,000, and that this loan
that the Government is now forced to ask
the people of Canada to subsoribe to is
flot the last loan that wve shall have to
raise in order to carry on the business oi
the country. The situation, as honourable
gentlemen who consider it ivili realize, is
a very serious one. The loan that we are
now dealing with is to amount to $300,000,000
or $350,000,000. A great deal of that money
bas already been forestalled by the Government. The expenditure that we are under
and have to meet will be very considerable,
and will necessitate a further loan at a
later date.
Figures were given the other day in
another place which struck me as îndicating
a very serious state of affairs which bas
not yet been brought to the attention of
the country. It waýs stated that the gross
indebtedness of Canada to-day amounts to
$3,080,391,478. There are, of course, assets
to 'be placed against that; but it must be
remembered that on such a large sum of
money the interest bas to be paid; and the
question is whether the assets that we have
to iplace against this large sum of money
are paying interest or are costing the country more than they are earning. Now, if
we consider the money which, according to
our blue-books, we haire invested in railways, we find that the Government railways-the Intercolonial railway, the Prince
Edward Island railway, the New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island railway, the
International railway of New Brunswick,
the Quebec and 'Lake St. Jobiq railway, and
the National Transcontinental railway-are
put down as stand-ing the country to the
extent of $302,839,443. Whxen, after looking
at that large figaure, we examine our national

asýsets to see whiether we are getting any
return on that money, we find that the total
deficit on those railways for the last year
amounted to $6,194,768. With regard to
those railways, of course we ail recognize
that we neyer pay any attention to the
question of obtaining intereet on that
money; those railways are not supposed to
earn any interest; but we find that besides
earning no interest they are costing us over
$6,000,000 a year for operation.
that, as my honourable
In
friend addition to we have had to take over
bas said,
the Canadian Northern railway. The liabilities of the whole Canadian Northern system have been given as $434,312,747. Again,
we find that, as that system stands to-day,
instead of getting any money out of it ivhich
would help !towards paying the liability
for interest, we are obliged to find not
only the imoney necessary to pay t1 i in.terest on the liabilities, but also the mone 'v
to pay the deficit on the operation of the
road. The information waa given the other
day in another place that this year the
probable deficit on the operation of that
road wi111 amiount to $5,587,028; and the interest on those Iiarbilities bas been pi-iced
at somewhere about $19,000,000; so there is
a total of $24,587,028 Vhat we have to fiid'
in' connection with that railway system.
That is. one of the assets for which. wza
bave to pay a considerable amout of
money.
My bonourable friend has left on my
mind the impression that, in addition to.
those sumnt of money, we have also to take
into ancount the liabilities of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie. The figure given in the bluebook for the Grand Trunk Pacifie is $216,253,111. -Adding al] those items together
we get tbe large total vf $953,405,301 as
the liahilities that we have assumed. The
assets do not pay the interest on the liabilities, or the wo'rking expenses; for the information given in the blue-book regar7ding
the Grand Trunk Pacifie shows that there
was a deficit for the year 1918 of $10,316,379.
That, to my mind, bonourable
gentlemen, is a serious condition for this
country. My honourable friend has said
that the people of C.sra-li arc a greai
people-that tbey are able Le 'leal witb
questions in a way possibly hetter than
other count-ries in the world; that they have
mnore energy; tlbat they have possibly more
ability; 'but I think that, even wben it bias
sucht aseets. and is such a virile population,
able to cope with difficulties, it is very
unwise for a government to continue piling
trouble and responsibilty on the shoulders

SENATE
of its people without taking into proper
consideration the questions with which il is
dealing.
I have ventured to trouble the House
with those figures for the purpose of trying to bring homnc to honourable gentlemen the condition of our railway system
at the present time, and in order that they
may reallize what the addition of another
railway system is going to mean. If any
of those systems that we are operating at
the present time were being run successfully, the situation might be different; but
when you come to count up the figures and
find that we are losing money, you realize
that the situation is a very serious one for
the Dominion of Canada, and we should
very carefully consider this proposed agreement before we adopt it and thereby place
a further liability on the shoulders of the
people of Canada and add to the debt of
tie country.
The figures that I have already given
show that we bave at the present time to
reckon wi'th an expenditure of $41:098,175,
and that that money we actually have to
find for the purpose of running the railway
system that we have on our hands at the
present time. In addition to that, as honourable gentlemen will remember, we have
to find the noney for the betterment and
improveient of these roads. Last session
we had to vote considerable sums of money
for the purpose of providing rolling stock,
betterments, and improvenents on the roads.
It was s.tated the other day that the Governmient had spent on the Canadian Northern Railway systei, since taking it over
in 1917, the amount of $85,821,628, and on
the Canadian Government railways to the

addition to the money that we have to find

And
the cost of operation of those roads.
we have to consider these large figures of
expenditure in the face of a condition in
which the country cannot possibly hope to
make our revenue meet our expendi-ture.
Therefore we shall be increasing our debt
for somne years to come unless we can find
a way of iiproving our position and making
the railways pay their operation expenses.
When we come to the proposal that the
Governmnent is now placing before us, we
find that the Grand Trunk Railway Company has laid before this House a balance
sheet showing the condition of the company,
froin which it appears that the liabilities
total $504,629,211. As against that, assets
are given which, I think, require examination by honourable members of this House.
Hon. Ir. BOSTOCK.

In the first place, the property investments

the Government to show what is the position of the road to-day-what is the condition of the road-bed, or the condition of the
rolling stock and the equipment; and there
is nothing to show whether the condition
lias been improved since the report was
made by Messrs. Drayton and Acworth in
1916, or whether it has deteriorated. The
report made in 1916 stated that the Grand
Trunk Company proper has made unjustifiable charges to capital; that its lines have
net been adequately maintained; that more
tian $21,000,000 which ought to have been
spent on maintenance in past years, has not
been spent; and that there was a further
expenditure of $30,000,000 necessary in order

totals $51,000,000, which at that time, according to the Drayton-Acworth report, was
required for the purpose of putting the
road in proper condition so that it could
be operated to the greatest advantage.
As I have stated. we have to-day nothing
to show what is the present condition of
the road. The Drayton-Acworth report havinig been made in 1916, the assumption is
that it represented the condition of the road
in 1915. Now, we know that during the war
these raiîways have had a great deal of
work to do and that they have had great
difficulty in getting improved engines and
rolling stock; so the probability is that
the rolling stock lias decreased in value to
a considerable extent. In addition to the
information that is given in this report, we
should have, I think, a proper statement
by engineers and business men, showing
the truc condition of this railway at the
present time. With regard to other assets
that are mentioned here as part of the assets
of this company, we find that a considerable
sum is put down as current assets-sundry
outstanding accounts. There is an amount
mentioned of $43,838,831. If any honourable
gentleman looked at those current assets,
he would naturally assume that they were
assets that could be realized on and turned
into noney fairly easily-that they would
represent something different from advance, to railway companies for the purposes
of building roads, or to terminal railways,
and other matters of that kind. 'The Grand
Trunk Railway Company has really provided this noîcey for the purpose of helping
companies over difficulties. Instead of their
having to go into the market and sell their
stock, the Grand Trunk Railway Company
lias put the money into the hands of these

different railway companies, and now reckýons them as assets. They are in a certain
degree assets, but they are not easily realizable, and if the Grand Trunk railway is
in the position which my lionourable friend
lias led us to understartd it is in at present,
when lie spoke of the poassibility of the
,railway liaving to go into the hands of a
receiver, it is very doubtful that those assets
could be realized upon.
Tliere is only one item in 'the list of assets
that I have found wliich. miglit be easily
realized on, and that is the amount whicli is
.state'd to be due by the UnitedStates Railway
ÀÂdministration, $7,955,472. The rest of those
.assets seem to be tied up in some advance
on debenture stock and for the operation
ýof roads, and the building of parts of roads,
and I think they should not be stated as
current assets at ail. It is very doubtful
wlietlier they can be realized upon.

On the Ordcrs of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DONNE LLY: Honourable gentlemen, I desîre to caîl the attention of tlie
Government Vo a condition of affairs which
in my judginent seriously affects the people
ýof the province of Ontario.
The British
North America Act provides what representation each portion of the Dominion of
Canada shall have in the Senate of Canada.
It provides that the province of Ontario shall
have 24 members, that the province of Quebec shahl have 24 members, that the Maritime Provinces shahl have 24 members, and
also provides for the other provinces. In
-the Senate to-day the JMaritime Provinces
'have full representation, the province of
Quebec bas full representation, the three
prairie provinces are fulhy represent-ed, while
the province of Ontario is represented by
onl'y 21 members. We have now before the
Senate a Bihl which vitally affects the
people of the province of Ontario. The
great bulk of the Grand Trunk ravay la
located in the province of Ontario, and,
speaking as a senaVor from that province,
1 think it would be unf air if this question
were décided witliout Ontario being fully
irepresented. I therefore desire the honourS-16

able leader of the Government in this House
ta, bring this matter to the attention of the
other members of the Government, that
such action may be taken that the province
of Ontario shahl be fully represented in this
Chamber before this measure is finally disposed of.
GRAND TRIJNK RAILWAY ACQUISITION
.BILL.
FURTHER CONSIDERÂTION 0F MOTION
FOR SECOND READING.

'ThEi Senate resumed from this morning
the consideration of the motion for the second reading of Bill 33, an Act respecting
the acquisition by tHis Majesty of the Grand
Trunk 'Railway system.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, when the House adjourned this
morning, I was dealing with the question
of the assets of the Grand Trunk Railway
Company, and was pointing out some of the
items that were given in the list'of assets
amounting to $43,838,8M2. There is one item
that I want to point out to- the House in
that connection. It refers to boans to the
Centraà Vermont railway for construction
and general purposes, amounting to $8,355,964.71; and that is put down as an asset
of the Grand 'Trunk ]Railway Company. A
question has been raised in regArd to a
railway known as the New England Southern railway, whicIr lias some connection
witli the Central Vermont. The staternent
has been made that that amount was spent
on that New England Southern railway for
certai.n work, and that the work is practically of no value inasmnucli as the construction of that piece of road has been
doned. It has been further stated that abanthere
is a lawsuit in connection with that matter
which may involve the -Central Vermont
raihway in a liability of smme $3,O00,0OO, and,
as the Grand Trunk railway lias of course
the control of the 'Central Vermont railway,
and is responsible for that railway, it means
that the Grand'Trunk railway is responsible
for that lawsuit, and for the liabilities connected with it if the lawsuit should go
against the Central Vermont Railway Company. I mention this fact because 1. want
to show to the House the nature of the assets included in this list of assets of the
Grand Trunk Railway 1ýompany; and, inasmuch as we6 have had no explanation
from the leader of the Goveriment in regard to these assets, I desire to bring the
matter to lis attÉntion and to the attention
of the House in order that we nîay get further information upon the subject. I do not
wish to take up the time of the House
in going through ail the items, -but I think

that one is ,o important that we should
have furtber information upon it.

My hlonourable friend this norning led
us to believe that possibly at sone future
date the Governient vould contemplate
turninug this whole system over to other
hands. I think the words lie used were
that the Grand Trunk Railway system
would round off the present government
systemu of this country, and that there was
a possibility that the Government might
feel disposed to turn this whole system over
to sone large company. If we take the
figures which I gave this morning, showing
tle amount of money that the country bas
already put into railways, and add to that
amount the liabilities that the country will
have to assume if thev take over the Grand
Trunk railwav, which would make a total
of somte $1,500,00O,000 for these railw.ays,
I think it is very doubtful if any company
woul'd be prepared to pay that amount to

Canada, or to assume a liability of that
kind for the purpose of relieving the coun-

tryv of the operation of these roads.

The

suggestion that was made by the leader of
the Government is, I think, something
absolutely new to the country. I do not
think any member of the Governient bas
ever before suggested that after these railways have been in the hands of the Government they should be banded over to a
company.
Hon.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

I

did

not say that. I said the Government would
be in a position to do that, if they so
desired. after having an opportunity of
testing governtment ownership.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Well, this is the
first time the suggestion bas been made.
There is another point with regard to that.

We are arranging under this proposal to
guarantee certain stock of the Grand Trunk

Railway Company. A good deal bas been
said about Canada guaranteeing this stock
-that the shareholders of the Grand Trunk
Railway Company are going to be placed
in a very much better position owing to this
guarantee of over $60,000,000 of stock than
they would find themselves in if their
dividends were payable subject to the
earnings of the company. If this transaction goes through and these people receive
this guarantee of 4 per cent on their shares,

I tbink they would be very much disappointed, and would be very liable to
object strongly to any arrangement which

would take away from them Canada's
guarantee on account of their shares. By
Hon.

Mtr. BOSTOCK.

this guarantee we would be putting these
peoplie in a very much better position than
the one which they ocvupy to-day, when
they are dependent siniply upon the earning
power of the Grand Trunk railway itself to
pay thei interest on their muoney. That is a
question that bas been very fairly discussed,
and honourable gentlemen are probably so
fully informed of all the details of it that
I need not go into the matter any further.
But when wc are dealing with this matter
we want to bear in mind that we are
placing not only the debenture-holders but
the hold.ers of guaranteed stock and the
other shareholders of the company in a
very much better position than they are
in today.
In taking over this railway we are taking
over a large number of miles of railway
in the United States, and that raises a
question which I think has not been raised
before-the
question of the Canadian
Government, either directly or through a
company, operating lines of railway in the
United States. The other day the following
article appeared in the Journal of Commterce, published in New York. It is dated

Washington, the 29th of October, and reads:
The prospect of acquisition of the Grand
Trunk Railway system by the Canadian Government under the Bill now pending in the
Dominion Parliament does not comr.e without
attention to the matter in officiai quarters in
Washington. Senator MIcCormick of Ulinois today introduced a resolution
in th - Senate
directing the . C. C. 'to investigate and report to the Senate the facts in connecion with
the present or prospective ownership or control by the Government of the Dominion of
Canada either directly or through the ownersiip and control of the stocks of any corporation or company of any une of railwav or part
thereof, situated Nithin the territory of the
United States, together with a statement of the
mileage of said railroads."
The resolution was referred to the TC.C. and
will be taken up for consideration at the meeting of the committee Friday with i prospect
that it will be at once reported out for speedy
adoption by the Senate. While the M[cCormick
resolution does not mention any particular railvay that may become the property of the Dominion Government, the Illinois senator said the
object was to deal with the situation that presented itself in connection with the action of
the Canadian Parliament in passing a Bill to
acquire possession of the Grand Trunk system.

Further on the article says:
One of the first difficulties which may arise
under the ownership of Canada Is that Canadian
interests.will oppose the development of Portland atid Chicago as terminals to the disadvantage of Dominion ports. This would inevitably lead to a controversy with this country
which would oppose the drying up of the
facilities already in existence.
The question of the ownership of a right
of way through the United States by a foreign

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
government would also raise a delicate point.
Refusal of the British Government to permit
such control Is a policy of long standing, and
was emphasized some time ago when Great
Britain refused to allow the construction by
American interests of a cable lins between points
of the British Empire.
There la believed to be no precedent which
would indicate the policy of the State Department In this case. The United States itself, It
waa stated to-day, bas no such holdings in
foreign countries. The situation in Panama bas
special features, due to the particular relations
of that country with the United States. which
would not apply in a controversy with Canada.
Congress bas always been jealous o? foreign
control of any corporations, especially involving
means of communication in this country,' and
special legislation has been enacted ir recent
years againkt the ownership of the majority
stock of domestic corporations by alien interests. Similar legislation has been enacted
against the ownership of land by aliens.
These laws may be held applicable to the
Grand Trunk case, and it Is not considered improbable that opposition would
be aroused
against retention of control of the 1,!00 miles
of track by the Canadian Government.

I have read that to the House because I
think the House ought to be seized of the
position that the Canadian Government will
be placed in by taking over the Grand
Trunk system. I do not propose to discuss
this matter at length, because I think there
are in this House honourable gentlemen
who can probably go into details of the question much better than I can; but I
have brought this statement to the
attention of the House because I think
it shows some of the difficulties that
the Canadian Government are bringing
on Parliament and on this country
in taking over the Grand Trunk system.
The whole question is one fraught with
very greht difficulty, and may cause considerable trouble in the onerating of the road.
All those who know about the operation of
railways must realizethat it will be much
more difficult for the Canadian Government
to operate the roads in the United States
and get business in that country against the
keen competition of the other roads than it
bas been in the past for the Grand Trunk
and their officials. I think the natural feeling of any business man who had freight to
ship over the railways froin one point in the
United States to another would be to
prefer to help the railways that are
owned and
operated
by their own
people ràther than turn the business
over to a system of railways owned
and operated by the people of Canada. From that point of view the outlook
for the operation of this road by the Canadian Government is not a favourable one.
We are likely to find that the returns on
these roads, which to-day, according to the
S- -164

blue-book issued by the Government, are not
sufficient to pay all the fixed charges, will
be still further decreased when the roads
come into the possession of the Canadian
Government. It would probably be found
that the amount of money which Canada
would have to put up would be greatly. increased over what this blue-book states it to
be at the present time. If honourable gentlemen have the book before them and will
turn to page 27, -they. will find, under the
heading, "LUnited States Affiliations," this

statement:
By-book figures of December 31, 1917, these
roads show a deficit of $1,302,154.
To thismust be added deficit of Central Vermont of
$154,729 not shown in Grand Trunk Railway
Oompany's statement. This however, does not
show the deficit for the Atlantic and St. Lawrence, which for 1917 was about $1,200,000.
Thus making over $2,600,000 as the income cost
to the Grand Trunk railway in 1917, for the,
American railways.

So, with the efficient management by the
Grand Trunk railway, their American roads
apparently cost them $2,600,000; and, as I
have said, in all probability, if the Government of Canada were operating those roads,
they would find that the cost, instead of
being reduced, would be considerably increased.
The question of building up a port in the,
United States as against our own ports in
Canada is, I think, a matter which is very
serious for this country. As I have already
said, when the National Transcontinental
was projected, it was the policy to keep the
business of Canada in, the country and to
develop as far as possible our own ports
in preference to shipping goods through
American ports. But when we get this
railway'system into our hands we shall be
in the position of sending our goods miles
out of the way, and letting a line of railway with a terminal at an American port
go without freight, in order to build up.
our own ports. My honourable friend frorn
Halifax (.Hlon. Mr. Power) the other day
gave us figures as to the distances fron
Montreal to St. John, Halifax, and Portland. The distance from Montreal to Portland is 297 miles, and the distance from
Montreal to Halifax by the Intercolonial
841 miles-a difference of 544 miles in
favour of Portland. The ddstance from
Montreal to St. John by the Intercolonial
is 741 miles, there being a difference in
favour of Portland of 444 miles. Then, if
we take the Canadian Pacifie we find that
from Montreal to Halifax the distance is
755 miles, and from Montreal to St. John
it is 580 miles. Honourable gentlemen can
see that the advantage in favour of Port-

SENATE

land is very considerabie,

and that

the

freight business of the country is rauch
more likely to go to Portland than te go
the extra distance to St. John or Halifax,
hecause, when the freight arrives at a paint
like Montreal, the question of distance a ilI

Now lot us consider the question o! the
Bill itself. The Bill as submitted te ns
provides for an agreement, and it gives
certain particulars as te what that agree-

mient 6hail contoin; but these particulars
are given only in a general woy. Clause 9
of the Bill says:
The Gevernment and the Grand Trunk, and
each company comprised ia the Grand Trunk
sy stem, and ail persýons interested therein, are
hereby respeetively authorized and erapowered
to enter into the said agreement upen and sub3sct to the terms herein set forth, anild to do
and perform ail such acts and things as rnay
he deemed necesoary to observe, perform and
comply fully with the terms and conditions of
saiid agreement.

But the agreement its'eif ivith the conditions is net fuily set eut in this Bill se
that honourable gentlemen may understand
wbat the agreement is -oing te bo. I thinlk
that Parliarnent and the country are en1te, befere giving their assent te tiis
proposition, te. know exoctly -what the
zi reemieut is geing te centein.
Mvhonourahie friend (Hon. Sir lames

the shareholders of the Grand Trunk Railway Company wiIl have the agreement
placed before thesu at a meeting specially
called for that purpose, and will be asked
to consider it. Ths'y wili thus ho placed in

to take into consideration the wis.hes and
desircs of the people and the Parliament of
Canada to the sanie extent -as the Grand
Trunk Railway Company directors seeni
to have taken into account and considered the wishes of their shareholders.

That is the amount that has, been spezit
on the Canadian Northern railway fromn the
let of October, 1917, the date on which that
railway was taken ever by the Government,
Up to the 31st ef August ef this year. As
honourabie gentlemen will ne doubt remember, we have in the iast two years beýen vot-_
ing in the estimates a sum ef money as a
loan te the Canadian Northern railway to
provide for thi s expellditure cl money, and
it would appear fromn the figures here given
that the Canadian Northern raiiway bas
utiiized those loans up te within about
$7,O00,000 of the- amount that bas been
voted. The amounts voted up te the end of
next ye*ar, I think, total about $60,0O0,000.
I have piaced this statement betore the
House because I thought it was of interest
te show the way in which the financing ef
this raiiway business is being done at the
present time.
The Bill that is new before us has been
speken et as n-i arrange!ment made between
Canada and the railway'cempany, and t~he
Government have referrad te it as a genireus arrangement. They dlaim that they did
net wish te make tee hard a bargain with
the shareholders, that they wishpd te be
generous in the interest et Canada, because
apparently, they thought it would be et disadvantage te Canada if they were net genereus in dealing with the matter.. I thinik
that the sharehelders ef the company are
peeple who have been accustomed te, business transactions, and whe appreciate
things being dene in a businesslike and
straightforward way; and 1 should think
they weuid desire that any dealings with
themn should be on a business basis, and I
do net think they wouid expect the Dominion et Canada te enter into any arrangement ef this kind on any other than a fair
and proper business basîs, leoking, te what
would be their treatment et the shareholders, and what it would be fair fer the peopie et Canada te pay for a rallway systemn
which bas been part ef the lite et Canada
for a great many years, and which bas done
a great deai te buiid up this country,
especialiy the eastein part.

The cempany themseives made a different
propesai te the Gevernment. The Government turned dewn that proposai, and I
tbink that possibly net sufficient attention
bas been paid te it. The proposai was made
fromn London, and was presented te the
Government on the 18th et February, 1919,
and read as tollows:
On my arrivai In London I informed the
Chairman and Board that In an Interview with
You Just before I ieft I drew the conclusion that
you would be wi*lIng to consider proposai looking to the Grand Trunk working with the Can-

adian Governmen-t ralways In place of the
Government proposai te purchase. 1 have accordingtly suggested to the Board that the Gev..
emnent should take ever Grand Trunk Pacifie
RtaiIway and the Branch Lines Company, i-epaying te the Grand Trunk ail indebtedness,
and that Grand ,Trunk shou]d enter Into a
traMei agreement w1th the Governnient by whicb
Grand Trunk shouid become the eastern con-

nection of the Canadian Governent raiiways
and the Canadian Government railways should

become the western cennection of the Grand
Trunk, Interchanging at North Bay; Grand
Trunk te eperate at cost aIl the eastern Unes
ef the Canadian Northern railway; Grand
Trunk te undertake te epend upon improvements and additions te Its terminais and ether
faciiitles such portion of the money owing by
the Grand Trunk Pacifie ltailway and Branch
Lines Comnpany, which would be repaid hy the
Government and which might be necessary for
the efficient handlng of the combined through
business. This plan would enable the cempany
to continue operation of Its American lines and
secure all of the advantages therefroni both te

the Company and te Canada by reasen ef the
controi and mevement of International cernpetitive traffic over its Unes and through

Canada.Howard

G. lCelley.
Sir Alfred Smithers' name appears underneath, I suppose endorsing the proposai
made by Mr. Keiley. Then there is a repiy from the Acting Premier, Sir Thomas
White, dated the 19th of February, 1919. It
is addressed te Mr. Keiley in London, and
says:
Replying your message recelved through Scott,

your conclusion respecting our inteiview entirely
unwarranted. Proposai made in your cabie eannot be entertained.

That was a counter proposai made by the
Grand Trunk ]Raiiway Company, and I
think it might have been taken as a basis et
negotiation between the Government and
the cempany, and I believe that possibly
a better arrangement could have been
worked out aiong those lines than wiib resuit fromn the proposai that the Government
now bring forward. 1 have laid this before
the House, as I think that point shouid be
considered. If such a proposai were adopted, it wouid place the country in a much
better position te deai with those raiJ.ways
in the United States.

SE NATE
I must apologize, honourable gentlemen,
for the longth of time it has been necessary
to takoe to deai with this inatter, and for
the number of figures that I have had to lay
before the Houso. I have tried to show
that we require further information hefore
we ean proporiy deai with this proposai.
1 think the country and Parliament are ontitled to further information. I think that
they niost certainiy should have the agreenient boforo themi so that fhey can study it
in ail its details hefore they are asked to
deal with it. I do flot propose at the present time to movo any amendrnent to the
inotion. made by my honourabie frîend, but
;&L a later stage
there wiil no doubt
bo an amendment mnoved in regard to
this matter.
I say again thaf both
Parliament and the country are enfitied f0
further information, ani 1 think thiat tlîey
should thoroughly ncderstand the ag-reemient and the iiabiiities that they are taking
-upon thienselves or îvill take upon theîîîcselves if this Bill shioud becomie law.
Bion. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentie-men, 1 think that an> person dealing with
*this very important Bill, wishing f0 get
at its merits, couid do so by working along
t.he lino of three inquiries. The firsf is:
-'what are we gefting under the Bill? Second,
-what are we paying for what we are getting,
or whaf wiil we have f0 pay? What we
shall have to pay may not be aitogether
.cash; it may bo that along with large
suais of noney we may have to pay somoething lu the way of our national indepond'ceon account of having to submit 1,600
miles cf the road f0 the absolute jurisdjction
iii the firsýt instance of the National Government at \Vashirîgton, *and thon, wvlth regard
to infra-state freiglit rates and passenger
rates, to the jurisdiction of seven or eighit
rtate legislatures. Yeti may lose something
-else besid 'es your money: you M.ay lose
something wifh regard to the unification
,of the Dominion of Canada. You miay nind
that this Bill strikes at tlîe oid poiicy thaf*
was propounded, at ail events s0 far as the
Maritime province people couid understand
it, as an attempt to direct trade east and
west, not north and south, and f0 make
one nation ouf of Canada,
Iben, there is a third question that stili
hbas to ho considered. Assuming that the
price you will have to pay is roasonahie
i'or whaf you are going f0 get, if may ho
lal
this is nof an opportune time to make
.the barg-ain at ail-that the circumstances
of the counfry may ho snch that everything

Hon. .Mr. BO3STOCK.

is botter, and until you have more information liof oniy with regard to this entorprise.
but w ith regard to the working of the public
railroads Iliaf you now have.
1 ani going f0 be as brief as I possibiy
<'an, but hefore taking up this question in
detaii I îvish to say that any vote w'hicb
1 give will ho hasod entirely upon my own
study of tiîe question. I nave not been
asked for my views hy any member of the
Government, or by any member of the
Opposition; I have not been asked for my
viewvs hy anyone iii this House, or by
anyono oufside of if. There neyer was a
Bihl ahout which 1 heard lesa, and what 1
have ta say la based entirely upon my own
sfudy of tlue Bill.
There are one or two quostions that
have ta ho deaif with as preiiminary to
others w'hich I have menfioned.
In the
flrst place, on wýhat footing are you going
f0 deal wvitlu the Grand Trunk? My proposition withi regard to the Grand Trunk and
tiîe Grand Truiik sharehoiders- is thaf fhey
shouid ho on the saine footing as the p)eople
of Canada-no botter and not a bit worse.
If max hob said that tiîe sharehoiders do not
dlaimi or are not asking fo ho put in any botfer position than the people of Canada.
Thaf niay ho. but they may propose legisiaflan, or a contract that involves that, andl if
is neceesary ta examine the contract and sec
whefher that is so. A man may gef up lu
this bouse and fell yon that hoe is a
democraf f0 tiîe but, and thon hoe miay
bring- a nîoasuro down thaf wouid inake the
hiair of King Johin stand on end. A deciarafion is ono thing-, hut the practical working
ont is anothor.
In tlhe press and in Parhiamient, there
have been, if not open statements, at leasf
intimationýs that in some way or another the
Grand Trunk nover gof fair play with regard
to the Grand Trunk Pacifie. I dony any
such insinuation, and will produce thîe

They were
temporarily wrecked by the war; and the
saine thing is true of hundreds of comnpanies. Some -companies made money
during the war. A man with a tug or a
fiohooner or a littie factory only had to open
bis mouth, and the money rolled into hlm;
but there were other things, like electrie
-tramways, that went to ruin. Almoet every
ýelectric railway on the* continent passed
into the bande of a receiver. Take the case
,of a Canadian who bas shares in many of
these companies that have defaulted in
their dividends; what happens? They go to
their neighbour and say, -I want a law
passed to provide dividends for me." The
proposition would be preposterous. Further
'than that, if any one of those men, selling
bhis property, were asked, "Wbat do you
value your property at?" and lhe said, "The
-value in 1913, before the war, was a pretty
large sum, because it was paying 7 per
,cent,- -the purchaser would say: -"Thatis
not the case to-day; you bave paid no
.dividends for four years; you owe money
and the way to put a value upon your property is flot upon the basis of 1913, but upon
its value to-day." That arises from the iset
that the whole thing iýs a matter of contract, ind is settled on business principles,.
Now, I want to find out just where the
Grand Trunk stands, and on what. principle
you are going to deai with it-whether you
are going to fix the value as mentioned by
the Minister of the Interior, s of the state of
things iu 1913, or se they are to-day, or
when you take over the property. There is
a difference of millions between the two
pointe of view.
I want to get clear of that subject for the
present; but 'before doing §o I ought to
point out to you that in 1903, when this
Grand Trunk Pacifie business was firat
inooted, the President of the Grand Trunk
was a man by the naine of Sir Charles
1Rivers Wilson. He was made President in
1895, and continued to be President until
1910, a period of fifteen years. He was at
,one time an 4xpert in the British Treasury,
-and for years worked under Mr. Gladstone
-and afterwards under Sir William Harcourt;
and then hie went to Egy.pt and wound up
the financial difficulties of that country.
He bad quite a series of battles with the
~Khedive of Egypt and the Sultan of Turkey,

and hie trimmed them both. When hie came
home hie was made president of the
Grand Trunk, and in 1903 and 1904
he had wîtb him Mr. Hays, who was
also a man of continental reputation. It is
absolutely preposteroue to say that there
was in Canada any combination of men
that could have got the better of Sir Charles
Rivers Wilson and Mr. Hays in a railway
contract. I do not believe a word of- it;
and, if you look over the correspondence
betwepn their successor, Mr. iSmithers, and
the Government, you will doubt very mucb
if there is a man in the Canadian
Government
who can quite, get the
better of Mr. Smithers.
So there need
be no difficulty or no doubt at ahl
about the Grand Trunk having been
well represented and having taken good care
of themselves. That being so, the proposition that I submit would be that they have
to be dealt with on the basis that you would
deal with any Canadian citizen: What tbey
contract for they get, but they are not entitled to add to their contract any more tban
I amn entitled to do. Now, I do not want
to be misunderstood on this point. I have
not a word to say against the Englisb shareboldere. That la to say, I have no prejudice
at ail; my feeling is quite the other way.
I would treat them with exactly the samne
fairness as if they had been 'born and were
living in Canada. And if bhey get that
treatment, 1 d-o not think tbey should have
anything to complain of. It is ail very wefl
for a combination of persons wbo may be
interested in these stocks to hire space in
a new8paper and say that if Canada dQes
not use the stockholders of the Grand Trunk
generously and well we cannot go to Europe
and borrow money. If Canada in the future,
as she bas done in the past, stands by bier
contracte even wben they happen to be
injurlous to bier, and shows that she is
always and everywbere loyal to bier contracts, she can go into any market in the
world where there is mnoney to lend, if Epbe
bas security to offer, and can borrow money,
in spite of ail these tbreats about what is
to bappen to us if we do not depart from
the principle of contract and find some 'new
principle for valuing the stocks of the Grand
Trunk.
.Âllow me to read a short paragrapb about
the origin of this matter, and then for the
present I will drop this subjeet. This la
from the Life of Sir Rivers Wilson-bis
remi.niscences-written by himself:
The most important event connected with
my presidentship was the conception and partial construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific
raiiway, as the auxillary and close ally of the

idea as first contemplated was to open up railway communication In connection with the

extension of the original plan emanated from
the Government of Canada, who considered that
the opportunity had arrived for the construction of a new transcontinental line through
Canadian territory from the Atlantic to the
Pacifie. The idea eventually adopted was that
while the line should be constructed and worked
as a complete unity, the portion westward from
Winnipeg should be the property of the Grand
Trunk railway working by means of a separate
corporation (the Grand Trunk Pacifie), the
shares 'of which would belong to the Grand
Trunk shareholders; while the eastern portion
from Winnipeg to New Brunswick was to be
built by, and at the exl)ense of, the Canadian
Government, who would lease it to the Grand
Trunk railway when finished. Certain financial
assistance in the way of subsidies and guarantees was to be accorded to the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Corporation by the Government. It was
not without considerable trouble, and after
meeting with much party opposition, that Sir
Wilfrid Laurier was able to carry his scheme
in the Dominion Parliament.

Now, this is the important thing.
says:

He

I first presented the proposed new policy to
the shareholders at the general meeting in
April, 1903, and in March, 1904, I had to lay
before them the complete and enlarged scheme.
Although a certain amount of opposition was
expressed, I had on the whole not much difficulty in carrying the necessary resolution; in
fact, during the whole course of these transactions Mr. Hays and I were well supported bv
the board, with the exception of one somewhat
timid member who resigned his seat on azcount of the increased liabilities which he was
apprehensive would be incurred by the shareholders.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: He was a man of
some sense.

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Now I think I can
drop that subject for the present with this
statement, that according to the version
given by Sir Charles Rivers himself, the
Grand Trunk Company knew what they
were doing, and were not shoved by anybody. They were quite well able to take
care of theinselves and they are here on the
basis of contract and on nothing else.
Another point to which I wish to refer.
It bas some slight connection with this
matter. You will find in one of Mr.
Smîithers' letters a sort of whine over the
Grand Trunk-that they did not get as
ruch as the Canadian Pacifie got, or as
the Canadian Northern. Now, there are
two answers to that. In the first place, they
got what they contracted for.
That is
probably the best answer. The Canadian

Pacifie goýt what they contracted for; so
Idd the Canadian Northern. But, even going back of that, I am not so sure that
relatively the Grand Trunk did not get just
as much as either the Canadian Pacifie or
the Canadian Northern; for, as a matter
of fact, the Grand Trunk was built in an
inhabited country, and the day the road
was opened the company began to earn
some imoney; but any one who was through
the Northwest and knows anything of what
it was like at the time -the Canadian Pacific
railway was built, will know that it was
then an uninhabited country. The country
all around the north shore of Lake Superior
had not a soul in it, except the trapper,
and from Thunder bay into the Red river
there were not fifty persons outside of perhaps two or three dozens working around
the railway stations. Then there were the
Red River settlement and Portage la
Prairie; but from Brandon to the foot of
the Rocky mountains there was no one.
It is one of the most marvelous things in
the world how the Canadian Pacifie railway held on until population went into
that country; and to draw any comparison
between the Grand Trunk and the Canadian
Pacifie is, to my mind, simply out of the
question. This is a mere matter of opinion,
of course; but I think that the Grand Trunk
perhaps got the better of the two transactions, assuming that they are to be given
the $15,000,000 which was lent and which
they have no4t repaid.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Was not the Grand
Trunk Pacifie in a similar position?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: About what?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: A position similar
to the Canadian Pacifie railway?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: In a similar position
in what respect?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: With regard to
population at the first?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Oh, no, they were
not. The Grand Trunk Pacifie had the
Canadian Pacifie railway to haul in supplies for then; the Canadian Pacifie rail-

w ay had to get in their supplies as best
they could.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I want to
deal also with another point-one other contention which I have heard with regard to

Persons who are flot
lawyers can visualize the seriousness of that
situation by supposing a case of a very
different kind. Suppose the Government of
the Uni*ted States bought the stock and
bonds of the Canadian Pacifie railroad,
dismissed the directors, and appointed five
American citizens to run and operate the
Canadian Pacific, ostensibly for the benefit
of the people of Canada, but really and in
the long run for the benefit of the people
of the United States. I put it te you:
would there net be a hubbub from the Atlantic to the Pacific about what the United
States Government had done in a case of
that kind? 0f course, 1,600 miles of railway are not s0 big a matter witb regard to
the United States as the purchase of the
Canadian Pacific would be with regard to
Canada; but in the individual states the
1,600 miles would assumé larger proportions
than with regard te the whole United States.
1 do net want to inflict learning in international law upen you, but 1 wish te remind mnany honourable members of this
House of the fact that the Suez canal, which
was built ýby foreig-n ceuntries, first got concessions from the Khedive of Egypt, which
were ratifled by the Sultan of Turkey, and
that canal was net put there by fereign Governiments or even by fereigni citizens of their"
ewn sweet will. The samne is true ef the
Panamna canal. The United States Governmeiit ceuld net get possession of whiat. t.hey

their own zone there. When the Bagdad
railway was built by the German Gevernment, tbey get concessions from the Sultan
of Turkey. The saine thing is true of the
Persian Oil Syndicate, in which the British
Governmnent are baif ewners and the Persian Gevernmient are aIse interested.
I have net heard whether there has been
any communication between the British
Gevernmnent and the Gevernment at Washington with regard te the Canadian Gevernment buy.ing t.he Grand Trunk railway.
I tbink there should bave been, and if there
were, I think we ougbt te know about it.

allies to-day, and the American Gevernment are even operating temporarily some
roads in this country; but when these roads
are lianded back, and when we cesse te be

Wben Mr. Gutelius w-as made General
Manag-er of the Intercolonial railway hie
was not to be interfereci witb by anyene,
and was net te allow pelities te interfere
with him. He took two trains off the Intercolonial, one running from St. John te
Rothesay, and another from Halifax to Bedford. Ha toek tbam off on the ground that
they did net pay. Tbey did net pay, but
they had been running for a number of
years, and quite a number of people had
spent meney in building nice summer
bouses along the lines of those reads. The
resuit was that when Mr. Gutelius eut off
these two trains hae scrapped ail the preperty of these people aleng the lines of the
railway, but hie had those trains ion again
within thirty days. The saine thing bappened upon a read ewned and eontrolled
by the Canadian Pacifie railway. They teolk
off a train that wa-s net paying, but ins-ide
of tbree weeks the Railway Commissioners
erdered thein te put it on again.

Then, take the case of a railroad that is
losing meney: tbe Intercolenial would be
a geod instance. Soiineone says: " Well,

~NOVEMBER
let the.m raise their rates, and wipe out the
-déficit." There are some people wvho would
:gay it wvas not worth while. If is true
that yau woul be only s'hifting your money
from one hand to the other; you will wipe
ýout the déficit, and you will have to pay
more for your passenger and freight rates.
,Of course, where you have a deficit and
there is a benefit ta be got from a too low
rate, the benefit is got by a few and the
-deficit is spread aver a large number. But
there is this ta be said about the deficit
-on the Intercolonial: if you are carrying
gaods at too low a rate and are carrying
passengers at too low a rate, nevertheless
somne Canadians, although it rnay be only
a sinall fraction, get the benefit of that.
But if you take your 1,600 miles of road in
the United States and operate at a ioss,
what happeras? The Consolidated Revenue
Fund of Canada has ta ýmake up the deficit,
and you -have not even the crumb of coinfort thaf you have in the case of the Intercolonial, that the low rate mnures to the
benefit of some Canadian citizens.. You are
in this pos'tion: the people along the line
of this ro-ad in the United States for 1,600
miles simply say, '«Keep right down as
low as you ian; it does not matter if theTe
is a loss; it will neyer have to be met by
the people of this country; if the people
of Canada are fond of payîng a déficit on

either the National Government or the state
legislatures will set out with a wicked policy
ba.sed on any such foundation as th-at, but
human nature and self-interest are about

of having low freight and -passenger rates,

The Grand

"We have only one fund ta' live an and
ta develop this road, and that fund is Our

The Government of Canada
cannot say that, because the people there
will sav: " You are not like the Grand
Trunk wnas: you first use the earnings, whatever fhey are; if they are short, and you
want any more money, go ta your Consolidated Revenue Fund." You paid $25,000,000 of deficits in 1919, -and yau mey have
ta pay a large sum for shortage in eurnings
on this 1,600 miles of rorad in the United
States, and, in any event, you are nat in
the sanie position or anything lîke as good
a position as was the Grand Trunk itself.
The Minister of the Interior annaunced
a policy with regard ta the operation of
these ro-ada. It is important, and I direct
the attention of the members of tbis House
ta the stafement made by him with regard
ta that policy. He said:

To other words, they are going ta sift the
Grand Trunk system in the United Sta tes:
if there are any roads that are not paying,
they are ta be thrown down; in other words,
anything thaf. is profitablç we will keep, but
anything that we are losing money on can
go into the scrap-heap. 1 wander if any

Now I want ta refer ta one af the questions that I said would go fa the heart of

SENATE

252

this Bill as a business transaction, and that
is, what are we getting when we take over
this Grand Trunk system? I have made a
note of the statements of the responsible
minister of the Crown-I did net bother
with the statements of men in opposition to
the Government-and I understand that Mr.
Meigihen stated that the Government have
all the lines of railway that they want, that
they can handle three times as much freight
as they do handle, and that what they are
after is-first, lie says traffic, and he later
corrects that and says through traffic, which
I think is what he meant from the first;
because if you acquire the Grand Trunk you
get more lines of railway, but you do not
multiply the tons of freight or the number
of people who want to travel, and if you
take the freiglt froin the Grand Trunk and
put it on the Government line of railway
the Grand Trunk is simply that much short.
I do not see that you gain anything there. I
suppose they may work out soînething and
say it is on through traffic; but that is
irrelevant. They cannot take anyt4hing from
the Grand Trunk east of Chicago without
diminishing the earnings of the Grand
Trunk. If the Grand Trunk had freight
destined for a point beyond Chicago, perhaps twice as far as fron Sarnia to Chicago,
you migit make -your loss on the haul fron
Sarnia te Chicago, and pick it up on twice
that distance beyond Chicago by transferring the whole thing to the Canadian railway system. But what I point out is tnis:
There are no favours in railroading. When
the Grand Trunk takes freight into Chicago
which is destined for a point, say, on the
Pacific coast, they make their choice
and make their bargain with the conpeting roads. They. say: " If we give
you our westbound freight, will you give
us a share of your eastbound freight;
to take it from Chicago to the Atlantic
seaboard?" Now,- take away from the
Grand Trunk the weapon that they
freight
their west-bound
have with
going into Chicago, and you .lose the
rast-bounid freight that it gets in exchange for that. This seens, apart from
the question of the Canadian Pacific railway, to be the only reason put forward foi
the taking over of this road-that we were
going te got through freight. What I conplain of ls that this thing, which is the
foundation stone of their ohole structure,
is not elucidated with statements froin the
books of the Grand Trunk showing what
their through freight would be. I know of
no more overwhelming reason for delay
with regard to this Bill than the need foi
Hon. Mr. ROSS.

ascertairing through experts and through
an examination of the books of the Grand
Trunk, the facts which would show whether
or not there is aùy foundation for that
contention: for, mind you, you are undertaking very great responsibilities and are
becoming liahle for many millions of money,
and unless there is a solid foundation youî
whole structure will fall. There is absolutely no arswer that I can see with regard
to that, tho'gh there may be more through
freight than I think there is.
Then thore is another point with regard
to through freight. You have a transcontinental road. Are you going to take the
freight from the Grand Trunk and starve
that, and at the same time are you going
to starvo the Transcontinental? European
freight can cone into Halifax or St. John
in winter or into Quebec in sumrner, and
can go vie the Transcontinental and the
governnent road to the Pacific coast. But
are you going to work out a new route,
atindon-ing the Transcontinental and going

via Toronto and Montreal and Portland?
Is that going to be the trunk line, and are
you going to build up the city of Portland
att the oxpense of the eastern part of this
eountry, and with the abandonrment of all
the terminals that you have thore, and even
the abandonient of the Transcontinental
road as well?
The next question that I wish to refer
to is that of the arbitration. Honourable
gontlenen, you will sec if you look at the,
Bill that three nien are to find the value o
the road that you are taking over. There
are just as many ways of fixing the value
of a railway property as there are said to

be of killing a cet. You may base the value
upon the cost, less depreciation. You nay
fix it on what it would cost to replace it
at the present timne, or what is known as
the reelacement value, or you can take its
value as a goinz concern; or you can take it
on any other hasis-the basis, for instance,
on whieh a butcher buys an cx: " What
.s the thing worth, and what can I nake
out of it? Can I make anything out of it?"
If there is no profit in it, he does not buy:
it has no value. These arbitrators are
asked to fix the value of the Grand Trunk,
but thre is more in the problem than just
thit. The Minister of the Interior, as you
will sec on referring to page 16.36 of Hans-d, bas something to say with regard
to fixing the value. Mr. Maharg was asking
the minister this question:
Might I ask how that excess would b' arried
at the present timie? Would the arbitrators tale
the valuation of the property at th,â present

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
time and then set that over against the liabl-

aties?
Mr. Meighen says:

1 would say certainiy not, because If you
-assume It would cost that much to replace the
roadithat does flot Say the road ought to be
replacefi at ail-I wauld think It would be perfectly absurd for the arbitrators ta do that.
Anyway, we are flot dictating to the arbitrators
*at ail.

That I regard as an important statement.
1 do flot see why we should not dictate ta
-the arbitrators, in plain and unambiguous
Eng-lish, ta lay down the principles
upon which, they are ta be asked ta make
the valuation. Moreover, I do not see why
-we shouid not dictate ta them that certain
features put forward, such as pioneer
value and prospective value, mnust be
loft out of consideraf ion. Moreover, you
should fix for the arbitrators the date on
whjch the valuation is ta be mnade. Mr.
Meighen saye:
Anyway, we are flot dictating ta the arbitrators at ail. any more than we do in ail our expropriation legisiatian ; it is for the arbitrators
ta say what is the business value of the Grand
Trrunk Pacifia road. 'Taking everything into
accaunt, what is

its business value?

You take everything into account, hie
says: that is the principle that hie lays
down. He' refers 'ta the question ag-ain at
page 1637, where hie says:
First of al. let me repeat: we make no rules
for the arbitrators ; jr we started ta do that we
woulcl certainly get into trouble.
I do not see -why hie wauld necessarily
get inta trouble about that. But 1 want ta
refer ta pages 1126 and 1127. Here is the
principle that Mr. Meighen lays aown
there, with regard ta the assessment af
damages af the Grand Trunk. He say.s:
Sa that It is oniy fair that if the Grand Trunk
Is ta be acquired it shauld be acquired under
sueh conditions as obtained before the war, and
anything that is done that mereiy maintains
those conditions cannat be said ta be unfair
either ta the country or ta the Grand Trunk.
You get yourselves into this position
whicli, as I sce it, is absalutely unsound:
the Grand Trunk sharehalder, instead af
being put on the same footing as I wauld
be with regard ta my business affairs, is
ta be carried back ta 1913, ta the time
before the war begaan, and ail thet arose
out af the war; bel are the tremendous
increase in wages and in cost of raw
inaterial. He is put in the position hie
accupied in 1913, and then -everything is
taken into account, and Mr. Meighen sîLys
that that would be fair.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Leaving out the
depreciation of five years.

253

Han. Mr. ROSS: Yes, leaving ail that
out. Sa there yau are. Now, mmid, that is
a statement made by a minister af the
Crawn; and you are ta have a board af
arbitrators ta deai with this matter, and
they cannat ignore, forget, or overlo9k
that statemnent.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: May I ask te
lionourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Certainly.
Han. Mr. GORD ON: Did the honourable
g'entleman state that the date wouid be
carried back ta the year 1913?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: For the arbitration?
Han. Mr: ROSS: It is ta be an the
basis af 1913.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It might be.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: .Mr. Meighesi says mora
than that:
Sa that it is only fair that if the Grand Trunk
ls ta be acqulred it should be acquired--

"it should be," not "it might be"should be acquired under
-it
as obtalned before the war.

such conditions

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But lie
did not fix the date as 1913?
Han. Mr. ROSS: No, but you will find
it at other places before that--at an earlier
stage in the discussion of the same subjeet. He takes the year 1913.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is the year
when the Grand Trunk paid the highest
dividends they have paid since 190W.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes. Hie gives the
history of those years. 1 did 'not read
that. But what I say about that is this.
I mnight be in a position similar ta that
of tbe Grand Trunk; indeed, 1 am in a
similar position. The ainaunt in my case
miight be a ,ridiculously small figure, but
the principle ie the«same, aud an investment af $ 10,000 in a company eau test a
princîple as well as $ 10,000,000. If 1 were
having my few shares in a tramway coinpany, for instance, taken froin nie, and if
the value was ta be fixed, 1 could not say:
"Oh, tal±e me back ta the time before the
war. ta 1913, the year when I was getijng
a 7 per cent divîdend." 1 wquld be told:
"The business has been run during the
last four years without a dividend, and it
may be four years more before *You will
vou canniot take tliat as your
get anvlasis u ai 1L."

SENATE
I know that there is ambiguity about al]
these things, but this question is se important that I do not believe ]Parliament
should assent to the Bill at all until they
see this agreement, because every word is
important; the twist of a word may mean
a million dollars to you. Moreover, we
want a clear definition in the agreement
for the arbitration. We want to tell the
English shareholders:
"You are to have
your daiages assessed on the sae
basis
as would a Canadian citizen." If lie went
into a court and asked the court to
determine
the present
value of his
holdings, the question would be, not
what they were worth in 1913, not what
they would be worth in 1940, but what
would a business man or a company who
wanted to buy and hiad the noney to pay,
be willing to give. The basis shouild be
defined affirmatively and it should also be
defined negatively.
That is to say, the
principbe should be defined, and for greater
assurance it should be made clear that certain considerations are to be eliminated.
We should declare: " We are going to eliminate prospective value; moreover, you
iust take into consideration all the conditions, including the war and the depreciatien of the value of the property."
It is
unreasonable to expect the citizens of
Canala to go without fair dividends, as
thousands of tliem -men, women and children--bave bad to do, anti then to step up
to the front and give a valuation that wiill
providie dividends for a nunber of English
shareholders, who should not be on any
different footing. They would thus be relieved of all their troubles with regard to
the war and the circumstances that arose
out of the war. ,
There is another point to wbich I wish
to refer, and that is the statenent made
hy the Minister of Raiways. If you refer
to page 1064, column 1, yeu will find that
the Minister of Railways makes this statement:
The arbitrators will no doubt take into consideration the fact of the Grand Trunk railway
being the pioneer railwày of Canada; and believing as I do that the people of Canada wish
te deal generously with the Grand Trunk shareholders, they will not be too severe when
making their award.
I consider that is very dangerbus language for a Minister of Railways to use.
Do you not -ee why I referred, perhaps a
little tediously, to the way in which we have
to treat the Grand Trunk; and why I asked
on what footing the Grand Trunk is placed
-whether on a contract basis or not. If
you go out to buy a farm in the backwoods
Bon. Mr. ROSS.

of Ontario and the farmer asks you to
include as an element in the value of lis
farm the fact that his grandfather was a
pioneer, having settled in the woods there,
you would think lie was crazy.
By his statement, there is no clear idea
in the mind of the Minister -of the Interior
as to the principle upon which, the arbitrators should proceed. Practically, he said:
"We are not going to dictate to them; it
is a go-as-you-please affair, and you may
go back to the period before the war, and
yon may take everything into consideration."
Then comes the statement of the
Minister of Railways, who says the arbitrators may take into account, and undoubtedly they will consider, the fact that the
Grand Trunk was a pioneer railway. The
Grand Trunk railway people think the
C.P.R. got too much jam on their bread.
They think that they may now have a good
chance to get $100,000,000
or $150,000,000J
because they were the pioneer road. I assert
that that«has nothing whatever to do with
the valuation.
There are a number of other subjects,
but I an not going to address the louse
regarding themn.
lon. Mr. DAVID:

Go on.

Hon. Mr. ROSS: There is the question
of an alternative scheme.
There is the
germn of an alternative scbeme in the
correspondence: but there are honourable
gentlemen on this side of the House who
will develop that idea and give it special
attention, and I think it would be unfair
to you if J w ere to go on pounding away
at a subje:-t which will be dealt with in a
muhet better way fhan I can deal with it.
Then there is the question of the public
debt and the present financial position of
the country. and the inadvisability of proceeding with this matter at this time, even
That

question, too, will be dealt with before tie
debate is concluded. I have no doubt that
vou will also hear something of government ownership.
My idea of that is that
yen have approximately the finest sebeme
of government ownership that you will ever
get. The Board of Railway Commissioners
have the questions of rates, terminals, and
se on in hand; in fact, there are very few
things that the railways can do without
their consent.. The idea of basing any support of this Bill on the ground that it is
government ownership is to my mind quite
absurd and quite unnecessary.
There is another question invoived in
this Bill that I have already referred to.

ready to meet the Government more than.
half way. But, with things as they are, 1
absoluteiy refuse to agree to this Bill until
there has been a great deal more evidence
forth-coming than We have now, and until
the questions I have referred to have been
cieared up. There is no need for haste. The
Grand Trunk is financed away on into next
winter. As the Minister of the Interior
-said, if the worst cornes to the worst, the
debenture-holders can take the road and
ýoperate it, and hand over the surplus, to
those to whom it is due. Perhaps it might
flot be too bad for the Grand Trunk to have
a receiver appointed. Practically ail the
American roads-I have no recollection of
the New York Central having gone into the
hands of a reeeiverHon. Mr. BEIQTJE: Nor the Pennsylvania.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No, nor the Pennsyivania. But practicafly ail the others have
been in the hands of a receiver, and have
ernerged better roads. This Bill could be
deait with at another session of Parliament,
wheni we wouid have more information, and
after the people of the country have had an
,opportunity to express their views. I
believe that there is a rising tide against
the Bili. While there are many people in
favour of public ownership, they are not
prepared to make any kind of sacrifice for
governnient ownership. They want to know
what they are paying for it and ail the
people have a right to be heard.

Mr. RlOSS.

The honourable the leahave been mae
der cf the Opposition tijis forenoon raised
the question as to the physicai condition
of the Grand Trunk property at the present
time, and indulged in some criticisma because there had not been any information
forthcoming upon that subject. It would
1)erhaps be opportune and appropriate,
therefore, to give to the House some information that may be regarded as authentic
upon that subject, showing the present
condition of the Grand Trunk railway. In
that connection I propose te read a report,
under date of October 26, 1919, submitted
by Mr. George A. Mountain, chief engineer
o! the Board of Raiiway Commissioners for
Canada.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Whom was the
report made te?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTISON: To the Board
of Railway Commissioners. It is addressed
to Mr. Cartwright, secretary of the board,
and reads:
1 left Toronto on the 'Éorning of the 2lst
and Iinspected the main Une of the Grand Trunk
te Sarnla, returning to Komoka, and making an
inspection of the Uine frorn Komoka to Windsor.
I found that the requirernents stated in niy
report were at least in moat cases lived up te,
and In some cases exceeded, particularly in
connection wlth tie renewals, and wouid say
that it wvas 95 per cent completed.

That is 'to say, the work which had been
laid eut by the commission as necessary
tû put the road in proper condition had
been 95 per cent completed on that portion
The report goes on to say:
ei the line.
There were a few yards yet wanting some

tie renewals but these were naturally left ta,
the last. as they had their entire force on the
main Uine between stations, which was good
lpractice.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The feport speaks
of the commission having ordered certain

things te be done. Perhaps my honourable
friend can tell us when that was ordered
by the commission.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 have net. ny
information upon that point. Apaenl
a previeus inspectioni had been made.

o'hlichl these improvements were ordered
te be-m-ade that 1 should lîke te know.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shall endeavour te obtain that information for the
honourable gentleman. (Reading):
On Wednesday, the 22nd, 1 started speciAl
froin Windsor and went over what is known as
the Southern Division of the Une, on whlch the
Wabash run their fast trains. This line ru-is

and that is the effect of this legislation
upon the unification of Canada. Assuming
that this Bill passes, and that you take
the railroad out of politics, you will have
right in polities a scrap between Halifax,
St. John, and Portland, with a lot of governments involved. If the Portland route
wins out over these otber routes, and the
terminals at Halifax and St. John are
scrapped, you will find that this attempt
to make one Canada is going to carry you
right back to where you were wlen we
had separate provinces and practically tifferent countries.
There is- one other thing. I think it is
pretty clear from this Bill that the Doininion Government is assuming ail the
responsibility of the guarantees given by
the different provinces. Every crazy subsidy that was voted froin the Atlantic to
the Pacific by the Provincial Governments
is now assumed, and is going to be paid
by the Dominion Government. It has not
been said that that is so; but I have taken
pains to try and understand the Minster
of the Interior, an
it works out in [hat
way; and it woull be better once and for
all for the Governinent to niake that statement and let the provinces out and permit
them to get on their feet financially, and
to pass some law to prevent such thing
occurring again.
Then, there may haveto be somue conî ensation to the pr vinces that kept their
heads and kept out ot [lese er..zy suhsid:es. For myself. I would coneider an
application from the province of Quebec or
the province of New Brunswick for some
kind of compensation if they have now to
couae in and pay their share of taxation
for all these absurd subsidies which have
been voted by Nova Scotia, for one -and
Nova Scotia is not a bit better than Alberta and British Colunbia. But il Quebec had its business well mauagrd, why
should it not have some compensation?
How that would work out I do not know.
There is enother mato [hat ought to Le
cleared up if this Bill is passed, and that
is the question of municipal taxation. The
Grand Trunk paid taxes to the municipalitieF. I ive not tne figures under miy
hand; perhaps honourable gentlemen have
them; tere would be $700,000 or $800,000
at least. Now, when the Government acquires the Grand Trunk tose municipalitics lose those taxes, because the railroad
becomes Crown property. The Governmuent
have to face either one of two things. I
undertaxd that there is sone att<'"ipt
made te say that the Grand Trunk prop-

255

erty will go on paying its taxes.
It is
Crown property, and if the property goes
on paying those taxes, then it bas to be
put on the same footing in other municipalities. If, on the other band, it does
not pay the taxes, you have special aid
local and unjust legislation, and the only
legislation that will last is legislation based
upon justice for everybody.
Before proposing the motion which I have
to make, I wish just to refer to a statement
that I find is in the mouth of practically
everyone, and which was made by the
President of the Privy Council. He said
that if they did not go on with the Bill
now the opponents of the Bill might organize to defeat it. Out of its own mouth
has come, it seems to me, a very good
reason why the consideration of this Bill
should be deferred.
He admits that the
opponents of the Bill are not organized.
Labour organizes, temperance organizes,
moral reformers organize, and even the undertakers in the province of Nova Scotia
organized.
They wound up by appointing
officers and holding a banquet, and they
passed a resolution to memorialize
the
Dominion Government to prohibit burials
at sea. I do not see why the opponents of
this mneasure, like all other people, should
not have a chance to organize.
I do not
sec why they should not have a chance to
stand up and be counted, why they should
not have a chance to memorialize Parliament and nresent their views. That reason
is as strong as any of the other reasons that
While it is true
have been put forward.
that over a year ago this question was in
the air, and there was some discussion
about taking the Grand Trunk over, I reinmber it as well as if it were yesterday,
yet I never heard anything about it again
until the day the matter was brought down
in the House of Commons. Even if I had,
how is the man on the street, or the lawyer
in his office, or the doctor in his office, or
the merchant, going to consider a thing of
this kind when all the material is in the
offices of the Grand Trunk and the offices
of the Government? How long is it since
we got the blue book? It bas not been
before us all summer.
Notwithstanding all I have said, if you
eau get the British Government and the
Canadian Governmnent to clean up this
question of international relations, if you
can come forward and give us facts that
xill show that the taking over of this road
will give you the through freight that you
now have not got and that will make up
for what the roads cost you, I shall still be

the Jnter-state Commerce Commission will
treat Ihe Çrand Trqpk line, as they are
now palled in the United Statas, lA exaçtly
the same maner as they will gli otlwr inter-state roads. I think that we ought to be
quite prepared to take our chances for com.peting for business on that basis.
Likewise the Railway Commissions of the
geveral states were referred to by the honourable getleman frqA fi4dleton (non.
W. B. Ross). In eaoh state there are other
lines that corne under the jurisdiction of
those bodies, and I think it is safe to assume that the State Commissions would
treat this line in exactly the same manner
and on the sanme basis as they would all
other lines that corne under their jurisdiction, and therefore there is no particular
need for worry on that score.
It was stated that the portion of the
Grand 'Trunk system lying within the
United States has not proved profitable up
to the present, and therefore we ought not
to assume liabilities for a losing proposition
in a foreign country. The statement was
not made in exactly those words; but that,
I think, was the intent of the honourable
gentleman's remarks. I think it has been
stated in the other House that the deficit
assumed to exist on the American lines
was about $1,632,000. I think at the sanme
time it is true-in fact, while I have not
the statement on paper, I have the information-that the profits derived from
handling that American business over the
Canadian portion of the Grand Trunk
system netted the Grand Trunk railway
between $15,000,000 and $16,000,000 of profit;
that had they not had that business to haul
from Sarnia to Island Pond, Vermont, over
the main line of the Grand Trunk, they
wouid have lost that amount of business.
Therefore a deficit on the small portion of
the line lying within the United States,
where they gather traffic, at Chicago, and
deliver it at Portland, .is really an asset
instead of a liability.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Where is the
authority for that?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I wil. endeavour
to oonfirm that information, if my honourable friend so desires, later on.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: May I ask the
honourable minister, while he is on that
point: Would not the business produce the
saine rate of profit on the Unes in the
United States as on the lines in Canada?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The manner in
whioh the earnings are arrived at is on
the mileage basis, and probably threeHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

quarters it the miloage çevered would be
in Canada, and all of it would be through
business. The expenses i connetion with
gathering and losding treight .914 deverirw
it, the cost of delays to cars, per diep,
etc., at terminal points, which happen to
be in the United States in both instances,
have made that end of the trafic seem
unprofitable, while the Canadian portion
of the line enjoyed the profits of the basiness.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: The terminal
charges would make the difference?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They contributed, yes.
I was quite interested in the remarks of
the honoprable gentleman from MiddlIeton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) concerning that great
financier Sir Charles Rivera Wilson and his
reminiscences regarding that gentleman. I
happen to have personal reminiscences
of the same gentleman, which I arn going
to burden'the House with for just a moment.
In the year 1893, or possibly 1894, Sir
Charles Rivers Wilson made a tour of
inspection of the Grand Trunk railway.
I happened to be a humble telegraph operator on that line at the time. His knowledge
of railroading and of railroad operation impressed itself on me then in a way that I
shall never forget. He was travelling over
the line between Sarnia and London one
afternoon, and, as usual, the president's
train had the right of way. Passenger
trains and freight trains that were on the
road were set aside by order of the train
despatcher, who was being watched by the
superintendent in London, and everything
was put " into clear," as we terrn it, for
the president's special. He came along in
the afternoon where I happened to be
located and his special train' pulled into
the side track. Greatly to my amazement,
when I hastened down to find out what
the trouble was-knowing that the whcile
subdivision of sixty odd miles was tied up
and seven or eight trains, passenger and
freight, were awaiting the paesing of this
train-I was informed by the conductor that
Sir Charles had decided that he would have
some tea, and for that purpose he had taken
the side track, apparently oblivious to the
fact that he was tying up all the rest of the
trains on the division. I acquainted the
train despatcher of this fact and that Sir
Charles would be there about forty minutes,
and he immediately got busy and got all
the operators on the line to give out orders
changing the "meets" and time orders, etc.,
that the various trains had, in order that

they had fully complied with the conditions set
out in my report. This complies with Mr.
Simmons' memo of July 4th, 1919, who made the
original inspection of this line. They have completed the work that they agreed to do, and in
my opinion the line is in a very good condition
of maintenance.
Leaving Fort Erie on the afternoon of the
22nd I ran to Niagara Falls. This line is in
first-class shape, considerable new rails have
been laid, new ties and new ballast.
I left Niagara Falls on the morning of the
23rd and made an inspection by daylight to
Hamilton, and then from Toronto to Coteaa
Junction. The requirements of this line are ail
embodied in my report of June 18th, and i
might say that they have complied with probably over 90 per cent of these requirements,
and I have no doubt they will fully complete
them by the 15th of November.

All that is left undone is a few of the yards,
such as Prescott, which want some tie renewals,
and in some places sonte rail anchors required
to be put on, and which are already on the
ground.
When I reached Coteau the darkness prevented my inspecting the track from Montreal
to Coteau, and I went in to Montreal, returning
by daylight and inspected the track from Montreal to Ottawa. I found the line in first-class
shape, well ballasted, tic renewals and rail
renewals where promiséd. In my opinion the
Grand Trunk have complied with practically all
they agreed to do, and which has placed the
maintenance of their line in good shape. There
is no reason why it cannot be kept in that
condition.

Governtent of the United States is operating 2,002 miles of railway in Canada, and
this Government and the people of this

country have so far raised absolutelv no
objection. At the present time the Government of Canada, as owner of the stock of
the Canadian Northern Railway Company,
t- operatng between 200 and 300 miles of
railway in the United States without any
itterference being had, or exception taken
by the Government of the, United States,
except that when the United States Governtment took over the control and operation of
the railroads in that country they specifically excluded that piece of road, which is
owned and operated by the Canadian Governmtent; they said they would not interfere with it-they were satisfied that we
should operate it. I myself discussed the
question with the legal representative of
the Director of Railroads of the United
States, in May 1917, in the city of Washington, as it affected the railway employees,
in whon at that time I was directly interested.
Reference wvas made also to what might
occur with regard to rates, inasmuch as the
control of rates on the lines in the United
States was outside the power or jurisdiction
of our Board of Railway Commissioners or

the Dominion Government. I think, honourable gentlemen, it is safe to assume that the

could not discriminate against an individual

ness, and therefore we may feel certain that

we might move the other trains, passenger
and freight, that were on the road. When
the forty minutes had. exmpired I inquired
of the oonduetor again il they were ready
to go, and 1 had a number of orders for
them. The conductor went out, delivered
hie or4ers to bie engineer, and advised Sir
Charles, or rather the "buttons" who came
to the door, that they were ready te proceed. Sir Charles decided that hoe wanted
tpe make soine -copy," and therefore they
would not move until hie had finished
making hie copy, which, I presume, was
the writing of a letter or sometbing of that
sort. Soé'e delayed the train tbirty minutes
more. That ail im-pressed itself on my mind
at the time, and I have neyer forgetten
that indication of the ability as a railroad
administrator of a man who bas the reputation of being a great financier, but who
apparently did net know the first thing
about the operation of a railroad.
Some comment has been made with referonce te the provincial guarantees on certain
portions of the property controlled by the
Grand Trunk and the Grand Trunk Pacifié,
and it is stated that the Federal Government is proposing to assume the liability
for ail the provincial guarantees. I feel
positive that that is absolutely incorrectthat there is no sncb thing ini contemplation, and that such a resuit will not occur.
Likewise with reference te taxes. Federal
property is exempt fromn taxation, and,
while I do net desire te make any legal
argument, because i cannot, I think it is
true that ail Federal property is supposed
not ta be revenue-producing or profitable
and net operated for the purpoee of profit.
The Canadian Northern raiiway, since it
became the property of the Canadian
Government bas been carried on under its
corporate identity as the Cagadian National
railway. It bas continued ta pay taxes just
as it did when it was a private corporation.
If this agreement is passed and the Grand
Trunk railway becomes absorbed in the
Canadian National Railway system, the
statement made by the honour-able Minieter
of Railways in the House of ýCommons is
absolutely tz'ue, that the existing taxation,
at the rates which prevail in the various
municipalities, will continue ta be paid as
it bas been'in the past.

over other lines. Let us for a moment realize
the fact. The Canadian National railway
has established a passenger train service
between Toronto and Ottawa, a very creditable service, with good equipment. I think
it compares favourably with that of the
Ganadian Pacific railway, which, in my
opinion, is the best in the world.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman say how many thousand
acres of yard the Canadian National bas in
Montreal?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not in the business centres- of Montreal?
Hon. Mr. CAýSGRAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. The Canadian National railway cannot to-day haul a
single passenger out of the city of Toronto
unless they pay tribute to the Grand Trunk.
Likewise they canfiot deliver a passenger
into the city of Ottawa without again paying tribute to the Grand Trunk.

Trunk now obtain their coal, a straight
saving of half a nllion dollars per year
would result, to say nothing of the saving
of freight; and I submit that that is a good
proposition. I could go on giving numerous
savings of that sort that could be effected,
but I do not desire to take too much of the
time of the House. I submit, however, that
the economies in operation that can be
effected are almost limitless.
With reference to traffic, may I take a
short time to make clear to the House just
what is involved in the suggestion that the
Canadian National railway should obtain access to the industrial and agricultural centres of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec;
and let us see for a moment what traffic

emanates f.rom that district, which the Canadian National railway does not touch. It
is a fact that in the province of Ontario
there are 75 towns and cities of 2,000 population and over, as shown in the 1911 census, served by the Grand Trunk and not
reached by the Canadian National. In the

the years innnediately preceding this date,
the years of the war, and I have ventured
to use the figures of 1915, which perhaps
were the last figures that would indicate
normal conditions. The value of the manufactured products of the Dominion of Canada
in the year 1915 was $1,381,0000, of which
$715,531,000 worth was produced in the province of Ontario, and $381,203,000 worth in
the province of Quebec; or 52 per cent of
the whole in Ontario and 27l per cent of
the whole in the province of Quebee; or, in
other words, slightly over 74 per cent of
the total manufactured products of the
Dominion of Canada emanated from the portions of those two provinces not served by
the Canadian National railway.
I think it is safe to assume that most
of the manufactured products, transported
to some point in this country or in some
other country, must naturally be handled

fore
the Canadian National railway had access
to this territory and to this business, it
would participate in the benefits of the
long hauls te various distant parts of the
country, as it cannot do at present.
Let us turn for a moment to the experts
alone. Canada exported $882,000,000 worth
of goods in that year, of which $600,000,000,
or 72 per cent of the whole, came from
those two provinces named. There has been
during the last few weeks a herring dragged
across the trail until it is nearly worn
out. It is stated that if the Canadian
Government acquires the Grand Trunk railway that will divert Canadian traffic to
American ports, particularly to Portland.
That, I think, is an entirely erroneous
assumption. If Canada is at the present
time, or was in the last normal year,
exporting 5882,000,000 worth of goods, and
if 72 per cent of those exports originated
in those two provinces, largely in the territory not served by the Canadian National
railway, it must have been exported over
the linos of the Canadian Pacific and the
Grand Trunk, and as a matter of fact the
only seaport which the Grand Trunk
reaches and uses in winter months is Portland, Maine. Therefore, because of the
fact that the Canadian National railway
has not access to the industrial centres of
Canada, the experts of Canada are now
going through an American port; whereas
if we controlled that railway, the policy of
the Government could be, if so desired, to
divert a large portion of the business which
originates within our country to our own
seaports instead of leaving it to pass

respect to imports the very same situation
exists. The imports of Canada were S564,500,000, of whichHon. Mr. GORDON: May I ask the
honourable gentleman, does he mean that
the bulk of the exports are now going by
Portland?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, those

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is that right?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What about Montreal?

I assume,
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
honourable gentlemen, that nobody contends that the port of St. John or the port
of Halifax would be used so long as the
port of Montreal is open.
With reference to imports, there was
imported into the province of Ontario for
that year $277,000,000 worth of goods, and
into the province of Quebec $180,000,000
worth. Those goods are not all used in
those two provinces by any means, but
are distributed by the firms who purchase
them and handle them to all parts of this
country. If the Canadian National railway lias not access to those bases where
those goods corne into the country it cannot fairly participate and get its fair share
of the business in the distribution of then
throughout the country.
I mention these facts to indicate te
honourable gentlemen the desirability, and
indeed the necessity, of obtaining control
of the Grand Trunk railway and operating
it in conjunction with the Canadian National railways, if the Canadian National
railways themselves are ever to be anything but a liability.
While it is of great importance that the
National railways should have access to
the industrial centres, we must not overlook the fact that a very large portion of
the agricultural products of Canada also
emanate from this same territory. Canada
in the year 1916 produced $26,000,000 worth
of butter, of which over $20,000,000 was
produced in those two provinces. In the
same year, Canada produced $35,000,000
worth of cheese, $34,000,000 worth of which
came from the provinces of Ontario and

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
Quebec, we produced $58,000,000 worth of
lumber, of which $31,500,000 worth came
from those two provinices. I mention these
facts, honourable gentlemen, to indicate to
you that not in manufactured goods alone
does this argument apply, but also with
regard to agricultural products, to a very
large extent, and to show tha-t the business
now enjoyed by the Grand Trunk railway
ought to be under the control of the Canadian National railway's in the interest of
the whole people,
But, while these things a.re important, it
is still more desirable -that -the Canadian
National railways should obtain and have
connection with the United States railroa-ds. The customs revenue of this country last year was about $147,000,000, which
indica!tes that there 'musît have been a
large exchange of business between Canada and other countries. I am not prepared
to say at the moment exactly what portion
of that was interchanged with the Uited
States; but certainly it was a very
large portion, and if the Canaddan
National railway is to receive any
traffic from American roads it must
have con:.ections with some of them.
Now let us see what the situation is.
I used to be in the railroad game for some
sixteen years, and one of the things that I
was familiar with was this very question of
routing traffic and interchanging with
foreign lines. Take the condition of the Canadian Pacific railway, if you will, for a
moment. They are véry much alive to the
imporfance of this particular matter. The

and Aroostook railway at Brownsville Junetion and Greenville Junction, Maine. They
interchane business with the Boston and
Maine railroad at Lennoxville, Quebec, and
at Newport, Vermont. They interchange
business with the Central Vermont at Farnham and Stanbridge, Quebec; with the Rutland railway at Iberville Junction; with the
Q., M. and S., which is the Delaware and
Hudson, at Delson Junction; and with
the New-York Central at Adirondack
Coming to the Niagara fronJunction.
tier, over the T., H. and B. railway,
which the Canadian Pacifie partly own, they
operate a passenger -service right into the
city of Buffalo, and over it they have direct
freight connections with every railroad
running out of Buffalo, serving the central
part of the New Englqnd an-d the Central

states. They interchange business with the
Michigan Central railway at St. Thomas
and at Windsor, and run their passenger
trains over the Michigan Central railway,
into Chicago. They interchange business
with the Pere Marquette railway, with the
D., T. and I., and several other railroads
that might be named, at the city of Detroit.
At the Soo they connect with their own Soo
line and have access to the whole of the
middle and western states. That is a brief
enumeration in part; it is perhaps not complete, because I have just named the points
from memory. Those are the points of interthe
change and the facilities that
Canadian Pacifie have for interchanging
business with'foreign lines in Eastern Canada. I happened to be the station agent at
one of those points, Brownsville Junction,
Maine, for a number of years. At that point
they interchange business with the Bangor
and Aroostook railway, which is purely a
local road within the State of Maine.
I remember very well preparing a statement for a committee of which I was a
mem<ber, and negotiating with the -railway
in connection with wages, and I know that
in one year the charges on freight delivered
-to the Bangor and Aroostook railway from
the Canaaian Pacifie railway at that point
'alone was a little less than $1,000 short
of $1,000,000 in one year.
Thousands of
cars were interchanged at that one point
within a year. I merely mention that to
indicate the importance of having interchange connections with United States
roads.
What is the position with reference to
the Grand Trunk railway?
The Grand
Trunk railway, I think, has interchange
connections with the Boston and Maine at
Portland, with the Maine Central at Lewiston Junction in M-aine, and at North Stratford, New Hampshire. Lt interchanges with
the Boston and Maine at Lennoxville, Quebec. Lt interchanges with the Delaware
and Hudson at St. John's.. It owns and
ope;ates the Central Vernont railway, which
has access to all points through Vermont
and New Hampshire into New London,
Connecticut. Lt has direct connection with
all the roads running to the Niagara
frontier. At Detroit it bas direct connection with the Wabash, the Pere Marquette,
and other toads. Tt may be interesting to
the House to know_ that for the year ending October 1, 1919, the Grand Trunk railway interchanged with American roads 704,163 carloads of freight, which aggregated
16,642,000 tons. Does not that indicate to
us the importance of having direct inter-

266

SENATE

change with Anierican lines, if we are going
to be successful in the operation of a railroad on behalf of the people of Canada?
What is the position of the Canadian
National railway in this regard? East of
the Great Lakes they have not one solitary
connection except through the New- York
and Ottawa at the city of Ottawa. What
does that mean to the railway? It means
absolute strangulation so far as the possibility of obtaining a fair share of the traffic
to which it is entitled in this country; and
yet, through this little connection in Ottawa, the Canadian National railway, up
to October 1 this year, interchanged 14,000
odd cars, 9,229 of which were loaded. If
we had access to and direct connection with
a number of the large roads in the United
States, think what it would mean in the
interchange of traffic and the getting of
business, the effect it would have on the
reduction and the elimination of deficits
with which we are faced, and which the
public and some honourable gentlemen
criticise the Government for. Here is the
golden opportunity to eliminate that condition, and te get direct connection with
those large and important American lines,
and to get a fair share of the through business to ail points in Canada, theréby swelling the volume of traffic and rendering
more proitable the roads which Canada
now owns.
I think that all honourable gentlemen
will agree that in almost any business-a
manufacturing business, for example-there
is a certain overhead expense that will
keep on regardless of what the earnings
may be. But, as production increases, in
like proportion your overhead expense for
management decreases in proportion to the
amount of output. The same principle applies te railroads. A railroad must have a
certain official staff: it must have an accounting department, an auditing department, a car service department, a department of freight and telegraph receipts,
passenger receipts, and so on; and if that
road is earning comparatively little money,
the proportion of the cost of managerial
expenses is very much greater than if that
road is doing a flourishing business. That
is exemplified in the fact that the managerial expense of the Canadian Pacific railway in proportion to its operating revenue
is the smallest of any railroad in Canada;
and the much-maligned and abused Intercolonial comes next, notwithstanding that it
las been charged many tiues that it has
been badly managed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

May I point out a few facts in connection
with this matter? I have gathered this
information in such a way that I think
it must be recognized as accurate. These
figures have all been taken from the railway statistics of June 30, 1918, the latest
available, and it is to be noted that the
Canadian Pacifie's operating revenues were
$150,274,000, and its general expenses $2,629,000, or 1.74 per cent of its operating
revenue. The Intercolonial railway comes
next. Taking the Intelkcolonial, Prince
Edward Island, St. John and Quebec, and

National Transcontinental railways coinbined, their total operating revenue was
$30,153,00, and their total general expenses
$580,000, or 1.94 per cent. The Canadian
National railways, or what was the Canadian Northern system, Lad an operating
revenue of $134,879,000, and their general
expenses were $3,466.000, or 2.56 per cent.
The point is that if the operating revenue
of the Canadian National railways as a
vhole can be increased by increased traffic,
there is no reason why the percentage of
the operating revenues utilized for general
nxpenses cannot be reduced to the ratio et
other lines. The Grand Trunk, for example,
had operating revenues of $50,900,000, and
general expenses of $1,434,000, or 2.88 per
cent; that includes the Grand Trunk PaThe point is this: that, with the
cific.
amalgamation proposed, if the Grand Trunk
railway systeni is acquired by the Government, and merged with the Canadian National systemu, and operating revenues are
increased as they ought te be and will be,
then if, instead cf having four or five manhave to-day, that staff is
agers, as yo
reducedi to the present basis of the Canadian Pacifie, the saving would be the $1,026,000 annually, on the cost of managing
these roads clone. Let me put it in another
way. $1,026,000 annually, capitalized at 4
per cent, means $26,650,000 of capital investment. I think that is an item worthy
of consideration.
It las been suggested in the House of
Commons, and I think reference has aiso
been mode to it here, that an alternative
proposition bv way of a traffic agreement
with the railway would better meet the
need. I speak from experience and some
knowedge of railway matters when I say
that 'I arm absolutely and positively of the
opinion that no traffic agreement cari ha
made between two railroads that is not
recognized by both of them as being advantegeous to both. I have in mind the traffic

made some yeaÈs age between the Grand
Trunk railway and the Intercelonial
railway. Il. appeared obvious that it
was irn the ir.terests of both those
roads. The Grand Trunk did not ow'n any
lines in the Maritime Provinces. and the
Intercolonial did flot have any west of Ste.
-Rosalie Junctien. fheretore a traffie agreement was enteted into whereby the Intercol1onial got inte MoiAreal, and business
originating on the Intercolonial for points
west of Montreal would be delivered for furtherance over that line. How did that werk
outP Any one who is familiar with the operation of the Intercolonial train over the
Victoria bridge and into the Bonaventure
àtation will know that there has bien
nothing but disputes, many of them stili
unsettled, as a resuit of that agreement. We
talk of a traffic agreement with the Grand
Trunk whereby it would hand ever businjess to the Ca*iadian National instead ýof
the Canadian Pacifie railway for inîtherance to points in Western 'Canada. Just
before recess, when I referred 1x the towns
and cities in Ontario served by the Grand
Trunk and not reached by the Cana dian
National railway, the honourable. member
for De Lanaudière. (Hon. Mr. Casgrain>
pointed eut that most of those places were
reached by the Canadian Pacifie railway.
Honourable gentlemen, that is the answer.
The Canadian Pacific railway do net want
the Grand Trunk railavay, but they do ýnot
want the Canadian National railways to
have i.t, because, jus't 80 long as the Grand
Trunk railway remains a separate entity and
-unit, just so long therCanadian Pacifie railway will draw the long-haul traffie dut of
those towns not touched by the Canadian
National and destined to points which the
Grand Trunk does not reach. Therefore I
say that ne traffic agreement may be made
with the Grand Trunk that would be beneficial to the Canadian National in anything
like the samne .degree as would the acquisition of the Grand Trunk preperty itseIf.
I made mention before of the matter of
the ceai supply.. Let me refer to that from
the industrial standpoint. Have you seen
any manufacturing industries
locating
themselves along the lines of the Canadian
National eastern lines at large points like
TorontoP I do flot think so-why? Because
they use etfal in* their business, and that
ceai must ahl eome from the United States,
and the Canadian National railway having
no access to the United States, any coal for
these industries must come over the Grand
Trunk or the Canadian Pacifie lines into
the city of Toronto, for example; and il

267

the industry is located on the line o! the
Canadian National, what happens? The
whole'freight rate is charged te Toronto,
plus switching charge. So long as that condition existe, industries are net going to
locate where it costs themn perhaps five dollars per car extra te get cea] to their plant.
You have not access te the existing plant,
and you cannot induce industries te locate
upon your lines. That is a matter worthy
of consideration wben deciding as te
,whether or net the acquisition of the Grand
Trunk railway is desirable.
1 have net deait with the question et
public ownership, neither do I propose te
do se at any length; but I desire te observe
that the principle or .policy e! public ownership is net învelved in this matter. It is
simply a plain business question oi what is
the proper and economical thing te de in
the light o! the exis ting situation. Lt is
centended by soine gentlemen that public
ownership and operation of railways in
Canada has proved a failure; and they have
pointed to the Intercolonial as an example.
In the early days I believe that was ahsolutely true; but within my own recollectien and knowledge o! the operation of the
Intercolenial railway, from the time that
the board of management, compesed of Mr.
Tîffin, Mr. Pottinger, and Mr. Brady, were
put in charge, the evils ef patrenage began
te disappear, and when a succeeding Minister of Railways, the late Mr. Cochrane, replaced Mr. Gutelius in charge o! the railway, and gave him a free hand, the abuses
that I have referred te almest entirely disappeared. In the year 1916 the Intercolonial
railway shewed a surplus o! more than
$3,000,OOO; and, had freight rates. been the
samne on that read as upon other railroads.
the surplus would have been very much
more substantial.
May I peint te anether instance ef goverfiment ownership, and te an improvement in
service because o! governiment ownership?
I refer te the Great Northwestern Telegraph
CoJmpany. Up te the time the Canadian
Nortbern was taken over by the Gevernment, the service o! the Great Nerthwestern
Telegraph Company was abselutely ridiculeus. It is net perfect yet, but it is vastly
improved. I mention this in leading up
to the point that gevernment ownership
need in ne way interfere with. efficient administration and operation o! a railway.
If you couple with that government operatien, you may get into difficulties but just
so long as a railway is eperated as a business concern, and is free o! political influence, there is absolutely ne reason why

268

SENATE

the administration and operation should
not be just as successful and economical
as it would be under private ownership.
I do not propose to take up more time
than seems to be reasonably justifiable; but
may I point out that two eminent railway
authorities some time ago, in commenting
upon the railway situation, made some very
pointed and, I think, illuminating references to this situation. I would refer to the
comment of Sir Thomas Tait, who, in
making a certain proposition which meant
the amalgamation of a number of railroad
interests for the purpose of more economical
operation and greater profit, said:
Very large economies in operation and maintenance can be effected If the five systems
herein included In this scheme are worked as
one for the good of the system as a whole.
The utilization of the shorter or easier and
therefore cheaper routes for traffic, the taking
up or temporary abandonment of useless lines
or lines of little value where the public would
not be appreciably affected, the ability to use
.all motive power and rolling stock freely on
any part of the whole system, thus saving much
unrecessary movement, especially of freight
cars, and obtaining greater service out of such
shipment reductions in train service without
appreciable disadvantages to the public by
avoiding at present duplicate services, joint
instead of separate stations, terminais, offices,
etc., with consequent reduction in staff, concentration of work in shops and elsewhere.
larger purchases and therefore lower prices of
ail materials and supplies, etc.
The savings
which could be effected in these and other directions are so many and the aggregate would
re.present so large an a.mount that they might
go a long way toward paying the deflcit in the
earlier years resulting from the operation of
the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacifie

and 'government systems.

That is the opinion expressed by a gentleman whom I think every member in this
House will recognize as an authority upon
questions of this kind.
Likewise Mr. W. F. Tye, C.E., a promnient
consulting engineer, expressed similar views
in a book which he issued in January, 1917,
wherein he points out that the distance between Quebec and Vancouver, by a combination of the Canadian Northern, the
Grand Trunk Pacifie and Transcontinental,
would be sixty miles shorter than via the.
Canadian Pacific railway; the distance between Montreal and Winnipeg would be
sixty-four miles shorter than via the Canadian Pacifie railway. From Toronto to Winnipeg the new route would be twenty-eight
miles shorter than by the Canadian Pacifie
railway, 108 miles shorter than by the present Canadian Northern, and fifty-one
shorter than by the present Grand Trunk
connection. We would also have a shorter
line, with much better grades than either
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the Grand- Trunk or the Canadian Northern
between Winnipeg and Vancouver.
Mr. Tye further remarks that the Canadian Northern has a very meagre system of
very badly placed branches in Ontario and
Quebec. That confirms what I have tried to
explain this afternoon and this evening
when I said that the Canadian Northern
lines in Eastern Canada, as they exist today, were a joke. I regard them as just
about as good a business proposition as
building a million dollar hotel at the North
Pole and expecting to fill-it with guests.
Mr. Tye goes on to say that if it is to be a
success as an independent road it must
have such a system which can only be had
by duplicating and paralleling the Grand
Trunk or Canadian Pacifie, which duplication was, in his opinion, useless and unnecessary; but he recommended instead the
consolidation of existing lines, which is the
propos.al now before this House.
I have endeavoured, honourable gentlemen, in perhaps a very imperfect way, to
bring forward a few points to indicate the
advisability of an amalgamation of these
railroad properties, and the benefits to be
derived in the joint operation of them. The
other question that I referred to at the beginning was: if it is desirable to acquire the Grand Trunk railway, is the
proposal now before Parliament and before this House a fair and reasonable
one?
I do not propose or presume

to speak

with

but my

upon financial

conception

of the pro-

posed bargain is sim.ply this, that the bonds
and the guaran.teed stock of the Grand
Trunk Railway, upon which the Grand
Trunk Railway has always met its obligations, would simply be transferred; that is,
those obligations would continue to b met
by the Dominion Government out of the
revenues of the railway, as has always been
the case on the first, second and third preferred stock and on the common stock, the
value of which is questionable, but upon
which the Grand Trunk have over a long
period of years paid some returns, but not
the ordinary returns paid on the guaranteed stock and bonds, namely, four and
five per cent.
A question arises as to the value of that
particular stock. The Government made an
offer to the Grand Trunk Railway Company,
based upon the recommendation of the
Drayton-Acworth report, which -was that
an annual payment should be made at the
beginning of $2,500,000 a year and increasing after a few years to $3,600,000.
The
Grand Trunk Railway Company said: " No,

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
that is not satisfactory; vie viant a larger
sum." If I arn not inistaken, they named
the sumn of $5,600,000. It wa.s flot possible
tô reach an agreement, and therefore the
negmotiations were, about a year ago, broken
off by the Government, 'who said: -"We
caninot offer you any More," fbelieving, -and
indeed knowing, that the Grand Trunk wnust
necessarily realize their financial position
-that their obligations viere continuing
to pile up and that some day they wiould
corne to the Governmen-t and accept its
off er.
The alternative offer made at ýthat time
was to, arbitrate as to what the value of
that stock was and vihat the payrnents
should *be, and that is the question that it
is proposed to submit to arbitration. Is
there any fairer method of arriving at what
the amount -should he? I submit, honourable gentlemen, that, even though the
arbitrators' award. miglit be more than the
Government have heretofore oifered, the
benefits to be derived from the acquisition
of the Grand Trunk railway, and its operation in conjunction vith the Canadian
National Railway system, for the varions
reasons that I have endeavoured Vo point
out, viould far exceed any award that may
be rmade, and would to that extent reduce
the deficit that the taxpayers of this counrtry
are novi paying from year to year.
What is the -alternative if this is not
doneP If Parliament decides at this tirne
that the agreement shahl no.t be made, but
be laid over until another session of Parliament, the Grand Trunk's liabilities wiii
in the rneantime increase, and the present
excessive cost. of operation cf the Grand
Trunk Pacifie and Canadian Northern
railways in the West, a separate entities,
-viii continue instead of being greatly
redueed by amalgamation, Canada paying
those additional expenses in the meantime.
My opinion is that the Grand Trunk Railway Company' would have good cause to
contend before the Board of Arbitration that
any additional expense or liabilities that
they incur between now and the time that
the agreement might eventually be made
should he taken into consideration by the
board. I think that any of us, in the case
of a business proposition referred to arbitration, would take a similar stand. I therefore desire, to support thia proposed Bull,
because I believe that it is in the best interest of the people of Canada and the
future success of the Canadian National
railways, in vihich the people of Canada are
directly interested.
Just a word with reference to the Canadian Pacifie. The Canadian Pacifie rail-

269

way,- is in my opinion, the fine.st and best
transportation system in the world. I
believe it is most efficiently managed.
I was an employee of that road for some
sîxteen years, and knew every operating
official from coast to coast, because of my
peculiar business on behalf of the employees
bringing me into contact with them ail, and
I knew something of the efficiency in the
management and operation of that line.
I want to, say to you, honourable gentlemen,
that, in my opinion, while I xnay.differ with
other members of the Government in that
respect-for I know of utterances made in
the other Hlouse-I do not believe that the
Canadian Pacific Company want to acquire
the Grand Trunk. They do flot need it.
They have.access to nearly all the induetrial
centres in Ontario and Quebec that the
Grand Trunk have.
But the Canadian
Pacific does not want the ýCanadian National
railways to acquire the Grand Trunk because, so long as they are competing only
with the Grand Trunk, and the Grand
Trunk does noV extend beyond the southern
portions of Ontario and Quebec, the Canadian Pac'ific have little competition, se far
as concerna the long 'hauls to other points
in Canada, which. îs a profitable business.
I aubmit, honourable gentlemen, that as
Canada develops the Canadian Pacifie is not
going to suifer; that the growing business
of Canada will in a few years be ample to
meet the full capacity of both of these great
raiiway systems; that the 'Canadian Pacifie
railway, by reason of its efficient management, wili be an inspiration to the management of the Canadian National railviays,
and necèssarily so. With healthy competition on the part of the Canadian National
railways, the Canadian Pacific railway must
necessarily continue Vo keep on tiptoe
to give the best. possible service. Let service be the hasis of future cempetition.
Then the people of Canada wiii be viel
served by hoth great railway systems.
There are a number of other details that
I would have liked to mention, but I fear
I may have wearied the Hou-se aiready.
Some HIon. SENATORS: Go on.

suaded me to be recreant to my oath of
office. But I believe that our oath of office
imposes upon us the necessity of giving all
affaira of state due consi-deration. We are
sworn to give our best, whether that best
be good, bad or indifferent, to the service
of the country; and we are sworn to give fair
and full consideration to every measure of
importance that may be brought before
Parliament, and to cast our vote in accordance with our honest convictions.
The honourable leader of the Government refers to the fact that much of our
early railway legislation was a series of
blunders. I believe that that very argument was the strongest argument that could
be advanced in favour of delaying final
action on this Bill until we have a very
much larger fund of information before us
than lias been submittedto us up to the
present time. It is all very well to take a
chance. The honourable gentleman's argunient puts me in mind of the lady who came
home to lier husband and said, " I have
bought a ticket for a raffle of a motor car."" Well," he said, " how màny chances are
there?" " Oh," she said, " that is what decided me: there are a thousand chances,
and we ought to have a pretty good show
with so maany chances." la this case there
are a thousand chances of making a mistake. The honourable gentleman has told
us that .there are forty or fifty subsidiary
companies. Each of these companies bas
hundreds of ramifications in connection
with their different phases of indebtedness
and in connection with the physical upkeep
and equipment of their properties. I confess
that I have very little information about all
these matters to enable me to come to a
decision at this juncture. I have read carefully every speech made in another place as
it has been spread upon Hansard; I have
read as diligently as I- could the public
press in search of information; and yet I
feel, and conscientiously feel, that I have
not at this time sufficient information to
enable me to formn a fair and unprejudiced
judgment, not as to the wisdom of purchasing, but as to the wisdom of taking such an
important step upon the meagre information
that ¶has been submitted to the country for
only two or three weeks.
In the business world there are always
two factors to be considered in making a
purchase. One is: is the price fair, and
such as to yield a profit to the purchaser?
The other is: is the time opportune? There
has been no argument, honourable gentlemen, in reference to the price, because we
have decided to delegate our own responsiHon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

bilities to a Board of Arbitration to adjudicate this matter without Parliament having
anything to say in regard to the final basýis
of purchase. That of itself would not affect
my views so seriously had we been favoured
with a copy of the agreement which is to
be submitted to the Grand Trunk shareholders for consideratidn. As a matter of
fact, I believe that no 'such agreement has
any existence, and the Parliament of
Canada is placed in the invidious position
that whereas we are asked to pass an
enabling Bill, land to give a blank cheque,
the Grand Trunk shareholders are in a
much more favoured position, because they
have not been called upon to express an
opinion until they have seen a copy of this
agreement, signed, sealed, and deliveredan agreement in which Parliament is to
have no voice, and, in fact, which it is
not going to be allowed to sed before the
transaction becomes an accomplished fact.
I do not believe that is a reasonable position
to place Parliament in, and I cannot see
what harm can be donc by delaying the
passage of this Bill until next session.
To that extent I am in hearty sympathy
with the amendnent proposed by my
honourable friend from Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross) that the consi-deration of this
question be deferred until next session.
During the interval we shall be able to
get further information; inquiry can be
made; we can get a better idea of the
opinions of the people of this country in
regard to the advisability of such a vast
undertaking. It is assumed that Parliament will meet within three months. Then,
are we to assume that, if this question,
which came like a bolt out of the blue, is
not settled within two or three weeks,
Canada is to be very greatly disadvantaged?
I think the honourable the leader of the
Government gave away the whole position
when' he referred to the fact that it is
absolutely necessary to the solvency of the
National railway that this purchase should
be completed. That is the very worst argument that could be placed before a Board
of Arbitration. It is not usual in commercial life, if a man or a corporation is
wishing to purchase an article of any
nature, or property of any description, to
preface the bargaining with the statement
we are able to purthat "unless
chase it from you it really means
the insolvency of our own enterprise."
I think that the statement of the leader
of the Government that the purchase is
absolutely necessary to the successful

,NOVEMBER 5, 1919
operation of the pre-sent state railway is
an intimation to the arbitrators to place
a very bigh value upon the *asaets which
may be submitted to thern for adjudication.
That, after ail, would not be so vitally
important, if Parliament, the representative of the people, were to have an opportunity alter the award to express any
opinion thereon. 'But I believe that in
another place the proposition was made
that the award of the arbitrators should bie
subjeet to the final ratification of Parliament, and that the amendment was mot
aocepted, and it is not in the BIi at the
present, time.
I do not intend to go very deeply into
the financial question; but f' think that
belore we assume such a heavy responsibil-ity we should at least give sorne consideration to the financial position of the
ýcountry at present. In ordinary commercial life, if a bargain i8 to be made, if
a purchase, is to be considered, the prime
question the purchaser has to consider is,
can he afford it? Therefore 1 make no
apology for bringing a ýfew facts before the
honourable members of this House i regard to our financial position *at the present moment. I will deal very briefly,
perhaps, aIl too briefiy, with corne few
facts and figures that I think may cause
honourable gentlemen to give-consideration
to the importance of the financial situation
in the final consideration of whatever action they may decide upon in connection
with the passage of this Bill. Five years
ago the. interest on our Federal debt wae
only $13,000,000 per annum; to-day, after
such a short space of time, it ie $115,000,M0. In addition to this $115,000,000, there
is an annual charge of fromn $30,000,000 to
$40,000,000 for pensions, etc., or a definite
fixed charge of $150,000,000 anuuaily, to
which again must be added the deficits
fromn the operation -of our national railway,
-of perhaps corne $25,000,000 more, making
a total in ail of some $ 180,000,000. Our
total estimated revenue for the year, including customs and excise receipte, war
profits tax, income tax, etc., is $280,000,000,
leaving a balance of only $ 100,000,000 for
,ordinary and extraordinary expenditures.
1 believe, honourable gentlemen, that I amn
correct in say.ing that our total expenditure
thia year wi]l be between $700,000,000 and
1800,000,000-more nearly $800,000,000 than
$700,000,000, including dernobilization aud
capital expenîditure, which woul leave a
shortage of over $500,000,000. We have been
s0 accustomed during the last few years
to, dealing with such great surine that
S-18

273

perhaps these figures may not have the
ca-me effect that they would- have had a
few years previouely; but when we corne
to cousider that we would have a shortage
of receipts of over $500l,000,000 this year
over the estirnated expenditure, -and $650,000,000 in excese of the total expenditures
of government five yea'rs ago, surely it is
time to pause and give consideration to
a question that is going to add another
hall billion dollars to our liabilities. We
know that oui liabilities will bie added to
to the extent of hall a billion dollars. We
aiso know that frorn that should be deducted a certain arnount of assets, but the
liabllity is fixed and the ass-ets are conjectural.
I noticed, as I suppose honourable gentlemen aIl did, that the other day Mr. Boville,
Deputy Minister of Finance, submitted a
statement to a committee of Parliament,
showing that in addition to the capital
expenditure of $529,122,445 covered in the
estimates for the current fiscal year passed
by Parliament at its regular session there
muet bie added the following: To meet cost
of fGrand Trunk receivership, including initereet and deficits on operation, $ 15,000,000;
provision for credit for Great Britair
and allied countries, $ 125,000,000. These
figures increased the country's obligation, other than current expenditures,
to an amount in exeess of $699,122,445.
Since this staternent was made, I have
sean supplerntary
estimates
brought
down totalliug $62,000,000 additional.
Now, honourable gentlernen, it la alI very
well during this time of prosperity to,
congratulate ourselves on oui ability to
meet expenditures; it is all very well to
feel that our Victory Loans in the past have
been a success-and I hope our present
Victgry Loan will be a great succees. But
these figures that 1 have read entail the
uecessity for further Victory Loans of several
hundred millions a year for several years
to corne, and the question is whether the
country will 'be in the sarnie prosperous
condition then to raise those loans as it is
to-day. We are blessed at the present tirne
with a great favourable balance of trade.
because out exporta exceed out imnports
by a very large ainount. One reason for the
very favourable balance of trade is the
high pries of wheat and other agrieultural
produce. But, fortunately or unfortunately,
oui trade returns are iu dollars and not in
tonnage. To-day the farmer is receiving
$2.25 a bushel fnr wheat as against $1 a
few years ago. The reason for that is that
the devastated countries of Europe have

REVIED EDITION

SENATE

274

not been producing, and therefore we, in
common with other nations that have a
surplus to export, are able to sell our
surplus products at a very high price. It
is reasonable to assume that these wheatproducing countries, however, now that
the war is over, will soon be able to attain
as great a measure of production as during
the pre-war period, and that to a certain
extent will limit our export trade of the
future. As soon as our export trade of the
future becomes limited, the prices must of
necessity fall, and, although our tonn'age
available for export may increase, our
receipts in dollars will be certain to fall
off. In 1917 our foreign trade reached the
crest of the wave, amounting to $2,552,000.000. This was 250 per cent greater than in
1915 and 350 per cent greater than in 1914.
In 1912 our imports exceeded our exports
by $293,000,000. In 1917 this balance was
reversed, and, instead of being $293,000,000 against us, there was $542,000,000 in
our favour. Because of this, and because
of the war and the prosperity that has
come to Canada on account of the war, we
have been able to bear these financial
burdens. It is because of the great influx
of money into this country for munitions.
for war materials, for wheat, for every
kind of farm produce, every kind of
woollen goods-in fact, every line of production in which Canada is able to engage
-that we have been able to undertake
the obligations that we have undertaken.
Honourable gentlemen, can that continue?
Is it reasonable to suppose that it can
continue? There is no one more anxious
tian 1 am-and I ai sure every member
of this Chamber is anxious-that it shall
continue, but I am sure that there was
never a flood-tide without an ebb.

There

s no doubt we have reached the crest of

the wave. The trade returns show it todav. Our favourable balance of trade is
gradually receding, and to my mind it is
doubtful whether we are going to be in
such a financial position that we shall be
able from year to year to assume a burden
of several hundred millions of dollars over
and above ouîr annual receipts froin the
taxation which is now imposed.

It has been estimated by the government
statisticinn that the present total value of
the whole resources of this country is equal
to about seventeen billion dollars. I want

te ho careful about these figures, and therefore I have taken the official figures of the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, as published
ie The Canadian Official Record. and I am
going to askz the indulgence of this House
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

while I read the details of this compilation,
which are very illuminating, very instruc-

tive. I make no apology for bringing these
figures before the members of this House,
because in rny judgment each and every
one of us ought to be acquainted with a
matter of such vital importance to the
future prosperity of this country. We talk in
a grandiloquent way as to our undeveloped

resources,
magnificent

and it is true that we have
resources,

undeveloped

they are not illimitable.

but

It is also true

that il we undertake the development of

those resources we must find capital with
which to develop them, and if we are to
tind capital fer their development, we must
save and serte. We must find the capital
to develop our resources in this country,
or we mnust go abroad to find it; and if we
are to co abroad for it we must first of all

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
The Bureau of Statlsties explains that although Table 1 adds up to a total of over nineteen billion dollars, some repetition of values
among the Items reduces this total, For example, the item I'Real Estate and Buildings ln
Cities " overlaps upon the Item IlPlant"I under
the heading "lManufactures." The statiatica
given to show current manufacturlng production ln the table do flot consider the tact that
values of raw materiais are repeated in the
addition of such Items as wheat, flour, bakery
products, etc.,* and of such Items as iron ore,
pig Iron, steel Ingots, bars, wire, etc.
The
Bureau of Statlstics believes that between sixteen and seventeen billions would be a lberai
estîmate of the total capital Invested ln Canada.
Now, honourable gentlemen, our nat-

ional de-bt at the present time -is approximately $2,OOO,OOO,OOO.
We are now undertaking to add to that vast sum an additional $500,0OO,0OO, making it $2,500,0OO,0OO
as -against a total irtvested capital of $16,OUO,tXJO,0OO. I do not say it is too large a
proportion. Each one of you is able to
fo-rm your own estimate ju.st as intefligently as I arn; but the point that I am
trying to make is, not to argue against the
purchase of the Grand Trunk Railway systomr by the Goverument, it rnay be a perfectly proper thing to do ln good time;but I arn arguing and I do urge that there
is no such desperate hurry as to 1make it
ne-cessary to close thie matter, which has
been before the public for- only three
weeks. If we are to do justice to ourselves
and to the country, we ought to .take
ample time; we ought to give ourselves
the benefit. of the doubt; and, when we
do re-aissemble for the purpose of casting a
vote regarding the proposed purchase, we

can do so intelligently, feeling that we
bave acted according to our beat judgment and have not been hasty in supporting an enterprise injudiciousdy hurried,
and which may mean fluat not only ourselves, but more particularly future generations, will have to bear euch a burden of
taxation as will tend to restrict further
national development.
I do not wish to take, up too much time
isn quoting figures; but I thought it would
be in the interest of the House and cf the
country that there ehould be soins recognition of the question of the pr oportion of
our obligations toc our national debt, that
there should be some consideration given to
the relation of oui income to our outllay, a.nd
to the question whether noîw is the
appointed time.
There bas been -a bogey held before us
in connection with the argument that
unless we corne to an immediate .decision
for the Government of Canada to purchase
tliis railway, the Candian Pacific ra.ilway

s-lsi

275

wî.1l gobble it up.
Personally I do
not believe that that is possible. I think
the honourable member for Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross), in reading the extracts
fromn the statutes of Canada this afternoon,
including extracts fromi the Railway BiAI
wihich we passed last session, fully ecb'c
the idea that the Canadian Pacifie railway
had any power to purchase the Grand Trunk
railway without the consent and sanction of
the Parliament of Canada. It may be interesting t.o read, however, the rernarks of
the president oif the Canadian Pacific rail!way in thjs connection, in a speech delivered
in Montreal on the occasion of the organization of the Victory Loan campaigu in tlhat
cýty. He said:
In the fIrst place, I may be pardon_ýd for caillng your attention to the tact that there exWs
by statute an absolute prohibition against any
arrangement by way of amalgamnation or joi-nIng of earnings between the Canadian Pacific
and the Grand Trunk or any branch Uines of
the Grand Trunk or leased by It or under Its
control. In the second place the Grand Trunk
duplIcates, ln many respects, the existing facilities of the Canadian Pacifie, whlch would render Its acquisition both unnecessary and. uàwise. In the third place, the Grand Trunk
cannot be dlvorced from the Grand. Trunk Pacific with its enormous liabillties--liabllittes whieh
I imagine no corporation in Canada would
think of assuming even though they were able
to do so and, lastly, the acquisition of the Grand
Trunk or any -portion of It has neyer been suggested to the Canadian Pacific or by the Cana-,
dian Pacifie and has neyer been considered ar

contemnplated ln any way or by any means direct
or Indirect.

I feel, honourable gentlemen, that I am
occupying the time of the House too longSome Hon. SENATORS: No, no; go on.
Hon. Mr. NIGHOLLZ :-and more particularly as I fsel that when this Bill cornes
before the Committee of the Whole, if it
ever does corne before the committee, I shall
have sornething further to say in reference
Lo certain amendments which, if adopted,
rnay be reasonably expected to modify the
effeet of the passage of this Bill as riow
submitted to us. I desire to say again, as I
sa:d at the outset of my remarks, that 1
feel a great sense of responsibility. Il is no
easy task for a loyal supporter of the
Government to rise in his place and criticise any action of that Government. But,
on the other hand, honourable gentlemen,
I want you to consider just this point:

If

you were in the highway and saw a car
filled with your own friends taking a very
sharp curve and you hoisted. a danger signal
to warn them against something that might
lead themn to destruction, do you net think
that you would be doing your duty to your
friendsP

t76

SENATE

Honourable gentlemen, as we are discussing a railway measure, I want to draw your
attention to the fact that probably the best
known and commonest sign in connection
with the railway business is a sign that will
be found in every township at every point
where a railway crosses the highway. That
sign is well advertised. It is a very simple
one and is desdigned to save the public
fron danger. It reads " Stop, look, and
listen." Honourable gentlemen, I want to
say with reference to this Bill that in my
judgment it would be the part of wisdom to
stop until we have sufficient information
to enable us to form an intelligent judgment
before casting a vote on such an important
question. I say we ought to look most carefully into all the multifarious ramifications
of the large number of subsidiary companies,
which may have all kinds of unknown
liabilities; and we want to look very carefully into any international questions that
may arise in connection with the operation
of 1,600 miles of railway in a foreign country. And, in conclusion, let me say, honourable gentlemen, that we want above all to
listen for the judgment and the voice of
the people of this country, who have had
no opportunity to express any decided
views either for or against this most
important proposal, because it has been
before Parliament and before the country for a period of only three weeks.
I should be very glad to vote for the purchase of this railway if I felt assured that
the country would not suffer thereby. I am
not opposing the principle of public ownership but I submit that it is unwise and
injudicious for Parliament, and more particularly for this honourable House, to come
to any hasty conclusion on inconclusive
evidence; and therefore I think it would be
the part of wisdom for us, before committing the country to an expenditure of half a
billion dollars, which, when once done,
cannot be undone, to Stop, to Look, and to
Listen.
Hon. NATHANIEL CURRY: Honourable
gentlemen, when it was first rumoured that
the Government might take over the Grand
Trunk Railway system I was of the opinion
that it would be better to wait until the
present method of operating our Government railways had been tried out. But
when it became evident that the 'Grand
Trunk could not fulfil the obligations
entered into on account of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, and that the Government would
have to assume those obligations and
operate the non-paying portions of the combined system, I came to the conclusion that
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

the Government should take over the Grand
Trunk railway at this time, more particularly as the present Government system
is all length and no breadth, and sadly
lacks feeders. The Grand Trunk system
Will add breadth to the Government system,
and will supply the necessary feeders, thus
enabling the whole system te earn its fixed
charges. In addition, it will save enormous
sums in doing away with the duplication of
terminals, administration, train service,
printing, advertising, etc.
There does net seem to be any doubt as
to the value of the Grand Trunk property.
The greater'portion of its mileage is through
the richest and most thickly populated portions of Ontario and Quebec. The principal
objections to the acquisition of this road
seem to be based upon, first, a fear that
the Government would get into difficulties
with the United States Government over the
American mileage. If honourable gentlemen
will look at etatistics, they will see that the
United States ship to this country nearly
double the tonnage that we ship to
them, and that that enormous tonnage

over the Grand Trunk American mileage.
The American people are keen traders, and
they are net going to bite off their noses to
spite their faces; neither are they going to
throw any obstacle in the way of the operatien of the Grand Trunk mileage in the
United States se long as it enables them to
ship their goods to this country. As tirr ý
goes on, I think we shall find that, instead
of obstacles being placed in the way of
Canadians owning American mileage, that
will be encouraged. The United States want
their trains to run into Canadian cities,
and they want Canaditan trains to run into
American cities, and will afford every facility for the interchange of commodities between the two countries. We have in this
country over three hundred manufacturing
companies which are subsidiary to United
States companies; therefore I do net think
we need ever have any fear that the United
States will do anything to prevent us operating railways in their country. As a matter
of fact, as it is now, that mileage is owned
by British shareholders; and I think that
if there were to be any change the American
people would much rather that the people
of Canada should own that mileage than
that the people of Great Britain should.
Another objection seems to be a fear as to
the outcome of arbitration. That objection,
no doubt, was a sound one two or three

ample time to consider the question, when
we have been given information which is
not now before us, that it will not he their
duty and my duty to support the purchase
by the Government of the Grand Trunk
railway. But what I say to this House with
all earnestness is that, having in mind the
financial position of the country, knowing
as I do that at this moment we do not
know ýthe maximum amount of our national
debt, knowing as I do that we have unsettled
liabilities in many -directions in connection with the war, great obligations with
regard to the settlement of the soldiers, and
in connection with many other great
national projects, it behooves the Senate
of Canada to hesitate well before it involves
our country in an expenditure such as is
represented by the purchase of the Grand
Trunk railway at this time.
I listened with a great deal of interest
to the address of the honourable the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) this
afternoon. I heard him dilate upon the
miles of railway, and the traffic arrangements anid the great business that bas
been done by the railways in Canada; but
I want to tell the honourable gentleman
that he bas not convinced me that the
experience which has followed public ownership and government management in the
United States is not going to follow us.
even when he bas a monopoly of the railway mileage that he says he wants to
obtain. If the people of the United States.
in spite of the energy and ability and
courage with which they adopted this
same project, determined to make it a
success, believing that it could be made a
success, made nothing but the abject
failure which they did, what right has an
honourable minister to assume that he can
make a success in Canada, rather than
the failure that the people to the south of
us made in their country.
When I went down to the United States
during the months prior to the taking over
of the railway system of that country, every
one was filled with enthusiasm over the
great project before the people, and confident of the great success which they were
going to achieve. They were going to have
lower freight rates, cheaper fares, better
railway administration; but what has
turned out to be the result? From the first
three months after they took possession of
the railroads until to-day, they have had
a miserable. broken-down system of railways. There is no man in the Union bold
enough to stand up and say that he wants
the Government to retain the management
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

or ownership of the railways of the United
States. There are no newspapers or magazines bold enough to proclaim the desirability of the people retaining them. And
yet our ministers would force us to adopt
a course which brought misfortune there,
and wi!] to us.
Look across the water, and see the experience that they have had in England;
see the experience that every country-with
the possible exception of Germany-has
had in the matter of the operation and
administration of Government railways.
Having in min(d the experience of others,
any man who comes to me and tells me
that I have to support Government ownership of railways in my country, bas to lay
his cards on the table, cards that will prove
that success will follow, before I will believe
one word that lie says; and this Government
has not, nor has any minember of it, ever attempted to do so.
It has been said that perhaps the experience cf the people in the United States
might not come to us. But our conditions
are similar and we have no reasonable
right to expect other results. In the first
place, over $600,000,000 more bas been taken
out of the people in the United States by
increased rates and fares in one year than
was the case under private ownership. They
have run behind alnost $400,000,000, and
there is not a public man in that country
to-day who will deny that the whole attempt
bas been an abject failure. If all the figures
'hat have been given with regard to the
National railways, the working out of the
interchange of commerce, and the possibility of utilizing what bas been described
as a rotten system which this House was
buncoed into buying, could be substantiated, I am not prepared to say
that I would not make the sacrifice
at some time in the future, at a fair
price, of buying the Grand Trunk railway;
but I say it is camouflaging the people et
this country to say that because they bought
the Canadian Northern they should be cru(fied and bound to the principle of buying
the Grand Trunk railway. What was the
story that came to this flouse with regard
to our obligation 'to buy the Canadian
Northern railway? In the first place, we
were in the midst of the war. There was
not a man or a woman in this country
who was not worried to death with the fear
of what might happen to this land, and
to our beys on the other side, and we did
what we could to carry on here until the
war ended and our boys came home. What
were we told when asked to buy the Cana-

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
dian Northern.? "11f yo-u do not buy the
,Canadian Northern your ban.ks and your
loan companies and your other rail-ways and
your municipal guarantees and every province ini the country will be ruined and your
national credit will go to the wail." The
-9ret thought that came to us. was that
we should be administering comfort to the
enerny, and, so far as I was concerned, that
was the one important consideration; and
when that thought came to my mind I said:
--No, if it la necessary, in order to save the
national credit of Canada, in order to proniote the well-being of the institutions of
this country, that we should keep up our
flags until this war je over, no matter what
may be the cost, I will vote in support of the
purchase of the Canadian Northern. But
what is the story that cornes to this House
and the country to-day? Ail danger of
German invasion is past; ail danger is past
of anything happening to the boys. We in
this Chamber are able to sit down and
quietly think out the business aspect of
this transaction; and with what are we
approached? With the saine story that we
heard before? No. No bankruptcy for Canada, no misfortunes for our country, no
ruin for any Canadian institution; but soins
stock-brokers and other persons from London corne here and say: " We owe you
some money; we cannot pay it; buy what
we have and let the price be fixed by
arbitration." I say, honourable gentlemen,
that the conditions are different-as widely
divergent as the pales. I say to these gentlemen: " You are not a band of philanthropisa; you are not a pdor, weak lot of peopie who need to be protected; you did not
build the Grand Trunk railroad for the
glory or the advantage of this Dominion
alone; you did it to make rnoney; you did
it in the saine spirit as other men have
invested in financial. institutions; you have
played the wrong horse, you have loat soine
money, and you cannot get it ail back; but
you owe us some money; we do not say
we wiil put you on the street if you do not
pay it, but we say to you, corne and ait
down at the table with us. You say you
have a good railroad; our miniater says we
have a poor one; let us see how we can
unite tbe two and save themn both, but, for
Heaven's sake-I appeal to this Senatedo not tie around the neck of generations
unborn in this country a noose that will
perbaps strangle the future financial wellbeing of this Dominion."
It rnay be that my picture is too black;
it rnay be that in the working out this
scherne rnay turn. out to be a auccesa. But
in the meantime what are we asked to do?

but if they make a failure-if their good
habits, their skill, and their good fortune
in handling the aiffairs of the cornpany
are flot any better than those of 4nrnc otiher
railroadocompanies on this continent-*-what
is going ta happen? This country at the
start will get no return on a billion and a
half of dollars wrung out of the people of this
country. Worse than that, we shall be at
the rnercy of the good judgment, the good
will and -the skill of these men, if we are
not to be face ta face each year with a
deficit. With rnoney which la needed te

-w-ould be a shame to see any chance taken
in the mariner which 15 indioated by this
proposition. I say, honourable gentlemen,
that I cannot face the possibility of that
happening until 1 have had every opportunity toestudy thià question.
No matter what may have been done by
Sir Robert Borden or sornebody else in England, I neyer heard of this as a live issue
in this country until the iast two or three
weeks. I heard rurnors that there was talk
about the purchase of the Grand Trunk, but
nohody tald us anything about the detaile.
I heard there were sorne atock-brokera here

on to a great national blunder? Only then
he said the Grand Trunk Railway would
bear the burden, whereas to-day neither ne
nor any one else shows us how or who is
going to pay the bills.
I regret, like my honourahle friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholls), that on this
occasion I am obliged to disassociate iyself
fromi
men with whoms I have no quarrel,
and with wion I have no disagreemsent on
any principle of policy or anything else
except the purchase of the Grand Trunk
railway. I regret it particularly because
this proposaIl comses before ie and before
this House at a time when a man whom I
love and whons I have placed on a pedestal
above any othser living Canadian as having
accomplished greater things for Canada
than any other living man is ill and absent.
But my duty to myself and my children,
ny duty to nsy province and my country, is
te represent their feelings lsonestly when I
can agree with them, and te say to the
Senate of Canada that the people whom I
represent, the people in the district of
Montreal, and in the province of Quebec,
do net understand this question. Those who
do understand the proposal do not approve
of it, but are bitterly opposed te it. If that
is the case, wby should we not wait? Who
is going te be hurt? Why should we ignore
the great province of Quebec? We shall
meet in three months, and when we do the

Minister of Labour, will not have gobbled

knows, whether he says so or net, that the
situation will be exactly what it is now. We
shall say to the president of the Grand
Trunk Railway: " Put down in writing what
it is you are selling this country and what
assets you have. " We should inquire
of the President and the Government at
Washington vhat they are going to say
when we own thirty-five railroad corporations within the limits of the United States.
But my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Curry) said that we had a great many interests in the United States and they had
a great many here. To own a pulp-mill· or
a large factory in another country is quite
different froms controlling transportation in
that country. If you get into trouble with
the people of that country or have any
inisunderstanding with them, or if some
Gernian or other citizen of their country
wants to find fault with, or complain of
what you do, the case is far different. I
say that one of the first things that should
have been put before this House was a
declaration of policy on the part of the
authorities of the United States that they
were not going to oppose the procedure
whicli we propose te adopt. For mvself, I
should view with alari -I shsould not permit if J could prevent-Japan or France or
the United States
buying a railroad
that ran into Halifax or Vancouver
and controllin miles and miles of railway
in our country. I should object to that.
I do not know that the United States will
object. The good will wbich exists between the two couitries to-day mayv enable
us to secure from' themî approval of this
proposal. If they do approve, let us consider it; let us know the value of what
we are going to get; let us know iii dollars
and cents what will be the total saving in
operation, and the assets whici the Minister of Labour bas described; and tien let
the Government coie before the Senate
in three months' time and tell us the
whole story. Put your cards on the table,
and if it is in the interest of Canada at
soine future time to buy the Grand Trunk,
I will vote for it. But, because I think it
is not at tiis tine in the interest of Canada
te vote for this purchase as it lias been
laid before this House, I shall vote against
tie project as submitted and in favour of
the amendment of the honourable senator
from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross).
Hon. GEORGE GORDON:
Honourable
gentlemen, it was not my intention to say
anything upon the subject to-nigbt; but
when a res-ponsible minister of the Crown
rises in this House and tells us that the

NOVEMBEIR 5, 1919

eastern lines of the Canadian National rail-

ways are only a joke, and particularly since
I was one who su.pported the Gavernment
in acquiring that "joke," I think it is time
for us to conisider very serieusly what it
is proposed to impose upon this country
at the present time. If the eastern uines
of the Ganadian Northern railways are a
joke to-day, than they were a worse joke
the day we acquired them; for I undarstand that this year we have spent u-pon
those roads, not only the eastarn, but also
the western one, over $85,O0O,000. Therefore I arn safe in assumning that many millions cf dollars have b-een spent on thase
eastern lines. Now we are tod iA is only
a joke. If I had been told that it wa-s only
a joke before I voted for the acquisition
of that line, my vote would have been
placad differently. ls the present proposai
a joke? If At is a joke, I want to say to
you that se far ais I can see it will cent
us a great deal more than bal!f a billion
cf dollars. Wa are asked to buy something
and we are not told the puice or the terme.
We are told that the Grand Trunk is bankrupt, and then some persen rises and tells
us what a valuable asset it is. This alona,
in my opinion, is enough te make us pause
and wait until we gat sufficiant information
about the deal te allow us te form a fair
judgment.
Lat me point eut te you Just a
few figures. I give you these because
they have net yat been referred te
by any parson her-e this avening. Take.
thé general statement o! assets and liabilities as shown at pages 38 and 39. 'There
is given, aniong- currant assats outistanding,
one item of 643,0W0000. When I first looked
at that item I naturally thought that these
ware assets which would be available te
help te diseharge seme of the liabilities.
A statement of the assats was given in
anethar place, and to, my surprise oe et
the items read eut was ýsome $8,000,000
advanced te the Central Vermont. That
was given as a current asset. In my
opinion, that asset is just as much. a fixture
as a rail in the Central Vermont read.
Anothar current asset was ever $14,000,000
advanced te the Grand Trunk Pacific. In
the whole total et the $43,000,000 there is
net, I venture te. say, ovar $3,000,000 that
ehouild ha classed as current assets.
When we find that there is sucli a deficiency in the information hefore us, when
we have net before us the right accounts,
is net, that alone a strong reason why there
should be a delay in order that we may
obtain information as neairly correct as

281

possible-within a few million dollars at
least-about the li'ability which wiIl be
ëaddled upon us in the event. of Our
acquiring this system of road? We do flot
aven know the terms on whieh. a certain
portion of the stock is to be arbitrated
upon. We could not possibly expect to
know what that is going to cost; but 1 say
that part of the terms of this bargain, just as
mu-ch as if we w*ere paying it te the stockholders, is the amount of inoney that will
have ýo be expended to put the system in
condition; and iAwas stat-ed in the DraytonAcworth report of 1917 that, the deferred
expenditur-es at that time amounted to over
$51,000,000, qnd we have reason to believe
that to-day the delerred expenditures are
millions of dollars more than they were
then. The Minister of Railwayis stated in
my hearing that no examinatien had been
made of the road recently, and therefore
the department was not in a position to
know what expenditure would be necessary
in .putting the road into condition. This
afternoon in this Hou-se, the Minister of
Labour read a report by Mr. Mountain,
an engineer of the Railway Commission,
in which he statýed that he had spent two or
three days only last month in going over
a certain portion o! the road, -and he found
that that was in good condition. Upon such
a report as that we are expected to pass
judgment on thiýs great railway system.

ask you, honourable gentlemen, is that a
matter of smail moment to this countryP I
have been trying henestly and with ail my
might to flnd out, ever sînce this question
has been brought up in the other House,
what our liabilities would be outside of the
arbitration value which. may be put upon
the stock, but up to date I have not been
ibIa -to find that out. It seems to me that
we wîll be assu -ming a liability of $535,000,000 at laast, exclusive of whatever the
arbitration award upon the stock may be.

282

SENATE

It is safe for me to assume that the liability
altogether will be nearer $600,000,000 than
$500,000,000. Do you not think it is a reasonable proposition that we should know,
within six or seven or eight or ten million
dollars, about what the liability will be?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I point out
to the honourable gentleman that the information is clearly set forth on page 1443
of the Commons Hansard of October 27.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What is it, then?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I haven't it before me, but the information is there.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Does the honourable
gentleman remember within ten or twelve
or fifteen million dollars what it is?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was just drawIng the honourable gentleman's attention
to the fact that it was on record.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I believe I have read
what the honourable gentleman refers to,
and, as near as I can come to it, the figures
are what I stated a while ago-something
between $500,000,000 and $600,000,000, perhaps $535,000,000.
Now, let me say that I have the same
sympathy for the shareholders of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company as I have for the
shareholders of any other company, no more
and no less. The officers of their company
entered into a contract with the Government
of the Dominion of Canada with their eyes
open. I was one of those who very much
approved of the stand which the Opposition
took at that time in trying to persuade the
Government not to go on with the deal.
However, the contract was made.
The
Grand Trunk Railway Company shouldered certain obligations. they became
endorsers, as it were. Now they are
squealing and seeking to get away
from their obligations; they are even
whining; they are even going so far
as to say that if the Dominion of Canada
does not treat them extremely generously
we shall be precluded from going over to
England for any funds or loans that we
may seek later on. I for one do not beiieve
that there is anything in that at all, and
I believe that the Dominion of Canada
to-day should ask them to carry oût their
contract.
Some of my honourable friends say they
are bankrupt and oannot pay anything.
Weli, if they are bankrupt and cannot pay
anything, that would end it. But if they
are bankrupt, how is it that under this
proposed agreement the first thing whieh
the Government of the Dominion of CanHon. Mr

GORDON.

ada proposes to do is to guarantee the payment of £12,500,00G of their guaranteed
stock at the rate of 4 per cent-in other
words, placing that in the position of being
worth, if not now, at least within a very
short time, $60,000,000. That is not all:
the debenture stock is going to be
guaranteed, $155,000,000 more of debenture
stock is going to be guaranteed, part at 5
per cent, and part at 4 per cent. For the
life of me, I cannot see that a company
that owns assets like that is bankrupt. If
they are, and if the debenture stock is
worth that money, I say that what the
Government should do is to present a Bill to
the Grand Trunk railway for the amount
of money which the Government claim they
owe to Canada, and should demand
payment; and if they do not pay their
obligations, then it is not for me to suggest what should be done to them, but it
is for the Government which is .at present
controlling the affairs of this country.
This is not a time when Canada can afford
to be over-generous. This is the time
and there will always be a time-when
Canada can afford to be just. If we are
just with the shareholders of the Grand
Trunk railway, and give them the same
justice which they would mete out to us
if we were in their place, then no fault
can be found with Canada.
The heavy obligations with which we

Trunk Pacific Bill was

introduced in the Lower Chamber, we were
led to believe that our finances were in
such shape that we could not undertake
any new work of develctpment for some
time; we could not even proceed with some
of the ones which we had undertaken: but
alil at once, at the drop of the hat, we
became rich, richer than ever we were,
so rich that we need hardly consider the
kind of bargain that we were going to get
so long as we could acquire this road by
arbitration. I never yet knew a business
man to purchase anything by arbitration,
but I have known many of them to arbitrate rather than go into the courts. I
never knew of any person arbitrating
when he was going to make a purchase,

note, I was made to take care of it when
it became due if he did not.

earn themn or not, because we set a value $30,000,000 were paid by the holders o!
upon it by the offer we made to the Grand that stock, years snd years ago, and iA
Trunk Railway -Company. By a letter has gone into the treasury of the Grand
signed, I1 think, by Mr. Meighen when hie Trunk Railway Company for the building
was in England, we ofiered, for the gua- of this rosd and to provide facîhities for the

SENATE
people of Canada; and if there is no limitation binding the arbitrators to a maximum
figure, we may be muleted for a certain
amount of dividends on that common stock.
And, as the honourable gentleman from
Middleton (Hon. Mr. Ross) has stated,
prospective value may be taken into
consideration when the arbitrators are
preparing their award. In fact, it was
prospective value which permitted the
arbitrators in the case of the Canadian

Northern to decide upon $10,000,000. Surely

it was not the actual earning capacity of
the Canadian Northern, for we know what
its situation was last year and what is its
situation to-day and what the situation will
be next year. The valuation was not based
on the earning capacity? On what was it
based? Its prospective value; the hopes
of the country for its development; the
buoyancy of a young, progressive country.
Cannot the sane ,arguments be advanced
regarding the Grand Trunk Railway Company? I say that if prospective value is
one of the considerations in valuing this
stock, and if no maximum figure is stated,
we must not be surprised if something is
given to the holders of the common stock.
I woul-d draw honourable gentlemen's
attention to another feature. They will have
noticed that not only the Grand Trunk
Company,
but
also
the
Grand
Trunk Pacific Company, will be valued,
and it will be the contention of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company before the arbitrators that the Government has full value for
its money, that the Grand Trunk Pacifie has
cost all the money which is shown there in
the books of the company, and that it
could not be reproduced at this moment for
the sane amount; and that is true. And
the Grand Trunk Railway Company will
make the argument that they do not owe the
$97,000,000 since the Government has the
railway. Of course, it will be said: " But
look at the operation; look at the deficit. "
The same thing could have been said of the
Canadian Northern. Bt the Grand Trunk
gilway will show the possibilities of the
West, and honourable gentlemen only need
to read the letter of the President of the
Grand Trunk, Sir Alfred Smithers, who
gives all the arguments that will militate
in their favour when they come before the
arbitrators.
Now, honourable gentlemen, if this arbitration were to be held between private
parties, I ask you if it would not be extremely difficult to value those railways
and those stocks, more especially if prospective value is to enter into consideration?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

How can the arbitrators set a limit to our
possibilities? I will draw the attention of
this Chamber, in order that you may understand the situation which confronted the
arbitrators when they examined the value
of the Canadian Northern, to the faet that
the Canadian Northern stock had not
brought a cent to the Canadian Northern;
but it was handed to Mackenzie and Mann
for the services which they had rendered
while they were building the road. Mackenzie and Mann, when the Government
loaned them the last $40,000,000, bound
themselves in writing-and the document
has been read here in this Chamber, and is
in the statute-bound themselves not to
claim one cent, if there were default, for the
services they had rendered; so the arbitrators had in hand stock of the Canadian
Northern that had not brought a cent to
the Canadian Northern, that had been given
for services that Mackenzie and Mann had
bound themselves not to claim anything
for; and yet $10,000,000 were granted. If
this arbitration had taken place between
two private parties, I ask you, would $10,000,000 have been granted? Nothing would
have been given to Mackenzie and Mann,
because nothing was due in law or in
equity, and no arbitrator would have felt
before his conscience that he could rob
Peter to pay Paul. But this was a case
between private interests and public interests; and so it is in this case.
I venture the opinion that we shall be
mo.st lucky if we escape paying dividends
on the common stock. We have a claim of
$97,000,000 against the Grand Trunk Railway Company. The Grand Trunk obligated
itself to pay for the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
The coimmon stock amounts to $115,000,000. I am quite clear in my mind that we
shall be made to pay upon the preferred
stock of $63,000,000 a dividend of 4 per cent,
amounting to another $2,500,000. We have
already bound ourselves to pay $2,500,000 on
the guaranteed stock; and these two make
$5,000,000 which will be slightly less than
the minimum amount asked by the Grand
Trunk in its letter to the Government,
where they claimed £1,163,000. My conviction is that we shall be very lucky if we
escape paying dividends on the common
stock, through the fact that we have $97,000,000 to offset against $115,000,000 of conmon stock.
Now, I ask, will that award improve our
position? " Unthinkable, " says the Minister of the Interior, as to the idea of relieving
the Grand Trunk of its Grand Trunk Pacific
liabilities. Not only are we doing that, but

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
we are relieving it of all its liabilities, and
aasuring its stockholders of their dividends
in perpetuity.
We are capitalizing the
hopes and dreams of tiose stockholders,
and are binding the country te pay interest
when we can least afford it. Previously the
Grand Trunk railway shereholders had to
earn that dividend. This will no longer be
necessary. They were partners in the conpany, with all the risks that title implies, now they become state creditors;
and yet, honourable gentlemen, this is
but the smaillest, the most insignificant
part of the obligations which the Government assumes. 'Jhese are but marginal
liabilities, as Sir Thomas White called
them. Our fear, based upon experience, is
that under government control and management the income will shrink and the
expenditure increase. By the Drayton-Acworth report we have been told that on
capital account alone $51,000,000 are needed
forthwith. We assume all the risk, the increased cost of operation, the increase in
wages and material, in financing on capital
account and in meeting deficits when they
occur; and we do that, honourable gentlemen, to my mind absolutely uselessly. It
is dlear in my mind that we, are not freeing the Grand Trunk Railway Company
from any obligation towards the Grand
Trunk Pacifie Railway Company. We are
freeing the Grand Trunk shareholders from
all troubles for the future, but we are burdening the Exdchequer of the Dominion of
Canada with untold amounts.
But it is said: "We see no other alternative." One of the ministere in the other
Chamber said, "Show us any other alternative, and if it appeals to our judgment
we will consider it." Well, I have given a
little consideration to this matter. The
Government says we need terminals in the
East, and that it will cost us $100,000,000
if we do not get the Grand Trunk and its
terminals. We need the Grand Trunk system in the East te balance up our large
-system in the West; we need it in order
te obtain return freight in the East for
our trains which will come burdened wit'h
freight from the West. Now, I put te myself this question, and I put it te you,
honeurable gentlemen: Cannet we get all
that without purchasing the Grand Trunk
Railway Company? In a certain sense, do
"we net hold the whip-hand? Are we net the
creditors of the Grand Trunk Railway Company? Is net the Grand Trunk Railway
Company to-day euing forHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Mercy.

287

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will net say
mercy, but forHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Charity.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Delay.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At all events,
for assistance. I claim, honourable gentlemen, that the Government, in the position
which it occupies, can. obtain from that
company the use of its terminals and satisfactory traffic arrangements for interchange
of freight. The Minister of the Interior
dismisses the idea, and says it is not feas'ible. In the same breath he admits that
he is net a raillway man; and, admitting
t'hat he is not a railway man, he relies
upon the Drayton-Acworth report. Well,
honourable gentlemen, in the investigation
which took place before the Drayton-Acworth Commission there were but two railway men, Mr. A-cworth and Mr. Smith.
Sir Henry Drayton was net a railway man.
-He was a barrister, a legal gentleman. He
was the chairman of the Railway Commission of Canada, and as the head of
that commission he stood as the legal element of that commission. There were but
two practical railway men concerned in
making that report, Mr. Acworth and Mr.
Smith, and Mr. Acworth is the only person who suggests the purchasing of the
Grand Trunk. Mr. -Smith dissents from
him, and suggests rather a 'working arrangement between the Grand Trunk system and the Canadian Northern system.
If you will but read that report you will
find that we have there two railway men
in contradiction, and one, who is a man
of no mean stature in The railway world
of the United States, Mr. Smith, who knows
our conditions better than Mr. Acworth,
suggests a working arrangement between
the Grand Trunk system and the Canadian Northern.
My honourable friend the leader of the
Liberal party in this Chamber-whom I do
net call the leader of the Opposition, because I cannot admit that there is an official Opposition in the Senate-has cited
a letter of Mr. Kelley, which I will read
again, because it establishes that net only
does Mr. Smith, the arbitrator, but also
the Grand Trunk itself, think that it can
enter in-to a traffic arrangement with the
Canadian National railways te the mutual
advantage of both parties. Mr. Kelley says
in a despatch te the vice-president of the
railway, Mr. Scott:
Take foflowing message personally to Sir
Thomas White:-

SENATE

,On my arrivai in London I informed tha
Chairman and Board that in an interview with
you just before I left I drew the conclusion
that you would be willing to consider proposal
looking to the Grand Trunk working with the
Canadian Government railways In place of the
Government proposai to purchase. I have accordingly suggested to the Board that the Government should take over Grand Trunk Pacifie
railway and the Branch Lines Company, repaying to the Grand Trunk all indebtedness, and
that Grand Trunk should enter into a traffle
agreement with the Government by which
Grand Trunk should become the eastern connection of the Canadian Government railways
and the Canadian Government railways should
become the western connection of the Grand
Trunk, interchanging at North Bay; Grand
Trunk to operate at cost ail the eastern lines
of the Canadian Northern railway; Grand
Trunk to undertake to spend upon improvements and additions to its terminals and other
facilities such portion of the money owing by
the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway and Branch
Lines Company, which would be repaid by the
Government and which might be necessary for
the efficient handling of the combined through
business. This plan would enable the company
to continue operation of its American lines and
secure all of the advantages therefrom both to
the company and to Canada by reason of the
control and movement of international conpetitive traffie over its lines and througi
Canada."
Howard G. Kelley.
Sir Thonas White answered:
Repl3ing your message recelved through
Sott, your conclusion respecting our interview
entirely unwarranted. Stop. Proposal made
in your cable cannot be entertained.
In not jumping at the offer as it was
imade. Sir Thomas White was quite rigbt.

But J say that there was in that offer a
basis of negotiation which could have terminated in a working arrangement which
would have been to the advantage of this
country, which would have given the
western system o.f our Canadian National
railways feeders in the East, without the
assumption of one dollar of responsibility
for the administration of that vast system.
I ask you, honourable gentlemen, why
should not that experiment be tried? It
is not yet too late. We would gain under
that arrangement valuable experience, and
we would still be free to take ýanother step,
this other stelp which is proposed in this
Bill, if we ever decided that it was proper
to take it. I ask you, honourable gentlemen, you who with me will remain hereunless the farmers, one day, abolish us, as
that is in their programme-to the end of
our lives, I ask you to pause before taking
that fatal step and ask yourselves if we
should thus prejudge the future. You are
all aware, honourable gentlemen, that if we
go .forward this week, and pass this Bill,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

and purchase the Grand Trunk railway and
bind ourselves to these liabilities, present
and future, and to the payment of dividends, we cannot retrace that step;
whereas,, if you ask the Government to try
the other experiment of a, traffic arrangement, you remain free to act otherwise later
on. If you buy the Grand Trunk to-diay you
cannot, I repeat, retrace that step.
Now, if we do fail in governnent ownership and government administration, what
does the honourable leader of the Government propose, and, what does the honourable Minister of Labour propose? They say:
"If we do fail, we shall have rounded out
our system in the East by taking over the
Grand Trunk. While we may meet with
failure and all that it implies, we shall be
able to turn to the United States financiers."
My honourable friends, of course, turn to
the nearest neighbour for help. They turn
to the United States, or to financiers abroad,
and they say: "We shall present them with
a splendid proposition-although it will have
the stamp of failure upon it-we shall offer
them this system, which will have cost us
so many hundrede of millions on capital
account and on operation, and we will invite bid:s from .the world." The honourable
gentleian first proposes to destroy this corporation, this vast organization, a British
concern which bas moral and material support on the other side, in order to try his
government experiment. If he fails, he will
then look about for a new syndicate to take
hold of the mess the Government will have
put this country into. I say "mess," because my honourable friend s'peaks of the
possibility of failure. Is this a reasonable
position for Canada to take? Here we have a
complete organization, which was a pioneer
organization in Canada, and which did
fairly well until the war. We throw that to
the wind; we disinterest the members of
that organization who are on the other side,
and who have taken risks and are ready to
continue and carry on. Remember, honourable gentlemen, thait 'this corporation is now
a going concern, and if we are led by our
experiment into financial difficulty, we shall
have to look to newcomers who may bring
in their credit and some cash, but who will
have no exiperience; whereas we have that
whole organization to-day. I say, honourable gentlemen, we should pause before deciding to take that fatal step. You will be
here for a number of years; the members
of the House of Commons will disappear.
You may be held responsible for an act
whicb nmay be deemed rash to-morrow if we
fail.

there will be an addition of $200,000,000 to
the debt. Both Mr. Boville and Sir Thomas White stated that another loan would
be needed, anid I may say that, according
to the calculations which Mr. Boville
makes, it will be $500,000,000 that we shall
have to borrow next year. So there is an
additional $700,000,OO to add to the two billions, upon which we shall have to pay
the yearly interest.
Sir Thomas White, before the House of
Commons Committee on Soldiers' Civil Reestablishment, said that we had reached
the extreme limit of our financial capacity.
Remember his words, honourable gentlemen: " the extreme limit of our financial
capacity." Can we with a light heart assume this present huge liability? I put to
you t'hat question, honourable gentlemen.
The interest on our debt in 1913 was $13,000.000; it is now, according to Sir Thomas
White, $155,000,000, if you add the $40,000,000 in pensions. Antd this is the debt exclusive of our commitments for the present year, and of our railway deficit.
J must apologize for the length of my
speech.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Go abead.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: It lis very interesting.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen have received ithe "Addendum to
Votes and Proceedings No. 43," which has
been distributed to this Chamber, and
which contains the fourth and final report
of the special committee of the House of
Commons on Bill 10, an Act ýto amend the
Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment Act. In that report I find the statenient of Sir Thomas White. Honourable
gentlemen, we shall have to find, over and
abové the amtount which this country produced in taxation in 1913, $200,000,000 a
ear. Where 'shall we get that money?
The question is put to Sir Thomas White,
as yn will see at page 88:
Q. What have been our main sources of revenue, Sir Thomas?-A. The main sources of
,e "nue h-v h-n the customs. inland revenue,
rest office, and. since the war, the income tax
ani the business profits' tax.
n. Broadly sneaking. how does our incom'
tax compare with the income tax in the United
States?-A. My instru-tions were-and I think
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

they were carried out- to put it exactly on the

same basis.
higher a year ago, then I think it was reduced.
I was informed by experts of my department
that our tax is on all fours with the tax of the
United States. Personally, I have held the view
that it would be a mistake to make it materially
higher.
Q. Why?-A. For two reasons. In the first
place if it was materially higher I think it
woild have some influence on people coming into
this country, especially business people to establish industries, and further I think if it was
materially higher we should lose some people to
the United States. Then another thing is thisthis is not generally known with regard to the
income tax-we are in quite a different condition
to England with regard to the income tax. We
have in our Federal system provinces and municipalities, some of which raise part of their
revenue by income tax, for example in Britisli
Columbia there is a very heavy provincial tax,
there is the municipal tax and the Federal tax.
There are three sets of taxes imposed upon income taxpayers in British Columbia. In Nova
Scotia the Provincial Government brought in an
income tax for this year, there will be added on
a Federal tax, and therefore they have two sets
of taxes there. In the province of Ontario a
man pays income tax to the city. My own view
is that all the provinces and many of the municipalities will be obliged to resort in a greater
degree to the income tax, because their requirements are going to be heavier. I had nany
requisitions made to me from time to time by
Provincial Government for increased subsidi"s
and sometimes the question was raised as o
why we should invade the field of income taxation. But it was necessary, and our income
tax to-day, answering your question, Mr. Chairman, is I think upon all fours almost precisely
with the American income tax.
And he states that it would be in his
opinion imprudent ýto increase that incone
tax. Now, as to the business profits tax,

at page 90 the following question is put to
him:
Q. Would -there be any objection, in your
judgment, to increasing the Business Profits
Tax so as to raise the moneys required?A. The Business Profits Tax could not be raised,
and personally I have grave doubt whether it
can he continued over any considerable time
without grave damage to the trade of the
country.
Q. For what reason?-A. Because the limiting
of business to a certain percentage in the first
place discourages enterprise from coming into
Canada, and in the second place tends to prevent
merchants and manufacturers from creating
reserves with which to extend their business,
especially extensions. It came to my attention
many times during the war that concerne would

establish in Canada but for our Business Profits

Tax; they are afraid of it; and this being a
country that invites immigration and business
enterprise I always thought that we should have
regard to that fact and to our future in the
imposition of our taxation.
My own view is that with the declining
p'ofits-and they are bound to decline : they are
declining-the income tax will provE in the
case of most companies, to b, larger thqn the
Business Profits Tax ; in other words, it will
si to speak, automatically ro out. It has yielded a very large amount of money. The last time

NOVEMBER 5, 1919
I inquired I think it was $75,000,000 or $80,000,000. When I imposed it I estimate.d that it
would realize $30,000,000 in three years; it
raised about three times that amount, I think.

So you have the opinion of Sir Thomas
White as to the possibility of financing that
amount by increasing the income tax,
which he says is inadvisable, or the business profits tax, which he says should be
reduced rather than increased.
At page 96 he is asked the following question:
Q. It has been suggested that in order to
raise the revenues to carry our national debt
and other expenditures including money expenditures that may he incurred along the line
you have been discussing that a generai land
tax on ail property in Canada might be advisab'e. What is your view as to that?-A. Welil,
that is a question of course of poliry for the
Gove-nment, and many considerations are in1
v9 ved. We have a vexy large country from the
Atl'ntic tu the Pacific. The cost of organization
and administration would necessarily be very
heavv. unless you had an assessment by the
Dominion of all the land, there would have to
be an adjustment of assessment as between
provinces, and even as between parts of provine-s. That is if you adopted the municipal
assessment there would have to be an adjust-ent, so far as the assessment is concerned.
The Government would have to levy upon that
se many mills unon the dollar. I thought about
a tax of that kind. I am speaking from memory,
but T think four mills would have given about
$20,0.00.000 only.
Q. Some person quoted figures as coming
from Mr. Crerar that a ten mill rate would
rase $80,000,00,0?-A. Weil
the
Government
would have to consider the expediency of such
a tax. In the first place you have already a
municipal tax on land. I do not know whether
there are any provincial taxes direct upon the
land, but it has always been represented to
me by provincial authorities with whom I have
discussed the matter that a tax upon land
shoujd be essentially a municipal or provincial
tix.

Then further on:
Q I understood him to suggest a ten mi,1 rate
on the unearned increment?-A. Oh no.
Mr. Morphy: He put it as a tax on unimproved land values.
The Witness: No, he would get no such thing.
One feature of any tax, and I think especially
of land tax, is that we are only going te be
able to meet our national obligations by increasing the production of Canada, among other
means by increasing immigration. I do net think
any scheme of taxation in Canada should be
seriously considered unless we have regard to
the probable effect on Immigration, and it ls for
the Government tu consider what taxation they
rhnH adopt with reward to land. We must get
into this country men who will go on the land
and increase our production, we must get as
many of our ovn people who are net on the land
no'v as "e can to go on the land and we must
induce immigration to come in here and continue the policy of taking up land, If we do
not then we may have a rather serious condition in Canada in a few years from now.

'Thpn. at page 87 he says:
S-191

I believe that, notwithstanding
the heavy
burdens which we have incurred, with the policy of retrenchment-which I am sure will be
enforced on this country as upon other countries, and if will be a political issue in the next
year or two-that this country can carry on,
but It can only carry on if careful regard is
had tu its financial position. Just look at it from
several standpoints. The national debt of this
country before the war was something over
$300000,000-I think $335,00,0,,00,0. I estimated
in the Budget speech of this year-and I do not
think there is any room for doubt about the
matter-that by the end of this year our net
national debt will reach nearly $2,000,000,000,
which Ls six times as much as it was before the war. Then you have the question of our
revenue meeting our expenditure. I rwould like
te say that the limnit of taxation is reached, but
it is going to be quite a problem to adjust our
revenue to meet our ordinary experditures. I
look forward to deficits for some years. I can
hardly see how you are going to avoid them.
Now just by comparison try and realize what
is the difference in our situation. The interest
on our national debt, which is a fixed chare
upon the revenue of the country, I think was
under $13,000,00,0 in 1914. I estimated in the
Budget speech for this year it would reach
$11500000'0.
Q. The figure of $10.2,00.0,00-0 was given out
last night?-A. My Budget estimate was $115,0,00,0.00 because there is some additonal interest for th's year to come in. But supposing
it is $110,000,000.
Then you have pensions added on which we
did not have to pay in 1914. I do nut know
how much it will be this year, but the estimate
was that it would run up gradualIy to $40,000.000.

Then, there is the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishmentHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yet the
ex4Minister of Finance voted for the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, the exMinister of Finance voted for the Bill, and

he voted for the Bill because he saw only
marginal liabilities. He said it is true that
we assume $500,000,000 of liabilities, but
there are $500,000,000 of assets, and there
are the working expenses on the liabilities
side, but returns as well, and the deficits
represent nothing but marginal liabilities.
Now, you have here the statement of Sir
Thomas White that we are running close
to the wind, that we will have to meet deficits year after year. I ask you, honourable
gentlemen, if you think it is prudent to assume those marginal liabilities, which may

MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED.

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed for the second reading of Bill 33,
an Act respecting the acquisition by His
Majesty of the Grand Trunk Railway
system;

and

the

proposed

amendment

thereto of Hon. W. B. Ross.
Hon. JOHN S. MeLENNAN: Honourable
gentlemen, before proceeding to the phases
of the question to which I particularly wish
to call the attention of the House, it seems
to me it might be desirable to touch on
some of the points which were dealt
with in the long debate of yesterday.
The first of these is that I was somewhat
surprised, and I think possibly other members of the House were ýsurprised to find
that the leader of the Government said
that the Government of the day had a
mandate from the people of Canada to carry
ont this policy. Let us go back some distance in the history of Canadian railroad
enterprise.
The Government
of Mr.
Mackenzie was carrying out the building
of a road aeross the continent to which we
were bound by Confederation as a Government work.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If honourable
gentlemen would stop talking we could
hear.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: This Government
was overthrown and Sir John Macdonald
came into ýpower, and he proposed and
succeeded in carrying on that work by a

privately-owned company with results which
we know. The question then slnmbered,
there being nothing to bring it up until
1904.
Sir Robert Borden then went to the people
of the country on a cry of " Better a
government-owned railway than a railwayowned Government."
The result of that
election gave no evidence that the people
of Canada were in favour of government
ownership. The question then went back
to its slumbers and remained there until
1917.
In a crisis which I shall not further
describe, because it bas been, adequately
and clearly and well described by my
honourable colleague from Brome (Hon.
Mr. Foster), the people of Canada undertook under exceptional circunstances and

country as those of, I nay say, this continent, the attitude of the railroad magnate
was, " The public be damned.'' when the
rates were made with reference to what
the traffie would bear, when discriminations betweeii different shippers and
different places were commiion and were
in the ordinary course of carrying on business; whcn, unfortunately, in a great many
cases profitablei things in connection wit:h

owned by insiders, wlhen it was not unknown that insiders built Ibranches and sold
them to the parent coinmpany. I think it is
worth recalling that it was a Canadian railroad that was the pioneer in establishing
a new standard for the whole of this continent, namely, that all these things should
be owned and operated in the intcrests of
all tie shareholders, and not any particular
group of them. That was an antedeluvian
time when in the railway world, to iput it
briefly, the hand of every man w-as against
every other, and if you wanted to get traffic
for your road, to get a fair share of the
business, you had to get it with a club.
The flood which swept those conditions
away was made by the mingling of two
streams. One was the public indignation
against the injustice of the railway management to the public; and the railroads of
to-day, working under different conditions,
and different

railway fathers. 'Mingled with that flood of

in order to reduce the fixed cost of a
station they must get some other railroad
to use it. They found that tlhey could reduce the cost of tracks by letting them to
other railroads. They had the new conception of -w-orking in harmony, depending
for their business and for a fair return
upon giving better service-prompter, more
efficient and more careful service than the
rival. They felt that in that way they
would obtain the best advantage for their
own road. That co-operation as the Minister of Labour bas said is carried on from
one end of the country to the other. Every
railway in Canada exchanges traffie with
other roads. Whatever the good intentions
of the railway executive are, they are suppiemiented by the fact that legislation has
been passed to protect the interests of not
only the general public, but of one railroad against another.
In speaking of that new spirit in railroading and of the new practice, let me call the
attention of the House to the fact that there
is an Association of Railroad Executive
of America, of which, by the way, the
president of the Grand Trunk railroad, Mr.
Kelley, is a imember of the executive coinumittee. That executive controls 92 out off

lated recomimendations wlhieh were submuitted to a general meeting held in January

of the great railroads in the United States
recommended that the Federal Government,
in the interest of the public, should have
power: (1) to arrange for the distribution
and re-routing of business so as to prevent
congestion and blockade; (2) to arrange for
a fair distribution of cars between roads,
regions and shippers; (3) to arrange for
the joint use of terminals when owning
roads failed to agree; (4) to prevent -waste
and extravagance in the construction of
new roads, branches. expensive terminals
and duplication of facilities. That such
recommendations should come from the
heads of American railroads marks the
enormous change that has taken place in
the spirit of Aimerican railroads, in their

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
attitude towards each other and towards the
public.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow 'me to ask him a question? Is the adoption of those reoommendations to be a permanent arrangement?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: That is a recommendation for a permanent arrangement
made in January of this year. It was not
intended -as a war measure, but was the
permanent policy on which the American
railroads wish to carry on their business
in the future.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is that an outcome or result of the arrangement which
prevailed during the war?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I should think
it is very largely.
Well-known railway men had the experience of co-operation and found the
benefits of it during the war, and its advantages over the war against each other
and against the public, which their predecessors had earried on in the antediluvian
period to which I have referred. Consequently they are now willing to relinquish
those powers and to adopt co-operative
méthods.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would the honourable gentleman allow me to ask him
also, bas he compared those suggestions
with the regulations which were in force
in Great Britain during the war for the
management of all the railroads?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Yes. The English position was so different that sucli a
comparison would be a little difficult. You
may remember that I once -brought the
attention of this House to the matter; but
I cannot expect that to be remembered.
I referred to the way in which railroads
were managed. They were all taken over
by the Government at the outbreak of the
war. It had been previously arranged that
a committee of what would in America be
called railway executives should manage
those roads. They worked closely together,
each road retaining its own personnel, but
being directed ais to general policy by this
central committee of either ten or twelve
of the chief railway managers-superintendents, I think they are called in England.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: But was not that
exactly what was done in the United
States?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: It was donc in
the United States under a voluntary sys-

tem. The American railway administratian is still carrying on the operation of
the American railways, but I brought up
this point largely to .show the new spirit
and the new methods in harmony with it.
In this instance again, we do not need to
follow the precedent of the great country
to t'he south; for tbese things which have
been recommended by the American railway executive as desirable have all become law in Canada and are already bèing
carried out.
As we revised the Railway Act last year,
it is not necessary to any great exteni to
call the attention of this House to the
provisions contained in it, but let me refer
oriefly to sectirn 154. Directors may make
traffic agreements, may make agreements
for running powers, foi division of tolls,
for management and working, for joint
committees; and it is all under the jurisdiction of the board.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: That is, exchange
of traffic.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Looking also at
section 312 and succeeding sections one will
see the extraordinary powers given to the
Commission and to the companies along
these same lines. The companies must give
accommodation at all stations for carriage
and delivery; there must be no delay; they
shall furnish all proper appliances and all
other service incidental to exchange. The
board shall decide what proper and adequate accommodation is. The board may
regulate the time of arrival of trains so that
connection with other roads may be made.
The board may order specific works, inay
arrange for tolls, may arrange for demurrage, for the interchange of traffic between
connecting lines, for interswitching, for the
reciprocal duties of the companies and for
charges. 'The Act provides that equal tolls
are to be charged, that there shall be no
discrimination for or against a particular
person or company, or as between different
localities. Facilities for through traffic shall
be provided; there shall be no undue preference or discrimination or prejudice in
the allotment of freight cars. Connecting
railways must afford reasonable facilities.
Facilities shall be provided for the. junction of private sidings, branches, etc. Equal
facilities must be granted to express companies. :The board has power to determine
these matters, and the burden of proof
where discrimination is charged is on the
railway company and not on the private
shipper. If you turn again to the sections
on penalties you will see how severe the
penalties are. Moreover, those powers have

SENATE
been exercised in every department, and
exercised without protest. In the West and
in the East, the Railway Commissioners
have ordered that train services shall not
be discontinued, and in some instances that
they should be improved.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my hon
ourable friend permit me to suggest that
he might call attention also to section
3.36, which is very much to the point. It
deals with joint tariffs.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Yes; section 336
deals with joint tariffs, and the following
section provides for cases where companies
fail to agree.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Joint tariff refers
to any continuous route operated by two
or more companies.

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: With regard to
instances in w'hich these powers have been
exercised, I do not wish to weary the House.
There is case after case in the East and the
West where the Commission has regulated
the number of passenger trains.
Let
this instance regarding freight suffice.
A fruit-growing district in British Columbia
served by the Great- Northern's Canadian
lines founi its routi ng and its rates to
points in Saskatchewan circuitous and expensive, the road trying, as all roads (o,

aul over its

the Conodian Pacific railay, instcad of the
Grand Trunk Pacific; and tariffs for the new
service were ordered by the Railway Conmission. The power of the commission to
do this has not been questioned, and that
power

can he exercised

in

any case fron

the Atlantic te the Pacific where 'sbippers
can show tihat the public interest would
be served.
In harnony with this spirit and with
what is being done on Canadian lines froin
the Atlantic to the Pacifie, where comnion
stations and connon terminals are used,
every Canadian line in connection with an
American road can inake arrangenets for
co-operation w hich works out satisfactorily.
For example, the Canadian Pacifie railway
does net try to buy the Maine Central because it is- an important link connecting
St. John with Boston. The Grand Trunk
and the Canadian Pacifie both use the Boston and 'Maine in reaching Boston froin
Montreal. There seems to be a sort of
theory of balance of power in these matters.
A year or two ago, after the Delaware and
fIudson had connected for many years with
the Grand Trunk railway to Montreal, and
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN.

the Rutland road had New York connections
with the Canadian Pacifie, it was announced
that the Canadian Pacifie had secured the
Montreal connection of the Delaware and
Hudson railway. It looked to the outsiders
interested in railway matters as if the
Grand Trunk was being shut out; but before the date fixed for the establishment
of connections between the Delaware and
Hudson and the Canadian Pacifie, starting
frein Windsor street, the announcement
was made that the Rutland road was going
to connect with the Grand Trunk railway.
J am inclined to believe, although I have
no knowledge, that this was not in conteiplation when the Delaware and Hudson
established connections with tihe Canadian
Pacifie railway, but it was considered to
be in the interests of the general railway
policy that a great railroad like the Grand
Trunk should net Le shut out from New
York.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If the honourable
gentleman will allow me, I would say that
I had to do with that agreement with the
Delaware and Hudson, and, as 1e says,
there was no intention of shutting out the
Grand Trunk from the United States; the
agreement was merely made for the purpose of securing to the Delaware and Hudson the advantage of the terminals at
Montreal.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Well, I have to
withdraw that particular instance, and I
will net take the time of the House by finding another. Scores of instances are te be
found from the East over to the West.
I believe that a working arrangement is
possible between the Government railways
and the Grand Trunk. The honourable the
Minister of Labour said that the connection
with the Grand Trunk was a bad one, that
it was irritating, and to the disadvantage
of the Intercolonial railway. I have never
noticed in the trains running between the
Lower Provinces and Montreal that all the
delay occurred between Montreal and Ste.
Rosalie Junction. More than that, if an
arrangement of that kind with the Intercolonial railway, with the Government of
Canada behind them, cannot be worked out
satisf,actorily, when scores of railroads are
making similar arrangements which are
mnutually satisfactory, it seems to me that
that is a reflection upon officials of the
Intercolonial or the Department of Railways,
rather than an argument against any such
arrangement. A great part of my objection
to this Bill would have been obviated if I
could have been shown that the course pro-

NOVEMBER 6, 1919

posed was unworkable.
with the greatest interest, and with an open
mind, but I have not been convinced, because there are so many examples to the
contrary.
In addition to the points I have made,
there is also the other point that it seems
to me that the underlying principle of the
proposed purchase is Prussian. That is an
offensive epithet, but it is not applied in a
personal way. You cannot wound the feelings of a policy. Prussia, the dominant element in Germany for thirty or forty years,
made the most extraordinary advance in the
arts, in trade, in commerce, ever made 'by
a civilized people.
She was peacefully
penetrating the defences of her greater
rivals. Britain's mails were carried between ports by German ships all through
the East. There was not -a dominion, dependency or colony of the British Empire
where Germany was net increasing her
trade. She rivalled in Great Britain itself British ironmasters and manufacturers.
That condition caused alarm to every one
;ho observed the signs of the times; and
had Germany kept on as she was doing,
by the exercise of this peaceful penetration,
it is hard to say what in twenty years
more would have happened. But Germany
would not depend any longer on giving a
good return in goods, in accommodation,
in transportation, or whatever it might have
been, for what she received, thus increasing
her business. Germany made a great world
war, the consequence of which is that Germany and every other country will suffer
for generations, that she might illimitably
increase, as her blinded rulers thought, the
advantages that she had already gained.
She imperilled those and loest them, that
she might have absolute control, that she
might say, " You must not only govern
yourself as I say, but you must trade as
I will."
In the railroad world conditions were
different. The railroad world of America
fought; they tried a rule of domination and
trying to get control, all fighting with their
neighbours or friends. They found that it
did not pay, and took the course of cooperating and working together and depending, as Germany had in pre-war times, on
giving a first-rate service and getting what
they could for it-and, in the case of the
railroad, that meant getting what they could
under the regulation of law and under the
regulation of a railway commission.
It
seems to me that this proposal is
a mistake because it is going back.
The oniy point upon which it can

299

be reasonably and fairly established is that
by buying the Grand Trunk railway the
people along that railway who have goods
to send to points on the Canadian National
or the Grand Trunk Pacific will be forced
through that ownership to put up with an
inferior service. So much for that, whether
right or wrong. I have tried to be as right
as I could be fron whatever knowledge
I possess on this question.
Two of the gentlemen concerned in the
Drayton-Acworth report that has been so
often quoted, were railway men, and both
of them were against government ownership and regulation. Mr. Smith is the head
of a very great railway company in the
United States, a railway connecting with
Canadian roads, and he is familiar with
Canadian conditions. On page C11 of that
report he makes a suggestion, which is certainly not in favour of government ownership and government operation. Nor is Mr.
Acworth, except in the most modified form,
in favour of putting control in the hands
of the Government, and Mr. Acworth is by
repute the best informed man on railway
questions in the Empire.
There is another aspect to this question
which we in this House s'hould very carefully consider. It is a phase of the financial question, not that which bas already
been dealt with, but that as to the sources
of the revenue, which, as has been pointed
out over and over again, this country requires to get. For many years we went
along borrowing freely from the greatest
money market in the world. That market
is now closed to us. 'There is but one market now open outside of our own country-that 6f the United States-towards which
the eyes of every bo.rrowing nation, and
they are almost al the nations of the world,
are now turned. But the most wonderful
thing in the history of finance that has happened since people sacrificed their jewels
and most precious possessibns to serve a
country, has cccurred in Canada in the last
five years. Any Minister of Finance who,
in the s:pring of 1914, suggested thait an
internal loan of $50,000,O0 should be raised
in Canada would have met with nothing but
discouragement, and would have given rise
to the opinion that the was absolutely unfitted in his ignorance of conditions in
Canad-a for the position which he occupied.
To-day $2,000,O0,000 have been raised from
the people of Canada. I think l can fairly
describe that as a most astounding and
wonderful thing, first, that Canadia had the
money, and, second, that Canada so lavishly
poured it out to support the ýGovernment

of Canada in what it was undertaking and
in its splendid achievements in organizing
an] carrying out the wishes and desires
of the people. The ending of the war has
not stopped that. It has been said thit the
time of bringing this railway matter on was
inopportune on account of its effect on this
loan; but the people of Canada have risen
above their disappointnent in their patriotisim, and this loan promises to be as succesful as any of its predecessors.
But it seemis to me that the Government,
when it looks again to the people of this
country, and it must look again for further
sums of noney in enormous quantities, is
especially charged with the duty of se adiministering the funds confided to them,
and so spending the taxation that is raised,
that there will be no occasion for any one
to say that their administration is net
cautious, that it is not conservative, that
it is not thrifty, that the Governnment eibarks on anything which is expensive which
could be done, even at some inconvenience,
in a more careful and more thrifty way.
Do not let the Government of Canada chill
these generous iinpulses, these loyal and
patriotic impulses of the people of Canada
if it can possibly be avoided. It seems te
ie that haste in this railway iatter is one
of the things that nay- do great danage
along these lines.
There is another aspect whieh has been
referred to in this House by the leader of
the Governmient. It is known to all of us
froni one end of the country to the other
that this country politically may be on the
verge of a great change. If one reads the

we, the Parliamnent of Canada in 1919, are

where our debt is enormous, when we must

rash or ill-informed elements in the parliament of the future can well retort that in

by the motion which I am glad to be able
to support, whatever the results of the

Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Honourable
gentlemen, my views on the public ownership of railways bave been fairly well advertised, and not even the eloquent appeal
of the honourable leader of the House
yesterday has changed them. I was vor
much imoved by the letter froin the Prime
Minister, wo is away and ill, more ezpecially because in the early spring and
winter of 1911 the new.spaper of which I
am the proprietor was one of the few newpapers which gave him a loyal support.
Therefore it is after a long and I trut
honourable support that we have given the
Premier, that now I find I am in a position where I cannot altogether agree vith
liiiii on his policy.
In 1917 I voted in faveur of the ac-quiition of the Canadian Northern and possibly the public ownership of railwayS hv
the Canadian Government; but at hati
time the war was on, and it seemed te us
that there was a far greater issue at Stake
than the question of the governnent owner*hip of a railroad. We thought at fliat tiimîe
only one thing mattered, and that was the
winning of the war. Thank God, we bave
now wo¯n the war. Being in that position,

them in an entirely different direction. The
Minister of Labour, however, in making his
review of the situation, which was very optimiistic, was, I think, reviewing the situation from the standpoint of a ipractical railroad operating man. The Minister of Labour
is a practi-cal operating man, and necessarily, I assume, takes that view. The
operating man on a railroad has charge of
the rolling stock, the operation of the trains,
the movement of freight, and many other
things; so he represents a great part of the
management of the road. But, in supporting
the motion of the honourable member for
Middleton (Hon. W. B. IRoss), I would point
out to this honourable House that there are
two other factors, in the combination of railroad management, namely, the traffic department and the audit or finance department, and it seems to me that those two departments, which the Minister of Labour did
not touch on, are really more important in
this proposal. If the Grand Trunk is, as I
understand, in very good shape physically,
it is needlese for the minister te tel us
what he told us yesterday of the great advantages that would accrue te the government roads by acquiring this road. What
honourable gentlemen wish te know às how
the traffic is going to be affected by the
transfer of ownership froin private interests,
who have certain good-will with shippers,
ta government ownership, and also how
certain large expenditures that have possibly to be made are going te be financed.
These are questions which we have, I think,
reason and right te know about, and I aim
assured that the Grand Trunk has financed
itself for at least three or four montl'; se
no great harin will be done by delaying the
matter for a few months, and in the meantime inquiry can be made in order that honourable members may be un possession of
certain facts they wish to know about.
With regard te the expenditures te which
I have referred, there has been in 1progress
for a long time in the city of Montreal a
discussion between the oity and the Grand
Trunk railway as te elevating their
tracks at their terminals in that city. I
under-stand there is some agreement-in
fact, that the Grand Trunk must elevate
these tracks. The estimated cost is -anywhere froin $15,000,000 te $50,000,000. Now,
it is quite possible thaît Parliament might
make saime law that would proteet the Government, owning this railroad, from being
obliged to make this large expenditure in
Montreal, or it might be delayed. But a
similar condition exists, honourable gentlemen, on the lines running through Michi-

301

gan,, Illinois, Maine, Vermont, and other
states served by the roads now owned -and
o'perated by the Grand Trunk s'ystem. The
different cities throughout the states where
this road runs have made by-lawe that the
railro-ad must do away with what are known
as level crossings, and must elevate the
tracks or muet build communications under
the tracks. I think it woulid be very fair
in the course of the next few months,
before the next session, to ask the Minister of -Labour te find out thýe amount
of these expenditures and let us know in
order that we inight have some appreciation
of what it means te put the road in the
shape required by the by-laws of various
municipalities; and possibly the Finance
Minister 'could tell us how he is going te
get the money.
The Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) also informed us of the splendid facilities that the Canadian Pacific had for the
interchange of traffic by connections at a
number of points, which he named. He also
told us, as is s'hown in Hansard, at page 298,
that the Grand Trunlk had interchange connections for traffic with the Boston and
Maine at Portland, with the Maine Central
at Lewiston Junction, in Maine, and at
North Stratford, in New Hampshire. Well;
honourable members from Halifax and St.
John might very well get further information on this particular point. The most
valuable connection for the interchange
of trafflo the Grand Trunk system now
has, according to my information, is at
the International boundary, at Buffalo
and at Rouse's Point, the connections at
both places being largely for the interchange of traffic going te American ports
in preference te Canadian ports. The Minister of Labour; who comes 'from Ontario,
lives quite close te one of these interchange
points. If these valuable connections are
te be utilized, the traffic would naturally
go froin our Canadian West te the Niagara
frontier, instead of going te St. John and
Halifax. So I think that honourable gentlemen from St. John and Halifax might
very well give this a little thought, and
also consider if it would not he well to delay this Bill for a month or two se that
they might establish te their own satisfaction what the real effect of having these
connections will e.

merite or demerits of publie ownership or
private ownership, with or without government control. On a former occasion the
leader of the House gave us a ray of hope
when he said that if the inasure then
,advocated-one somewhat similar to this
-- were not successful, we might perbaps
after having failed to carry out the undertaking to the satisfaction of the Canadian
people, find a syndicate or a wealthy corporation to take it over. But after failure
on our part it mnight be difficult to find
any body of men willing to take it over on
as good conditions as we had before. However, even that ray of hope bas been dissipated by the letter from the Prime Minister, whose illness, I am sure, we all deeply
regret. He says in that letter, as I understood it, that this road will never he handed
over to a private corporation. After reading the letter, the leader of the Government repeated what he had said on a
former occasion. He said: "If we fail, we
cau advertise the road, and get financiers
in the United States or in England to take
it over." We are not concerned as to
where they come from, provided they take
our place, which I do not think any financiers, prudent ones anyw.ay, would think of
doing, because the roads making up this
system are already loaded down with debt.
I will not say whose fault it is, but they
are absolutely water-logged to-day, and it
will take them all their time to meet the
charges of operation. As the honourable
gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) said last night, we shall be
very glad if these roads can be brought to
meet operating expenses, and if the taxpayers of this country shall only have to
be called on to provide for the interest on
the bonds and to pay for the betterments.
Money will be needed for the betterments
at all times, which will mean an increase
of capital, and again we shall have to go
to the taxpayers of this country. It will
not be pleasant to have to ask the people
of Canada for that money when these betterments and improvements are to be made in
a foreign country.
We miglit discuss the merits or the
demerits of private or public ownership

of them, particularly of late years, have
been circulated widely. I iust say at
once that there are many good things in
publie ownershiip: I do not deiy that.
Hon, M1r. CASGRAIN.

Certainly, if we had started with public
ownership, we would not have such duplication as we have to-day. As the Minister
of Labour said yesterday, "'You would not
have had the two parallel lines running
between Winnipeg and Edmonton-one
straight and one crooked." There would
be only one line. Then, too, between the
city of Montreal and the city of Ottawa we
have three railways running. with no end
of trains. I think there are many railways
running between important points in the
United States or between important points
in England, any one of which lias as much
business as our three roads. I leave that
question to the Minister of Labour, who
seems to be an expert. I am sure that
between Philadelphia and New York there
are single railwy lines doing more business than our three put together. But
what are we going to do now that we have
them? It is too late to prevent that duplication. The roads are built, and industries
and settlenents have been established
alongside of them in good faith. After all,
the very warp and woof of our national life
is politics, and you cannot take a railway
away because it duplicates another. There
are very few railroads that run from one
important point to another important point
without touching at various different intermediate points. Therefore this argument as
to duplication must be banished from the
discussion. We have got the duplication,
and we have to make the best that we can
of it.
There are inany other good features about
public ownership which it would take too
long to discuss adequately. The question
that we have to consider to-day is the railway situation in Canada, in the light of
population and the extent of our mileage.
We have heard much about the DraytonAcworth report. The gentlemen who made
that report say that we have over 40,000
miles of railway. Think of it: 40,000 miles
of railway for 7,500,000 people. What does
that mean? It means, honourable gentlemen, that there is a mile of railroad for
every 185 persons, men, women and
children. Taking the average family as
four, that means that there is one mile of
railway for every 40 men vho are able to
work. Can 40 men do enough business to
support a mile of railway? And in some
places in this country the condition is
worse than that. In 1901 what was the
mileage in Canada? At that time we had
a population of 5,371,315 and 18,000 miles of
railway. That gave us 300 persons to each
mile of railway. We went on for ten

NOVEMBER 6, 1919

years, and in 1911 we had increased our
mileage by 7,400 miles, so that we had
about 25,400 miles of railway. During the
same period the population increased 40
odd per cent. We then had a population
of 7,206,000 people. Therefore we had for
every -mile of railway 284 persons: we were
already over-building. But six years later,
in 1917, we had 40,584 miles, according to
the figures shown on page 2 of the Drayton-Acworth report, and we had a population estimated at 7;500,000, or only 185
persons per mile of railway. You will see,
honourable gentlemen, how during those
six years the population increased but it
had not increased in proportion with the
increase in the railway mileage. We had
an increase of over 15,000 miles of railway
and apparently an increase of only about
300,000 in the population. But the western
provinces show a still worse state of
affairs. I am sorry some of my honourable friends from the West are not here.
I see my honourable friend ýfrom Bossevain
(Hon. Mr. Schaffner), and I hope be will
listen to what I say and tell his confreres
that in the western provinces there i6 a
mile of railway for every 122 persons. In
the Northwest the families may be a little
larger than they are in the East. There
may be five in a family-a man and his
wife and three children. That is thought
nothing of in our province, and in the
Northwest, where there is ample space, it
would be quite an easy matter to establish
a large family. So in that case you have
25 families per mile, or 25 heads of families
for each mile of railway. Now, honourable gentlemen, none of those roads have
.cost less than $50,000 a mile-and I am
putting it mildly, because the DraytonAcworth report put the cost of the Canadian Northern at $56,000 a mile. At 5 per
cent, that means $2,500 of fixed charges.
How can that $2,500 be paid? It can only
be paid by the railway making $7,500 of
gross -earnings. 'The Canadian Pacifie railway were very pleased when their operating expenses were only about 66 or 64 per
cent-somewhere below 70 per cent of the
gross earnings. 'Therefore, ifor every $3
that a railroad company earns $2 goes for
operation-and T think the honourable
Minister of Labour will back me up in that
-and $1 is profit. Of course, during the
war operating expenses ran away up to 80
and 81 per cent, but those were abnormal
times. Therefore, if a railroad bas to
meet $2,500 of fixed charges that cost $50,000 per mile, it has to do a business of
$7,500 per mile. According to some of the
S-20

305

annual reports, the railways do not make
that much per mile. I do not know hod
it is now; but for 25 families to contribute
$7,500 would mean that it would cost each
family $340, or a dollar for every working
day in a year, to keep those roads going.

I do not think anyone can contradict that
statement, because I make it from the
books, and if anyone wants to verify anything that I say, I will have the papers
here. I -did not know that I would be
called upon to speak this morni.ng, and
when I go on this afternon I shall have
more papers and books.
How does this condition compare with
conditions in other countries? The United
States, as every one knows, leaving Canada
out of the coinputation, has more miles of
railroad than all the other countries in the
world. If you add the mileage of Canada
to the mileage of the rest of the world, the
total mileage is just about equal to that of
the United States. The United States bas
400 people per. mile of railway. In the
United Kingdom how many people do you
think there are to support one mile of railroad? There are 2,000 people for every
mile; and yet under government ownership
you saw lately a huge deficit. You all know
that the railroads while in the hands of
the Government have not been paying.
When I was in England not very long ago,
the people were seriously considering the
immediate return of these roads to the
private companies.

The Government had

absolutely fallen down; and yet there are
2,000 people to support one mile of road?
Or, if you take the country as a whole, what
will 185 people per mile do?
But look at conditions in other countries.
Take Australia, for example, where there
are 374 people per mile of railway. They.
have government operation; they have had
it for a long time. Later on I will speak of
the railroads in Australia. What is the
cost of operation there? For every dollar
that we have to pay here they have to pay
$2 for the same service in Australia. I
challenge contradiction of that.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Can the honourable
gentleman give us the population per mile
along the Grand Trunk which we propose
to purchase?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have carefully
read the Drayton-Acworth report, which
cost the country a lot of money, and it
does not give that information, and I cannot answer the honourable gentleman.
In Russia there are 4,000 persons for
every mile of railroad. Argentina has a

country that is forging ahead. We can say
that Canada is the progressive country,
and so on; but during the last twenty-five
years or so the Argentine has forged ahead
by leaps and bounds. The beautiful city
of Buenos Ayres, which twenty-five years
ago had a population of about 200,000, has
now a population of nearly 2,000,000.

GRAND TRUXK RAILWAY
ACQUISITION BILL.
DEBATE CONTINUED.

The Senate resumed from the morning
sitting this day the adjourned debate on
the motion for the second reading of Bill
33, an Act respecting the acquisition by
His Majesty of the Grand Trunk Railway
system, and the motion in amendment of
Hon. W. B. Ross.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN (continuing): Honourable gentlemen, when we adjuurned, I
had just reached the point of discussig
the Drayton-Aexvorth report. I find that the
report is in two parts. Mr. Acworth, who
was associated with Sir Henry Drayton,
only came here late in December, and the
report appeared some time in February.
We may therefore take it for granted that
Mr. Acworth did not go over the ground
himself. I may say that the gentleman
who had been appointed originally was Sir
George Paish, who, I understand, is quite
an authority on railway matters; but for
some reason or another ha could not come,
and after he bad sent in his resignation
some weeks elapsed before Mr. Acworth
was appointed. Then some weeks elapsed
before he could come here; so that, owing
to the intermission between Mr. Acworth's
appointment and his arrival from England,
he was only able to reach here about the
end of December. We should therefore call
this report Sir Henry Drayton's report,
because the other gentleman simply signed
what had been prepared, and took everything fqr granted. I do not say that with
the view of disparaging Sir Henry Drayton.
Sir Henry Drayton is a good lawyer. He
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

was formerly the City Solicitor 'for Toronto
at a good salary, and he ýfrequently came
here to plead before the Railway Board.
The Government thought he would make a
good chairman of the lRailway Board, and
a vacancy having occurred suddenly owing
to the death of Mr. Mabee, he was appointed to that position. He was Chairman of
that Board for eight years, and having
heard the argument for the railways on
one side, and that 'for other parties on the
other side; having heard corporations and
individuals; and having had engineers at
bis command with all the employees of the
Commission to enlighten him-notwithstanding all that, before he vacated his
position as Chairman of the Railway Board,
he published a report in which the fundamental principles of the problem of transportation were absolutely ignored. I do
not know whether or not that was the
reason for his leaving the Board; I shall
not repeat the unkind things that were said
about it by those who are in the railway
business, but since then he has been transferred to a more exalted position. He may
have been an excellent lawyer; he may
make a good Minister of Finance, for all
I know; but as a railway man ha was only
an amateur.
If you really want to know the railway
situation you should read the report of
Mr. A. H. Smith, who was President of the
New York Central railway for years, and
who has devoted his whole lifetime to
railroading, and is a man of bright intellect; whereas Sir Henry Drayton, after
all bis eight years' experience on the Railway Board, does not seem to have grasped
the fundamental principles of the problem
on transportation. Here is what Mr. Smith
says: In the United States the rate for
carrying one ton of freight one mile is
three-quarters of a cent, and in Canada i
is almost the same. Very good, that is by
private enterprise. In Australia, under
government ownership he says the rate is
two cents, or one penny. I said this morning that it was twice as much, and you see
that I was within the mark. He says that
passengers are carried at threepence, or
six cents per mile, which is also twice as
much. Sir Henry Drayton says-he may
be right, or he may be wrong "The Government is entitled"-I wish to draw the
attention of the House specially to this"the Government is entitled morally and
legally to make the Grand Trunk live up to
its contract." When I say, " Make the
Grand Trunk live up to its contract," I
mean that the Grand Trunk railway share-

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
holders should get what is coming to them,
as was said by the honourable gentleman
from Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon). I
never supposed that the Executive of this
country, or the House of Commons or the
Senate, was a charitable institution. We
are justified in being charitable with our
own funds, but we are here as trustees of
the people. We are honoured 'with the
confidence of the people, by their entrusting te us the administration of their
money, and why should we give to shareholders, no matter how worthy they may
be, the money that has been entrusted to
us? If that were done by private trustees
they would be sent to the Kingston penitentiary or te St. . Vincent de Paul. We
have. no right to give these shareholders
anything but what is coming te them.
Much as we would like to do it, we have
no right to exercise any generosity with
other people's nioney.
If we want te
heilp them, well and good, but we have no
zight to help them with the public money.
Then. Mr. Smith goes on to say that
Now-that means 1917-it would require
immediately $30,000,000 to equip the Grand
Trunk properly, and that $70,000,O0 would
have to be spent in the next five years.
As that was two years ago, there is now left
only a margin of three years. That means
that $100,000,000 will have to be spent soon.
If you look at the report of Mr. Smith,
you will see the confirmation of .that
statement..
Then Mr. Smith makes a very strong
point when he says that if the Government
is to undertake to operate the three railways, nanely, the Canadian Northern, the
Grand Trunk Pacific, and the Grand Trunk,
in fairness te the shareholders of the
Canadian Pacifie railway the Government
should aIso take over that road. That statement appears on page 76. Mr. Smith
rejects absolutely and conclusively the
proposition of government ownership and
operation. He claims that, knowing human
nature as we know it, knowing that the
very warp and woof ef our natbonal life is
polities, it is impossible in a democratic
country te attempt it.
Sir Henry Drayton and Mr. Acworth agree
that the Government should net attempt te
own large railways, especially to operate
them. Then Sir Henry Drayton proceeds
to make recommendations, among which
we find one that is really amusing. He
would have the railroad entrusted to five
commissioners, and he says that these men
shoul.d be absolutely free and independent
of the Dominion Parliament. As the
S-20

honourable Senator 'from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Foster) said last night, he would have us.
hand over to these five men property of
the value of ons billion and a half of
dollars, to be used as they please. That is
iSir Henry's report: they would have na
Parliament or Executive to consult. And
these five men, although owing their
appointment te the Executive, once they
were appointed would be self-perpetuating..
They would be like those flowers which are
of both sexes and reproduce themselves.
even without assistance from another
flower near by. When one resigns, the remaining members will appoint another,
and so it will continue. I leave it to.
honourable gentlemen in this fHouse toconjecture how long these men would
occupy their positions or be kept in office
if they displeased the Executive whoappointed them. The Executive would
naturally say: "You are making ducks and
drakes of the management of these government railways, and, unless you do,
better, or give us the service we want, we
shall have to remove you." But suppose
the Executive did net remove them. In
this country, as in other countries, there
may be a change of 'Government, involving
a change of Executive, and, if so, those
five men might not be satisfactory to the
new Executive. We have elections every
four or five years, and there might be
change atter change. As a result, you would
have untried men to whose hands you
would entrust the administration of a
billion and a half of dollars worth of property. Where is the democratic principle
in that self-perpetuation?
I was quite amused yesterday when the
honourable leader of the House, who turned
out te be a great democrat on this
occasion, spoke about the House of Commons having a mandate, and so on. I éould
not believe it. I thought he was coming
over to our side, when he expressed such
liberal views. However, why should we,
the Parliament of Canada, who are, after
all, only the representatives of the people,
take from the people a billion and a hall of
dollars worth of property, entrust it to five
gentlemen, and say to 'them: "Do as you
please with ,the greatest asset Canada has
got?" It is sufficient to mention the proposition to prove its absurdity. If Sir
Henry Drayton advocated such a scheme
as that, and if he adTninistered the Railway
Commission in such a manner, then it is a
good thing for the Railway Commission that
he shifted his activities to another direction.

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
I took some trouble to clip extracts
from newspapers, but I am not going to
take the time of thie House to read any one
of them, because I know it is very disagreeable to honourable members to have
to listen to these long extracts when they
can read them for themselves. 'These
clippings are all from papers friendly to
the Governm.ent. They are all among the
very best Conservative and Unionist papers
in the country. I brought these clippings
here and honourable gentlemen can verify
any statement I make by reference to
them.
I will take first the Montreal Gazette. I
need not tell you what I think about that
paper, for I have repeatedly stated in this
House that I believe it to be the best paper
in Canada. If there is any better newspaper, I would like some honourable gentleman to name it. The first reason given
by the Government for buying the Grand
Trunk is in order to link up their system
with the other syetems so that they may
have the use of the terminals. They are
very fond of linking up. We have heard
that story before, and it is not worth
telling. There is no necessity for this
action at al]. That linking up can be done
and is being done, as the Government is
aware. A traffic arrangement is working now. Fifteen years ago, or thereabouts, the Intercolonial railway was
brought to Montreal, a traffic arrangement
was -made with the Grand Trunk, and today, honourable gentlemen-I do not know
why this was not mentioned before--today the Grand Trunk railway cannot
accept a ton of freight from the great province of Ontario and route it east of
Montreal except by the Intercolonial railway. Nobody is ignorant of that; all the
shippers are aware of it.
As to traffic arrangements, the various
American companies will continue to
maintain their identity. A traffic arrangement would be nuch better for Canada,
because under it we would not be obliged
to assume the obligations and. liabilities
of the Grand Trunk throughout the length
and breadth of the land, from CLicago to
Portland. But if we take over the Grand
Trunk sysotem, as this Government cannot
fail while there is a dollar to be got from
the taxpayers, we forego any xight we have
to the appointment of a receiver for these
railroads. A private company is under a
limited liability. If you hold stock in a
private concern, you may lose the stock,
but your responsibility does not extend
beyond that. But Canada's liability is

unlimited.
No matter how badly this
affair may go in the future, our liability is
unlimited. And remember, we have children and grandchildren who will live to see
the results of this undertaking, and wilI
wonder why we entertained for one moment
such a proposition. We can never go into
a receivership, unless, forsooth, Canada
becomes bankrupt; and ýthat will neverhappen, I hope. But we are in a fair way
to bankruptcy, I must say.
And if the undertaking turned out well
in Canada, how about fhe United States?
For instance, a great deal of litigation will
be inevitable in the United States. There
are in that country thirty corporations
included in the Grand Trunk system.
For all this litigation you will have to employ Aimerican lawyers, and all your cases
must be tried under American law.
The
jury may be composed of some persons who
were our enemies not long ago, and of some
others who would like to see a republie
declared in the British Empire. If you
have such persons on the jury when, in the
naine of His Majesty King George, you
are suing for your rights in the United
States, I would like to ask any member of
this honourable House, will you have a
very sympathetic hearing from that jury?
Canadians who have ha-d to prosecute
cases in the United States, know what kind
of justice they get there. I know of cases
in which very scant justice was meted
out. The plaintiff if he is a foreigner, has
a very poor lookout.
" But," it is said, " the Government will
not have the lines in its own name; they
will be in the name of a company; in fact,
each company will keep its name; the
property will be in trust, as it were." That
does not go in the United States at all.
The authorities in that country want to
know who stand to make or to lose by
a transaction, and those who stand to make
or to lose by it are the persons they
consider. You cannot go before a United
States court as a trustee without having
to divulge the names of those interested.
I have thia from railroad authorities who
are very near the Grand Trunk. They have
told me that immediately the Canadian
Government started to operate in the
United States they would be asked: "How
]nuch money have you invested? When did
vou acquire this property? Who are your
shareholders? Who owns the property?
The Government of Canada? Then the
Government of Canada is here as the owner of this railway system, and will be
treated as such."

SENATE

Now I come to the so-called four per cent
guaranteed stock. That is the tragedy of
the whole thing. Is there a man in this
House who can tell me by whom that stock
ls guaranteed? " Guaranteed " is a catchword. It was never guaranteed by anybody
-not by this Government; not by the linperial Government. The Grand Trunk Company had so many preference shares, first,
second and third, besides the common stock,
that they had to find some new word for
-something else, and they said, "We will

stock that bas priority over some other
stock, and the " guarantee " is that if they

mooney, they are going to pay a dividend, and
they will pay the holders of that guaranteed
stock before they pay the others. That is

two years they have not paid one cent. Nobody can deny that statement. And what
are we going te do? We are going to pay
four per cent on par for ·that stock. Four
per cent on par on stock that vas on the
market at 45 cents on the dollar! Do yeu
know what that means? It means a revenue of nine per cent to the holders. If any
one of us had bought 100 shares of that

down in a similar way. Many banks have
done so-the Farmers' Bank, the Bank of
St. Hyacinthe, and others. And this money
will not even be spent in Canada. The
holders of that stock live on the other side
of the water, and our good money will go
across the Atlantic te those persons, ta
whon we do not owe one cent!
13ut I will tell you how we in this Senate
xnight do some good for the country. We
could play a great joke on the speculators
who have that stock. It would be the mnost
severe joke that could be played on them.
We could force down the price of that stock
by voting against this measure, and as soon
as it went down we could form a little syndicate. 'I see my honourable friends from
Rigaud, De Salaberry and Alma. A few of
os could then buy in that stock. I have always considered the honourable leader of
this House a very dear friend of mine, and
I would like very much to ask him why, if
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

he knew about this, he didn't give me an
inkling of it so that I might get into it.
Why net let the Senate get into it too?
Then the Senate syndicate, having got this
money, could band it back te the taxpayers
of Canada, because next year, if the Governrnent come with the same proposition,
that stock would be worth 90 and we would
have made 100 per cent on our money.
If we had bought up, say, the £12,500,000 of the stock, we would have had
to put up only a portion of that amount.
The Montreal Gazette says there would be
an appreciation of $20,000,000 or $26,000,000.
Then we could go to the Canadian people
and say: " See what the Senate lias done
for you: instead of allowing the stockbrokers te make money on this transaction, a comnmittee of the Senate has made
the deal. We do not want to profit by it,
and we now band back te you the profits."
If we lid that there would be statues erected
ii our honour in all our native cities, and
we should be hailed as the greatest public
benefactors that ever were in Canada. Nobody would talk then of abolishing the
Senate-not even the Manitoba Free Press,
which says that if we vote down this mecasure the Senate will be abolisled.
The
Manitoba Free Press is trying to frighten
us. I see the honourable gentleman from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) laughing.
I do not know whether he

Manitoba Free Press or not. It was a gentleman from Manitoba who -drew my attention to it. I wonder who owns the Manitoba

The Gazette says the persons who hold
that four per cent so-called guaranteed
stock are making between $20,000,000 and
$26,000,000 of profit. It is a very tuestionable thing, says the Montreal Gazette.
These things are stated by the Montreal
Gazette or some other Conservative paper,
and I have taken care net to state theni as
my own opinion. The Gazette says it is a
nice plum to be divided. Now, who is going
to get that plum? It goes on to say that
there is $175,000,000 of common and preferred stock, etc., which, according to
the market value on the particular date that

what I say. His own organ sav: that this
scheme will add from $25,000,000 to $30,000,0,'0 a year to the expenses.
lie -public debt of Canada was stated
yesterday to be about $2,000,000,000. Aceording to the reports, and according to
the speech of the ex-Minister of Finance,
we are going to be behind during the current year to the extent of $500,000,000. What
about the adjustment of war claims with
England? I have heard that the claim, of
England against Canada amounts to $425,000,000. I do not know how that claim is
going to be adjusted. No one ha's spoken
about that; but we sh-all have to meet it,
and I think that Canada will honour her
agreement to do so. i hope, however, that
Canada bas a contra claim. We are not
going to get a share of the German indemnity, and we have to pay England $425,000,000. When you re'collect that in 1914 the
public debt was not $400,000,000-according
to Sir Thomas White, it was only $335,000,000-and when you consider what the public
debt is to-day, why should you want to enrich the Grand Trunk bsharehold.ers? They
have been accustomed to go without dividends. Then why should we pay them dividends? The Quebec Chronicle is not in
favour of paying such dividends at all.

It is said that we have to buy our experience of public ownership. I thought that we
had bought our experience of public ownership from the Intercolonial railway, and that
we had bought our experience also since we
took over the National railways. The honourable member for Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon) says that the amount we shall have to
pay for the pleasure of masquerading as railway owners will be $85,O00,000 for last year.
I asked a question on this point, but in the
answer there were so many figures that I
eould not add them all up. I believe the
honourable gentleman's statement is very
moderate. That amount is for betterments
and improvements, to meet payments coning due, and so on; but the money has to be
found.

should be made by the Exchequer Court.
I think the idea is a very good one. A
most valuable law has been placed on the
statute book 'to meet the case of insolvent
railways, and if the sale were made by the
Excbeiquer Court a clause could be put in
the agreement to the effect that the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company must net buy
it. Knowing that company to be composed
of smart business men, however, I know
that they have no idea of buying the Granl
Trunk railway, because they have no use
for it. The Canadian Pacifie railway goes
wherever the Grand Trunk goes and i quite
satisfied to stay where it is.
I wish to pay my respects to that able
writer, Mr. iR. S. White, editor of the Mentreal Gazette, who was the member for Carleton for many years. I do not suppose there
is a more able writer in Canada, and I do
not suppose that the present Government

than the gentleman who is commonly called
Bob White. What he says shows that he possesses a thorough knowledge of the conditions. The Gazette of the 24th October asks:

cast upon it; was their case so weak that it
could not be placed before the public? The
Gazette blames both parties, the Liberal
party and the Conservative party, for
bringing about duplication and generally
making a mess of the railway situation.
Then it winds np by asking: " But can this
Government manace any botter?" Then it
declares that the Board of Trade of Montreal should not have been treated with the
contempt of silence, but should have been
answered. The Gazette of the 4th November refers te the 1,665 miles of Grand Trunk
railway lines in the United States. It estimates the liabilities of these lines and says
that we must I assume them all. It goes on
to say that we shall have to help those
railways whether we like it or not, and
whether they have deficits or not.

it shows the dedicits on those American lines:

SENATE
I suppose some honourable gentlemen
w oruil be bard pressed if tbey were atsked
to state where threse railways are situated.
I iave iad to study the mrap to learn where
they are. The railway frotm Detroit to Grand
Haven is continired fromr Grand Haven to
Milwaukee by ferry. Thiis s one of the oldeSt
roads, built by the Grand Trunk when there
was a lot of pine in tlie country. It was
built to take out the pine of Miehigan, and
wlien it reached New Haven tiey thought
they mighlt as well continue it to Milwaukee,
and -so they built a railway ferry, one of the
first established. It is said these roads niay
be feeders; but a fundamrental principle in
railroading is that you should net retain a
departnent or a branch that does not pay its
way. But these feeders are all foreign roads.
The Montreal and Portland, which shows
that deficit of a million and a quarter,
brings our trade to an Anrerican seaport.
The honourable menber froim Montreal
(Hon. rMr. White) tells us how much w e are
losing by building up this seaport when we
have our own Canadian ports. Any one who
lias seen the great irmprovenients going on at
Halifax, and also at St. John, at a cost of
mrîany inillions must realize that this is a
great pity. The Scientific Aierican says
Halifax is one of the best ports in the couniry. Will all thiese improveients in our
own Canadian ports have to lie idle in order
that we inay build up an Arrerican port'
What ias become of the cry: "No truck
with the Yankees" if you take the traffic
away froim Halifax there will bc loud conplaints. Tiese could bc avoided by proper
traffic arrangeients.
I will pass on to another and different
subject which is dealt with by the Montreal
Board of Trade. I wilI read certain views
whici are voiced by the Merchants' Association of New York:
Whereas, by reason of conditions inseparable
from our form of government, governnental
operation of economic undertakings, whether
Federal, State or Municipal, is characterized
by:
Extreme delays and inertia, vacillation, hesitancy and inconsistency in matters of policy;
Wasteful outlays in response to sectional demands;
Insuflicient provision of funds when needed
for necessary pur.)oses;
Absence of close and harmonious co-opreration
between the legislative tlirectofate and the executive officials ;
Insecurity of tenure in the higher places and
lack of self-interest as an incentive;
Frequent change of higher officiais and the
Injection into office of new and untried men;
Unsuitable nethods of selecting executive officials whereby such officiais are not often properly qualified by expert knowledge, previous
training, experience or proved capacity;
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hamipering conditions iniposed by law upon
executives whereby they are derrived of necessary control of operation and of their subordinates ; and
Whereas. from these conditions naturally result imperfec-t co-ordination, lack of qualified
management, bad operating methods, and generai waste and inefficiency ; both the methods and
the results being diametrically opposite to those
which prevail in properly managed business undertakings, which latter are governed solely by
economie considerations, and require for their
success close and friendly relations between the
directorate and the officiais; the prompt provision of funds as required by the economic needs
of the business ; high capacity, long experience
and special training on the part of the executive
officiails, assured tenure during efficiency, selfinterest, and the possession by such officials of
a very large legree of discretion as to outlays
and operating details ;
Now, therefore be it
Resolved, by the Merchants' Association of
New York that governmental methods in the
conduet of business affairs are inherently defective by reason of the fundamental restrictions imposed by our form of government; and
that such methods are often inefficient and
wasteful and therefore unsuited to the conduct
of business undertakings ; And 'be it further
Resolved, that The Merchants' Association of
New York is opposed to government ownership
and operation of railroads, telephones, telegrapis, and other public utilities, believing that
such utilities are far more effectively operated
under private ownership, subject to public regulation, than would be possible under governmental ownership and operation, and that it
would be a national calamity to subject these
instruments, indispensable to the welfare of
the whole country to the hamlpering, inefficient
and wasteful methods inseparable from governmental undertakings.

The alternative that was proposed by the
Board of Trade of Montreal was received
with the contempt of silence. The Montreal Gazette, which refers to this iatter,
says it will only be a poor compensation to
the taxpayers and electors of this country to
see the disappearance of the authors of tiis
commercial tragedy froin political life. What
interest suffers if this miatter isi deferred?
Soune honourable gentlemen talk about traffie
arrangements of the Intercolonial railway
weorking perfectly well. They say the Grand
Trunk Pacifie bas failed. Well, if it hafaileti, why should the Grand Trunk Copany, wvith its obligation for the Grand
Trunk Pacifie undischarged, be in a position
to dictate ternis to the Government of Canada? I do not think any one can answer tiat
question. The stock argument has been used
all throuigh this discussion thrat the shareholders of the Grand Trunk will not agree.
and tiat then we will show them the agreement and ask tbem to accept it. They say
t
they have nothing, that they are bankrup ,
that they cannot discharge their obligation:
and yet thbey are to be placed ahead of tie
taxpayers ofthis country. The taxpayers wilt

NOVEMBER 6, 1919

not be shown this agreemeqt, but it will be
taken across the seas and shown to a lot of
Grand Trunk¡shareholders. All the widows
and orphans over there will see it before the
taxpayers of Canada have an opportunity of
seeing it. Why should the Canadian people
not be placed on a par with a lot of bankrupt Grand Trunk sharebolders? If they tell
us they will not agree we should say: "We
will make you agree, and if you do not you
will have to accept a receivership." The
Grand Trunk will not bring one sixpence to
help to pay the debt of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, but the Government will have that
charge fastened on them permanently. Canada never cen be relieved from it.
The Montreal Star of November lst
published an article entitled "Canadian
Pacific Railway Nightnare." The Government use the stock argument that the Canadian Pacifie railway is going to gobble up
the Grand Trunk. But the Canadian Pacifie
railway managers are too good business men
to think of such a thing. They would not
buy a dead horse which would bring them
no revenue. The Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company is a big, powerful company, and
it has always tried to do what was right.
Its succeess is so much linked up with the
success of Canada it has always tried to do
what would inure to the prosperity of Canada, knowing that if the Canadian Pacifie
built up the country it was not so much for
Canada's benefit as for the benefit of the
Canadian Pacifie railway. They were well
aware that any benefit conferred upon their
customers, the people of Canada, would
inure to their own benefit, and that was
what they had primarily in mind. ii have
the word of Sir William Van Horne for that
He was advocating a certain policy which
was afterwards adopted. I said, "But it is
not in the interest of your railway." He
said, "What k in the interest of Canada is
in the interest of my railroad," and so it
proved in the long run to be. I might give
all the detaila of that matter, but it would
take too 'much time.
The Gazette of November lt, in answer
to a correspondent from Cape Breton who
wanted to know the truth, said that the
total mileage was 8,173 miles; that there
were two roads-the Grand Trunk and the
Grand Trunk Pacifie. The Grand Trunk
guarantee is $97,000,000; the Dominion
Government guaranteed $76,000,000; the Saskatchewan Government guaranteed -$11,000,000, and Alberta $3,500,000. Honourable
gentlemen will notice that the Government,
in taking over the Grand Trunk, releases
Saskatchewan from that $11,000,000 guaran-

317

tee and Alberta from its guarantee of $3,500,000. The province of New Brunswick never
guaranteed anything, yet it has been paying
through the nose ever since. Likewise the
provinces of Prince Edward Island and Quebec. It is unfair to thosie three provinces
and against the spirit of Confederation for
this Government, by relieving other provinces of their obligations, to penalize those
provinces which have administered their
aff airs wisely' and carefully. In the case
of the Canadian Northern, the Government
of Quebec did not give any guarantee, although Mackenzie and Mann had their
lawyers interview Sir Lomer Gouin on the
subject. The efforts of the lawyers made no
difference: the Canadian Northern got no
advantage 'from our province. And Quebec
was not the only province that they did not
prevail upon. I do not know why they did
not prevail upon New Brunswick, but I
think New Brunswick was pretty hard up
and they thought it was no use to try. As
for Prince Edward Island, they were not
dealing with such small fry; they wanted a
big fish like British Columbia, where they
could get $60,000,000 et one stroke.
If the Government kept the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, they would aocept no new liabilities. They should simply jog along with
the Grand Trunk Pacifie and leave the
Grand Trunk alone. With a traffic arrangement the operations would continue very
satisfactorily. However, if the Bill is going
to pass, I think it would be well to do as
is proposed in the amendment announced
by the honourable gentlernan from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), namely,
to limit the amount to be fixed by the arbitrators.
It has been referred to so often that I am
almost ashamed to repeat it again-that on
the 3rd of October Sir George Foster, in another place, said: " You may all go home,
gentlemen, our work is all finished. We
called you here for a certain purpose, and
that has been fulfilled, so you may go
home now." Some of them did go home,
but were requested by telegraph to hurry
back. But between the 3rd and the 6th
of October, something happened; whether
it was the vision of St. Paul on the road
to Damascus or not I do not know. Somebody fell off his horse. Lo and behold, this
Bill came before the House, although previously Sir George Foster had said: " It
is all over: we will ring down the curtain."
What happened? That is a secret of the gode
and the Government. We do not know what
happened. As the honourable gentleman
from Alma (Hon. Mr. Foster) said last

night, the siren must have been singing. By
this time the Montreal Gazette had become
sus'picious. It even points out very directly
who the siren is, but I have been told not to
mention the name. Nobody can guess. The
Montreal Star says it is not enough to have
the proposals ratified by the taxpayers, because by the time the taxpayers would be
consulted these five comnissioners would
have so bedevilled the road, and it would
be in such a state, that they would ratify
anyway. I think the Montreal Star tas
that wrong.
The Inter-state Commerce Committee of
the United States Senate, on the question of
the extension of government control, point
out-what is a very important thing if this
Bill is going te pass-that direct government
operation is much better than second-hand
operation by a commission. I agree with
that. I would rather have the ton. Mr.
Reid, the present Minister of Railways, run
Ihe railroad than to have anybody appointed to run it for him. The representatives of the people hold him responsible,
and Parliament could require an accounting
from him if anything- wvent wrong. The Coinmittee of the United States Senate, as a
result of the inquiry they made, arc
unanimously of the opinion that a secretary
of transportation should be appointed it
there is to be governmen't control. They do
not want such camouflage as the appointment of a commission with the statement
that the railways are taken out of politics.
They ýsay the railways cannot be taken out of
politics. They say the very warp and woof of
their national life are politics. Then they
go on to give the reasons why a secretary
of transportation should be appointed.
Here we have a Minister of Railways; and,
if the Government are going to run the railways, let then cone out fairly and squarely
and appoint the Minister of Railways to run
them. Why hide behind a commission? Are
they ashamed of what the commission is
doing? Do they not knowu that the commissioners hold their position only by the
good-will of the Minister of Railways? If
there were a change of Government, how
many members of that commission would
reniain in office, no matter what Government came into power? Do you think there
would not be a change? Since the Minister of Railways is changed when there
is a change of Government, why would not
the commission be changed? When the Government and the Minister of Railways are
changed the commission would go too. That
is why it is better to have private ownership,
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

with the security of tenure of office, rather
than an untried, inexperienced commission.
Moreover, a commission has net the
necessary authority to meet emergencies.
The Minister of Railways sits with the
Executive every day, and when an emergency arises the Minister of Railways can
get the propei authority right from the
source of power and can act immediately,
whereas the commission, by the time they
come to Ottawa and meet the Minister oi
Railways and te imeets the Government, find
that it is probably too late. So many matters arise from day to day that it ils necessary to deal with them all pronptly.
The administration must be vested with full
power, and that is possessed only by the
Executive. Surely the people of Canada
would net give absolute authority to an outside commission representing nobody but
themselves.
Then, again, a commission lacks initiative.
If you read the life of James J. Hill you
will sec that he gives many rea.sons: why a
road should be under private ownership,
so that every little detail may be attended to, and there may be the least possible interference. He says that frequent
changes are very bad in railway administration. When the commissioners have just
got into harness they may be changed, and
untried men brought in te take their places,
and it will require a long tinie to train the
new men.
You must get funds
Another thing.
promptly in case of emergency, and a commission cannot get funds; it is only the
Executive that can do so, or, in the United
States, only the secretary of transportation, whvo sits day by day in council with
the President of the United States. He can
get the authority to raise the necessary
money.
Then there must be a fixed policy.
How can you have a fixed policy whten, in
the ITnitel States, governinents come and go
every four years? What would be the fixed
policy to-day when there is a Democratic
President and a Republican Congress? There
would be pulling both ways at the saine
time. That shows the absurdity of this proposition in a deiocratic country. lIn the
case of an autocratic country like Gernany,
where eue man's will is law, it is all very
well.
The United States under private enterprise have built up the greatest railway
system in the world, coniprising 250,000
miles, or, to be absolutely correct, 253,000
miles, enough to go ten tinuos around the
earth at the equator. Canada's 40,000 miles

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
of railway would go twice around the earth
in the latitude of Ottawa.
I desire, in pamsing, te eall the attention
of honourable gentlemen to an appropriation made ýby the United States Governmen~t. Betiween the Tht of January, 1918,
and the lOth of November, 1918, the day
befooee the armistice was sign6d, the United
States Government appropriated the huge
sum of $ 1,175,000,000 for betterments, improvements, etc., on the raH-roaLs. Alter
the armistice they stopped. And that sum
the railroad. companies are refusing to. pay,
because they say $800,000,000 was epent in
war-time, when the cost of labour was high,
anci the expenditure is now of no use to the
ralroads.
Here la another most conclusive fact. The
railways created by prîvate enterprise in the
UJnited iStates. have the Iowes~t rates to be
found in any country in the civilized. world.
That statement can be very easily verified.
And while, they have the lowest rates of
transportation of any country in the world,
the game railroads under private enterprise .have paid the highest wages of any
country in the civilized. world, and have
done ail that on less capital than any
other country in the wooeld. What more
could you want than that?
Tim-e is going on, and I must cnt short
what I have te say. The people are coromencing to realize what government operation means. Rates have increased in the
UJnited States, in some cases, 100 per cent.
Nobody can deny that. Passenger rates
have increased 40 per cent and in some
cases 100 per cent. There are no more commutations. allowed for travelling in and oui
of the great -centres in the United States.
The people are commencing to see that
government ownership la not what it was
cracked up to be, because they have to
pay 100 per cent more in lares. Moreover,
notwithstanding the încreased freight and
passenger rates, the railways suifer a deficit
of $1,500,000 per day. What will be the
deficit in this country? On the guaranteed
stock alone we agree te pay $2,500.00. What
does that sum mean? It means $2W0,000 a
month, or $50,000 a week, or $7,000 a day,
which the taxpayers will have to provide. If
our children ask us, "Why do you have te
pay those taxes?" we must answer, "I do not
know." "Did you have te pay it?" "No,
we did flot have te pay it." "Then why did
you .pay itP"
"lb was thought lb wonld
be well bu provide, for the wîdows and
ocrphans in Great Britain." There must be
a great many widows and orphans there:
6o we must continue indefinitely te pay at

319

the rate of $7,000 a day if we take over the
Grand Trun-k guaranteed steck, though lA
can ha bought to-day at 45 cents on the
dollar. I say we should borrow the necessary money and buy il now, and thus, save
55 cents on every dollar. That la the beist
way te buy it, if we are going te do anything
with it.
In the UJnited States ýat present less
than 10 per cent of the farmers are in
favour of government ownership. That is
the sworn evidence.
I said that standardization was no good,
and I will tell you why. Tàke locomotives,
for instance. lb may seem strange for you
te hear that locomotives do not travel
beyond their own linets. A mountain, locomotive remains in the mountains; a locomotive that is built for easy grades and curves
remains where there are easy grades and
curves, so you cannot have standardization
of locomotives. Among other things, some
cars used in the south are of no use in the
north, and vice versa.
Hononrable gentlemen, you who, from
time immemorial, constitute in the nation
the assembly of the sages; you whom the
fathers of the Canadian Confederation have
creabed the censors of the House of Commons; you to whom they have entrusted
the safe-keeping of the liberbies and prerogatives of the people; you whose function
is te put a brake on disastrous administration of Governments; you who have the
power to reýpress abuses and step malversation; you whom the people regard as
the bulwark of justice against injustice,
of prudence against aberration; you who
are the authority withoub which no Iaw
can pass the last stage of parliamentary
procedure: lisýten to the humble but mighty
voice of the Canadian people begging you
ta postpone this Grand Trunk Acquisition
Bill. It is your long career in business or
in Parliament that gave you the honour
of being summoned to the Senate. It is your
experience that inspires your decisions, and
your wis-lom that directs your vote. Therefore
it is ta yonr experience and your wisdom
that the nation makes its final appeal.
Consider the frightfnl state of aur national
finances. Think of the unrest rampant in
the country. Watch the attitude of the
masses. Look into the future if this
meeasure becomes law. Lean over the chasm
thus created in our national treasury.
Think of the amount of taxes necessary
to fill even a smaîl part of ibis new abyss,
this unfathomed gulf. You have the power;

dreamt that you should. You are the last

well called. The Maritime Province rnbers then came forward, and presented their
pistols at the head of the premier, and said,
"Unless this line goes to, the Maritime
Provinces we will flot support the Bill."
I was glad that the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
admitted that yesterday; therefore we are
burdened with -this railroad because of
political reason8.
Then, in the course of tirne, we bought
the Canadian Northern, and many honourable gentlemen on this aide of the House,
who at that time sat in the Senate, voted
for the Bill and are opposing this one. Today we have heard, very good reasons gîven
for that; it wa& during the war, and the war
was the great issue, and honourable gentlemen voted for the Bill, though opposed te
government ownership. I respect the argument, and arn willing to grant that that influenced sorne of the gentlemen, but I think
there were sound arguments aside from that
altogether.
There was another road that I might men-tion-the Quebec and Saguenay. I amn surprised to find gentlemen opposing.this Bill
Who voted for the acquisition of the Quebec and Saguenay railway. 1 do flot understand why any honourable gentleman
should stand up in this House and vote for
the acquisition of the Quebec and Sague-.
nay railway, which always has been and
always will be an exceedingly unprofitable
and bad bargain, if ever a bad bargain wa.s
made, and now oppose this measure, which
involveýs no loss to. the treasury. 1 cannot,
for instance, understand the attitude of the
Montreal Star, which was quite agreeable
that the Grand Trunk Pacifie sbould be
taken over. I bave read an article which
appeared in that paper. It was read
in the other bouse and appears in
Hansard, and though I have it here, it is
nlot necessary te read it. They stated that
they were quite satisfieri and tbnught it was
the proper thing for the Government to
take over the Grand Trunk Pacific. Is it
not astounding that those gentlemen who
are te-day so virtuous in refusing te jake
over this splendid bargain, where we get s0
much more than a dollar's Worth for every
dollar paid out, were ail willing- to take over
the Grand Trunk Pacific, with its losses of
$ 10,000,000 a year, or the Canadian Northe rn, w'hich was deeply in debt, or the Quebec and Saguenay, wh.ich waa most unprofitable, or, honourable gentlemen, who were
willing to build a line acrosa the northern
part of Canada, a line which could not be
expected to pay for years to corne. Where la

ai] these unprofitable roads was supported
by honourable gentlemen who are opposing
the acquisition of this road.
Hlere is an opportunity to buy a road that
according to my judgment is a profitable
road. bere is a road that neyer failed to

preference stock, and the guaranteed stock.
It is only the h-olders of the common stock
Who have failed to get any dividénds for
many long years. We are proposing to pay
for this. road a aum flot greater than tbat on
which it bas earned dividends in the past,
and wbicb it would be earning to-day but for
war conditions. War came on, and, due te
the conditions. of the war, ail the railroads
bad to pay double wages, bad te pay double
for coal, double for oil, and, for almos-t everytbing that tbey bad' te buy. If they wanted
to repair an engine, or te buy new cars, they
had to pay double. Under those circumstances, how could this road be expected to
pay? In the United States the McAdoo
award ordered wages that were double wbat
they had been before and everytbing that
goes into the cost of operating bas doubled
and the rates were raised only 40 per cent.
The rates in Canada were' raised months
aftr this road ceased to, pay, long alter the
rates ougbt to bave been raised. Firat, tbey
were raised 15 per cent; later they were
raised 25 per cent. But this was long after
the time wben the raise wa's sufficient te
me-et increased expenses. Those two advances in the freight rate, after they were
made, and amounting to 40 per cent, were
flot even then sufficient. After ahl, it is only
a question of rates. But bonourable gentlemen say that the failure of the roads in the
United States was because of goverfiment
ownership. The Grand Trunk railway was
under private ownership. It did flot pay.
That is *no argument against government
n'wnersbip. Honourable gentlemen must go
farther tban that te find an argument
against government ownership.
I dlaim. that the purchase of the
Grand Trunk is a good bargain, an
excellent hargain.
What *are we paying for this road, and what are we getting?
We have heard a good many different statements in this bouse. Some honourable
gentlemen have confused the liabilities of
the Gra~nd Trunk and Grand Trunk Pacifie
with the liabilities that we will assume if we
take over this road. bonourable gentlemen
have said-ît bas been repeated over and

Trunk are $504,000,000, and then they add
$216,000,000 for the Grand Trunk Pacifie,
making the immense sum of over $700,000,000. These are not the liabilities which we
assume in taking over these roads. They
are the liabilities of these companies to their
stockholders, as well as to the public. These
are two vastly different questions. For in-,
stance, there is the sum of $116,000,000 of
common stock which we are not paying
anything for, and yet honourable gentlemen
get up here and tell us that we are assuming
that liability.

Hon. Mr. SMITH: Here is the bluebook
giving the various amounts which we are
liable for, and I would like the honourable
member to go over it with me and see how
he makes up his $700,000,000. On page 38
we have the obligations which we assume.
There is the funded debt, $173,558,554.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The interest on which has always been paid.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes, the interest on
which has always been paid. Then we have

notes-I have added everything-$35,548,235; current liabilities, $22,801,474; guaranteed stock-I am assuming that the Government is going to pay for the guaranteed
stock though I understand that an amendment is heing brought before this House providing that it will be arbitrated-but assuming that we are going to pay for the guaranteed stock, the amount capitalized is $60,833,332. These are the gross liabilities which
we have to assume, $298,085,792.
Hon .Mr. CASGRAIN: Look at page 26total securities with public, $707,929,817.
Hon Mr. SMITH: I am speaking of the
liabilities which the Governiment is going
to assume. That is the only question with
which we are concerned, the only question
it is necessary for us to discuss. I would
like the honourable gentleman to turn to
page 38. There he will find set forth the
liabilities of the Grand Trunk. There is
$116,000,000 of common stock wich we do
not assume.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The honourable
gentleman is referring only to the Grand
Trunk proper; he is not including the liabilities of the Grand Trunk Pacific?

would ask the honourable gentleman to
turn to the blue-book and tell me if I am
not right.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If you leave out
the Grand Trunk Pacific, of course some
one has to pay for it.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Leaving out the
Grand Trunk Pacifie, the total liabilities of
the Grand Trunk are $504,000,000; but we
do n-ot assume these liabilities. That is
what the honourable gentleman does not
seem to anpreciate. We do not assume the

amounting to $63,000,000. These are to be

I und-erstand that an amendment is proposed by the honourable member ifrom
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lync'h-Staunton), but
I do not know whether it is going to be
accepted or not. I do not know whether
this would be an opportune time for the
leader of the Government to say whether
it is to be accepted or not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In answer
to my honourable friend, I may say that
we are prepared to accept an amendment
placing a maximum upon the award which
shall be made by the arbitrators. As to
what that amount will be, I am not at the
moment prepared to say; but doubtless
when we go into committee we will be able
to arrive at a maximum amount which
will be satisfactory to the judgment of the
House. I now give that assurance to honourable gentlemen, so that when the Bill is
to be read a second time, and the House
votes upon the principle of the Bill, it will
be on tle understanding that the House
will afterwards determine in Committee of
the Whole what the maximum will be.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: That alters the situation to some extent. Possibly the guaranteed stock will be arbitrated; I am net
sure about thatHon. Mr. GORDON: The guaranteed
stock will be absolutely guaranteed if this

ment. The amendment that is to be
brought forward includes the arbitration
of the guaranteed stock, as I understand it.
Hon. Mr GORDON: It does not include
the guaranteed stock.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: The honourable member from Hamilton includes the guaranteed
stock in the arbitration as welil as the
others.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. In
order that what I have said m.ay not be misinterpreted, permit me to say that my
honourable friend from Hamilton has given
notice of an amendment proposing to place
a maximum upon the award which shaH
be made by the arbitrators. To that general
principle the Government will assent. As
to the amount, that will be determined in
committee. A further proposal bas been
made, or, at least, I have heard it whispered,
that notice will be given of a further amendment in Committee of the Whole to the
effect that the guaranteed stock should be
submitted to arbitration as well as the three
preference issues. I am not committing the
Government to the principle or policy of
this proposed amendment. That does not
interfere with the general principle which
I have laid down that the House in Committee of the Whole shall take into consideration the fixing of a maximum amount
which the award shall not exceed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: .For the preferred stock and the common stock, but not
for the guaranteed stock?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not discussing the details of this amendment; I am now dealing with the motion
that a maximum shall be placed upon the
award, and when we go into committee that
will be discussed. The two features which
I have mentioned will be discussed; but I
am not prepared to say that the Government
will commit itself to including the guaranteed stock in snch an aniendment. We
wiil, however, accept the fixing of a maximum amount as regards the awarrd.
Hon. Mr. SMJTH: That amendment is as
to the maximum amount that is to he fixed
by the arbitrators for the preferred and
common stock.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes; not the guaranteed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
what it is at present. I wdl1 further qualify
that: Honourable -gentlemen have it in their
own hands, when we go into Committee, to
S-214

323

determine whether this motion or the other
motion will prevail. All I desire to say às
that when the division is taken on the principle of the Bill on the second reading, we
commit ourselves to that general proposal.
Then, if honourable gentlemen who fought
for the principle of the Bill are not satisfied
with the amendment proiposed in Committee of the Whole, they are at liberty to pursue whatever course they wish.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: My argument is based
upon the assumption of the payment of the
guaranteed stock, $60,000,000, and that
makes a total of the gross obligation of this
Government of $298,085,792, against which
we have various assets on the opposite side
of the account.
On the opposite side of the account are
the following items:
Outstanding traffic accounts..

Other outstanding accounts.

$54,023,83,8
But on the investigation of the largeast
item of outstanding accounts, $43,000,000, I
find -the various items, and amongst those
items is one of $14,301,302, which the Grand
Trunk Pacific owes to the Grand Trunk.
Those $14,000,000 I am not assuming to have
any value. Then, in addition, there are
other items in the account which are doubtless of the same class.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Vermont Central.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: And therefore it is impossible for nie, or anyone else in this
Chamber, to estimate the value of this. I
will take off another $10,000,000, in addition
to the $14,301,302, making a total of 824,301,302, leaving a balance of what it would be
fair to estimate as good accounts of $29,722,536. That, deducted from the gross liabilities, leaves a net liability of $268,382,254 as the actual net liability assumed by
the Government-the obligation which this
country will assume on taking over this
road, and it cannot be disputed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is that?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: $268,382,256. This corresponds almost exactly with the statement
given by the Minister of Railways in the
other House; but he arrived at his conclusion in a different way. He placed the
amount at $266,000,000 while I have placed
it at $268,000,000. He arrived at it by balancing the outstanding accounts on the
credit side against the accounts on the
debit side of the ledger which are payable

SENATE

out of operating revenue, and by se doing
he arrived at almost the same figure as I
have by estimating the current accounts
at $29,722,536. That makes the total cost
to this country as I have stated, and there
is no way of getting round it. You mnay talk
about $500,000,000 or $700,000,000, but I have
here the figures taken froin the balancesheets of the railway. These are the liabilities we assume. They are net the liabilities of the Grand Trunk railway; that is
a totally different thing. Honourable gentlemen take not only the liabilities of the
Grand Trunk, but the gross liabilities, allowing nothing for any assets, as the liability
for which the Government wil' become
liable, treating the conmon stock as though
it were a liability which we are to assume.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: On page 40, they
give the funded debt, bonds and debenturcs as $202,332,997, and the total held by
the public as $448,828,755.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: It is not possible for me
to take up now and analyze a page of figures
which I have not examined; but at page
38 there is a financial balance sheet of the
Grand Trunk Railway system as presented
te this louse in the blue-book.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

You said the figures

were absolutely correct.

Hon. Mr. SMIT'H: Thîey appear on page

with me and show me one that is incorrect.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

Hon. Mr SMITH: Yeu are taking another page. The page you refer to is not
the balance sheet of the Grand Trunk Railway. Surely the assets and liabilities of
the Grand Trunk Railway as presented in
the balance sheet should be tl e amount

the honourable gentleman to show a single

would be, that is the amount of the arbitrator's award in excess of the two and a half

we will arrive at the total liiabiliby which
the Government will assume. I understand

total maximum possible liability under the
arbitrator's award, if this amendment is
accepted, of $313,218,000, or $92,452 a mile,
for this splendid system.
On the other side of the account the

investment of $1,508,777, and material and
supplies on hand $6,407,195, or a total, if
we take their statemnent of what the road
cost theim and their supplies on band. of
$442,915,963, the cost of whieh to the Governuient of Canada cannot exceed $313,882,250. There is only one thing to add te that
and that is the obligation of the Grand
Trunk Railway to the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
That is to say, the obligation we will assume
by relieving the Grand Trunk, which is
$97,000,000. The remainder of the obligation
to the Grand Trunk we are already committed to. We cannot get rid of it. Honourable
gentlemen in diseussing this question assumve that we are entering into a new
obligation with the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
We have already an obligation of over $100,000,000 which w e cannot avoid. We have an
obligation wbether it is sold or not. and it
is not added te by a single cent by the purchase of the railwav further than the $97,000,000 referred to. The only tbing to addl is
the obligation of the Grand Trunk of $97,000,000 whiih we assume, and you iust add
that to the other oblication, making a total
of $313,000,000 plus $97,000,000, or $410,000,000.
What have we get for that? We have a
road unequalled in Canada. We have a road
in the tlickly-settled portions of Canada.
W\e have a road that has enormous possibilities and a potential value of I think at
least fifty per cent more than we will
bave to pay for it. I consider it an excellent
bargain, a magnificent bargain, for this
Governiment, situated as it is with 15,000
imiles of road on their hands, wbich tbey
should handle as efficiently as they can.
What have we got in the Grand Trunk? We
have a road, as I have stated, costing, outsilo of the obligation of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, only $92,454 a emile, a line doubletracked for 711 miles, running through the
mrost populous section of the Dominion of
Canada, a line where the population is not
126 te tlie mile, as my honourable friend
was depicting as the horrible condition in
Canada to-day, but a road where the population is 1,000 to the mile. It is the only
road in Canada that has a large population
to the mile, a road running through all our
principal cities, a road baving a right of

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
way and terminals in ail the great cities of
Ontario and in Montreal and many
other places in Quebec.
A road that has
this right of way and these terminals is of
immense value. Can anybody in this
assembly estimate the value of the right
of. way of the Grand Trunk Railway and
the value of their terminals in Montre],
Toronto and all the towns and cities? The
honourable Minister of Labour yesterday
mentioned eighty-eight of the chief towns
and cities of Ontario and Quebec, outside
of Montreal and Toronto, where the raiiway
ran. He referred to Buffalo, Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, and all the large places
between. The right of way and the terminals in these cities and towns could not
be bought for a hundred million dollars,
and that item is not mentioned in the
Grand Trunk estimates of the cost of their
road. Their estimate of the cost of the road
tnkes that in at cost, and they cost them
little or nothing %lien the road was built,
and yet they are worîii a hundred million
dollars to-day and possibly far more, and
we are getting them all.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Does the honourable gentleman suggest that the arbitrators
will take those figures as a guide to determine the figures of the common stock?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I understand the arbitrators are to be limited in the amount of
the value found. These are my estimates,
and the arbitrators may not place much
value on them.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It looks like an
invitation to, them to take your figures.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I think the arbitrators should be fair to-the Grand Trunj.
It is the pioneer road of the cwntry. It
has never received any bonuses or land
grants, except $15,000,000, in all these years.
It has served the country for seventy years,
and during half of that time we had no
other road and to-d.ay the Grand Trunk
would be making a great deal of money
for itself and serving the public if it had
not been for the tact that the Dominion
Governments granted charters for other
roads through the same territory. Here
for example, was the Grand Trunk with a
double track serving the country east of
Toronto, and they granted a charter for a
road to run alongside of them. The Grand
Trunk had a line along the north shore of
lake Ontario and there was no excuse for
the Government to charter another .lino
on that route; but the Canadian Pacifie
railway received a charter and built alongside, and have taken half their traffic away.

325

The Canadian Northern also got a charter,
and they built another line. So there are
three lines now competing for the traffie
which the Grand Trunk could have
carried.
I say under the
circumstances the Grand Trunk have a good
right to make a claim
that they
have not been fairly treated by the people
of Canada, and therefore I think the honourable Minister of the Interior, when he
stated that we should treat the Grand
Trunk fairly and generously, is not stating
more than he should have stated, taking all
these things into consideration.
In addition to getting a line of railyay
which is said to have cost $434,000,O0 to
build, and these terminals and rights of
way of great value, we are getting proper
connections which are invaluable.
The
honouraible Minister of Labour yesterday
enumerated the various connections we had
in the United States. We draw from the
United States an enormous volume of business; we have always done so, and I presume we always will. I do not know what
the value of the imports from the United
States would be in the last few years; but
I know the figures are enormous. We are
perhaps drawing half of that over the
Grand Trunk railway. It is an enormous
trade. The National railway ends at Toronto. As the Minister of Labour stated
yesterday, it has no connection with the
United States from whence ail this enormous traffic comes. The Grand Trunk have
all these magnificent coniections and terminals at Buffalo, Detroit, Ohicago and Portland, and a connecting line between all
these places, and they have built up a business with the United States of enormous
proportions and of immense value. If we
take over this road we get the benefit of all
that. It will be an immense benefit to the
National railway. Honourable gentlemen
on the other side of the House have spoken
on this questionHon. Mr. POWER: And some on the
Government side.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: On both sides of the
House. They have only one answer as to
why we should not take over the Grand
Trunk railway. The answer is that we can
make traffle arrangements *ith it. I
submit that traffic arrangement with the
railways ie not a good solution. I submit
that under a traffic arrangement it is the
shipper that has the direction of the traffic
and under such an arrangement, no matter
what an arrangement was made, we could
not depend upon getting the whole volume

326

SENATE

of the traffic. The shipper has the right to
direct the route of the traffic, and he would
direct the traffic to suit the pleasure of the
gathering road, and therefore traffic arrangement is of little value. The position is
worse than that of the manufacturer who
rented a building to carry on his business,
or the farmer who rented a farm to carry
on farming. A farmer s-hould own a farin
in order to carry on farming proshould
manufacturer
a
and
perly
desires to
own a building if he
carry on a manufacturing business satisfactorily. But this is entirely different froin
that. It is ten times worse, because the
Governoment could not compel the Grand
Trunk railway to direct that traffic to the
connecting lines if they did not desire to do
so. The shipper bas the directing of it.
Further than that, would we not have to
cancel the obliga-tion of the Grand Trunk
to the Grand Trunk Pacific? Can you expect the Grand Trun'k to go on with that
obligation of $97,OO0,000 hanging over their
heads under tbe traffic arrangement? It
would be absolutely absurd to expect tbat.
If we entered into a traffic arrangement for
a long term of years-and unless it were for
a long term it would be useless-that obligation would be cancelled. I submit we
are going to get the value of the obligation
and we could not get it at any other time.
Under other circumstances, at any other
time that a railway camie to this Dominion
they had the Government caught. To-day
we have the railway caught. To-day it is
the railway company that bas its foot in the
frog of the railway, so to speak. We have
themn at our mercy. Previdusly the railways
always had us at their mercy to a certain
extent, and now the position is changed and
we have an opportunity to make an excellent bargain. Now that we have this railway at our mercy, although I want to treat
them generously, I want to take advantage
of the opportunity and make a good bargain to get a good piece of road to round
out our systlem and give us a good road, if
governient roads can be made profitable.
It is suggested by the amnendment before
the House that we should delay the matter.
Why delay? Everybody has had an opportunity. Suppose that it be found after more
minute and careful consideration-although
II contend nothing could be found of any
essential importance-that there was a further obligation of a few millions, it would
not change my opinion in the least, and I
do not think it would change the opinion
of any honourable gentleman who had
studied the question thoroughly with a disHon. Mr.

iSMITH.

interested mind, because we need the road,
and the cost of a few million dollars
would neither be here nor there. This
is too big an issue. It is a matter
of too great importance to permit a
small matter to stand in our way.
We have the railway company at our
mercy. Now is the time to secure that
railway which we desire on fair and equitable and cheap terms.
The arguments that have been advanced
in this House have largely been against
government ownership. As I stated before,
this is not a question of government ownership. We already have government ownership on a large scale, and this is only an
addition to round out the system, to help
to make it profitable, or less unprofitable.
I have not heard anything in the debate
yet with regard to the disadvantages that
might accrue from the acquisition of this
railway to the maritime ports.
Hints have been thrown out, and I understand that sone members have it in
their nind that there will be discrimination
against our Canadian maritime ports. I
cannot understand how any honourable
gentleman can corne to any conclusion of
that nature. Is the Government of Canada
going to divert traffic from its own ports to
Portland to a greater extent than a private
company would? It seems to me one has
only to state the case in that way to show
the absurdity of any such contention. The
Government of Canada has spent large
sums of money in developing St. John and
Halifax. Are they going to divert traffic
from those ports to Portland, purposely to
a greater extent than the Grand Trunk
Railway Company bas done?
Hon. Ms. DANDURAND: Does the honourable gentleman hope that the traffic
from Portland will be diverted to St. John
and Halifax?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I can say only this,
that if it can possibly be diverted, whatever loss may accrue to the Atlantic and St.
Lawrence railways would be made up by
the railways of Canada. We would net
stand to lose. If at some future time it
should transpire that we could carry all the
traffic to our own ports profitably and
leave Portland to look after itself, it may
at sone tiie in the future, it iight becone
profitable and possible to divest ourselves
of those American railways in the Eastern
States. I do not think it will be donc, but
it would be possible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the bonourable gentleman has said that the shipper

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
had the first and last word to say as to the
routing of his freight.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What inducement can be given to the Canadian shipper
If he insists upon paying the cheaper rate
on the shorter haul to Portland, instead of
the rate to St. John?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I am assuming the
rates will not be cheaper, but will be the
same. The direction of the shipper is the
'deciding factor, if the 'Government own the
Grand Trunk just as if the Grand Trunk
Company owns it. If the Grand Trunk
Company owns the road, the shipper will
direct his freight possibly to suit the interests of the Grand Trunk agent with
whom he makes arrangement. It generally
does not matter to the shipper which way
he ships his freight. If the Grand Trunk
agent is soliciting the shipper as to which
way to ship, he will send his goods to Portland; but if it is a government agent who
is soliciting the shipper, iV will be to his
interest to solicit the shipper to send to
Canadian ports, provided the rate is the
same.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
rate is the same.

Provided the

Hon. Mr. SMITH: 0f course, you can
hardly expect the shipper to do otherwise.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then, would it
be advantageous for Canada to carry freight
at a loss by carrying it at the same rate
to St. John as to Portland?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: That is a question
for a railway man to answer. I could not
answer that. It is a fact, however, that
millions of tons of freight are carried at
very low rates because of the long haul.
The loading and unloading are the same
in both'cases, and then in theong-distance haul there are sometimes countervailing advantages which would more than
make up for the long haul. In this case
for instance it might be to the national
interest to have our own ports used instead' of Portland; that might be of sufficient advantage to Canada to compensate
for the loss to the treasury from hauling
the goods a little farther than they would
have to be hauled to Portland.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
I suppose the
honourable gentleman is of opinion that
the Railway Board should have no say
in matters of that kind?

327

Hon. Mr. SMITH: The Railway Board
cannot govern the direction of the freight
by the shipper. The Railway Board have
no right to compel the shipper to ship his
goods as they or 'the railway company
may wish. The shippers' rights have always been respected.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But it is the Railway Board that controls the rates.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And prevents discrimination as to rates. Therefore the
Government system of railways would be
subject, I suppose, to the regulations of
the Railway Board.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes, I agree to that.
But what does the honourable gentleman
assume? That the Railway Board is going
to compel the Government railways to
haul the freight over the Government roads
at a higher rate?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, but I assume
thie, that the Railway Board would protect the shipper to the extent of allowing
him to choose his own route.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And to get the benefit of lower rates.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And therefore that
the rates would not of necessity be equal
for Halifax, St. John and Portland.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes. If they were
not, the shipper, having the choice of
routes, would probably choose Portland as
he does now, and the Government roads
would not suffer; we would be in exactly
the same position as we are now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then we would
not be improving our position by buying
the Grand Trunk.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Nor making it worse
either.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: We would not be
making it worse, and we would have many
advantages. There would be an advantage
in the interchange of traffic, for instance.
Let me cite to honourable gentlemen this
example. Under the present arrangement,
under private ownership, there is an enormous volume of traffic shipped from Ontario
and Quebec to the western provinces. The
Grand Trnk gathers it up and takes it
to North Bay. That is the end of the Grand
Trunk line. They may direct it over the

SENATE
SENATE

328

328

Canadian Pacific railway. If the Grand
Trunk were owned by the Government, the
Government's agent soliciting the shipment
would encourage the shipper to send it alh
the way through by the government route
from North Bay, and the Government road
from North Bay to the West would get the
benefit of all that freight, which might
otherwise go by the Canadian Pacific railway.
Could not the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
same resulte be obtained by a traffic arrangementHon. Mr. SMITH: No.
froni
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -since
North Bay we have a shorter route to Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Not at all; because it
would not be to the interest of the Grand
Trunk agent in soliciting that consignment
from the shipper, to have it go by the
Government any more than by the Canadian Pacific railway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But under an
agreeinent there would be an obligation
on the part of the Grand Trunk to send it
by the government route.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: But the agreement
could not control the shipper, and the
agent of the Grand Trunk can suggest to
the shipper anything he likes, and the
traffic arrangement would not apply-would
have no effect. The shipper chooses his
route and he may do so at the instigation
of the Grand Trunk agent or he may not.
At any rate, the Grand Trunk in that case
would be neutral, and the shipper would
have to decide between the two routes;
whereas if the Grand Trunk is owned by
the Government it would not be neutral
but would solicit the shipper to ship by the
Government road via North Bay. The Goveynmient would thereby get nearly all the
traffic, because the agent of the road can
almost always induce the shipper to ship
whichever way the agent likes.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Would the honourable
member allow me to ask him a question?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: The honourable member has said several times that the company
was at the mercy of the Government.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: If the company is at
the mercy of the Government, cannot the
Government force the company to make
Hon. Mr. SMITH.

as to connections,
such arrangements
traffic interchange, etc., as are in the interest of the country, and oblige the company to respect those arrangements?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I -have just answered
that question. The honourable gentleman
evidently did not gather the force of my
argument. No matter what traffic arrangement you may make, the Grand Trunk
agent cannot compel the shipper to ship
in any way except the way the shipper
wishes to have his goods sent.
Even under
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
government ownership?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: No; not even under
government ownership can he do so.
Now, I want to say, honourable gentlemen, that we require only a little courage.
It seems to me that many honourable gentlemen who have spoken upon this question
are timid. That is all that is the matter
with them-timidity. This is no obligation.
It is said that we are going to enter into
an enormous obligation; that we have to
borrow a great deal of money. I have naned
the obligation. We do not have to borrow
one dollar. The money is already borrowed,
and it is all on long terms-thirty years and
more, nearly all of it. There is only a small
portion of the notes immediately due.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: What portion?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I have not the exact
figures. The equipment notes look after
themselves. The current liabilities of the'
road, which are looked after by the incoming traffic, are $22,000,000, and the short
date notes, $35,000,000. Now, suppose that
we had to pay at an early date the. whole
Honourof that: that is only $50,000,000.
able gentlemen say that the Grand Trunk
is not in good condition, that it will cost
$50,000,000 to put it into first class condition. All I can say as to that is that the
Ministergf Labour showed yesterday that
Mr. Mountain, the engineer of the Board of
Railway Commissioners, has been over the
road lately and reported that it is in good
condition. I myself am a shipper. I have
been shipping in a considerable way for the
last forty years and have had a good deal
to do with the railways of Canada. I have
had occasion every year to order hundreds
of cars, and during the past two or three
years I have been able to get cars, and
good cars more quickly from the Grand
Trunk Railway than. from the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. What does that show? It
shows to me that the Grand Trunk have

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
plenty of equipment. Their equipment for
the last twenty years has been good.
I
have always been able to get cars from the
Grand Trunk more readily than from the
Canadian Pacifie Railway; not that the
Canadian Pacifie Railway is short of equipment, but they are shorter of equipment in
Ontario, at any rate, than the Grand Trunk.
I have, as I say, always been able to get
cars from the Grand Trunk and have been
able during the past two years to get them
more rea.dily than from the Canadian Pacific
Railway.
That, to my mind, disposes of
part, at any rate, of the argument that the
Grand Trunk is short of equipment. If they
had been short of equipment I would have
been pinched for cars and would have been
told that I could get them the next day or
the day after, but I was always able to get
cars promptly from'the Grand Trunk.
As te the condition of the roadbed, Mr.
Mountain bas described it as he saw it.
Any honourable gentlemen in this House,
especially those from the province of
Ontario who are travelling daily over
the Grand Trunk lines, would - state,
if they were asked, that those lines
are in excellent condition.
I would
not say there is not a better line on the
continent of America; perhaps that would
be going too far; but I do state that there
is not a better line in Canada than the
line from Montreal te Sarnia. It is doubletracked. It is always in perfect condition.
Trains can run over it at 60 miles an hour
if required, and they often run at 50 miles
an hour. And in other sections of the
country the Grand Trunk has a splendid
road. There is a tunnel under the St.
Clair river owned by this road, and there
are connections there with the United
States. We have the facilities for gathering
up traffic in the United States, in Chicago,
that great depot where traffic is collected
from all over the western states.
The
Grand Trunk have terminals right in the
centre of that city. What would the people of Canada have to pay to-morrow if
the Grand Trunk were blotted out overnight and they wanted to build it again?
And. would they net want to build it again?
Is there a man in Canada who would net
want it replaced? What would replacement cost? Honourable gentlemen, I- fully
believe it would cost, at the very least,
more than 50 Per cent more than we are
paying for it, to build it, at prices prevailing before the war. It is costing us by
this agreement about $92,000 a mile. Sir
Adam Beck in 1916, before prices had
raised, before wages had advanced, before

329

the cost of materials that go into the construction of a road had advanced, sent his
surveyors and engineers te lay out a road
from the town of Mimico, a little west of
Toronto through the city of Hamilton and
on to the Niagara frontier. How much do
you think was the estimated cost of that
road? $190,000 a mile.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: An electrie road.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: An electrie road, and
single-tracked, and this is double-tracked
for 711 miles. vo you suppose the engineers or Sir Adam Beck representing the
municipalities of Ontario would have stated
a figure higher than they thought it would
cost, when he was appealing te the electors
of the various municipalities to vote enormous sums of money to build that road? I
do not think so. I never saw or heard of a
man that would do that. I think the reports
of his engineers must have been correct,
and they estimated that it would cost $190,000 a mile-why? Because of the right of
way through the city of Hamilton and St.
Catharines-and the Grand Trunk railway
have a right of way through a hundred cities
and towns, and have terminals in cities and
towns net only in Canada, but in the United
States, worth untold sums that we cannot
estimate. ý
We talk about net believing in publie
owners!hip. As I eaid in beginning, bonourable gentlemen, in general I do net believe in public ownership. I do net believe that public utilities can be quite as
economically carried on under public ownership as under private ownership; but we
must not forget that there is quite a margin between the cost of the article sometimes, and the selling price, and if government ownership projects are net managed quite as well as they would be under
private ownership, it will net cost the people any more if the Government sells at
cost. There are exceptions, however, as I
said before. There is no great principle
that I know of te wbich there are net exceptions. This is one of the exceptions.
This is a case wbere we already own 15,000
miles, many of them unprofitable, and I
want to buy something te make, them profitable.
Another exception is the construction of
the hydro-electrie lines in Ontario. I supported that in the beginning and I have
supported it up te now. Why? It was an
exception te the general principle because
in Ontario we have no coal. Ontario is an
industrial province; there are vast industries there, the products of which were

SENATE
mentioned yesterday by the honourable the
Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
Ontario produces over 50 per cent of the
manufactured products of the whole Dominion. We want to increase those products. It is a good thing for us to try to
increase them. To do it we require cheap
and certain power. Twenty years ago we depen'ded on the United States for the coal to
carry on those industries; therefore, as an
exception to the general rule, I supported
the Government of Ontario entering into
an arrangement with the municipalities
whereby they could buy power and sell it
at cost. Coal may play out. The good-will
of the United States may play out, but
Niagara falls will flow on forever, and we
have that perennial and everlasting source
of energy in our own hands. That is an
exception, which I support. I honestly
believe that many honourable gentlemen
in this House have confused the generai
principle with the exceptions.
Because
they are disbelievers in government ownership on general principles they disapprove
of this bargain, which is an important exception. It seems to me that if we fail to
take advantage of this exception we will
be sorry, generations after us will be sorry.
I think it is the best bargain, and as I said
before the only good bargain the Government
has ever made with railways. We have the
Grand Trunk Railway fast, and having them
fast, we can make a good bargain and at the
saine time be generous with them; and I
only hope that the timid ones will have
courage. If a business man were to be as
timid as some honourable gentlemen are,
what would become o? the great industries
of this country? Did our manufacturers show
such timidity during the war when by enterprise and courage they built up an enormous
fabric, an enormous production, and trained
tens of thousands of men to become skilled
men, and placed Ontario and the Dominion of Canada generally, as a manufacturing country, in the forefront of nations? It
was not by timidity, but by a judicious
study of the question and by courage.
Wisdom is no good in enterprise and business without courage. Anybody who bas
studied this question must come to the
conclusion that this is a good bargain, and
that all we have to do is to go forward now
and not wait two or three or four months.
Conditions are as good now as they ever
will be. Now is the time to take advantage
of this opportunity, and in my judgment
there is no good occasion for delay.
Hon. Mr. SMITH.

I do not know that I have anything more
to say. I hope the amendment will be defeated.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, there are a few observations that I
should like to make in connection with the
question before the House, but it is now 10
minutes to 6, and inasmuch as I have sat
here all day, subject to floods of talk,
eloquent as a rule, I think perhaps the
House will agree that the Speaker should
call it 6 o'clock. The only promise I can
make is that J shall not make the longest
speech in the -debate.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Before the honourable gentleman proceeds with his speech, I
desire to call the attention of this honourable body to a telegram that was read in
this House this morning by the honourable
leader of the Opposition. It is as follows:
Winnipeg, Man., Nov. 5.
Hon. Senator Bostock,
The Senate,
Ottawa, Ont.
MacLean of Winnipeg Board of Trade has
Please
wired Speaker of Senate as follows:
take notice that Winnipeg Board of Trade with
a membership of over twenty-two hundred at
general meeting November fourth overwhelmingly defeated a resolution presented supporting
Grand Trunk Bill on ground that public bas
not been informed and details as to liabilities
and obligations are not available and on further
ground that only report available shows stock
to be worthless. Strong feeling expressed that
receivership is proper method of procedure.
J. S. Adamson.

I thought that there was something very
peculiar about the telegram and I sent a
message to the editor-in-chief of the Winnipeg Tribune, Mr. J. J. Moncrief, and asked

him to confirm the message if he could. In
answer I received the following:
Hon. L. McMeans,
.Senate, Ottawa, Ont.
W. H. Carter, President of Winnipeg Board
of Trade, said to-day: "Our Board bas not
pronounced on Grand Trunk Bill In any manner.
Resolution on question came before meeting,
but on motion it was resolved that the resolution be laid on table and there it is to-day.
Members expressed the opinion that they had
not sufficient data before them at the moment
to discuss the matter intelligently. Minutes of
Board which I have seen bear out President
Carter's statement.
John J. Moncrief.

I can only say that I thought it very
extraordinary that the Winnipeg Board of
Trade should pass a resolution cf that kind
without any mention of it appearing in the

NOVEMBER 6; 1919
press of this country; but the moment the
honourable gentleman read the message,
from my knowledge of the gentleman who
signed it I knew there was something
wrong about it. Mr. Adamson is a gentleman not entirely unknown: it was he
who at the last Liberal convention
brought out telegrams which caused a long
debate in the 'Commons, which I need not
refer to. I think some step should be
taken so that the members of this House
may not be subject to having telegrams
of that kind sent to them in order to mislead
the House.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Of course, the honourable gentleman understands that that
telegram was sent to me. The other telegram, I understand, was sent to the honourable the Speaker by (Mr. iMaclean.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Well, here is the
answer to it.
The telegram
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the honourable gentleman received was not
in cipher?
Hon. 'Mr. MdMEANS: No, not in cipher.
If it had been in cipher Lt probably would
have been in the possession of the Opposition.

Hon. L. G. POWER:

Honourable gen-

tlemen, I do not purpose troubling the

House for any great length of time. The
question which is before us has been dealt
with by honourable gentlemen who have
thought over the question and studied it
deeply, and I feel that it would be only attempting to paint the lily if I were to undertake to do over again the work which those
gentlemen have done very much better than
I could do it. I simply wish to make a few
observations, not as an expert, but as what
we may call a man in the street, giving the
impressions that would naturally be made
upon the mind of a man of that kind.
I think that in dealing with a question
of this sort, particularly in a body like the
Senate, where we are not supposed to have
the same sort of political feeling that they
have in another place, the right thing is to
look at the facts of the 'case and to consider
them in a calm and businesslike way.
I think, honourable gentlemen, that if we
deal with the Bill that is before us in that
frame of mind we shall do better than by
getting warmed up or showing anything in
the nature of temper.
The first thing is to find out what
are
There
really is.
the proposal
various estimates, honourable gentlemen,
of the amount which this measure, if
it goes into operation, will add to the

331

liabilities of this country. These estimates vary from about $300,000,000 to
something in excess of $500,000,000. I am
not going to enter into the details of the
matter. I have been reminded of the ballad
by John Hay, called "The Mystery of
Gilgal," where two gentlemen came into
Taggart's bar together and ordered a drink,
and Taggart, the landlord, mixed the drink
and clapped it smoking on the bar. The
man telling the story goes on to say:
Some says three fingers,
Some says two;
I leave the choice to you.

Now, honourable gentlemen, some say
$300,000,000, some say $500,000,000; I leave
the choice to you.
An Hon. SENATOR: It is neither.
Hon. Mr. POWER: As to it being neither,
I think I can show that it is either. If
one turns to the Commons Hansard of this
session, page 1443, he will find that the
Minister of Railways said:
I have stated that the total llabilities in connection with the debenture stock are $266,023,750.03.. Then on page 39 of the blue-book we
have additional liabilities as follows:
Firét preference 5% stock.. .. $ 1.6,643,999.78
Second preference 5% stock. .. 12,312,666.50
Third preference 4% stock.. .. 34,884,534.95
Total preference stocks..$ 6·3,841,201.23
Common stock.. .. .. .. .. .. 116,583,124.44
Total -preference and common .
stocks.. .. .. .. .. .. $180,424,325.67
Then, on the next page he says:
The debenture and guaranteed stocks amounted to $2.66,023,750.00, and the net fixed charges
$11,573,525.45. We have to add to that, $180,424,325.67. Then there are equipment not3s
amounting to $58,181,1,36.14, making a total
of $504,629,211.84.
And in that he says the Grand Trunk
Pacific and the American roads represent
a total of $275,000,000. Then, on page 1447
he says:
The total liabilities of the Grand Trunk RailThe amount
way systen are $2616,023,750.03.
that the Grand Trunk railway system has guar.
anted is $18,936,377.29; so that if you add
$266,023,750.0,3 to $18,936,377.29, you have the
funded debt plus any amount that may ba
awarded.
And he says in answer to Mr. Cahill:
"The total is $284,960,127, plus any amount
the arbitrators may award.' Bo honourable

gentlemen will see that

practically

the

lowest estimate, the estimate made by the
minister introducing the measure, puts the
liability at $300,000,000.
Then, Mr. Rowell sums it up again. He
says:

SENATE
Now, I will sum up these figures in order that
hon. members may see how they stand.
The
funded debt amounts to $20,5,190,417.52
guaranteed stock $60,833,332.51; guarantees an
American lines, $18,936,377.29; total on Grand
Trunk and subsidiary companies, irrespectie
of Grand Trunk Pacifie, $284,980,127.32. If you
wish to take in the Grand Trunk Pacifie and
its branch lines, add $216,253,111 to that and
you get a total of $501,2.33,238,
So, honourable gentlemen, we are asked
to add to the debt of this country at least

$300,000,000.

Even if we had not already a

debt of over two billions of dollars that
would be a serions proposition, and il would

be justified only by the most absolute necessity. Convenience would not justify our
adding any such sum as that to the national debt. It is not necessary to add
any strength to that statement; but we
have the fact that the hon. member who
sits in that Chamber, and who was for
some years Minister of Finance, came before a committee of the House of Commons
and proved to a demonstration that the
country could not afford to add anything
considerable to its present liabilities.
I quite agree with Sir Thomas White in
his view then, but it shakes one's fàith in
gentlemen who occupy prominent positions
in public life when we find the same gentleman, who had appeared before the committee of the Commons, and proved to them
that they could not afford to devote any
millions, to a certain purpose, within a
week or ten days coming before the House
of Commons and stating in that House that
the country should undertake an expenditurc involving not less than $300,000,000.
They say appeal from Philip drunk to
Philip sober; but in which case was he
sober? Was it the Philip who advocated
econony and the refraining from going into
further debt who was sober, or was it the
Philip wbo advocated the immediate assunption of a debt of over $300,000,000 who
was sober? It is not necessary to labour the
question that we are doing a very serions
thing, or proposing to do a very serious
thing, when we propose .to add over $300,000,000 to the debt of this country.
I have understood one or two gentlemen
in this Chamber to say-and I see the statement has been made by ministers in the
other Chamber-that there was no alternative. It was that or nothing-that the
Grand Trunk Company was in such a condition that the road had to be taken over,
because otherwise the road would not
continue to run. In some remarks I made
on the l5th of October I suggested an alternative, and that was that the GovernHon. Mr. POWER.

ment should relieve the Grand Trunk Company from all liabilities in connection with
the Grand Trunk Pacifie, and that, if that
were donc, the Grand Trunk Company
would be able to carry on as it had been
doing before the war. That is, I think,
oade clear in various statements that have
appeared. Last year the surplus of the
Grand Trunk Company was over a million
dollars, and previous to the war the average
surplus was about $4,000,000 a year, and if
the Grand Trunk Company were relieved
of the burden of the Grand Trunk Pacifia
the company could go on. Now pictures
have been drawn of the wretched conditions
of the Grand Trunk Pacifia Company;
but I have doubted the correctness of these
dark pictures, and I was pleased this afternoon to hear the honourable gentleman
froi St. Catharines (Hon. Mr. Smnith) telling us that the Grand Trunk w'as a magnificent institution, that it was run in the
most satisfactory and businesslike mnanner, and that its plant was in good condition.
If that is the case, if the Grand
Trunk Company are freed from the incubus
of the Grand Trunk Pacifia, and if they are
prepared to continue to give an admirable
service, which, as we learn from the honourable gentleman from St. Catharines
(Hon. Mr. Smith) they are now giving, why
should the
country pay $300,000,000 to
transfer the control of that railway and its
work from the Company to the iGovernment? Will the Government run the road
any better than it is being run now? I trow
not. The honourable gentleman will probably not say that the Intercolonial railway and the Grand Trunk Pacifia have been
conducted in a better way than the Grand
Trunk is at present.
I call attention to the fact that before
this measure came before the House I had
spoken of this alternative. I was not aware
at the time that this alternative had been
suggested from any other source. But I
find now, on further information, and particularly after the speech made by the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) that my humble view is
sustained by very high authorities indeed.
The honourable gentleman from De Lorimier read an offer made in February this
year to do practically what I have suggested. There is in the bluebook a telegram from Mr. Kelley to Sir Thomas
White, which reads:
I have accordingly suggested to the Board
that the Governrnent should take over Gran-t
Trunk Pacific railw ay and the Branrh Lines
Company, repaying ta the Grand Trunk all lridebtedness, and that Grand Trunk should ent'r

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
into a traffic agreement with the Government
by which Grand Trunk should become the eastern connection of the Canadian Government
railways and the Canadian Government railways should become the western connection (f
the Grand Trunk, interchanging at North Bay;
Grand Trunk to operate at cost all the eastern
Unes of the Canadian Northern railway; Grand
Trunk to undertake to spend upon improvements
and additions to its terminais and other facilities such portion of the money owing by the
Grand Trunk Pacifia railway and Branch Linas
Company, which would be repaid by the Government and which might be necessary for the
efficient handling of the combined through business. This plan would enable the company to
continue operation of its American lines an-i
secure all of the advantages therefrom both to
the company and to Canada by reason of the
control and movement of international competitive traffic over its lines and through Canada.

The answer was a direct negative from Sir
Thomas White, and reads:
Replying your message received through

Scott, your conclusion respecting our interview
entirely unwarranted. Proposal made in your
cable cannot be entertained.

I think it would be well if the Government took that view, but I find that not
only has this alternative been suggested
early in the year, but it was referred to
in the report of the Drayton-Acworth Commission. On page 1470 of the Commons
Hansard it is stated that Mr. Smith recommends that the Government should leave
the Canadian Pacifie and the Grand Trunk
alone, and that they should release the
Grand Trunk from their obligations as
regards the Grand Trunk Pacifie. Mr.
Smith is head of one of the very greatest
railway corporations in North America, and
he was a member of this commission, and
you see he was decidedly opposed to government ownership, and was in favour of the
scheme which I had the honour to suggest
to the House some three weeks ago. As it
is now, if this Bill passes and becomes law,
the liabilities of Canada will be increased
by at least $300,000,000. If the alternative
scheme were adopted, they would not be
increased at all.
You may say: "Well, you would have to
take the place of the Grand Trunk, which
has guaranteed somo $97,000,000 fer the
Grand Trunk Pacifie." But honourable
gentlemen will see that if this Bill -passes
and becomes law the Government are not
relieved from the burden of the Grand
T'unk Pacifie.
They have to carry
that; and in the one case, if they adopt
the plan suggested by Mr. Smith and MÉ.
Kelley, really the country is not called
upon to pay anything on account of the
Grandi Trunk and you get the Grand Trunk
practically for nothing; because, if the Bill
passes, then the country bas to assume the

Grand Trunk Pacifie, and that is the worst
that can happen under the alternative.
A good deal of stress is laid by some
honourable gentlemen on the statement that
the acquiring of the Grand Trunk would
give eastern connections with the Grand
Trunk Pacific. I fail to see how the transfer
of the control of the Grand Trunk from
the company to the Government is going
to improve the connections. The connections would be just the same, and the
Government are in as good a position as
the company to enter into traffic arrangements with the Grand Trunk. At any rate,
there are two lines from Winnipeg into
Ontario, so that the Grand Trunk Pacifie
would not be dependent upon the Grand
Trunk at all. I think any one who listened
carefully to the speech of the honourable
gentleman from Cape Breton (Hon. Mr.
McLennan) this afternoon must have felt
that this was a day of peace among railway
companies, and that if the Grand Trunk
were ever disposed to act somewhat ir. the
way of a curmudgeon, that time has passed
away. At any rate, if therewere any difficulty
made by the Grand Trunk about entering
into a reasonable arrangement the Railway Commission could settie that. Since
the Railway Commission has been ,n operation I think there has been very "ittle
ground of complaint of the polic'ies of the
different railway companies. Some honourable gentleman-I do not remember just now
who it was-said that the position of the
Grand Trunk was exactly the saine as the
position of the Grand Trunk Pacifie at the
present time. The honourable gentleman
who made that statement no doubt believed
he was stating what was correct, but he
was not, because we have evidence that if
the Grand Trunk Company are reliev-ed of
the burden of the Grand Trunk Pacifie, they
can carry on, and there will be no necessity
for selling them out or forec'losing, or any'thing of that sort, -and everybody knows
that the Grand Trunk Pacifie cannot carry
on. I think during the past year there
bas been a deficit of over $10,000,000 on the
operation of the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
I do not propose to enter into what might
be looked upon as a more or less personal
discussion; but I could not help being somewhat surprised when the honourable leader
of the Government spoke of the Government
as having had a mandate to take over the
Grand Trunk at the election of 1917. No
honourable gentleman could preserve a
straight face and make the statement that
that question came in any sense before the
electorate in the election of 1917.

SENATE

334

I only wish to say two or three words
with respect to the manner in which the
question has been discussed in this House.
I think, as a member of the Senate, that
I should feel proud of the ability which
has been shown in dealing with this question here and the tone in which the -question
has been discussed. Being the oldest member of the Senate, I naturaflly have a deep
concern in its good repute, and I think the
discussing of this Bill in this House must
tend very much to raise us in the opinion
of our fellow-citizens.
I simply say, in conclusion, that if the
alternative which was suggested by Mr.
Smith three years ago, I think, and suggested by Mr. Kelley in the beginning of
this year, is ýacted upon, the debt of the
country will not be increased a dollar,
and I cannot understand how any one who
is interested in the reputation and the wel-

fare of this country can vote to place that
additional three or four hundred million
dollars on the shouilders of a population
that is already carrying too much debt.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Ilonourable gentlemen: Speaking at this late hour, after so
many able speeches have been made on this
question, J cannot be expected to deal with
the matter at all thoroughly without
repeating a good many things that have
been said, not only by members of this
House, but also by the press, which has,
within the ilast two or three weeks, given
special consideration to the question. I
refer esipecially to the Montreal Gazette,
and I join my honourable friend the member for De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
in what he has said in regard to that paper.
That paper is I believe the best-made papor
on the continent of America.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And, although I do
not always see eye to eye with the Montreal'
Gazette, I recognize that there are in that
paper, on all questions engaging the attention of the publie from day to day, most
mature and well-reasoned articles. My only
excuse for following so many honourable
members who have already spoken is the
importance of the question which is
engaging the attention of the Senate
I have been in this House since 1902 and
I do not think there ever was a question of
such importance as the one that is now
before this honourable body. In the remarks
which I desire to make, I propose to take
up at the outset the position of the Grand
Trunk towards the Dominion of Canada, its
Hon. Mr. POWER.

indebtedness to the country, and to consider
also what is the position of the Dominion
of Canada, morally or otherwise, towards
the Grand Trunk Railway. I will then take
up the merits of the Bill and give the
several reasons why I am against it.
In dealing with the first point, I shall
have to go somewhat into the genesis of the
Grand Trunk Pacific. As you are aware, in
1902 Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was then
Prime Minister, was approached by the late
Mr. Hays, then general manager of the
Grand Trunk, who complained that the
Grand Trunk could not properly compete
with the Canadian Pacifie, and stated that,
in order to be placed on an equal footing,
they would require to extend their lines to
the Northwest. The letter was dated November 3, 1902, and was signed by Mr. Hays
and Mr. Wainwriglht. I will dispense with
the reading of the letter. I am sure it is
known to all honourable members of this
House; but I will read a few extracts from
it:
Your petitioners desire to memorialize your
Government in regard to the construction of a
first-class line of railway from the north"rn
terminus of the Grand Trunk railway at, or
near, North Bay, Ont., through to the Pacifie
coast, for the reasons and upon the conditions
herein set forth:First: That it be considered very desirable
and in the public interest that there should e,
without any unnecessary delay, a second transcontinental railway reaching from the Atlantic
ocean to the Pacifie ocean, in order that additional facilities may he provided for the large
and growing business of the Northwest, which
might otherwise find its outlet through American
channels.
That your petitioners propose, as
Second:
soon a's authorized by your Government to
undertake the construction of such a line from
North Bay, Ont., or some other point north
thereof, to be defined, to the Pacifie coast, the
terminus to he at or near Port Simpson; with
ail necessary branches along the route, to be
designated.
That your petitioners therefore ask
Third:
that their application for authority to construct
such a line of railway to be called the Grand
Trunk Pacifie Railway shall he granted.
Eighth: That in order to provide for connection with the Atlantic seaboard, all the year
round and through an all-British territory route,
your petitioners will be prepared to enter into
an arrangement with the Government for an
interchange of traffic or other satisfactory agreement with the Intercolonial railway at Montreal, or such other proposal as the Government
p1ay submit.
Ninth: That your petitioners would have the
advantage of ail the eastern connections, in
Ontario and Quebec, of the Grand Trunk railway, and by this means (on the completion of
the transcontinental line) there would be established and opened up a complete system from
ocean to ocean.

Mnr. Hays w as suggesting there what has
been su-gested by several members of this

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
honourable House-a traffic agreement in
order to meet the difficulty and to meet it
by means of a traffic agreement between the
government-owned and operated railway,
the Intercolonial, and the Grand Trunk
Pacific which it was proposed to construct
as a transcontinental line.
On referring to the statutes of 1902,
ehapter 50, sanctioned May 15, 1902, and to
the statutes of 1903, chapter 97, sanctioned
on June 25, 1903-it will be seen that the
Canadian Northern Railway was authorized
to extend its lines from the city of Quebec
to the Pacifie coast and to construct branch
lines covering the better portions of the
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and
Alberta, also branch lines to Ottawa and to
Montreal. It was only on the 24th of
October, 1903, and therefore a year subsequent to the passing of the first Act, and
several months subsequent to the passing
of the second Act, that the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Railway Company was incorporated,
with r>ower to construct a line of railway
from Moncton to Winnipeg, and from Winnipeg to Port Simpson or Bute Inlet on the
Pacifie coast, passing through Battleford,
Edmonton, Dunvegan and river La Paix;
and also the branch lines mentioned in
these statutes.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier and no doubt the
other members of his Cabinet were anxious
to satisfv the ambition of the management
of the Grand Trunk railway; but they were
equally anxious to bring the Grand Trunk
railway and the Mackenzie and Mann interests together, in order that a second transcontinental line only should be built. Early
in the spring of 1903, at Sir Wilfrid Laurier's suggestion, negotiations were. opened
between the late Sir Rivers Wilson, then
president of the Grand Trunk railway, and
Mr. Hays on the one part, and Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann on the other part, with
the view of conciliating both interests. I
was asked by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to take
part in the negotiations, and especially to
revise a memorandum prepared on the question by Mr. Z. A. Lash, K.C., in order to
make it as acceptable as possible to
the Grand Trunk railway management. I
did my best in that direction, but found
very soon that Sir Rivers Wilson felt that
the Grand Trunk railway was too big a
corporation to receive or acceUt terms from
Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann. The negotiations ended rather abruptly without
the memorandum which I have mentioned
receiving hardly any consideration on the
part of the Grand Trunk railway management, and in Messrs.. Mackenzie and Mann

335

feeling offended at the treatment they had
received. JI quite remember their saying
that they would show Sir Rivers Wilson
whether they were too small fishes to deal
with the Grand Trunk railway. I feel at
liberty to speak freely of what passed at the
time, because I was net -acting in the matter
professionally, but exclusively in my capacity of member of Parliament.
It may be interesting for members of this
House and for the public to know what
Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann were disposed
to do to conciliate the Grand Trunk railway's interest and avoid the building of a
third transcontinental line. I have kept a
copy of the memorandum which was presented at the time to Sir Rivers Wilson and
Mr. Hays. I do not think I should take the
time of this honourable House to read it,
but it will be interesting and will form part
of the history of the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
Honourable members will find that in that
memorandum the question was fully dealt
with. The memorandum commences by
stating the position of the Canadian
Northern at the time. They had over 1,500
miles of railway built in the West. They
had, as I have mentioned, their charter to
make it a transcontinental line. They were
in possession of the field, and they could
net be fairly ejected from it. The memorandum, after showing that the amalgamation of the two companies was impossible,
suggested the incorporation of a line extending from the East to Winnipeg, which
would be promoted by both the Grand
Trunk and the Canadian Northern, the
stock being divided between the two companies; and by an arrangement between
the two companies for the operation of that
line te the benefit of both interests. I will
place the memorandum on Hansard, so that
honourable gentlemen who desire may take
cognizance of it:
Re the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian
Northern Railway.
This memorandum is made for the cunsideration of the parties interested and not in any
way as a proposition by one to the other. It
contains Mr. Lash's personal suggestions made
wbth a view to bring about a practicable
arrangement between the two companies.
1. The situation of the Grand Trunk Railway
Company with reference to its outstanding share
capital and its outstanding bonds and other
securities is so complicated that no scheme
would be practicable at the present time which
would involve a surrender by Uts sharebolders of
their shares and the acceptance in l'eu thereof of shares in a new company formed by amalgamation of the Cana-dian Northern with the
Grand Trunk, or in a new company formed for
the purpose of taking over the undertakings of
the other two. Therefore the idea of the Grand

SENATE
Trunk pooling its undertaking with that of the
other company in such a way as would involve
the exchange of shares by the Grand Trunk
shareholders, would not be practicable at the
present time.
2. 'The Canadian Northern Railway Company bas now about 1,500 miles of l:nes, extending from Port Arthur into and through
Manitoba; and it expects during this year to
construct about 8 miles more, partly in Manitoba and partly to the West of Manitoba and on
the main line to Edmonton. The fixed charges
of the Canadian Northern railway are very
low compared with those of other railways;
and the financial arrangements for the construction of the additional mileage referred to
and the further extension to Edmonton will not
involve any substantial increase, if any, in the
fixed charges per mile.
3. The Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway Company bas not yet been incorporatei. It is expected that when incorporated, its charter will
enable it to build a railway from Quebec to the
Pacifie coast.
the
entirely independent of
4. Although
Grand Trunk railway, the Grand Trunk Pacifie
Company, I understand, relies upon getting
financial assistance from the Grand Trunk Railway Company for the construction of its line,
and relies upon making some kind of an
arrangement with the Grand Trunk Railway
Company for the interchange of tradic or the
joint operation of the two systems. I am not
aware of the nature of the financial assistance
which it is expected that the Grand Trunk Railway Company will afford.
5. It bas been suggested that the shareholders of the Canadian Northern Railway Company should transfer to the Grand Trunk
Pacific Company ail their shares in consideration of shares in the capital of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Company and that this transfer should
be made upon the basis of the cost of îhe Canadian Northern Railway Company's lines and
of their earning powers and the cost of the
lines to be constructed by the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Company and of their earning powers,
the intention being, if such a basis could be
arrived at, that the Grand Trunk Pacifie Company would construct the new lines required to
connect the systemas of the Grard Trunk railway and the Canadian Northern railway and
the extension to the Pacifie coast, and that
when the connection between the Grand Trunk
railway and the Canadian Northern railway
systems is established by the link bety een Port
Arthur and North Bay, a traffic arrangement
should be made with the Grand Trunk Railway
Company for the interchange of traffic at that
point.
There are several objections to the accomplishment of any arrangement on these lines.
First: The Canadian Northerii Railway
Company now holds a charter which would
enable it to build Eastwards from Port
Arthur to Quebec and Westwards fiom Edmonton to the Coast ; and it would be difficuit to convince the Canadian Northern Railway Company shareholders that it would be
to their advantage to practically surrender
these rights of building East and West, and
to exchange their shares for shares li a
company wvhich bas net at present any
constructed line.
Second: It would be practically inpossible
to arrive at a basis for the exchange of shares
which would be satisfactory te both parties.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

The cost of the respective lines might be ascertained with reasonable accuracy, but the
value of these lines and their earning powers
could net be ascertained at the present time
and opinions would be sure to differ widely
with regard to them. This fact alone, would,
I fear, make it impossible to expect any
successful result from any negotiations on
the lines mentioned.
Third: Under any circumstances
there
would be no advantage to the Canadian
Northern Railway Company in joinmug bands
with the Grand Trunk Pacifie
Company
alone. The union would have to be substantially and permanently with the Grand Trunk
Railway Company to make any arrangement
with the Grand Trunk Pacifie Company an
attractive one; and it seems to me that some
arrangement of a more permanent an-d elastie
nature than a mare traffic arrangement between -the two companies would have to be
entered into.
6. As it seems necessary under th circumstances that the shareholders and security
holders of the Grand Trunk Railway Company
should be allowed to retain their shares and
securities undisturbed by any arrangement
which may be made with the Canadian Northern Railway Company, some schem- short of
amalgamation which would leave the sharaholders and security holders of the two companies in their present positions and which
would have as far as possible the permanency
of amalgamation, must be devised if the parties
are to come to an arrangement for the joining
of the two railway systems and the building of
the necessary lines for that purpose, with extensions in the future.
7. The Grand Trunk Railway Company bas
now a system in the East. The Canadian Northern Railway Company has now a systemn in the
West. The most natural way of treating the
situation would be to allow the Grand Trunk
Railway Company to develop its system in the
East as it thought best ; and to allow the Canadian Northern Railway Company to dcvelop its
system in the West as it thought best, including
the extension from Edmonton to the Coast ; and
at the sae
timne to join these twù systems
together in some way which would be permanent .and which would provide for the building of the intermediate link and whch at the
same time would be practicable and possible of
accomplishment in the near future.
I suggest the following for consideration.
Legislation would of course be required to
enable tha suggestions to be carried out.
My scheme is as follows:
8. Let a new company-which might be called the Atlantic and Pacifie or some other suitable name-be incorporated, having the necessary powers to build a line from Port Arthur
to Quebec and having such other powers with
respect to branches as might be thought desirable. Let the charter of this new company confer upon it the necessary powers to operate its
own system and the systems of the Grand
Trunk Railway and the Canadian Northern
Railway and to enter into ail agreements by
way of lease or otherwise as may be necessary
in that behalf. This new company would be the
link which would bind together as permanently
as possible the systems of the two other companies.
9. Let the capital stock of this new company
be equally divided between the Grand Trunk
railway and the Canadian Northern railway

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
and let the board of directors of the ï.ew company be appointed in equal numbers by the
boards of the Canadian Northern railway and
the Grand Trunk railway, the intention being
that at ail times these two companies shall
have an equal interest in and an equal control
over the new company. I suggest that the number of the board be either six or eight with a
quorum of four consisting of two members representing each company; and power-should be
given to any member to appoint any other
member of the board as his proxy te represent
him ln his absence.
10. Government assistance by way of guarantee of bonds or otherwise would be expected
to enable the new company to raise the money
required for the construction of its lines; but
whatever method was adopted for the Government assistance, an issue of bonds by the new
company secured upon Its lines and revenues,
etc., would undoubtedly be required; and in order that the new company might at ail times be
in a position to meet the interest on its bonds,
the excess revenue of the Grand Trunk railway
and the Canadian Northern railway over and
above the amount required te pay the fixed
charges of these companies respectively could
be charged with any deficiency which might
arise in the revenues of the new company. This
would be eminently fair as the new company
would be controlled by the other two, and its
share of through rates and of general expenses
should at ail times be so adjusted that its revenues would be sufficient to meet its fixed
charges. The territory covered by the new company's Unes would not in the flrst instance be
productive of much local business. An arrangement of this kind would probably make it easy
te dispose of the new company's bonds at a
fair price: but if any other security were found
te be necessary it should be afforaed by guarantee or otherwise by the Grand Trunk railway and the Canad.ian Northern railway in
equal proportions. These two companies being
equally interested in the new company should
support the new company financially.
11. Se soon as the line between North Bay
and Port Arthur is completed, let the new company be entrusted with the operation of its
own and the other two systems. This could be
done by an agreement in the nature of a lease
or in some other convenient way which would
be permanent. Legislation would of course be
required in order that this might be properly
accomplished. The new company in assuming
the operation of the other systems would of
course recognize and carry out ail existing contracts whether with employees or respecting
trafftc, etc.
It should however otherwise be
given.a free hand with respect te the staff and
to the various questions which would arise in
connection with the operation. If this be net
done, then the saving in expenses whieh might
be brought about by the
Central Operating
Management and the other advantages which
would accrue therefrom might net be accomplished.
12. Make it the duty of the new company te
keep separate accounts of the earnings of the
three companies with respect te local traffic,
that is, traffle whlch does not extend from one
line te another; and make it the duty of the
board of the new company te decide from time
te time upon the arbitraries or proportions with
which each company is te be credited for
through traffit, that is, traffic which does exS--22

tend from one line te the other, whether arising
on or off any of the three lines.
13. Let the account of each company be
charged with the working expenditure connected with such company only and with a proportion of the other working expenditure based on
some equitable principle te be decided by the
board.
14. Let the usual arrangements between companies be carried out with respect te the use
of rolling stock and equipment, repairs, supplies, etc., etc.
15. Let the accounts be adjusted mcnthly or
at some other convenient period; and let the
net results te which each company i entitled
be from time te time paid over to such company subject te any special provision with respect te the fixed charges of the new company.
16. Each company would of course use the
money it received in this way in payment of
its fixed charges and other liabilities and would
divide the surplus by way of dividend among
its stockholders or use it in such way as the
company's board of directors might decide.
17. Branches from the present Grand Trunk
railway and Canadian Northern raLway systems which it might be advisable te construct
or acquire in the future would be constructed
or acquired by the company with whose system they connected and net be the new company, but when acquired or constructed they
should form part of the system and b operated
by the new company. Branches from the lines
of the new company might be treated in the
same way.
18. If it were thought advisable te acquire
steamboats, this could be done by such of the
three companies as the parties might find most
convenient, but the new company would operate
them as part of 'the whole system ; or steamboats might be acquired by a subsidiary company or companies and the stock and other
securities in these companies might be divided
as agreed.
19. The position of the Canadian Northern
Railway Company is a very simple one as ail
its lines with the exception of those leased fror
the Northern Pacific Companies belong to the
Canadian Northern railway. There are however
a few miles between Edmonton and Strathcona
which belong te the Edmonton, Yukon and
Pacific Railway Company. Powers of amalgamation between the Canadian Northern Railway Company and this company have been conferred by Parliament and could be acted upon
'whenever required. The position of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company is, I fancy, much
more complicated; and it would be necessary
when considering the details of any scheme under this memorandum to consider the legal
position of the various subsidiary cempanies
of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, se that
their interests wouId net be prejudicially affect-ed or any legal blunder made.
2'0. Whatever the disadvantages of an arrangement of this kind above indicated might be
(and probably any scheme which could be devised would have certain disadvantages), it
-would have the following advantages; viz;
First: It would bind the Grand Trunk railway and the Canadian Northern railway systems together as permanently as the present
circumstances would wprrant, short of amalgamation.
Second: It would leave the shareholders
and security holders of the Grand Trunk
Railway Company and of the Canadian

SENATE

338

Company unidsturbed.
Northern Railway
They would not have to place a value upon
their holdings before the scheme could be
carried out.
Third: It would give to the Grand Trunk
Railway Company and to the Canadian
Northern Railway Company all the earnings
which their respective systems would produce,
neither getting an advantage in this respect
over the other; and it would give increased
facilities for handling through traffic.
Fourth: It would practically turn all the
lines into one system operated by one
management thereby promoting efficicncy and
reducing general operating expenses.
Fifth: It would enable each company to
extend its own systern by the construction or
acquisition of branch lines, etc., ani to make
such capital expenditure for betterments, improvements, etc., as it might think fit, the
only condition being that these branch lines,
etc., would be treated as part of the general
system and be operated by the central
management.
Sixth: Should either company gez into default under its securities and should the
security holders take possession, it w ould not
greatly disturb the financial position of the
other company; and would practically be enly
a change of ownership from the shareholders
to their security holders of the con.pany in
default. Some satisfactory arrangement with
the new owners would no doubt result.
Seventh: It would facilitate the making of
financial arrangements for the early construction of the line of the new compary.
Eighth: It would pave the way for an
ultimate truc amalgamation of the systems.
April 13, 1903.

I am not quite sure that this copy of

the memorandum was the final draft as
presented to Sir Rivers Wilson. There was,
I think, something added by way of providing either for the choice of an umpire,
or for arbitration in case of disputes. As
I have already stated, the Grand Trunk
Railway management were not open to
negotiations and they insisted on being
given authority to extend the Grand Trunk
Railway system into the western provinces
and ignoring entirely the Canadian Northern railway which meant entering into a
railway-Jbuilding race with Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann. We know now who had
the best of it.
We are all familiar with the agreement
finally arrived at in the fall of 1903 between the Dominion Governnent and the
Grand Trunk Railway Company for the
building of the transcontinental railway.
The Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway Company was to build and own the western
division extending from Winnipeg to the
Pacifie coast, and the Dominion Government was to construct and own the eastern
division from Winnipeg to Moncton. The
Grand Trunk Railway Company was to
own the capital stock of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Company, the Government was to
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

guarantee the bonds of the Grand Trunk
Pacific Company up to 75 per cent of the
cost of the road, and the Grand Trunk
Railway -Company was to guarantee the
balance. Both divisions were te be operated
by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, the eastern division under lease for
a term of 50 years and subject to be renewed for a like term. The rent during
the first seven years was to be the payment of the general expenses of the conpany during that period, and during the
remaining forty-three years the annual payment of 3 per cent on the cost of the Eastern Division.
Honourable gentlemen know also that it
was provided in the agreement that the
Grand Trunk should have the means of
controlling the cost of the road. No contracts-in fact, no expenditure-could be
made without the engineers of the Grand
Trunk having access to all the details and
being able to control the expenditure,
which was but right, as the Grand Trunk
Pacifie was to pay as rental the interest
on the cost.
The Eastern Division was built by the
Government as agreed, at a cost of $159,881,948 (Royal Commission Report, p. xii),
and when it was completed the Grand
Trunk Pacifie Railway Company refused to
take it over on lease as agreed, and the Government remained saddled with it and
obliged to operate it at a very heavy loss.
As to the Western Division, it was built by
the Grand 'Trun'k Pacifie Railway Company,
and it has now a debt of $243,177,070. The
result of operations in the past has shown
the following losses: for 1913, $2,678,076; for
1914, $4,129,952; for 1915, $6,674,745; for 1916,
$5,297,189; for 1917, $5,707,581; for 1918,
$7,389,568; in all $31,967,111-apart from
taxes and other important items which are
not given for the years 1913 to 1916 inclusive;
apart also from the lesses on the operation
of the Grand Trunk Pacifie branch lines
which were quite heavy. It appears evident that the result of this failure is due
to wrong judgment on the part of the Grand
Trunk railway management in pressing this
venture upon the Government in 1903, their
utter disregard of the Mackenzie and
Mann's interest in 1903, and the improvident manner in which the enterprise was
carried out, especially the building of trunk
lines at enormous cost without feeders.
The Canadian Notthern management, both
in that respect and in lowering the initial
cost of their lines, have shown much better
judgment. It may be opportune here to
quote some of the findings of the members

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
of the Drayton-Acworth Commission, because we find their appreciation of the case
as made by the Grand Trunk Company. I
refer to pages 22 and 23 of the report. After
setting out the grounde taken by the Grand
Trunk Pacifie the commissioners proceed
to say:

339

for tle 'Government to permit this as a permanent policy.

I have shown the position as it was ai
the outset, the refusal of the Grand Trunk
to negotiate and join with the Oanadian
Northern, and the responsibility that they
took in the matter, moral and otherwise. I
have shown also what was the agreement
between the Government and the Grand
Trunk Pacifie and -the National 'Transcontinental. One would think that the terms
of all contracts, especially those sanctioned
by Parliament, should be respected; but,
as -to this contract, it seems that it was to
endure only if it inured to the benefit of
the Grand Trunk railway. The Government was allowed' to go on for years building the National Transcontinental at enormous cost, and as soon as it was finished
the Government was notified by the 'Grand
Trunk Pacifie that they would not respect
the terms of the lease, and that the National
Transcontinental would be left on the hands
of the Government. The Grand Trunk Railway Company went further than that, after
making, mainly, through their subsidiary
company, the -Grand Trunk Pacifie Company, successive raidis on the Government
exchequer, and we only have to refer to
the figures which have been laid before
this honourable House by the Government
to sec the extent of those raids. I have
here, in a return from the Finance Department of loans to the Grand Trunk Pacifie,
an item of $33,093,000, another of $6,000,000,
another of $4,931,000, another of $7,568,000.
In all, the Grand Trunk Railway Company
through the Grand Trunk Pacifie got a total
of $113,998,000, including the fifteen millions
which were advanced to the Grand Trunk
prior to Confederation, which amounts now,
with interest, to 26,000,000 odd.
On the fourth of March, 1919, Sir Alfred
Smithers notified the Government that they
would cease operating the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, and the reason naively given in
that letter was:

But though the Grand Trunk did not originate
the National Transcontinental, it accepted full
liability for it.
The agreement between 'the
Grand Trunk Pacifie and the Dominion Government provided as follows: "In order to insure,
for the protection of the company as lessees of
the eastern division of the said railway, the
economical construction thereof in such a manner that it can be operated to the best advantage
it is hereby agreed that the specifications
for the construction of the eastern division
shall be submitted to and approved of by the
company before the commencement of the work,
and the said work shall be done according to the
said specifications, and shall be subject to the
joint supervision, inspection, and acceptance of
the chief engineer of the company."
Upon this provision the Grand Trunk Pacifie
Company, On an officiai publication, "The Grand
Trunk Pacifie; Canada's National Transcontinental Railway; 10th edition, January, 1912,"
comments as follows:" Since the rental payable by the company
to the Government for the use of the eastern
division Os a percentage on the cost of construction, It will be observed that it Os a
matter of great importance to the company
that this item ' cost of construction' shall be
determined on the most economical basis
consistent with a well-built railway, in which
respect the foregoing provision contained ln
the agreement fully protects the company."
The company, then, appreciated that " cost of
construction" was to it a matter of great importance, and considered that it was fully protected by the terms of the agreement. But as,
in spite of the right of the company to approve
specifications and the right of the company's
chief engineer to supervise and inspeet the work,
the cost of construction of the National Transcontinental, which had been estimated at $61,415,000 was permitted to reach $159,818'1,1'97, the
company objected to carrying out their bargain.
And the Government, by accepting the company's
refusal and commencing to work the line themselves, have in effect released the company unconditionally.
The National Transcontinental
is now part of the Government Railways. We
make at this stage only two comments on what

thought that Canadians were very naive to
sign such an agreement.

At the outset the

Grand Trunk was allowed to gobble up all
the stock of the Grand Trunk Pacifie, and
to operate it for its benefit; and the Grand
Trunk, under its charter, would not be
justified in making advances to the Grand
Trunk Pacifie ! Evidently the same doctrine
did not apply when the Grand Trunk advanced as much as $8,355,000 to the Central
Vermont Railway, as stated by the Minister
of Railways, in Hansard, at page 1450.
That was a company chartered in the
United States, and owning 246 miles of
railway, and running with deficits for many
years.
The secret of the whole trouble is that
the public of this country, and the Governments-Conservative, Liberal or Unionist-have too much horror of receiverships.
A railway company has only to be financially involved, and is sure to bring the
Government to its terms by merely threatenOn the
ing to go into a receivership.
other side of the line, they have not shown
such a horror of receiverships. Most of tbeir
railways, as honourable gentlemen know,
have gone througb a receivership, and it bas
not affected the credit of the country. I mnyself have been assessed as a shareholder in
the Union Pacifie and the Northern Pacifie
and several other roads, and I am not the
worse for it. Capitalists are always found
to underwrite the aumount necessary to put
the company on a good footing again in case
those interested are not willing to carry
their share of responsibility.
I have no desire, honourable gentlemen,
to disparage the Grand Trunk railway. The
Grand Trunk Railway Company have rendered considerable service to this country.
They have been pioneers and they have
given a good service, too. But they have
done so as a matter of investment, with
the sole expectation of reaping the benefits
of their enterprise. They should be treated
fairly, even, as far as I am concerned,
f
generously; but they should be treated in a
businesslike way. I am going into these
details as a foundation for my argument,
because I purpose showing that under the
Bill they are not treated in a businesslike
way. They are not treated as they should
be treated or as this country should be
treated in regard to the Grand Trunk Railway or the Grand Trunk Pacifie. I think
it would be a salutory lesson to promoters
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

of all classes to deal with railways in a
businesslike way, and so as to protect in a
f.air measure the taxpayers of this country.
I may call attention to this fact. It has
been urged that there may be widows and
orphans who have nvested in this ro-id
a large amouni t fmney. Now we are not
dealing with the original investors. The
money that has been invested was invesited
in this road nany years ago. In many
cases the otock bas changed hands many
times, and it has changed hands, not on
the figures that originally prevailed, but
on the market price obtaining for the time
being.
Before I discuss the merits of the Bill,
I desire to dispel the idea that, in what I
have already said or may say, I am at all
infiuenced by my interest in the Canadian
Pacifie railway, or because I am a member
of the board o:f that great corporation.
Not that I consider that the Canadian Pacifie railway, as a corporation, is not entitled to freely express its opinion on a
question of such vital importance to the
country. I think net only is it right for
the company to de so, but the magnitude
of its interest in the welfare of this great
Dominion, and the valuable experience it
has in matters of this kind, makes it its
duty to pass judgment upon the measure
I
which is now engaging our attention.
have, however, neither mandate nor qualification to discharge that funetion. I am
speaking bere solely in my capacity as
a member of Parliament and as a Canadian
who has some individual interest at stake
in the affaire of the country being properly
administered.
Some of the members of the Government
have gone so far as to suggest that the
reason of the opposition of the Canadian
Pacifie railway to this measure was their
desire to purchase the Grand Trunk themselves or acquire a monopoly of the railways in Cana-da. The suggestion is, to my
mind, the very worst compliment which
may be paid to the good judgment of the
Canadi n Pacific Railway management.
The Canadian Pacifie railway bas its own
transcontinental line, which is second te
none on the continent, with its feeders
and its great fleet of steamers on both the
Atlantic and the Pacifie. The whole is in
splend'id condition, and able to competewith any other line. Its interest is not to
acquire a monopoly. If it did, it would
have public opinion against it and demands
for the lowering of rates. With the creation of the Railway Board of Canada and
the Inter-State Commerce Commission in

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
the United States, the day of railway monopoly on this continent is past. The public has its protection in its own hands.
and railway corporations and public utilities of all kinds can prosper only so long
as their administration enjoys the confidence and the approval of the people. I
have in mind a great corporation in the
city of Montreal, the Montreal Light, Heat
and Power Company, distributing electric
light and gas both for industrial and
domestic purposes
in Montreal
and
surrounding mun.icipalities.
It stands
as an example of what I say. I know of
no company which was more criticised at
one time than that company for what was
alleged to be its high rates, its policy of
combine and its watering of stock. Several
years ago the company adopted a new
policy, that of reducing its rates as its
dividends were increased; and, notwithstanding very strong competition in Montreal and surrounding municipalities, the
company has remained in possession of its
business, and has increased its business
enormously, and is now giving satisfaction
to the whole public, and we never hear and
have not heard for years of any criticism of
the company. If there is any weak spot
in the management of that company, it is
in the gas department, where it lacks competition. I have no hesitation in saying
that, in my opinion, in industries of ai
kinds fair competition and public confidence are essential conditions of permanent prosperity. The property of the Canadian Pacifie railway represents value
exceeding a billion dollars out of a total
national wealth of some sixteen billions, as
was stated by the honourable gentleman
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholls) last
night; and the Canadian Pacifie railway
cannot fail to recognize that its interests
are intimately linked up with the interests
of the Dominion of Canada, and that the
future value of its property depends entirely
upon the development and prosperity of
this country, which must necessarily be
very much influenced by a sane railway
policy, or by an insane policy such as the
one we are now considering. Was there
anything in the long and brilliant careei
of Lord Shaughnessy as president of the
company to lead us to suppose that he or
his worthy successour Mr. Beatty would be
influenced in passing judgment upon a
question of this kind by egotism or by the
fact that they may have to compete with
national railways? I have no mandate to
speak for the Canadian Pacifie, but my own
strong opinion is that it is necessary for

the Canadian Pacifie railway as it
is necessary for any other large company, to have competition. Competition
is one of the greatest sourcesi of
success now-a-days, because companies et
that kind cannot prosper permanently without being in a position to give satisfaction
to the people. In my own judgment it
would be a misfortune for the Canadian
Pacifie to be the only railway in Canada,
because they would be criticised; whether
their rates were excessive or not, those
rates would be considered excessive by the
people at large and people would feel dissatisfied.
It has been said that, as a consequence
of thiÈ Bill, the people of Canada will
assume new obligations to the extent of
about half a billion dollars. This is dealine
merely with the Grand Trunk. What we
have to consider is not only the debt et
the Grand Trunk, but the debt of the whole
systen of the Grand Trunk; and not only
that, but also the debt of the Grand Trunk
-Pacific and of the Grand Trunk Pacific
branch lines, and we have only to
refer to tic blue-book which is before us,
at page 29, to find out. what the figures are.
We have there a "memorandum re Grand
Trunk Railway System Funded Debt and
in the hands of the public in 1917." This
goes back to 1917, and the debt is much
larger to-day than it was then. It must
be thirty, forty, or fifty millions more. 'The
funded debt is placed at $448,703,356; equipment notes, $7,730,116; guaranteed and preference stock, $133,286,651; common stock,
$118,2419,615; total securities with public,
5707,929,817; exclusive of Government loan
to the Grand Trunk the figure of which
there given is $15,16,663. But I said a
moment ago that the debt, which was
ordinsrily fifteen millions, is now stated
by the Government as being $26,679,000
with the interest added. So this gives a
total of S724,676,000 for the Grand Trunk
Railway system.
Now, on referring to some figures which
were brought down by the Government in
answer to my question, I find that the indebtedness of the Grand Trunk Pacifie and
the Grand Trunk branch lines, amounts to
$243,177,000, making a total of $977,833,000,
and I understand there are several items
which are omitted ir that. On examining
the return made by the Finance Department
I find an item of $6,000,000 which does not
appear to be mentioned in the blue-book.
I find another item of $34,591,000, and
another item of $7,568,000, and I am satisfied that the figures are altogether incom-

books are no doubt pretty much complicated, and I am not surprised that the
figures are not clearer than they are.
It may be a repetition of what has been
said, but J must go, though not at length,
into the question of government ownership
or government operation of railways before
taking up the Bill, because it is a very important question. It is to my mind the
most important question before the country,
and it is our duty to try to enlighten the
people of this country on this question.
I know that this is somewhat of a fad at
the present time in certain parts of this
Dominion; but I am satisfied that it will
soon come to an end, because, not so much
of the experience in other countries, but
of the result that will be shown by governmnent-owned railways here.
Reference bas been made to the opinion of
Mr. Acworth, one of the Royal Commis-zioners. I have here the revised opinioif of
this gentleman. He prepared a historical
.sketch of government ownership of railroads
in foreign countries, and it was presented
to the joint committee of Congress on Interstate Commerce. It is dated May, 1917.
I have als.o " Government Ownership of
R1ailroads and War Taxation," by Mr. Otto
Il. Kahn, of New York, where he expresses
his own opinion on the question, and gives
a sumniary of Mr. Acworth's opinion. I
w ill read two or three pages of this latter
work:
For a concise statement of the results accomplished elsewhere under government ownership I would recommend you to obtain froum
the Public Printer, and to read, a short pamphlet entitled "Historical Sketch of Government Ownership of Railroads in Foreign Countries," presented te the Joint Committee of
Congress on Interstate Commerce by the great
English authority, Mr. W. M. Acworth.
It will
well repay you the half hour spent in its perusal. You will learn from it that, prior to the
war, about fifty per cent of the railways in
Europe were state railways; that in practically
every case of the substitution of government
for private operation (with the exception, subject to certain reservations, of Germany) the
service deteriorated, the discipline and consiquently the punctuality and safety of train
service diminished, politics came to be a factor
in the administration and the cost of operations
increased vastly.
(The net revenue, for example, of The Western Railway of France in the
worst year of private ownership was $13,750,000, in the fourth year of government operation it fell to $5,350,000.)
He quotes the emiHon, Mr. BEIQUE.

nent French economist, Leroy-Beaulieu, as follows:
"One may readily ses how dangerous to
the liberty of citizens the extension of the
industrial regime of the State would be, where
the number of functionaries would be indefinitely multiplied. . . . From all points of
view the experience of ýState railways in
France is unfavourable as was foreseen by
all those who had reflected upon the bad results given by the other industrial undertakings of the State. . . . The State, above
ail, under an elective government, cannot be
a good commercial manager. . . . The experience which we have recently gained bas
provoked a very lively movement, not onlv
against acquisition of the railways by the
State, but against all extension of State industry.
I hope . . . that not only we, but
our neighbours also may profit by the lesson
of these facts."
Mr. Acworth mentions as a characteristic indication that after years of sad experience with
governmentally owned and operated railways,
the Italian Government, just before the war,
started on the new departure (or rather returned te the old system) of granting a concession to a private enterprise which was to
take over a portion of the existing state railway, build an extension with the aid of state
subsidies, and then work on its own account
both sections as one undertaking under private
management.
I may add, as a fact within my own know
ledge, that shortly before the outbreak of the
war the Belgian Governient was stuidying the
question of returning its state railways to private enterprise and management.
Mr. Acworth relates a resolution unanimously
passed by the French Senate a few years after
the :State had taken over certain lines, begir.ning: "The deplorable situation of the State
system, the insecurity and irregularity of its
workings."
He gives figures demonstrating the
invariably greater efficiency, economy and superlority of service of private management as
compared to State management in countries
where these two systems are in operation side
by side. He treats of the effect of the conflicting interests, sectional and otherwise, which necessarily come into play under government control when the question arises where new lines
are te be built and what extensions te be made
of existing lines.
He asks: " Can it be expected that they
(these questions) will be decided rightly by a
minister responsible to a democratic legislature,
each member of which, naturally and rightly.
makes the best case he can for his own constitu
ents, while he is quite ignorant, even if net
careless, of the interests, not only of his neighbour's constituency, but of the public at large?"
And ha replied:
" The answer is written large
in railway history. . . . . The facts show that
parliamentary interference has meant running
the railways, net for the benefit of the peopls
at large, but to satisfy local and sectional or
even personal interests." He maintains that in
a country governed on the Prussian rprinciples
railroad operation and planning may be conducted by the Government with a fair degree of
success, as an executive function, but in demi
cratic countries, he points out that in normal
times ' it is the legislative branch of the Government which not only decides policy but dictates always in main outline, often down to the
detail of a particular appointment or a speciil
rate, how the policy shall be carried out."

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
I have read this extract from the pamphlet
in order to save time because it is a good
summary of the opinions expressed by
this gentleman in this book. Any honourable gentleman who may desire to consult
the pamphlet itself may have it for that
purpose. i will confine myself to giving
short extracts from the historical sketch.
Mr. Acworth says, under the title, "The
Lessons of Foreign Experience":
Such la an outline history of the Introduction
of State ownership in the less important half
of the railway world.

He has made a complete review of railways in the different countries.
What lessons bas it to teach for the more
limortant half, the United States and the United
Kihgdom? Evidently, in these two countries !t
will not be suggested that State owvnership is
necessary for political and military reasons.
The consclousness of political unity needs here
no artificial stimulus. The experience of England since the present war began bas sufficiently demonstrated that a number of Independent and often competing private companies can
be welded together at a moment's notice into a
homogeneous system, and operated from the
moment when war is declared, with absolute
success as an organic whole, under public control, on public account, for the public service.

This is merely a suggestion of a traffic
agreement, which has been mentioned by

several honourable members
spoken on the question:

Railway history conclusively refutes the idea
that State ownership promotes railway development. If we consider countries where the railways are already' making a reasonable return
on the capital, what do we find? Belgium bas
notoriously failed to keep its railways abreast
of its rapidly growing trade.
The Prussian
Government bas consistently for a generation
past forced the enormous coal and iron traffic
of Lorraine, Luxemburg and Westphalia on to
the waterways, by refusing to build the new
lines necessary to cope with the traffic by land.

times of worst congestion are not more bitter
than those which go up regularly every autumn
from the coal operators of the Ruhr Revier, the
most Important coal field in Prussia. In Australia the managements of the Government railways have boldly defended themselves in timr
of bad congestion by claiming that the railways
cannot afford to keep sufficient equipment to
cope with maximum demand.

I may say that in Australia, as is well
known, government ownership was adopted
because -private enterprise could not be
found which would invest the necessary

it is well known also that that is one of
the countries where railway service is most
expensive.

The only additional quotation whioh I
desire to make from this book is the conclusion. In conclusion Mr. Acworth says:
President Hadley-

He is president of Yale university and
has published a very good book on railway
transportati<ml. He is an authority on the
subject:
President Hadley tas summed up the conclusions of the Italian Railway Commission
based on the railway experience of the world,
as it existed 36 years ago, as follows:
(1) Most of the pleas for State management
are based upon the idea that the State would
perform many services much cheaper than they
are performed by private companies. This is a
mistake. The tendency is decidedly the other
way. * * * The State Is much more likely to
attempt to tax industry than to foster It.
(2) State management is more costly than
private management. * * *

(3) The political dangers would be very
great.
Politices would corrupt the railroad
management, and the ralîroad management
would corrupt politics. * * *

Honourable gentlemen, I believe that
attention has not been sufficiently given to
the fact that, as. a result of clause 11, which
is very short, the Government is not only
assuming the debt of the Grand Trunk
system by purchasing the railway, but it
is also assuming the debt of the Grand
Trunk Pacific syetem and giving a clean

and for the purpose of arbitration is
making good the claim of the Grand Trunk
against the Grand Trunk Pacific and the
Grand Trunk Pacific branch lines, and
affecting the government claims. I call
special attention to that point, because I
think it is of considerable importance.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Will the honourable
gentleman excuse me? Is it his point that
the Government in buying the Grand Trunk
Pacific thereby cancels the debt of the
Grand Trunk Pacific to the Grand Trunk,
on the theory that when you become the
owner of the Grand Trunk you cannot owe
yourself, and that therefore the $97,000,000
in wiped out?

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And the $21,000,000
also.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: That point escaped me
in examining the Bill. When you corne to
the arbitration clause some provision will
have to be nide that in the assessment of
valuation of the Grand Trunk Pacific this
debt has to be taken into account, because,
if it is merged, we are going to be badly
hurt.

344

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Of course, I am
dealing with the Bill as it is. Section Il
says:
Upon the transfer to or vesting In the Government of the preference and common stock
as herein provided for, the Governor in Council
may provide for the diecharge of the receivership of the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway System and the termination and withdrawal >f

Canada relating thereto.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

If is a receipt for

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Why? It i3 because
the Government assumes the debt of the
Grand Trunk Pacific as owner of the stock
of that conpany which is in the treasury
of the Grand Trunk Railway Company.
Then J refer to clauses 3 and 4, whicli say:
The said agreement shall contain provisions
for the defining of the companies, properties
and interests comprised in the Grand Trunk
system, and, including the terms and provisions hereinafter set forth, may contain such
other terms and conditions not inconsistent
with the provisions of this Act, as the parties
may agree upon.
As part of the consideration for such acquisition, the Governnent may agree to g-uarantee
the payment of:
(a) Dividends payable half yearly, at four
per cent per annum, upon the present guaranteed stock;
(b) The interest upon the present debenture
stocks.

The power which the Governwent is taking is the power to make an agreement
whieh must not be inconsistent with the
provisions of the Act; and, as far as that
point is concerned, I say that if the Act
were to renain as it is, that claim would be
entirely wiped out, and for the purpose of
arbitration it would not be considered,
because the Bill is going on the assumption
thatf the Government is taking possession of
the Grand Trunk Pacific and assuming all
its liabilities, and is therefore discharging
the guarantors of the Grand Trunk, or discharging any debt owing to the Grand
Trunk, or obliging itself to make good any
amount owing to the Grand Trunk by reason of advances made to the Grand Trunk
Pacifie.
I desire also to call attention to another
point which Pas sonie connection with this.
By reason of the fact that the Government
undertakes to guarantee the 4 per cent
guaranteed stock and pay par ultimately,
the Government is giving a value to that
stock. It is giving par value to that stock,
and it is therefore giving a value to any
security which is subsequent to that stock.
It will be argued before the arbitrators that
the Government, having admitted that the
$60,000,000 are worth par, has acknowledged
Hon.

Mr. ROSS.

the value in the property, and that will
tend to increase very nuch the appreciation
of the other stocks which are to be subject
to the arbitration.
Another point to which I desire to call attention for a moment is the very important
question of traffic agreements. The whole
contention of the Government is that they
must buy the Grand Trunk system because
there are no other means to meet the difficulty. If that were true, there would be
force in the argument; and I think it is of
great importance to show that that contention is not correct, but that there are means
at the disposal of the Government to attain
its object, and I think that every person
who lias sîome kaowledge of railway
natters will say that it can be as well
attained- through a traffie and running
riglt agreenent.
It is well known that
during the war, in order to avoid congestion
it was necessary to co-ordinate the Canadian
railways. There was what was called a War
Board Associatian, which, so to speak, took
hold of the different railways to meet the
difficulties. It is known also, and acknowledged, that the railwvy service in Canada
was the best service on the continent-by
far superior to that in the United Statesand that the War Board Association gave
entirn

satisfaction.

What was done satisfactorily during the
war can bc donc satisfactorily in peace time,
and it is being donc. The association is
being continued, and the members of the
association are these:
Algoma Central and Hudson Bay railway.
Algoma Eastern Railway.
Atlantic, Quebec and Westrn Railway.

NOVEMBER 6, 1919
and lines Wtest of the Great Lakes; it has
also a traffic committee, a financial committee, with a subcommittee on claims, and
even a legal committee.
The Canadian Railway War Board was
formed in October, 1917, and was a voluntary organization, including al] steam
railways operating in the Dominion of
Canada. It was composed of a number
of committees of railway experts working
under the direction of an executive consisting of the presidents of the principal
lines.
Prior to the fall of 1917, the railways had
coped successfully with the heavy burden
of troops and munitions which had been
thrown upon them by war conditions. It
then became evident that if this record
was to be maintained through the approaching winter, and with the railways
te the South almost at the breaking-point,
the efficiency of the several companies
would require to be moved up to the highest
notch. This could be done only by the
eliminaton of unnecessary light inovements
and duplicate train service; by the centralization of engine and car distribution and
by similar processes, under the guidance
of a body which would have jurisdiction
over all lines and whose knowledge and
experience would result in the proper arrangements being made at the right time,
and without undue interference with the
local operations of the individual railways.
After a number of conferences between the
Government and railway authorities the
organization I have described was established.
Under the direction of the board, traffic
was diverted from overburdened lines;
locomotives were loaned to railways which
were in need of them; rolling stock was
devoted to the movement of troops and
munitions in greater quantities; industries
were kept supplied with freight cars by
the ewitching of surpluses from one line
to another; and efficiency was further promoted by the heavier loading of cars and
trains and by regulation of the shipment
and flow of traffic.
With a view to further safeguarding transportation from interruption, an agreement
was negoialed with railway labour organizations whereby, in the event of dispute,
instead or resorting to the strike or lockout,
matters which were not settled amicably
by the interested parties themselves were
placed before a Board of Adjustment composed of an equal number of railway and
labour executives, whose decisions were accepted as final and binding. That, during

345

a period of general labour unrest, the
Canadian railways have been practically
free of strikes, is a tribute to the knowledge,
experience and judgment of the members of the Board of Adjustment. It is no
doubt true that in any other circumstances
than those in which the board was established, its formation and spirit would not
have been possible.
The wisdom of the plan of operation expressed in the Canadian Railway War
Board is manifested in Canada's war-time
transportation record, for in no other country did the railways so successfully discharge their war duties and at the same
time maintain a fully adequate service for
the movement of domestic goods and passengers. It is significant also that in no
other country was the operation of the railwaya left entirely in the hands of the
Railway Executives.
It has been said that what co-operation
and co-ordination could accomplish for the
good of the public service in war conditions
they can achieve in times of peace, and it
ia realized that this is true of the railway
system. In matters of car supply, train
service and dealings with labour, which are
vital te the nation's welfàre, the railways
can give better service by acting in concert
as necessity arises, rather than as individuals. With this thought in mind the railways have united in forming an association
which takes the place of the Railway War
Board. The association is organized along
lines similar to the War Board and, through
its executive and committee, wiMl deal
with railway questions from the standpoint of the country as a whole. The new
organization includes both government and
privately-owned railways, and, as in the
case of the War Board, is composed of
groups of railway officers whose policies
and action, unhampered by outside interference or control, assure to Canada continuance of the present efficient railway
service, which is unequalled in any other
country.
Now, honourable gentlemen, this is a way
out of the difficulty; but, apart from that,
what I claim ks-and it has already been
demonstrated, I am sure, te the satisfaction
of every honourable gentleman who has
listened te what has been said-that our
Railway Board has all the power necessary
to do that very same thing, and if they
have net the power, it is easy to add to
their powers. If the -Government is afraid,
for instance, that a traffic agreement with
the Grand Trunk will not be respected, what
prevents the agreement being made in such

fairly and liberally, so that it can go through

enterprise without imperilling the intereet
of the country; the Goverument, instead of
wiping out the Grand Trunk Company and
assumifig ail its responsibilities, can use its
legitimate dlaims against the Grand Trunk
for the purpose of obtaining a traffic agreement on such terme as will fully psrotect
its 0w-n railway.
*Now, honoqirable gentlemen, 1 have
summed up in a concrete form the different
reasons whieh I have to urge against this
Bill, and I will read thein without further
remarks.
I arn,.against this Bill for the following
reaéons:
Ist.
Be-cause it involves government
ownership and operation of railways under
the control of the Government, which la
alw.ays much more expen-sive, much lese
efficient, destructive of individual energy,

demoralizing, and inevitably used s a political machine by the Government for the

2nd. Recause practical experience here,
in the United States, in England, France
-and other countries, has provedl that government operation of railways is ruinous.
3rd. Because the acquisition of the Grand
Trunk syslein will edd enormously bo our

34

already appalling publie debt, and imperil
the credit of the country.
4th. Becauee lack of information prevents
our realizing the extent of expenses to
which trie country wîll be committed and
o! the deficits whieh il will have to meet
from year to year.
5th. Because the acquisition of the
Grand Trunk railway, spart from loading
the Dominion of Canada with some $970,000,000 of new obligations, a large portion
of which are ýalready matured or soon to
mature, implies the lose for the development of this country of the help of ail the
English capital invelted in the Grand
_Trunk .railway and of the important credit
which that capital may command for the
future development of the property.
Let me pause here to recail what was
very properiy said by the honourable
gentleman froin DeLorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand> on that point, and to draw again
attention o! the House to the importance
o! conserving in the intereets of this
Dominion the influence and~ credit of the

anybody suggest that seriously? Il is a
most valuable asset which. cannot be

6th. Recause the condition of un.reet in

more objectionable.
7th. Recause the Grand Trunk railway,
being a great international highway having conriýecting links extenýding to Portland,
Boston, Chicago and other points in the

industrial advantage resulting from the
transport through Canada o! a very large

I desire before resuming my seat to express my appreciation of the manner in
which this debate has been conducted in
this honourable House, and also of the
good example which bas been shown by a
number of members on the other side, who,
disregarding their party affiliations, have
answered the call of duty to their own
consciences and to the country and have
taken the action which they believe to
be in the public interest. It is a great
lesson for the future, for members on this
side as well as on the other side. I believe we are all, as a rule, too partisan.
For my part, I can appreciate all the more
the position taken by those honourable
gentlemen, because I have myself on
several occasions taken an attitude which
was against the Government of the day,
and J always had to congratulate myself
for having done what I considered to be
my duty, and for acting as I thought was
in the best interest of the country. It is
a great lesson for this honourable House
and for the country at large, and it is
of such a nature as to raise this House in
the estimation of the country.
Hon.
Mr.
BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, the House has been sitting since
Il o'clock this morning, and everybody is
very tired.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Several honourable members desire to speak. We cannot possibly take the vote to-night unlessSome Hon. SENATORS: Go on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am appealing
to the leader and not to the back benches.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: We are appealing to you.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Honourable gentlemen, I wish to say that the whips have
arranged to have the vote taken to-night.
All our members on both sides are present.
I think it is only fair that we should finish
to-night and take the vote.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Let the honourable gentleman from -Halifax proceed.

Hon. WM. ROCHE: Some of the honourable gentlemen opposite have their
judgnent affected by a false analysis.
They think there is a resemblance between
the Canadian Northern railway and the
Grand -Trunk railway.
The Canadian
Northern railway was built as a rival
of the Canadian Pacific and the Grand
Trunk Pacific. The railway borrowed money
from everybody from whom they could
borrow, and from every institution that
had money to lend. They borrowed a large
anount from one of the great banks, and
the strong reason that was urged for the
Government taking over the railway was
that that great institution would otherwise
be so crippled that it would be unable to
continue business, and that the failure of
that great bank would ruin the reputation
of Canada. The railway was in extremis,
and we acquired it. After we had acquired
it and after the ebullition of joy had subsided to some extent, we looked into it and
we found that the precious acquisition that
we had obtained at so much sacrifice of
feeling and so much sacrifice of money
was deficient in objectives, deficient in coordination, deficient in feeders, and that
its terminals were a joke, and it had nothing but a huge heap of debts and indebtedness. In fact, it was like the Indian'-s gun.
It had neither lock, stock, nor barrel. The
conditions of the Grand Trunk railway
were different. They were satisfactory. It
was always well and economically managed. The servants of the railway were
active and vigilant to secure freight. The
railway was popular in Ontario and in
Quebec. It was of great advantage to the
province of Ontario with regard to its business, and contributed largely, by the carriage of produce and passengers and by
providing other facilities, to the prosperity
of the great province of Ontario.
Then we had three railways in the West:
we had the Grand Trunk Pacific; we had
the Canadian Northern railway; and we
had the Canadian Pacific railway-enough
competition 'to aatisfy the wants of all the
business in the West. In the year 1918
the gross receipts of the Grand Trunk railway were $53,000,000; the working expenses
were $46,000,000; a surplus of $7,000,000.
Against that there were fixed charges of
$ii,000,000, which left a deficit of $4,000,000.
Up to June, 1919, the gross receipts of the
Grand Trunk railway were $63,000,000; the
working expenses were $53,000,000, leaving
a surplus of $10,000,000. Against that there
were fixed charges of $11,000,000 to $12,000,000 leaving a deficit of $2,000,000. Thus, in

SENATE
one year, the Grand Trunk railway had
relatively improved its position by $2,000,000.
So I put the question to those honourable
gentlemen who are so anxious to acquire
the Grand Trunk railway: could the Government work the Grand Trunk railway
to advantage? If it could operate the
railway so as to serve the country and make
money, why could not the Grand Trunk
Railway Company so well managed hold
its own and make money also, provided
there were no war, which was the cause of
the deficit and loss-the war which demoralized business, which prevented travel, and
reduced the intake and income of the
Grand Trunk railway?
In the other House, I believe it was
asserted-and I believe it has a certain
amount of currency in the press-that the
Grand Trunk Railway Company refused to
run the Grand Trunk Pacific because they
had been informed that the railway could
be built for $13,000,000; but when the
accounts were made up on the completion
of the railway they found that it was going
to cost $200,000,000 and that that great
discrepancy between the $13,000,000 and the
$200,000,000 appalled them, so they threw
up their hands and refused to take over
the railway. Now, do you tell me that it is
creditable that two astute and capable
managers like Charles M. Hays and William Wainwright, as good railway men as
are to be found on the continent-engaged
in the operation of railways, repairing railways, building extensions to railways, aequiring branch lines, managing railways and
all the expenses attendant on those various
so deceived that what
services-were
they thought would be built for $13,000,000
cost $200,000,000? Why, it is inconceivable.
What is the fact? The railway could not
run because the Government, between Dandurand and Pocohontas, took up five miles
of the rails. You cannot run freight or
passenger cars over a space of five miles
where there are no rails. That was the
reason why the Grand Trunk Pacifia did
not run and operate-not because they were
deceived about the cost, but because it was
a physical impossibility, when the rails
were taken away, to run cars or conduct
business in a continuous line. I am told
that the rails were taken over to France?
Did they ever come back? Where are they'
Again, we were told that they declined to
run the Transcontinental railway on account
of the Government increasing the grade of
the railway. Some of the opponents of the
Grand Trunk railway say that the railway
was so costly and the experiment of running
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

trains over it involved so much money that
the Grand Trunk shrunk from an undertaking so expensive and so onerous. That
the Government was justified in increasing
the grades, I do not know; but that is the
reason, so iar as I have heard, why the
Transcontinental railway was not worked
by the Grand Trunk Railway Company.
I think that to shorten the discussion, so
far as I am concerned, and to come in contact with the proposition before us, I should
ask what is the proposition? I think it will
occur to every member of this House that in
a proposition of this magnitude, the agreenient on which negotiations are being conducted, and upon which a conclusion will
ba finally formed aùd a bargain struck,
ought to have been submitted to the judgment of this House; because we all know
that two or three vords inserted in that
agreement may alter the whole complexion
of the proposition; and if gentlemen knew
that those words were in it they would reject the proposition at once as being unsuitable and not such a proposition as the
Parlianent of Canada could accept.
The leader of the Government, as usual
with him, made a very captivating speech,
but he did not say a word about the material
details or the main ingredients of the proAfter be had expatiated on

general topics, he went along to Utopia, enjoying dreams. He was followed by the
Minister of Labour, and we all thought that
be ,was going to give us an exposition of the
financial situation of this question. But
he gave us the particulars of railroads in
the United States, and be went off at a
tangent to describe the number of full cars
that came out of the States, and the number
of empty or half-empty cars that went down
to Scowhegan, or some of those benighted
regions in Maine or Vermont. So we are
without the particulars in reference to the
proposition which is now before us. If there
be any misconception, if there be any doubt,
if there be any error, it arises from the fact
that the leader of the Government in this
House, usually so expressive and persuasive, abstained, and I think, abstained designedly, from giving us that which Nould
have satisfied us as to our curiosity and as
to our opinion upon the subject, and left
us in doubt as to what it really is.
We heard this afternoon varions opinions
about the amount of indebtedness, ranging
from $268,000,000 up to $900,000,000 for which
Canada will be liable. Now, let us see what
it is. In the first place, there are $60,000,000 of guaranteed stock. I take it that $60,000,000 of guaranteed stock will be regarded

naterial industries and operations of the
people of the country.
Now, let us see what those obligations
are. The Deputy Minister of Finance said
that Canada this year wvould have to provide $102,000,000 of interest money, and he
states that the amount of the indebtedness
of the Governient at this time is $2,000,000,000. When the Finance Minister was
exaninedl he increased the animal interest
to $115,000,000. It was stated in the House
of Couinions tîat the amount of indebtedness was known to be $2,200,000,000.
Let us sec now what we have to meet.
In the first place, there is the nmilitary.
,200,000,000 and $115,We start with our
000,000 of interesit, and we add to that $60,000,000 at least for the soldiers; $40,000,000
are placed in the Estiinates, but I venture
to say that before the soldiers are settled
and satis.fied it will require $20,000,000 more
than that. Then, for the Grand Trunk we
will require $30,000,000 for betterments and
rolling stock, and the amount of interest,
$5,000,000, and $60,000,000 that we may have
to provide, would make $95,000,000. If we
have to pay for the common stock and the
other stock it would be $60,000,000 more.
Then we have the deficit which will occur
upon the workings of these railways, of
$15,000,000 or $20,000,000 more-some gentlemen have made it much more than that,
but I have placed it at the lowest possible
figure. Then we will have for the navy
at leasit $50,000,000. Lord Jellicoe in his
tour of the world went to Australia and
made a programme for thenm under which
they will have ta spend an equal, if not a
larger aununt than that; he will b here,
and iext year we will be called ion to
provide $50,000,000 for the navy. Then, for
the League of Nations we have to provide
at least $10,000,000 more; we have committed
ourselves to that. In the British House of

able and' large. They are adequate, if
econornically handled and developed. We
have a large quantitv of valuable agricultural land, the greatest possession that any
country could have. We do not know the
exact value of it. We could flot put a value
per acre.upon it, because that would be
a very deceptive calculation. We have the
wealth of the forests; we have the productions of the soil; we have what is underneath the soil-the mines; we have' a good
climate and an energetic people; we have
in the East the splendid wealth of the seas,
of the forests and of the mines. We have
almost everything with which a country can
bie endowed by nature; but those resources
must be econornically worked. They rnust
be developed. There rnust be time for the
countrv to recover from the load of vast
expenditures upon it; and, under normal
conditions, the exertions of our people will
fully develop our resources and advance the
splendid heritage which we have in this
country.
Now, how is all this wealth of material
to be transrnuted into rnoney, and to, ba
utilized by the Government? What process
have we for doing it, and what implementsP
In the firat place, we have the Income Tax.
That was a usurpation of the past, an encroacbmrent on the rights of the provinces
for direct taxation. It was a war measure
to which the people submitted. But can
an exaction of that kind be cantinued and
be looked upon as a resource by a country
like Canada? We know that the people
are already objecting to it, and are looking
to the day when there will be no more incorne tait, because it is a severe infliction
upon persons of lirnited means, and it is a
great exaction upon industrial epterprises,
where ten, twenty, thirty, forty or fifty per
cent of their profits are taken frorn thern;
but it is a severer tax upan people who rnay
have an income frorn a bouse or two, or from
a little money invested. This tax presses
upon them, and, with the high cost of
living. it reduces their caniforts, and makes
life a burden to, them. The late Finance
Minister was alive tW the 'burden, of the
incarne tax. He said it could not be sustained or continued, because people were
discovering that Canada is a dearer place
ta, live in than England; >and if Canada is
a dearer place ta live in than the United
States, then a great many people who were
burnped and buffeted about with taxes, and
imposed upon by extortionists, may prepare
S-23

363

ta move ta another country, when the restrictions which prevent people irnmigrating are removed.. That mnust be so.
But the great reliance of our cauntry in
producing the necessary money is the tariff.
0f -course, we have lost the tax on liquors,
which. rwas a very remunerative tax, which
brought a large arnaunt of revenue inta the
Treasury. That has gone, cornparatively.
But the rnain instrument that brings maney
into the Government caffers la the ad
valarem tax. The apecific duties bring in
a large arnount of rnaney, but the ad valorem tax is the implernent which has given
the cauntry the greatest arnount of revenue.
The tax upon an article or au implement
is perhaps thirty-five per cent. An article
or implement coming from the United
States into Canada before the war would
bear the duty of $35 if the article were
valued at $100. The saine inmplement comning inta Canada ta-day would bear a tax
of $70, and a war tax besides. Now, that
tax cannot continue. With the reductian
ai -prices, that source of revenue will fail
off greatly. If the prices go back ta the
normal, the Government will lose about
one-fourth of its revenue derived from that
tax. That bas ta, be cansidered. That tax
eannat be continued. Then, a large amount
*of the gaods imported inta Canada is from
the United States. The prices of articles,
in the United States are high, and with
those taxes at the rate that I have specified, and the specific tax, a large amount
of revenue has been brought ta Caniada.
An adequate revenue ai that kind 'would
discharge aur obligations. But what is the
fact? Great Britain is endeavouring ta increase lier trade with the colonies. Emissaries from Great Britain are out here now
trying ta establish an interim trade period.
Articles frorn England will probably within
twelve rnonths be 25 or 60 per cent les
in price than sirnilar articles frorn the
United States, and they corne in at fifty
per cent reduction from the rates paid on
Arnerican goods; sa that a great amaunt of
our revenue will bie lost; and it behooves
us ta look araund and disoaver where we
can obtain. a revenue adequate ta the expenditures which we have undertaken, and
ta those which are proposed far us.
I say tfhat it is tlie part of prudent men
and statesrnen ta refrain from proposîng
or aupporting any measures, speculations,
or enterprises 'which involve a large
arnount af rnoney. I say it is the prudent
course to rernain as we are, ta endeavour ta

from the embarrassment that rests upon
them, and to discharge, if possible, a portion of this debt. We have borrowed two
billions of money and we owe that amount
now. If in, these war loans there had been
a provision for a sinking fund, .a sinking
fund of one per cent in ninety years would

surplus of revenue that we could apply to
a sinking fund that would discharge that

speculations involving a hundred, two hundred, or five hundred millions of money.
We have all that appalling debt before us

Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

It will occur to every meiber present that
that will be the effect, and it will be accentuated in the future. The expense of
operating a railway on Government account
will be far greater than operating a railway
on private account.
What will be the general effect upon the
country? What will be the effect upon the
lower provinces? I was sorry to hear the
leader of the Government pronounce the
Transcontinental railway a blunder. That
was a very emphatic word to use in regard
to a ralvav in which we in the eastern provinces repose our hopes, a railway to whose
beneficent effect we look for the improvement of our conditions and the wealth of our
people. I notice, both from the remarks of
the leader of the Government and those of
the minister who followed him, that the d.isposition is to operate the raiivays to the
soutt, to use Portland and other places in
the United States, in preference to the

te us. The ports of St. Jotn and Halifax

have the competition of the Canadian Pacifie; we have the competition of the Grand

Transcontinental railway; all running to
the port of St. John. We hope to run
them to Halifax, Sydney and other
ports in the East. Why, then, should
we fear that the Canadian Pacifie railway would absorb this railway? But
the Canadian Pacifie railway has no intention of absorbing the Grand Trunk. They
have established their line and their depot in the port of St. John. It works there
to their satisfaction; and if they were not
to find enough accommodation at the port
of St. John they could go on to Halifax,
where there is ample accommodation for
all the shipping of the Western world.
We are met at the last with a challenge.
What is that challenge? " What is your

say it proudly, there is no necessity that
you can prove that you should acquire the
Grand Trunk railway. It 'has been demanded of you by the people, and we say:

the development of the country; let the
farmer and the workingman combine to
produce from their fields and from their
operations the products that we require; let
the wheels of industry revolve; let the fisherman out upon the deep produce the wealth
of the sea; let nature and science work
for you; and if you wait until -those resources are combined and brought to bear
upon railway propositions, you are safe.

GRAND

TRUNK RAILWAY
TION BILL.

THE DEBATE

ACQUISI-

CONTINUED.

Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON: It
is my intention to be brief in the remarks
which I shall address to the House upon
this very important issue. I confess that
I approach with hesitating step to deposit
my vote in the urn. But I have gained
some confidence in the conviction at which
I arrived hesitatingly as I have listened
to the debate in this House and after havS-23j

ing read the debate in the other.
My previous opposition to this Bill was
founded to a great extent upon the fact
that my experience had led me -to lose
faith in government ownership. I have
seen a good deal of the working of
government ownership in this country
and have read
authoritative reports
upon it in other countries, and I
have not known of any government
ownership of a purely commercial affair,
in England, France, Germany, the United
States or Canada, which has succeeded.
A series of articles has been written within
the last eighteen months in one of the great
English magazines. The author has investigated some of the most important municipal-owned and government-owned commercial businesses in England, and he has
shown that they have not been commercially successful. I am informed on very good
authority that nowhere in the world has
any advance been made in the art by any
government which owned and operated a
telephone system; that all the advances
have been made by privately-owned corporations.
A member of this House should, like Mr.
Balfour, never read the newspapers when
he is about to make up his mind on a question such as the one we have now before us;
because immediately he sees disparaging
remarks, injurions reflections on, and iniproper motives attributed to every person
who opposes public ownership. 'You can
catch more fiies with sugar than with
vinegar, and I cannot understand why advocates of public ownership are everlastimgly attributing to those who are opposed
to them improper motives, or declaiming
that they are bound to the chariot of big
interests. For I can assure them that there
are in this world men who are really convinced that public ownership is not desirable, and that all the people who are opposed to it are not venal. And I attribute
to myself some virtue. I really believe
that I am not tied to any big interest's.
chariot.
Be that as it may, if this proposal before
us involved the beginning of public ownership by Canada, I should cast my vote
against it, because I believe that I should
be doing my country an injustice in encouraging the Government of Canada in any
way to embark upon commercial enterprises. But I regard it as a quite different
subject. I regard this as a case arising
after one has got into the trouble.

je, a persan who je not a lawyer-no

cannot realize the argumente that may be

board bhas a general authority ta value

upon which a- baard is bound to act-not
upan which it may act, but upon which. it is
bound ta act. The llrst is that arbitrators
muet consider the value ai the property;
they muet consider the coet ai replacement;

at a price at which it will pay him to purchase it; and, if he does not buy right,
neither private ownership nor public ownership can iake it a success. So we must
place ourselves in a position to buy right.
If we do not liiît the power of this board,
we may not buy right. It night be more

property upon its physical value. I have
a copy of the award here, and if I read
what the arbitrator said in that case it
will perhaps give you a better appreciation
than I can of the difficulties which surround a case of that kind. Tbey first set
out what they were asked to value, and then
they went on to state:
The question to be determined by the arbitrators was one of great difficulty and one
which, of neceseity, admitted of great diversity
of opinion. We heard much testimony, had the
benefit of assistance of experienced and able
counsel on both sides, and carefully investigated
every matter which seemed to throw any light
upon the question to be determined.

They continue:

As to whether or not there was a surplus of
assets over liabilities was naturally a subject
which engaged much time and consideration.
It is of course not a conclusive test as to the
value of the stock but it is an element which
cannot be ignored. Its importance was perhaps
emphasized by the fact that a Royal Commission had reported the assets and liabilities of
the company to be about equa.l. This report
which was made in a proceeding to which the
company and its shareholders were not parties
was admittedly based on a misconception of
some of the facts, and there were omissions
of both assets and liabilities. It should also
be pointed out that the work of the Royal
Commission had reference to a date anterior
to the first day of October, 1917, and there
were changes in the interval.

What was the second one? It is as follows:
In arriving at the surplus of assets over
liabilities the report of Professor Swain as
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

to the reproduction cost now of the physical
property based on pre-war prices, and also
his estimate of the depreciation has beem
adopted and after a careful examination we
found the surplus of assets over liabilities of
the company on the first day of October, 1917,
on a conservative basis to be not less than
twenty-five million dollars after deducting the
full amount of depreciation found by Professor
Swain and making such reduction in the value
of the land grants and other assets as seemed
reasonable.
It is to be pointed out that a valuation of
the physical property of a railway company
by the reproduction new method, less deprelation, is not to be regarded as an ascertainment of the actual value. It ls only a means
to that end, but as it was the best, and in fact
the only estimate available, it bas been adopted
as a basis for the foregoing calculations.

I ask any non-professional man if lie can
understand that award? It takes a lawyer to
unders-tand it. You see they went over
everything they could imagine, and they
concluded that the only way they could fix
a value was to take the value of the property, less depreciation. It was the only
means to that end-in fact, the only estimate

available, and it was adopted as the basis
of the foregoing calculations.
Now, honourable gentlemen, assume this
is before the arbitrators. The first thing
counsel for the railway company will do
will be to prove the value of the physical
assets. The value of the physical assets is
the cost of those assets, purchased between
the year 1850 and the present time, and that

is four hundred million odd. But, at the
tine of the purchase, the entrance into
Montreal was pretty nearly a wigwam; the
entrance

to Toronto

was

purchased when

Toronto was called muddy York; the entrance into Chicago whien the name Chicago
was net known three counties away; the
entrance in-to Hamilton wben it was simply
called " The Ambitious City." The entrance
into all the cities of this country was purchased wlien the property could be bought
at practically prairie land prices, and the
property which they purchased for a small
sun at that time stands in their books today at $400,000,000. Counsel of the arbitration would very properly say: " It is not the
money we have paid for it when we bought
it at acreage prices as farin lands, but it is
xvhat it is worth to-day. Look how it is assessed in Montreal. This property is worth
at least three times the value it was when
we bought it." Could the arbitrators ignore
that argument? And if they took present
values they would make the physical assets
of this company worth $1,200,000,O0
instead of $400,O0,000, and they might make
an award which would saddle us with an
enormous debt for this property, far and

NOVEMBER 6, 1919.
away beyond what it is worth as a commercial proposition. But you see that in an
arbitration only concluded a few months
ago the arbitrators deliberately adopted that
system, or that principle, in arriving at
values.
The next question which they would take
up would be the potential value of this
property; and if they were men of imagination they would see Canada in the next
twenty years blooming as a rose. They
would see us gro-wing in prosperity, and
they would say: This is going to be a great
thing, and it promises to turn out so well.
But it is the old story, and what, perhaps,
is a beautiful gold brick would be sold to
us as a coin of the realm on potentialities.
Now, honourable gentlemen, believing, as
I do, that we would run the most certain
risk that we would be compelled to pay
an enormous price for this property-for
there is no doubt that it is worth more than
it is held at in the books-I say that we
should put the arbitrators in this position,
that they must not give an award which
is beyond the value of that property as
a going concern, an earning commercial
proposition.
How would they ascertain that? By looking at the net earnings of the com.pany,
and seeing what capital the net earnings
would justify us in investing in this purchase. How are we to find the net earnings?
It would not be fair at present to take the
last ten years, for this reason, that during
the late war the cost of operation went up
one hundred per cent, while the tariff which
they were allowed to charge foýr carriage of
merchandise went up not more than fifty
per cent. So that we would be taking advantage of their misfortunes in abnormal
times, and they would be fools to agree to
that. I have taken the operations for ten
years, from 1904 to 1913 inclusive, and I
have taken the net earnings for those ten
years, and ascertained what are the average
earnings., upon a share of stock during that
time. I find that we have to pay for that
in four per cent bonds, and I have ascertained how much capital that would pay
four per cent on per annunfi. I have a statement here in which it is worked out to the
last cent. I am dealing only with the first
preferred, second preferred, third preferred,
and common s7tock. These are what we are
arbitrating about, ordinary stocks. I have
found what the total dividends on the first

ten years they paid five per cent on the
first preferred. During that time they paid
on the second preferred five per cent, excepting for the year 1908, when they paid

two and-a-half per cent. During that time
they paid on the third preferred: During
the year 1904, nothing; for 1905, two per
cent; for 1906, three per cent; for 1907, three
per cent; for 1908, nothing; for 1909, nothing;
for 1910, one-half per cent; for 1911, one
and-a-h.lf per cent; for 1912, two and-a-half
per cent; and for 1913, two and-a-half per
cent. I am not going to trouble you with
the guaranteed stock on which they paid
four per cent during all that time. Now,
the average dividend that they paid
on these stocks during that time was
$1,938,929.01. In the Drayton-Acworth report the average dividends are not correctly
shown, because the calculation was made
there as if the stock during all those years
was at a standstill. As a matter of fact, it
increased, and you cannot find an average
dividend on a quantity of stock, unless it
is the same amount of stock on which the
dividend is paid over the period. But this
statement bas been worked out, and it
amounts to £9,960,250.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The Government. It is made out by a Government
official from the Grand Trunk books, and I
have the assurance of the Government representative that it is absolutely correct.
It means that if we pay them for this stock,
first, second, third preferred and common,
£9,960,250, they will get -dividends equal to
the average dividend which was paid to
them on these stocks for the years 1904 to
1913. You will recognize that this plan will
prevent the arbitrators from going beyond
that amount, but will not prevent them
from considering any element which they
may desire to consider in arriving at that
amount.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: You are aware that
the President of the Grand Trunk, Mr.
Chamberlin, and also the Vice-president,
said that during these years you have mentioned no charges were made for expenditures, and that these dividends were being
paid out when they should not have been
paid out at all. The question I wish to ask
the honourable gentleman is: are you taking

which ehould have been made and which
were not?

to consider whether or not these dividends
are really and properly paid, because I do
not propose that we shall state in the Bill
that they shall only value it on the earnings.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Do you propose by
this Bill to rip up anything--criminal court
corrupt practices? Are we going into that?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do not
know. I hope honourable gentlemen do not
understand me to be proposing that this
amount shall be paid to the railway cornpany, or that the arbitrators shall accept
as gospel all the statements which I have
made.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is an invitation
for them to do so, is it not?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I cannot
help it. I am only making this proposition.
I am simply placing a maximum amount,
and trying te explain to the House how I
arrive at that maximum. If you agree with
me that it should be placed upon earnings,

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I may say
that I have not considered anything except
the principal. That is for the arbitrators.
I have assumed that the Grand Trunk statements are all correct for my purposes, and
I have said that the best which the Grand
Trunk can make out on an earning capacity
is shown in their books. If I were settling
the price to be paid, I would look carefully
into the question that my honourable friend
has mooted. That is for the arbitrators. I
am not saying they would pay that amount,
but I say: " You shall not go beyond that
amount; if you find these dividends were
improperly paid, if you find these earnings
are not correct, you will give less."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Suppose they did
not take into account the $97,000,000 due by
the Grand Trunk Pacific, what effect would
that have on the dividends?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: They will
take into account anything that is put before them.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: But you have not.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen do not seem to understand.
Perhaps I am not making myself clear. I
am not taking anything into account. I
am not passing on any fact. I am not saying whether or not this is true, or whether
it is not true; but J say the best case the
Grand Trunk can make out is to show that
they paid these dividends, and if they show
they paid these dividends, and if for any

money-getter, I think you ought to accede

to my propisition. If you think the company would get less, valuing on some other
basis, then take the bridle off; but, if you
do, I think the horse will run away. All I
have done is te try to arrive at a maximum
worked out on the principle which I think
should be adopted, and which I think will
do justice to the railway company, and by
which we will not allow ourselves to be
victimized.
I have perhaps not succeeded in my point,
but I would put in this statement so that
it will be accessable. It will be of interest to
honourable members. I have endeavoured to
explain the ground upon which I have gone.

In conclusion, I would like ta, sayHon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentleman has adopted that basis 'because he
assumed that il was correct-that the dividends -were paid out of the revenues, not
out of the capital?
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: Out of
the earnings.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If hie had known that
they were paid out of capital, he would
not have adopted that basis?
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-,STAUNTON: I do not
trouble myseif ta inquire whether they were
or not.
Some Hon. SENATORUS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-.STAUNTON: Honourable gentleman, I arn trying ta put this
upon a cautious, careful basis, and I do
net consider that il is of any value ta
know, for the purpoae of my caiculations,
whether my premise is true or not. The
arbitrators will not be allowed ta go beyond that, and they will be bound ta go
below it if it turne out that the dividenda
are paid out of the capital, or improperly
paid.
As for me, I would much prefer that the
suggestion of the hon-ourable member from
Amherst <Hon. Mr. Curry) were adopted,
that this pro>perty were turned over to the
Canadian Pacific railway.
People are
shocked ai that idea; 'but the best-run corporation that I know of, one whose stock
stands firmly in the market, and wbich
gives a good service ta the public-I neyer
heard a word against it--is the Conaumers'
Gas Company in Toranto.
The city of
Toronto bas a large interest in it. Il is
managed by a private corporation, and

gives entire satisfaction in price and in
quality ta the city of Toronto. lis stock
stands usually ai over 200 and the dividende
are limiied ta 10 per cent, and 1 neyer
heard anyhady say that the Gas Company
o! Toronto should be taken over and operated otherwise than il is. If the Government of Canada cannai regulate, At cannai
manage. If it had a large intereat ini the
Canadian Paciie railway, il would have
stock that was worth money in the market,
and, as we all admit, in a corporation that
is managed hetter than any other corporalion that we know of. If thai were not
clone, I cannai understand why a paoling
agreement should not be made between the
Grand Trunk and the Government, by
which they wauld interchange traffic over
the two .roads.
However, as I said befare, we are flot
here to Iay clown a policy; we are here to
see that, when the policy o! owning the
railways has been laid dlown years befnr2i
-and, by the way, adopted and approved
by this House-no hasty, ill-cotisiderc!d
bargain shal be made, by which Canada

Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, in common with a number
of my colleagues on this side of the House,
I regret that on this occasion I shall have

on matters that have come before this
Chamber. But the necessity of my doing
so was not of my making. It is solely due
to what I believe will be the ill consequences to Canada if this measure now
before the House is adopted.
I listened with great interest and in considerable perplexity to the speech of the
honourable member for Hamilton (Hen.
The honourable
Mr. Lynch-Staunton).
member stated that he had very great
doubts at one time :about the character of
this legislation, and that it was such as
should meet with his support. I do not
know by what arguments he was convinced
that it was his duty to vote for this measure.
Certainly those arguments were not reflected

in any of the remarks which he addressed
to this Chamber. He has given to me, if
proof were wanting to me, the strongest
proof why I should maintain my present

disposition to vote against the measure.
He has told us why no arbitration should
be held. He has shown us the way
by which we can arrive at the price. It
is not necessary to employ distinguished
counsel. It is nat necessary to select important personages to act as arbitrators,
for any accountant can prepare the figures.
Have a number of accountants, if you will,
so that tiere shall be no divergence in the
figures wbich they prepare and present to
this House. Then it is for us to pass upon
the question. and sec whether we will purchase the property or not. If the very course
were adopted that the honourable member
for Hamilton bas outlined in his remarks
here, there is not a member of this House
but would bu able to pass upon the value
of this property, because every member
would have the facts before him upon which
to make up his mind, just as competently

az could bu done by arbitrators employed

one requiring the utmost care, the utmost
attention, and the utmost skill on the part
of the conveyancer. He said that it would
be impossible for him to state whether that
work could be performed in two weeks or
not, although he had at his command the
whole resources of the Justice Department
of this country. So I leave my friend, the
inember for Hamilton and the Minister of
the Interior to fight the battle out between
them.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I do not

themselves in the very best part of Canada
where there was the greatest population,
the greatest business, the greatest industry.
Therefore they had an opportunity, if any
railway could bave an opportunity, to make

that they have not been able to pay dividends, as they should have paid thein.
Their management was really mismanagement. They attempted to manage a great

miles, with directors not living in the country nor having any knowledge wbatever of
it. All the troubles that have come to them
have come by reason of their own mismanagement.

would have succeeded in what it was attempting to do.
M-acdonald, Tupper and
Pope were the three. men who saved the
situation at that tine. So I say, honourable gentlemen,
that on sentimental
grounds alone, so far as I am concerned,
the Grand Trunk people would plead in
vain for any clemency. I would give them
cold justice, but nothing more.
This should be a business proposition.
We are business men, or supposed to be.
The Grand Trunk Railway company have
fallen down on a proposition which they
made to this country-for we di-d not ask
the Grand Trunk railway to send their lines
to the West. We did not ask them to establish a transcontinental system in Canada.
They came to the Parliament of Canada
asking for that. I happened to have the
honour of a seat in the other House at that
time, and I know ail about the circumstances surrounding their coming here. It was
true that they desired only to connect with
North bay and build from that point westward. They may say that the National
Transcontinental was forced upon them.
Perhaps it was, but they accepted it. As
business men they must have known what
they were accepting. They entered into
an agreement whereby the Federal -Government was. to take off their hands the building of the line from North Bay to Winnipeg.
That was part of the consideration when
they entered into the agreement to lease
the property. The portion from Winnipeg
to Moncton was built by the country at
large. Under the agreement, the Grand
Trunk people were to supervise the building of the road, to see that it did not cost
more than it should have cost, and then
to pay a certain rental over a number of
years subsequent -to completion, for the
use of that road, and to operate it, for, I
think, fifty years. I am not certain as to
the time, but I think that is correct.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, fifty years.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Time passed on,
and the National Transcontinental was finished. The Grand Trunk were asked to implement their agreement by taking over the
road, and they absolutely refused. They
broke their contract: they broke a solemn
contract entered into between themselves
and the people of Canada. And these are
the people who are now coming whining to
us for special consideration! The Grand
Trunk Pacific was their own child. It was
their own desire that they should have the
Grand Trunk Pacific, and now they throw
that also upon our doorsteps, and ask us

363

to take care of it. They broke their contract. I think all they should expect from
this country is cold justice, and that is
all that we should give them.
We have enough serious obligations upon
our hands. We have facing us a serious
problem regarding our soldiers. This war
bas cost us a tremendous amount of money.
I do not propose to go into figures at this
late hour. We have a surfeit of figures. I
say the war has cost us a tremendous
amount of money. It has laid a burden
upon this nation from which it will take
many years to recover. The other House is
now, I understand, debating a motion to
give additional help to our soldiers, the
men who fought for us that we might have
liberty to sit and debate in this room, and
who, by their exertions, held that liberty
for us. Yet we are declining to give additional reward to them. But we have plenty
of money, any amount of money, to give
to the Grand Trunk shareholders. I was
in London two years ago when a meeting of
the Grand Trunk shareholders was held,
and I read the next day in the Times an extended account of what was uttered by
those shareholders at that meeting. Reading the slanderous and scurrilous remarks
that those shareholders made about the people of Canada, I said to myself: " They
will need to have a mighty good case to get
mny support when they come looking for
help."
The honourable the Minister of Labour
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) made a few remarks
on this question. The Minister of Labour
is usually sane and level-headed. I never
knew him to slip before, but he made a
most unfortunate remark, it seems to me,
with reference to the National railway, formerly the Canadian Northern. He said-I
think I quote him correctly-that the Canadian Northern railway east of Winnipeg
was a joke. Well, the Government of
which he was a member induced us to pay
a considerable price for that. A rather expensive joke I If it was a jole for this country, I hope there is no joker in the Bill before us.
The Minister of Labour went further. He
found it necessary to cry up the Grand
Trunk, and to decry the railway that we
own, and for which we paid a very large
amount of money. If the Minister of
Labour ,had expressed himself in the sante
way two years ago, when the Ganadian
Northern matter was before the House, 1
doubt if Parliament would have consented
-if they had taken his words at their face
value-to make that purchase. He can

SENATE

364

see nothing but good in the Grand Trunkth.. most magnificent line that ever was
created, in the opinion of the Minister of
Labour. Why should he cry up the one
and cry down the other? We own the
national road. We are about to buy the
other. Why should he cry out " stinking
fish" with regard to the one, and "caller
herring " with regard to the other? Is that
the attitude of a wise buyer-to tell the man
from whom he is going to purchase: "Say,
old man, you have the finest horse "-or
the finest cow-"that I ever saw in my
life. What would you take for it?" Even if
he wishes to give a fair price, he does not
use those tactics. He need not decry the
property that he is going to buy, but he
certainly should not exaggerate its value.
If I were acting as one of the counsel on
that arbitration my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has
spoken of, I certainly should quote the
speech of the honourable the Minister of
Labour in support of my contention as to
the great value, potential and otherwise,
of this great railway that was before the
court.
We also had testimony as to the value
of the Grand Trunk from my honourable
friend from Wentworth (Hon. Mr. Smith).
He also spoke in the most eulogistic terms
of it. I remember having had an experience once with the Grand Trunk that
did not tend to arouse my admiration for
it and its rolling stock. I left Ottawa one
Sunday morning at 8 o'clock by the Grand
Trunk, at least, I supposed I was going to

were due to leave, I think, at 8.10. I cannot be absolutely sure, but the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) will correct me if I make
any mistake with regard to this, for
he was my companion on this journey.
We left at 8.10; at least, we went aboard
the train at eight o'clock. lIt was to have
left at 8.10; but we stayed alongside the
platform for at least an hour. Then we were
moved out as far as the bridge, and lay
there for three hours; then we were moved
down the line three or four miles, where we
remained until another engine was procured-and that lasted about twenty miles
further. To make a long story short, I arrived in Montreal in time to catch the 9.45
night train on the Canadian Pacifie railway
for Ottawa. My honourable friend the leader
of the Government in this House had not
then the high opinion of the Grand Trunk
that he seeins to entertain now.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They have
improved since then.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Now we are told that
this proposition is going to be a great financial success because of the enormous production of coal from the mines owned by -the
Grand Trunk. My honourable friend the
Minister of Labour would have to settle
matters with his labour friends in the
United States, or we might have difficulty
in getting that coal, because, as I understand, all that coal is commandeered on account of the coal strike and the consequent
shortage.
Hon. ,Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am glad to know
it is not so. But you will have to have a
different experience to what I have had in
coal mines, in order to make all that you
claim will be made out of these mines along
the line of the Grand Trunk.
I am not going to take much more of the
tirne of the House; but J wish to give a few
t
reasons why I am opposed to · his measure.
I come from the Maritime Provinces, and
naturally I am interested in the winter
ports of those provinces-St. John, Halifax.
Sydney-and I consider that this is bad
legislation from that point of view. lIt may
be my own fault, but I cannot understand
how any man having at heart the welfare
of the eastern part of this country, what is
known as the Maritime Provinces, can vote
for this measure. If the road to Portland is
to be a success and is to pay-and I understand that it has not paid in the past-it
must be made to pay by increased traffic,
and that increased traffic must be had at
the expense of our Canadian ports. That
follows as a matter of course. From Montreal, Portland has an advantage of a shorter
haul by over 200 miles over St. John. In
the winter the haulage from Montreal to
Portland costs about half as much as the
haul to St. John, and about one-third the
cost to Halifax. That is a serious handicap
to our eastern ports. For thirty-five years
our policy has been to have lines running
east and west to build up the Maritime Provinces by means of the traffic that would
flow through them in our export trade. I
fought the Grand Trunk Pacific on the very
ground that the Grand Trunk people had a
port at Portland., and I felt that the traffic
which the Canadian Pacific was carrying
from the West would be diverted to that
port from the Maritime Provinces so far as
the Grand Trunk Pacific could divert it.
That, it seems to me, is a very wrong thing,

GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY ACQUISITION
BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 33,
an Act respecting the acquisition by His
Majesty of the Grand Trunk Railway system. Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, before we proceed-to deal
with the different clauses of the Bill may
I say it is proposed, as we proceed with the
consideration of the Bill in committee, that
certain amendments shall be moved so as
to give effect to the suggestions which were
made during the discussion upon the second
reading.
There are two fundamental
changes suggested. It is proposed that a

maximum shall

be

set upon

the

award

to be made by the arbitrators.
My
honourable friend the Minister of Labour
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) will present to the
committee an amendment dealing with that
subject. He is familiar with it, and has
not only given co.nsideration to it, but has
gone into the matter at some length with
all the parties interested.
A further important change may possibly
be made, namely: we shall discuss the proposal that the stocks will be submitted to
arbitration-the guaranteed stock as well
as the preference issues; and that the
guaranteed stock and the preference issues
oe included in the amount which will be
paid per annum by the Government, so
that the public will be fully assured, notwithstanding the potential value that may
be urged, that the Government of Canada
will not bind itself to pay to the shareholders of the Grand Trunk more than the
maximum named in this amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Coultd the
honourable gentleman tell us what the
maximum amount is?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend the Minister of 'Labour
will do that. The amendments, which have
been distributed, are of course consequential to the essential or material amendments which will be moved.
Hon. GEORGE G. FOSTER: Honourable
gentlemen: Before we proceed to the dis-

cussion of the Bill which is before this
Chamber, I ask your indulgence while I
call attention to a matter which, while it is
to a certain extent personal to myself, also
reflects upon the honour and well-being of
this Chamber and the Government of this
country. I have received from soie unknown source during the last few days two
marked copies of a newspaper printed in the
city of Winnipeg and called the Manitoba
Free Press. In the first column on the
editorial page is a leading editorial, headed
" The Senate and the Grand Trunk." There
is a half or three-quarters of a column of
matter which I shall not ask the Chamber
to listen to. But I am going to read to
you,
and through you to the country, some of
the language contained in that editorial.
It is dated October 27, 1919, and says:
The acquisition of the Grand Trunk railway
by the Canadian Government is essential to the
successful future operation of the National Railway system.

Another portion of the same article says:
The financial interests which oppose the acquisition of the Grand Trunk railway are well

Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

Dear Mr. Smith:I am quite sure you will understand that I
have no motive, other than the one berein expressed, in asking you to accept my resignation
as President of the Stanstead, Shefford and
Chambly Railway.
When, several years ago, your company paid
me the compliment of selecting me as its President I accepted the office with mucb pleasure,
because it maintained a connection which had
existed with my family for at least forty years,
in that my father had been Presidant during
that time.
I am impelled to resign for no other reason
than the fact that this company is controlled
and owned practically by the Grand Trunk
railway and its affiliated companies, and that
it was through the affiliation of the S. S. & C.
with the Central Vermont, of which you are
President, that I was appointed, and, as I arn
not able to concur in the legislation which is
pending before Parliament, with regard to the
sale to the Government of the different proper-

to have the reputations they bring to this

chase, I want to see the contract drawn so
that every line and every provision, no matter what political party or individual it may
please, shall be framed so that it will serve
the best interests and secure the protection
of the people so far as we can protect them.
I desire to express the hope that the
honourable leader of this House will exercise patience with -us, and give us full
opportunity to understand the question, to
study it and to look at it in every phase;
and my only desire is that when it is done
Canada may be saved from the position
which I have feared and still fear she may
be placed in by virtue of this Bi, but
which may be mitigated very niuch by
amendments which will safeguard the interests of the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Instead of going
into the merits of amendments which have
been laid before us, would it not be advisable for the Minister of Labour to give us
the explanation that would enlighten the
Senate, and afterwards to adjourn the committee stage till three o'clock, so that we
may have a little tine in which to digest
these aiendiments.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Hon. gentlemen,
I think that the House must have been
deeply impressed with the importance of
the suggestion advanced by the member for
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) yesterday, as to the necessity of placing some
maximum beyond, which the arbitrators
ought not and should not go. The honourable gentleman from Hamilton had very
carefully compiled a statement upon a basis
which in his opinion was absolutely fair,
and the conclusion he reached was
that the annual amount which the Government would be called upon to pay
by reason of the valuation of the
stock ought not to exceed an amount
which he proposed to name. The amount
which the honourable gentleman from
Hamilton had in mind was, however,
arrived at without taking into consideration
the number of assets of the Grand Trunk
Railway Company, which perhaps may be
best termed and described as undisclosed
assets, that is, revenues and surpluses
which they enjoy and have, which do not
appear in the records of the Grand Trunk
railway itself, but in those of the subsidiary
companies. Therefore, I think those ought
to be taken into consideration, and in
moving the amendment which I propose to
offer to the House I have that in view.
Perhaps it would be just as well that I
should read the proposed addition to clause
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

6, and then explain briefly the reasons why
it is proposed to make this change. I move
that we add to clause 6, alter the word
"Canada," page 3, line 19, the following
words:
'he value, If any, so determined shafl in any
event be limited to an amount on which the
annual dividend at four per cent per annum'
will not exceed five million dollars. The fixing
of this amount shall not be taken by the arbitrators as any addition or indication that
the value to be determined is the amount s0
fixed, or any other amount.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That would
cover the arbitration of guaranteed stock
as well as preferred and common?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Consequential amendments will be made as we
proceed to give effect to that proposal that
it covers guaranteed stock, without expressing it in this amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If I remember
correctly, the figures the honourable gentleman from Hamilton based his calculation
on yesterday would have resulted in a
maximum of about $4,372,000 as against
$5,000,000 which is proposed to be the maximuni by this amendment. As indicated a
few minutes ago, there are some assets of
the Grand Trunk Railway Company which
I think, merit consideration and ought to
be taken into consideration by the arbitra-

tors; and, if the shareholders of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company are to accept this
Bill, as it may be finally passed, it must
be at least reasonably just to them. Therefore, if I may, I propose briefly to indicate
to the House why I think it is reasonable
to increase the maximum proposed from
$4,380,000, to $5,060,000 which was the basis
arrived at by the honourable member from
Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That makes $80,000,000 capitalized.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: About $125,000,000. The Grand Trunk Railway Company
own the stock in a number of subsidiary
companies which are profitable. I shall

referring to it to demonstrate the thought
I have in mind that there should be a
margin over and above the amount which
the honourable gentleman .from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) had in mind,
to take care of the Grand Trunk subsidiary
assets.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Do J understand
in connection with these undisclosed assets
that it is the intention te increase the
yearly dividend as if they were investments?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: You have suggested making the maximum $4,380,000.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My thought is
that the undisclosed assets such as these,
are items that ought to be and must be
taken into consideration by the arbitrators
in dealing with the whole subject. Further, if we limited the maximum, as is proposed, to the sum of $4.380,000, which was
about the figure the honourable member
from Hamilton had in his mind, based upon
the railroad assets only, we would probably
be dealing unfairly with the shareholders,
and perhaps put the thing in such a position
that it would not be accepted, and the arbitration would fail. Therefore we propose
to make the maximum amount, beyond
which the arbitrators must not go, $5,000,000 in order to take care of the undisclosed
assets which I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: You do not regard the reserves as permanent investments like stock in the construction of a
railway?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: These are matters which the board alone should determine, because we have no knowledge of
the facts. But if we restrict the board
from giving consideration to any of those
properties which I have mentioned, I think
it would be unfair to the owners of those
properties.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In the surplus of
the Grand Trunk Railway Company, were
those assets or profits put in for the year
1918?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would ask the
honourable gentleman whether he bas
taken into consideration the question of
giving a clear direction to the arbitrators
to consider those items which he has
mentioned, as against the $97,000,000, the
liability of the Grand Trunk Railway Company on the Grand Trunk Pacifie, which,
of course, will have to be assumed by the
Government.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I understand
that the Victoria bridge is owned by the
Grand Trunk Railway Company direct,
and that the company is not an independent company. In answer to the question
of the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Bostock), I do not think, seeing that the House
of Commons did not presume to do so, that
this House should undertake to restrict or
direct details of what the arbitrators
should do in any way. We should leave
these matters entirely to them. I do not
think we are competent, in the absence of
in:formation or knowledge of details, to
direct the arbitrators to do, or not to do
any specific thing.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I would like to
ask whether the undisclosed assets were
disclosed to the House of Commons when
this Bill was under review?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I cannot say
definitely, but J do know that this very
statement which I now hold in my hand
lias been in the possession of the Department of Railways, and that it is a state-

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
ment of fact audited by Price, Waterhouse
and Company, who, J think, are a firm of
auditors in whom everyhody has confidence. I do not think there is any doubt
whatever as to the correctness or- authenticity of the facts I am presenting.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I appreciate the
principle on whieh the honourable minister is proceeding as regards these undisclosed assets, but it strikes me
that the Grand Trunk Railway ComDany get the benefit of these assets.
But, soraewhat on the lines suggested by
the honourable leader on this side of the
House, I would suggest for the consideration of the Government and the Minister
of Labour the advisability of adopting the
clause which I am going to read, as an
addition to the Bill. I think it is proper
to guard against the company being treated
unfairly; it is equally advisable to guard
against the people of this country being
treated unfairly; and it would be necessary
to have some provision of this kind added
to the Bill:
For the purpose of the valuation provided for
in this Act, the arbitrators shall treat the
obligations of the Grand Trunk Railway Company -as guarantors of bonds or other securities
or other title of indebtedness of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie Railway Company or of the
Grand Trunk Pacifie Branch Lines Company,
and all other claims of the Government of the
Dominion of Canada against either of the abovementioned companies, as being in full force.

I am afraid that the Bill, as drafted, and
particularly clause 11, would imply that the
Government assumes the- entire responsibility of the obligations of the Granfl Trunk
Pacific Railway Company and the Grand
Trunk Pacifie Branch Lines-Company, and
that therefore any claim that the Government of Canada may have against either of
those companies may be wipep out. I think
it is fair that the door should be closed to
all interpretations of that kind. The Governiment should be given no .advantage over
the Grand Trunk, but, on the other hand,
the Grand Trunk should have no advantage
over the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Has the
honourable gentleman put that in writing?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have it here.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not quite
connect the proposed amendment which
,the honourable member from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) has in mind, as referring to clause 6, which we have been discussing.

373

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not know that
it does refer to clause 6.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The honourable
gentleman was not intending that it should
modify the amendment under discussion?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Oh, no, I was not.
It is not connected with that amendment.
I think it might be put at the very end
of the Bill, after clause 11.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Could not the honourable gentleman table his amendment, so
that copies of it may be made?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, I will do so.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I understand from
the honourable minister (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that the income from these sources
will be included. I am referring to page
45 of the general statement of the Grand
Trunk.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is it not?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: None of the figures that I have quoted are contained in
the Grand Trunk reports at all, because
they are not Grand Trunk matters. They
are profits accruing to the subsidiary conpanies in whi-ch the Grand Trunk Railway
own stock, after they have paid dividends
,to the Grand Trunk in full upon the stock.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The dividends will
be included?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But what is not included is the surplus?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The surplus,
which runs to half a million dollars.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes. Now, in many
cases these surpluses which they show may
not amount to much. What I mean is: are
any of them in liquid form-in money or
bonds or anything of that description?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Or cash in the bank?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It seems -to me that,
whether you brought this up or not, it
would be the duty of the 'arbitrators to go
into the affairs of the individual companies,
to make sure there was such a surplus. For
instance, in the case of the Grand Trunk
proper, they showed a surplus last year,
even though they paid no dividend.
Another question I would like to -ask the
minister is this. You are now giving us the
undisclosed assets; in connection with

SENATE

374

them. I presume there will. be also undisclosed liabilities. Have you those?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
appreciate, honourable gentlemen, this line
of reasoning. Assuming for the moment
that we had the most exact statement regarding every dollar of liability owing by
the Grand Trunk to its creditors, in what
way would that assist us in aTriving at a
conclusion as to what we should pay the
Grand Trunk? We should be assuming the
office of the arbitrators. Parliament is not
the tribunal nor the body to determine this
valuation. Why do we appoint arbitrators?
The duty of the arbitrators will be to Investigate carefully, with the greatest exactitude, all the liabilities and all the assets
and all the values of the Grand Trunk
Railway system and its affiliated companies,
if you choose, and then to determine what
shah be paid. Now, if my honourable
friend had before him to-day an exact statement of the liabilities and assets, would
he be prepared to determine what the Goverrment of Canada should pay the Grand
Trunk, and would the other members of
Parliament accept my honourable friend's
judgment and findings? It would be utterly
impossible to arrive at a conclusion in that
way. The arbitrators will doubtless spend
twelve months or more in making the most
careful and extended investigation of all
the affairs of this company, and then they
will come to a -conclusion as to what should
be paid. It is for this reason that the scope
of the arbitrators in determining the award
is enlarged. The amount mentioned by my
honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) was based upon the
net earnings, or the dividends, or the interest, which would be more accurate, over a
period of ten years. As pointed out by my
honourable friend the Minister of Labour
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) there are other assets
than those net earnings, and it is desirable
arbitrators should consider
that the
whether they possess any value or not. If
they do not possess any value, the award is
not increased; if they do possess value, it is
reflected in the award; if there be liabilities, tbose are reflected in the award; if there
are any assets, their value is reflected in
the award; and so on. So it seems to me it
is futile for us to discuss what the liabilities and what the assets may be. because it
does not lead to anything. That is primarily the duty of the arbitrators.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I should like to ask
the honourable leader of the House if there

is in his mind, or in the mind of anybody
else, any doubt that the arbitrators, in arriving at the final amount, wilil take into
consideration any liabilities that may hereafter be shown to exist in any place or in
any respect against this company. I understand from him, but I want to be quite
clear on the point, that it will be the duty
of the arbitrators to take into consideration any undisclosed indebtedness, no matter where it may be found.
I
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
might remind my honourable friend that,
having in mind the Canadian Northern
award, we made a special provision that
there should be. a certain reserve made for
undisclosed liabilities, and it will be the
duty of the arbitrators to see that the publie interest is protected in every possible
way in precisely the sane manner -as two
individuals would ýprotect their interest
when entering into an arbitration respecting the purchase of property and the assumption of liabilities associated therewith.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHaSTAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, i think that the discussion
is not keeping in a right channel, respecting the motion of the minister. May I be

which I suggested yesterday, I considered
only the funds which the !Grand Trunk
Railway Company declared were available
for dividends. Now, if we are going to raise
that limit by the same methods as I followed, we should be satisfied that these undisclosed assets are available for dividends.
That is the touchstone: Are they available
for dividends? Any company may write up
in its books that it made a surplus, but
the question is, has it written up in its
books that thisVISIT OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, when we adjourned I was
endeavouring to explain that these assets
which are spoken of by the honourable
Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
should be added in if they were actually
available for dividende to the 'Grand Trunk
railway. Since the adjournment I have
crystallized my idea in the form of this
amendment:
The value, If any, so determined shall in any
event be limited to an amount on which the
annual dividend at four per cent per annum
, being the average
shall not exceed
dividend paid by the Grand Trunk during the
ten years prior to 1914.

That is the same amendment as I have
given notice of, except that it is expressed
in interest instead of in capital. I have
added to that these words:
Should, however, It appear to the satisfaction
of the arbitrators that the cash reserves of
subsidiary companies of the Grand Trunk as
claimed to exist were actually availaible for
dividends and were not offset by unpald liabilities In other subsidiary companles, the limit
above mentioned may by the arbitrators be
raised to $5,000,000.

That is to say, as appears from the statement that the Minister of Labour referred
to, the~re are certain surpluses of subsidiary
companies which, it is claimed, are available for dividende on Grand Trunk stocks.
Now, there are several subsidiary companies of the Grand Trunk Company which
have had deficits instead of surpluses, and
the Grand Trunk has, over a period of
years, paid to those companies about $7,000,000 in advances. If this 37,000,000 was all
that was required to keep those companies
solvent, those surpluses would palpably be
available for dividends; but if those cornpanies which did not pay dividende are still
carrying deficits, the Grand Trunk Company will have to advance them more
money to make up the deficits, and these
advances would absorb the surpluses in the
successful companies. This proviso of mine
covers that point, and makes it clear that
if the arbitrators find that the advances
already made by the Grand Trunk Company
were sufficient to keep the defaulting subsidiary companies solvent, then they might
find that these surpluses are genuinely
available. If they do not find that sufficient has been paid by the Grand Trunk
Company to the ffailing companies, then
they are not available for dividende and
they would not get an advance on that
account. If the amendment is put in this
way, it will give the Grand Trunk Company
the ibenefit of those surpluses appearing on

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Had we
not better wait until we get to that clause?
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: Wi.th reference to
what has been stated by the honourable
member fro.m Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton), I may say that I notified the
Minister of Labour that I intended to ask
a question this afternoon along similar
lines. I advised him of the question which
I intended to ask, so that he would be prepared to answer me; but I observe that he
is not in his seat at this moment, and I
have no doubt the leader of the House will

his argument; but my business experience
is thalt when a company piles up a surplus,
that surplus is not kept in the bank or in
bonds or securities, but is reinvested
in the betternent of lte property. 'T'he
honourable Minister of Labour stated this
morning that it was proposed to consider

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable leader of the Government allow me to
say a few words in order that the Senate
may understand whiat the proposal is?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend will permit me, I desire
to say that since we met this morning I have
taken up the varions proposals made with
the Governmtent, and I have given mty
undivided and best attention to endeavouring
te work out the difficulties which faced us
and which are involved in the amendments.
I find that it would be impracticable to pursue the course that I suggested this norning
as evidenced in the amendient which I
moved, and consequently I propose to
amend the Bill along other linos. I propose
dispensing with the various consequential
amendments which were distributed this
morning, and when we come to section 6, to
amend that section as follows. I just mention it now, before we proceed with the Bill,
so that when we consider the preceding sections we nay know wlat to expect when
we reach section 6. The amendment I propose is as follows:

would only be noticed by any one accustomed to analyse financial statements, is
that if those companies earned eight per
cent and piled up their reserve, that would
be all right; but if the reserve fron year to
year, as earned, was put back into the properties and only by means of that reinvestment they were able to earn eight per cent,
then I claim that those surpluses cannot be
cons'idered, because we would be paying
twice over. We would be paying on a basis
of eight per cent dividend, and we would
also be taking into consideration the surplus
that bas been accumulated. I gave notice
verbally to the Minister of Labour that I
proposed to ask a question with reference to
this, as it naturally occurred to me when
he made his speech this morning. The point
I want to make is that we are in danger of
paying twice, at least according to ny understanding of what the Minister of Labour
said. If that reserve is in cash, and is available for distribution, it is quite right that
the Grand Trunk Company should receive
some consideration.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I propose
to add it to section 6 after theword"Canada"
on page 3, line 19. I merely mention it
now so that when we come to section 6 we
may be able to deal with it. May I suggest to the committee that we proceed with
the sections preceding that, as they appear
in the Bill from the Commons, and if it is
resirable that we should reconsider them,
the jutdgment of the House must prevail.
It seent to me that that would be the most
satisfactory way of proceeding with the
Bill.

Hon. Mr.
LYNOHS'PAUNTON:
This
amendment is meant to cover that point.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

other amount.

That will conte

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
what the honourable leader has called the
consequential amendments, be proceeded
with?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I propose
to move this amendment when we come to
section 6.
My honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has
an amendment which apparently would be
in lieu of this. My honourable friend from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. iBéique) has an
amendment of which he gave notice this
norning, and which will be dealt with
later on. These three amendments are the
only amendments before us, and I think
they are the only amendments we need
anticipite. At al] events, they are the
only anendments J can foresee.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do I understand
that all the other amendments are withdrawn?
Hon. Sir. JAMES LOUGHEED: They
were consequential upon our adopting the
amendment to section 6.
Hon. Mr. 130STOCK: That was moved
by the honourable the Minister of Labour
this morning.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, but
we propose now to withdraw those and adopt
this. All that was done very hurriedly
between two o'clock this morning, when
we adjourned, and the time when we met.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Do J understand that the modified position is that the
guaranteed stock is allowed its four per
cent interest, as in the Bill which came
from the Commons, and that the arbitrators
will simp]v value the preferred and common stocks, but may not, in the aggregate,
go beyond $5,000.000P
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: All stocks
are included in the $5,000,000. Then, under
section 4 of the Bill the Government must
have authority to deal with the holders of
the guaranteed stock with the view of their
delivering it up, and thus abandoning the
voting power which it carries, and of accepting non-voting in lieu thereof. That is an
agreement which will have to be entered
into between the Government and the guaranteed stoekholders, but we make no discrimination in the amendment which I
have moved. The whole must be included
in the $5,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Do you think it

would be wise to pay such a large sum,

or any sum, in fact, by way of guarantee?

It is an invitation to the arbitrators that
yôu will be satisfied if they do that.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, that is my•
opnion.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The objection of
honourable gentlemen before was that there
was no limit, and we were asked to do
the very things to which they are now
objecting. Now the honourable gentleman
does not want a limit to be placed in the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think the limit
of $5,000,000 is too large.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr CASGRA[N: It is about as
large as the Grand Trunk asked for.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It does
not fix an arbitrary amount; it is discretionary with the arbitrators. We simpiy
allow them to valuate the property, and,
supposing that they fix it at $10,000,000 we
are not to pay more thanHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not want
to run counter to the suggestioi of my
honourable friend, -who says that this
matter may be debated on clause 6. I
am ready to make a ilittle statement showing
what the situation is to-day and what it
was before this maximum was fixed. If the
honourable gentlemen insists that I should
waitHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
want to put it on the ground of insistitig;
but the futility, I think, is apparent. Would
it not be better for us to discuss some
concrete question, and then the judgment
of the House ca-n be taken upon it by
way of an amendment?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not intend
to diseussHon. Mr. CROSBY: Had we not better
have the clause read and drawn in proper
order? The House does not know what
clause it is discussing. Let us discuss the
clauses that come before us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I only draw
the attention of the honourable gentlemen
to this fact,Hon. Mr. OROSBY: Mr. Chairman, I
w-ant to know what clause we are discussing,
and I want it read.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We have a
notice by the leader of the Government

SENATE

378

that c1lause 6 is to be altered. The notice
is different from that given by the Minister
of Labour this morning. The whole Bill
will be affected by the decision on clause 6.
Before we reach that we have to pass the
first five clauses. It seems to me that we
should understand the situation before we
start discussing the first five clauses. Inasmuch as we will have consequential
amendments, the Senate shouid know
exactly what this maximum figure of $5,000,000 means when compared with the offer
of the Government to the Grand Trunk
and the counter offer of the Grand Trunk
to the Government.
I will only speak for two or three minutes,
so that the points of comparison may be in
the minds of honourable gentlemen. I
want to draw attention to the fact that the
Government, by this off er to the Grand
Trunk, had declared iself ready to make
an annual payment of $2,500,000 for the
first three years, $3,000,000 for the succeeding five years, and 83,600,000 annually
thereafter. Mr. Smithers, by his letter of
August Sth, said that he dild not believe that
those figures were sufficient, and he closed
his letter by saying:
But it was also suggested that an alternative

should be made of a definite sum without arbitration, and I am authorized to say the board
would recommend to the shareholders the payment of an annual sum of £1,163,000-

-which, at $4.86 would be equivalent to
$5,652,000. So you have an offer by the
Government to pay a maximum after eight
years of $3,600,000 a year, and you have a
coùnter offer by the Grand Trunk of $5,652,000.
The honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has suggested
a maximum of $4,336,000-I will drop capital
account-as against $3,600,000 in the offer
of the Government, and as against 35,652,000 in the offer of the Grand Trunk. Now
the Government says, "We will fix a maxiI -draw attention to
mum of $5,000,000."
the fact that this maximum amount which
may be granted by the arbitrators is $1,400,000 a year more than the offer of the
Government; yet it is below the minimum
amount which the Grand Trunk Railway
Company was ready to take. Now the
Government says $5,000,000. I am not very
much concerned with the reasons which
actuate the GovernmentHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend prefer that it should
be put in this way: that the arbitrators
should arbitrate between the maximum
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

offer of the Government and the minimum
offer of the Grand Trunk?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I draw
the attention of my honourable friend to
the fact that I am not arguing, I am simply giving figures. While you are limiting it to $5,000,000, there is a decrease in
the common stock of $652,000 a year. I
want to draw attention to the fact that we
were guaranteeing the four per cent guar-

anteed stock. If the arbitration goes up
to the full amount of $5,000,000, we are
guaranteeing on the preferred stock a 4 per
cent dividend in perpetuity.
I will not repeat the remarks which I
made as to the danger of assuring a dividend which may not be earned on that
preferred stock, because in spite of my
argument the majority decided that the
Bill should be put through. Now we must
do the best we can to safeguard the interests of the country, and, pro tanto the
fixing of the sum of $5,000,000 is a very
great safeguard of the interests of Canada, because we put a limitation upon the
fiight of the imaginations of the arbitra'
tors in assessing the potential value of that
stock. Yet we must not close our eyes to
the fact that the maximum will give an
assured 4 per cent on that preferred stock.
As I said, I am not very much concerned in the reasons which actuated the
Government in fixing that $5,000,000, nor
in the discussion which arises over these
balances which belong to the reserves
which have been accumulated by the various subsidiary companies, because the arbitrators will have a number of other
reasons by which they may decide that
$5,000,000 is the correct figure for their final
decision. They may decide it on the value
of the terminals. They may decide it upon the prospective value if we do not state
in an amendment that the prospective
value is not to enter into consideration.
I am not so muth interested in the reasons
which aetuated the Government in fixing
the figure at $5,000,000, because there are
so many other considerations that I feel
that we have practically given a direction
which may be taken advantage of, and that
the result may be that $5,000,000 will be
the decision of the arbitrators.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-Government empowered to
enter into agreements with Grand Trunk,
etc.:

Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: Before that section
is carried, I feel that to be consistent I must

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
again refer to my objection to the provision
in that clause. The section says:
The Government may enter into an agreement
with the Grand Trunk Railway Company of
Canada and with such other companies and interests as the Government may thInk necessary.

My objection is on the ground that the
Parliament of Canada will not receive

a

copy of that agreement, and that, whatever
the award may be it will have to be paid
without either the House of Commons or
the Senate seeing a copy of the agreement.
The unfairness is in the fact that before
the Grand Trunk shareholders have to
come to a decision, this agreement will be
prepared, signed, sealed and delivered,
and submitted to them in London, and they
can accept it or reject it as they please;
they can criticize it or ask for amendments
te it, and the Government, by Order in
Council under subsequent clause, is authorized to alter the agreement if they see
fit.
I am not going to raise any factious
opposition to the clause; but one of the
chief objections that J have to this agreement, and one of the principal reasons I
had for rising in my place and suggesting
delay the other day, was because I have
never yet known of a business transaction
-perhaps on account of my limited experience-in which one side had not an
opportunity of seeing the agreement and
yet became bound by it, and the other side
had the right to reject or accept. I do not
propose to offer any amendment, but to be
logical, and so that my objection may be
better understood, I have felt in incumbent
upon me to rise and give voice to it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Nicholls) is to be congratulated for bringing this matter to the attention of the
House. The question of the agreement mentioned in this clause is a most important
one in the interests of the country. It is
provided that these other companies and
interests shall be dealt with in the agreement, but we do not know anything about
them. We have not the information we
ought to have, and we are asked to give
the Government a sort of blanket charter,
or a free hand, to deal with these matters
without knowing really what they cover.
The arrangement under this Bill is that
this agreement, after it is drawn up, is to
be submitted to the shareholders of the
Grand Trunk Railway Company; but we in
this House, and members of Parliament
generally, are not going to àee the terms and

379

details of this agreement before we assent
ta it. We are to give the Government a free
hand to draw up the agreement and put into
it what they like. I think we are asked to
go very far in this matter, and that it is
not in line with what has been the policy
heretofore in regard to this kind of agreement with railway companies. As I took occasion to point out previously, when the
agreement was made between the representatives of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the ýGovernment, the whole terms
of the agreement were set out in the
schedule to that Act. And, again, when the
agreement was made between the Government of the day and the Grand Trunk Pacifie, which entailed the question of the
National Transcontinental, the terms of
that agreement were also set out in the Act,
and Parliament and the country had the
opportunity of knowing what the actual
terms of the agreement were before Parliament agreed to the Bill becoming law. I
think it is a most important matter for the
country that thev should know exactly
what the terms of this agreement are, that
we should not be going into this matter with
our hands tied, or without having the information that I think this House is entitled
to; and I would propose to move an amendment to this clause, providing that this
agreement shall be sub;nitted to Parliament
for ratification before it is finally adopted.
I therefore move, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Dandurand, that this clause be amended to
carry out that principle.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It was stated in
the House of Commons by the Minister who
had charge of this Bill that the agreement
was being prepared, and that it possibly
might be prepared in time for enbmission to Parliament before prorogation. I
think my honourable friend owes it to the
House to state whether it bas been prepared, and, if so, whether it will be brought
down.
,Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say to the honourable gentleman that the
agreement hai not been prepared. It was
entered upon, but it was recognized that
the agreement could not be completed without the directorate of the Grand Trunk considering it, practically the same as the
Government of Canada. Let me illustrate
in this way. My honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholls) bas taken exception to this clause and suggests that the
agreement should be laid before Parliament. My honourable friend is president
of one of the largest industrial undertak-

SENATE
ings in Canada. If he were about to purchase anything for his company, he would
not dream of calling a meeting of its shareholders, and submitting the agreement to
them. He would call his directorate together, and deterine whether the agreement should or should not be carried
out. Likewise the other side would have
their directorate consider the agreement. To
say that an agreement containing all the
particulars that must necessarily enter into
a submission to arbitration must be submitted to Parliament is, it seems to me,
opposed to the intelligence of business men.
It is never donc. Furthermore, my honourale friends eau readily understand that
the agreement inust be within the four
corners of this statute. It cannot go bcyond it. If honourable gentlemen can conceive of our importing anything into the
agreement that would bc injurious te the
Interests of Canada, outside the authority
of this statute, then they are justified in
coming to the conclusion that we have not
any authority to do so. This is simply an
agreement to submit the whole matter to
arbitration, and must necessarily be taken
up by both parties to the agreement, and
I venture to say to-day that if this agreement were before Parliament, Parliament
would not look at it.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I may say in reply
to the honourable leader of the Government
in this House that the Cabinet or the Government, acting as the directors of the country, are negotiating with the officials of this
company, but the officials have no power
whatever to say that those terms shall be
I am in sympathy with the
accepted.
amendment, but I shall not vote for it, for
the reason that yesterday the principle of
the Bill was accepted by a majority of this
House, small though it was, and I think
other amendments may be made which will
safeguard the interests of the country to a
very considerable extent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to join
issue wiith my honourable friend, and I will
tell him my experience as a lawyer. I would
ask him if, in making an agreement with
me to subnit a very important matter to
arbitration, he would be willing to leave
it to me to draw the agreement, and consent that the agreement as drawn up by
me would be binding on him?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
not an analogous case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Absolutely.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
said that the Government of Canada will
prepare this agreement with the directorate
of the Grand Trunk, and between them they
will conclude the agreement. If my honourable friend were the president of a cornpany, and were dealing with me as the
president of another company, of course,
between the two of us, we would enter into
the agreement. We would not dream of
calling our shareholders together for the
purpose of discussing the details of the
agreement.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The directors of
the company and the Government have
agreed upon a certain form of agreement,
but the shareholders may refuse it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then we
do not go any further. That is an end of
the transaction.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Certainly. But
it seems to mie that it is a most extraordinary thing that the Parliament of Canada should be bound by an agreement
wbich is going to be drawn up between
the Government of Canada and this coinpany. The Government of Canada is responsible to Parliament. It is only acting
as a cominttee of Parliamient, and why
should Parliament delegate in advance its
powers, absolutely untrammelled, to the
Goverars ent of the day to draw up an agreement of that kind? The people of Canada
have the right to be asked to ratify or to refuse to ratify the agreement which the Government of Canada is going to make. I
think it is not only subversive to all rules of
common every-day routine business, but
subversive of the rights of the people. I
hope my honourable friend will insist upon
bis amendment, and that we shall divide
the committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I am the
seconder of the amendment, allow me to
nake the suggestion that the Bill, when it
is through committee, may be sufficiently
clear to ensure a direction to our Executive,
and a satisfactory one, and may be so clear
that we will not feel the need of having
the submission of the agreement. I would
suggest te. mîy honourable friend that we
suspend the motion till we are through discussing the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I feel some diffidence
in rising to discuss this question after
lis.tening to the honourable member from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholls). As we know,
he has had a great deal of experience and
is recognized throughout the Dominion as

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
one of its leading business men; but he
has certainly gone astray in this matter.
The honourable gentleman tells us this
agreement is like the agreemert with the
Canadian Pacifie railway. In what way?
The Canadian Pacifie Railway agreement
was entered Into by the Government
with the company for what purpose?
For the purpose of constructing a railway.
We bad no interest in the railway. They were going to start a new railway construction in Canada. Why are we
interested in this?
Because the Grand
Trunk Pacifie owes us $98,00O,000 and the
Transcontinental owes us $160,000,000. Thus
far we are interested, and are going to the
Grand Trunk execu.tive or directors, and
my honourable friend must know-if he
does not know it is because he does not
view the matter properly-that the directors
would not get together and come to this Government, and say, "This is what we will do."
He knows they could not commit the stockholders of that company by a vote of the
directors; but the directors 'vould come and
make an arrangement with us. We are not
arranging a contract to build the Transcontinental, or to build the Grand 'Trunk Pacifie. That has been done long ago. That
was the beginning of the trouble we have
to-day. We are going to make an agreement, the very best agreement we can possibly make, with regard to the transportation of the Dominion of Canada, for the
good of the people, and to save 'as much
as we can out of the wreck. That is the
situation we are in to-day. If we were
talking about building the Transecontinental,
or building the Grand Trunk Pacific, it
would be a different thing altogether. We
might say, "We will have them right before
us." In this case, all that we can possibly
have before us we have before us. In whom
are we trusting? We dre trusting the Government of this country, Sir Robert Borden,
and every man in it. I do not mean to
say you could not find a government the
equal of this Governnent if you searched
the whole world. I say we are putting our
trust in the character of men, and can we
not trust those 'men? Can we not trust men
like the Premier of this country, the
Finance Minister, the 'Minister of the 'Interior, and the Minister of Justice?
They
are trustworthy men, and I think we -can
intelligently paiss the measure and trust
them to take care off the interests of Canada.
They have been taking care of the intereste
of Canada for a long time, and I do not
think any man in this branch of Parliament,
or
any
man
in
Canada,

can
accuse
them
of
ever
having
forsaken the best interests of our country.
Is there a man in Canada who can stand
up and say that? Therefore I say it is
only a waste of time to compare this agreement with the agreement entered into for
the construction of the Canadian Pacifie
or the agreement for the construction of the
Grand Trunk Pacifie. When those other
agreements were entered into the propositions were new, and the whole proposition
could be placed before Parliament, because
there were no vested interests at all; the
whole matter was in its beginning. But
this is a very different thing, as I have
said, and we have our vested interests; we
have money invested in the Grand Trunk
Pacifie and in the Transcontinental. We
have gone into this, and now we are trying
to do the best we can-to save as much as
we can out of the wreck, with due regard
to the interests of transportation and the
best interests of the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Honourable gentlemen, 90 per cent of the business done in
this world is done by firm offer, either from
the seller to the buyer or from the buyer
to the seller. If a corporation or an individual or a government want ito phurchase
or to sell anything, they make up their
minds as to what they are willing to sell
it for, or what they are willing to pay for
it. Then they make the proposition to the
other party and the other party is always
at liberty to consult the directors, or, in
the case of a private affair, to ceonsult the
family; and if lie comes back and says, " I
accept," the party making the offer is bound
to carry it out. If lie does not, he is discredited and dishonoured, and in the case
of a business concern they are very soon
out of business.
Now, this Government want the Grand
Trunk railway. They have made an offer
for it, and this Bill is a guide to the arbitrators as to what they shall do. If we
fix a maximum of. $5,000,000, which we are
prepared to pay, and if the arbiitrators show
good cause why we should pay it, what
further interest have we in the matter?
What do we care what the Grand Trunk
directors or shareholders may say to each
other? We have absolutely no interest in
that, and it cannot affect the result one
particle, one way or another. To talk of
bringing it back and isubmitting it to
Parliament i% absolute nonsense.
The
companies that I am interested with do
business to the extent of many millions of
dollars every year. Practically all that
business
is
done
by
firm
offer.

it?" If as a business man I gave s.uch an
answer I should lose my position in a
week. and my company would lose its
standing as a business concern; it
would be discredited and dishonoured and
would very soon be out of business. I say
it is absolute childishness -and foolishness
to contend that this Government, after making an offer as to what they are willing to
do and what they are willing to pay, and
after that offer has been accepted, should
say, "We nust go back and think about it."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I have only a few
words to say. I would suggest to the honourable leader of the Opposition that his
motion would come in very much better
after we consider and settle upon the terms
of the agreement. Of course it is a fact that
under section 7 the shareholders of the
Grand Trunk will see the agreement and
have the right to vote yea or nay, as to
whether they will accept it or not; but that
Parliament and the people of Canada will
be bound by such an agreement as the
Government of the day may make. It may
be that after we have finished with the
whole Bill something along the lines of the
honourable gentleman's (Hon. Mr. Bostock's) suggestion might well be inserted in
the Bill, or there may be other amendments
that will meet that very objection, and I
think it will be well that whatever motions
and amendments are made should be all
taken together at the end, after we have
reviewed the whole Bill. I would suggest
to the honourable gentleman that be withdraw that amendment.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In that case, I
would ask the permission of the House to
withdraw the amendment for the time being,
and to take it up later.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Bostock was
withdrawn.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Shall clause
2 be adopted?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: It is not necessary to withdraw those Iast lines with reference to the guaranteed stock? From what
the honourable leader of the Government
said, that would seem to be included with
Hon. Ur. CURRY

the other stock, and here it is specifically
excepted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; because the Government does not take over
the capital stock, as I understand. The
holders of this guaranteed stock abstain
from voting, and they recéive certificates
of non-voting stock in lieu thereof. We do
not require that stock.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Any more than
you do the new.
Any
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
more than we do the debentures.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understood that
the four per cent guaranteed stock, as well
as the first, second, and third preference,
and the common stock, was to be arbitrated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I thought it might
very well be .arbitrated. The Bill provides for the ratification by a majority of
the shareholders. Clause 7 says:
As soon as said agreement has been ratifid
by a majority in voting power of the holders of
the stocks enumerated in the preamble to this
Act.

This provides for ratification on the part
of the bolders of the 4 per cent guaranteed
stock, the first, second, and third preference stock, and the common stock; they
will be voting as a whole, as the majority
will have to be the majority of all the
shareholders. I think this provision should
be amended so as to provide for a majority
of the 4 per cent guaranteed stock and a
majority of the other stock, and that all the
majority of the other stocks, and that all
the capital stock should be made subject to
arbitration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to my honourable friend that
while apparently under the proposed
amendment all the stocks would be included in the maxinum-and are, because
it includes the guaranteed stock; yet it
would be an anomaly to place the valuation upon the guaranteed stock, which has
priority to all the other stocks, and c,>nsequently there must be a valuation of the
other stocks separately from the guaranteed
stock; for this reason. There is a trust
deed by which the guaranteed stock ranks
immediately after the debenture stockby which it is really treated as a debenture
indebtedness, and it is not at all likely that
the holders of that stock enjoying a ranking privilege alinost on a parity with the
debentures, would permit the arbitrators
to couple that stock with the preference

NOVEMBEIR 7, 1919
stock. They must take into consicleration
the existence of that stock when they are
dealing with the preference issues. The
Bill simply provides that, having inoluded
ail those stocks, and having determined
what the valuation shall be, the Government may enter into an agreement with the
holders of the guaranteed stock as to, the
abandonment of their voting power upon
that stock and the acceptance of, say 4 per
cent certificates in lieu thereof.
This is
about the only explanation that I can make
regarding that. Of course, they will vote
on the stock until an agreement is entered
into with the Government whereby nonvoting certificates are handed over to them
in lieu of their stock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Do I clearly
understand the position which the Government takes? Clause 4 says:
As part of the consideration for such acquisition, the Government may agree le guarantee the
payment of :
(a) Dividends payable hait yearly, at tour
per cent per annum, upon the present. guaranteed stock;
Does that remain there?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes:

Hon. Mr. IYANDURAND:
I now understand the situation. The suggestion made
this morning, that the guaranteed stock
6hould be arbitrated, goes by the board.
The guaranteed stock is not to be arbi-

trated.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:

That is rigaht.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
By virtue of
the agreement under the Act, we shail pay 4
per cent upon the guaranteed stock. The
amendment bears upon clause 6, which
reads as follows:
The value, It any, of the first, second an.a
third preference stocks and the common or
ordinary stock of the Grand Trunk now !ssued
and outstanding to the face values above mentioned (hereinafter together calied the "preference and common stock") shaIl be determined
by a board of three arbitrators.
Then Sir Walter 'Cassels is named. This
is, the amendment which is now tabled:

383

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
-My explanation would be that the three preference
stocks and the common stock shall not be
given a larger dividend than $2,500,OOO by
the arbitrators.
-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
My
honourable friend (Hon. Mi. Lynch-Staunton) just points out that in the fourth lîne
of the amendment the word "capital"
should, be stricken ouit an~d the amend.ment
should read "the present guaranteed stock,"
the meaning being',that the $5,000,0O0 shal
include ail stocks-the guaranteed stock
as well. That is to say, the maximum
amount of that award shall not exceed
$5,OOO,OOO a year, including the interest
payable upon guaranteed stock.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Ahl stocks?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, al
stocks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So the variation made since this znorning is sim.ply
this, that the guaranteed stock remains
with its four per cent dividend, but that
the pref erence and the comimon stock, being
arbitrated and being valued by the arbitratoTs, will not .be able to get a greater
return thýan i$2,500,000?
Hon. Sir JAMES LjOUGHEED: Yes,
that is right.
Hon. Mr. 1XATDUR1AND: So the limitation is, upon the valuing of the pre.ferred
and the common, whilea the guaranteed
stock is not affected in the deast by the
amendment which is, proposed by the
honourable leader o! the 'Government.
Hon. Mr. BRIQUE: If the honourable
leader of the Government will allow me
to suggest this, I think we would progress
better to take up section 6 and determine
first o! all the question what shail be arbitrated, and then to, proceed to determine
what ýshall be the maximum which mnay
be awarded under the arbitration. I think
it wouhd be more logical, and we would
make better progress with the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
consideration of section 6, and that it be
amended to read as follows:
The value, if any, Bo determined shaIl not be

The value, if any, so determined shali not be
greater than an ambunt on which the annual
dividend at tour per cent per annum on the

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not rise to make

to suggest that we deal with the first part
of section 6 and that we decide that the
four per cent guaranteed stock will be made
subject to arbitration as well as the three
preference stocks and the common stock.
Of course, I am open to consider any reasonable objection which may be offered to that
being done; but, so far as I am advised
at the moment, I cannot see why that stock
should not be arbitrated upon.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend can move an amendment.
I have moved consideration of section 6,
and if my honourable friend has an amendment to move, let him move it. I do not
propose te move any such amendment.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some responsibility rests on my honourable friend, and
it is to give an explanation why Le Las
altered his course this afternoon. He may
have a good reason te offer, but why should
not the Senate know it, and why should
that guaranteed stock be not arbitrated
upon?
lon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
already explained that I took it up with
the Government, and we have concluded
that it is impracticable to throw this stock
into the sarne pot as the preference shares,
for the simple reason that this is a ranking
stock that is practically on the same parity
as the debenture stock. It ranks immediately thereafter; it has certain privileges;
it is subject to a trust deed, and cannot be
acquired except in this way. The holders
of that stock are not going to say to the
arbitrators: "We consent te your depreciating this stock fifty per cent, or whatever it may be." They say: "We are quite
content to hold on to our stock." The Government must necessarily make some arrangement with the holders of that guaranteed stock by which they will abandon
their holding rights. That guaranteed stock
carries with it voting rights, four votes per
hundred pounds, and it is therefore necessary that the Government should be empowered to deal with it. This Bill proposes
to give authority to the Government to
agree with the holders of that guaranteed
stock.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend indicate in a general way, or
in a specific way, what the guarantees or
pledges are in regard to this guaranteed
stock?
Hon. Sir

FAMES

LOUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that in the case of liquidation it ranks
immediately after the debenture stock. It
would rank first of all the assets, outside
the debenture stock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to
the fact that the holders of that stock have
received no dividends during the last few
years. Those shareholdera can only get
a dividend if it is earned. The advantage
of arbitrating upon that guaranteed stock,
which every Senator must sec, is that if
the arbitrators decide that only $2,000,000,
or $1,000,000, is the amount that should be
given to the shareholders, it goes without
saying that the award up to two and a half
million dollars will go to the guaranteed
stockholders who have a priority over the
preferred stockholders. But if we maintain the situation, and declare that they
will be entitled to 4 per cent, it also goes
without saying that the arbitrators will
have no leeway between the two and a half
million dollars, which is given to the guaranteed stockholders, and the $5,000,000
which is the maximum sum. There is no
question that we guarantee the guaranteed
a payment of
and guarantee
stock,
$2,500,000. and the only play which the
arbitrators will have will be between the
$2,500.000 and the $5,000,000, while this
morning they had full play over the whole
S5,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am sorry that the
honourable leader of the Government takes
my suggestion in such bad part. My suggestion was not by way of objection to his
amendinent; I intended it merely as a suggestion. I was going to explain why the
four per cent guaranteed stock should be
subject to arbitration. The honourable
gentleman Las stated that Le saw difficultics in the way, but Le Las not pointed out
what the difficulties are. I think we should
be allowed to discuss this without getting
excited, and without my honourable friend
taking my remarks in bad part. I quite
apprehend that the holders of the four per
cent guaranteed stock have a preference
over the preferred and common stock. I
do not suggest that tl'ey be deprived of
that preference; but I do suggest that if,
for instance, the arbitrators were to find
that the dividends that had been paid on
that four per cent guaranteed stock had
been paid out of capital for the last ten or
twelve years, and that the value of the
stock, instead of being par, is only forty
cents or fifty cents on the dollar, I do not

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
see why we should deprive the arbitrators of the power of so saying and of finding
the value so that the country will get that
stock at its true value. That is the only
suggestion I make, and I repeat that I
cannot see any diffieulty in the way of ac-.
cepting it. I would suggest also that the
agreement be submitted for the ratification of the majority of the holders of the four per cent guaranteed stock,
because
they have an
interest
different
from
the
other
stockholders. I suggest also that it be
made subject to ratification by a majority
of the other stockholders and that the
amount required to satisfy the holders of
the four per cent guaranteed stock be determined by the arbitrators. I would
amend the section, which is to be found in
this Bill, and which enables the Government by the Governor in Council to adopt
such means as may be necessary to compel
the delivery of the stock which will be subject to arbitration, and apply it to the four
per cent guaranteed stock, as well as to the
other stocks. I am open to hear any
reasonable objection to the course I suggest.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: I beg to
move as an amendment to the amendment:
The value, if any, so determined shall in any
event 'be limited to an amount on which the
annual dividend at four per cent per annum shall
not exceed $4,372,262, being the average dividend
paid by the Grand Trunk during the ten years
prior to 19'14.
Should, however, it appear to the satisfaction
of the arbitrators that the cash reserves of
subsidiary companies of the Grand Trunk as
claimed to exist during the said period were
actually available for dividends and were not
offset by unpaid liabilities in other subsidiary
companies, the limit above mentioned may by
the arbitrators be raised to not to exceed

*5,OO;OO-0.

Hon. 'Mr. BELGOURT: Before we take
that up, may I point out that my honourable friend from De Salaberry. (Hon. Mr.
Beique) suggests that the guaranteed stock,
as well as the other stocks, be arbitrated
separately. God knows I am not very
anxious that this agreement should go
through. Nobody would be better pleased
than I if the shareholders should not ratify
it. But the House has pronounced in
favour of the Bill, and we are here to see
that it is the best Bill that can be made.
What I suggest is this. My honourable
friend says that the holders of the four per
cent guaranteed stock have exclusive
guarantees and pledges in favour of their
stock. Assume that this Bill goes through;
when the agreement is before the share-

S-25

holders for ratification, and the shareholders of the first and second preferred
stock find that the guaranteed stock has
been aocepted at a value which warrants
the payment of a four per cent dividend;
when, in other words, they find that one
half of the limited sum, that is one half of

the $5,000,000, has been applied to redeem

the guaranteed stock, the first and second
preference shareholders will say: "That has
been done to our detriment; this guaranteed
stock is not worth one half of the $5,000,000,
and our stock, the first and second preferred and ordinary stock, amounts to more
than the remaining $2,500,000, and we are
not going to ratify this agreement because
we have not been fairly treated." I am
sorry that my honourable friend is not
paying any attention to what I am saying.
I haire the vanity to think that there is
something in it.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Go on; I
am following you quite closely.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does it not endanger the ratification by the shareholders
if you allow the four per cent guaranteed
stock to take one half of this sum of $5,000,000 which you propose they should get, leaving the holders of the first and second preferred stock and common stock the sum
of $2,500,000 which they must consider
value for their shares?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
transaction
must
necessarily
be
a
negotiable transaction.
We cannot and
do not propose to take those shareholders by the throat and say: "You
must do this."
The four per cent
guaranteed stockholders occupy an exceptional position, and they say: "We will not
consent to do this, that or the other thing
unlees you consent to do this." We can
negotiate with the others. The holders of
the three issues of preference stock are willing that the matter should be arbitrated;
but the 4 per cent shareholders are not willing to sacrifice their chance of getting the
face value of the shares.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So, if I understand the situation, there is nothing to hide,
and my honourable friend does not want to
hide anything. I am simply drawing the
conclusion that we have to make sacrifices
to the guaranteed stockholders, because
otherwise they will vote against this agreement, which will not carry.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
put this question to my honourable friend?
In what way does it affect the Government

of Canada if the 4 per cent shareholders get
more than the preference shareholders, so
long as the maximum award does not exceed
that $5,000,000? True, it may result in some
internecine strife between them, but that is
a matter that does not concern us.
We have
Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon.
nothing to say in the matter. If the arbitrators grant $2,500,000, it goes exclusively to
the guaranteed stockholders.
Hon. iSir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
event of the other shareholders refusing to
accept the remainder the Government may
be able to make a better arrangement than
that. There is nothing to prevent the Government from negotiating with the holders
of the 4 per cent guaranteed stock.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: There may be no
remainder. There may be nothing.
Suppose the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
arbitrators declare for $2,000,000, will my
honourable friend tell me that, under those
conditions, the preferred shareholders will
get one cent? The guaranteed stockholders
are ahead of them in priority and will gobble the $2,000,000. If it is $2,500,000 the
guaranteed stockholders, as of right, will
take the $2,000,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It may
be a stale mate, but we cannot help that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think it may help
in the discussion of this matter if I give
the figures in regard to the guaranteed
stock. In the London Times of the 9th and
lth
of October, this year, the quotation
was given as follows: The four per cent
guaranteed stock, 46; the five per cent preference stock, 50; the five per cent second
preference stock, 371; the four per cent
third preference stock, 20. These figures
work out in this way. The $60,833,332.51 of
the four per cent guaranteed stock, as given
in the blue-book on that day, were worth
$27,983,332.95. The $16,643,999.78 of five per
cent first preference stock were worth $8,321,999.89. The $12,312,666.50 of second preference stock were worth $4,617,249.93. The
$34,884,534.95 of four per cent third preferowere
worth $6,976,906.99. The
ence stock
$16.583,124.44 of common stock were worth
$10,492,481.20.
The whole of those stocks,
according to that quotation, were worth
$58,391,970.96. 'The par value of the four
per cent guaranteed s'tock is $60,833,332.51.
So if all those stocks had been bought that
diay, at those prices, there would be a saving
of $2,441,361.55, as against $60,833,332 that
we are going to pay interest on at four per
cent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Honourable gentlemen will sec from that
that on the London market at the present
time the values of those stocks are based on
the interest that is paid on them. The guaranteed stock, drawing 4 per cent interest,
is quoted at 46; the first preference stock,
drawing 5 per cent, is quoted at 50. As far
as I can see, no attention is paid to any
other value, as suggested by my honourable
friend. Of course, the guaranteed stockholders have their interest ahead of the
holders of the first, second, and third preference stock. Therefore under the Bill we are
in this position: we are going to put the
holders of the guaranteed stock in possession of a stock that is assured of its interest
from the Dominion of Canada; and in five
years' time, if they like, the Government can
buy it at par. Therefore the stock which
is quoted at 46, if the Government think fit,
can be bought five years from now at par.
According to that, we are making a very
valuable gift to the holders of the guaranteed stock, and if this arrangement is put
before thern in that way, no doubt they will
vote for it.
When we come to the question of the voting power we find, according to the bluebook, that the debenture stock carries 1,161,952 votes; 'the 4 per cent guaranteed stock,
400,000 votes; a total of 1,561,952 votes. Then,
if we take the first, second .and third preference and the ordinary stock, we find
So the

debenture stock and the guaranteed stock
together have the majority of the voting
power of the company. But, if you put the
guaranteed stock with the preference stock
and the ordinary stock together, the voting
power might be the other way, and the
agreement might be thrown out.
Hon. Mr. McJJENNAN: I cannot sec why
of
this is a concern of the Parliaiment
Canada. We undertake to .pay a certain
amount of money in the form of an annuity. How that ils divided a'mong the
different classes of shareholders having
votes, eight of which exist, is a matter entirely for the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and for the gentlemen representing
that company to arrange witlh their directors
and shareholders.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not quite agree
with that either. We are going to pay on
the valuation, which is not te exceed a sum
which we name. Now by saying that it is
to carry four per cent, yen are really throwing out the guaranteed stock from the consideration of the arbitrators. it was worth
45 or thereabouts before this legislation

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
was brought into Parliament. it strikes me
that the guaran'teed stockholders have
pretty nearly everybody by the throat. I
do not understand what the first sentence
of the amendment means, and I should
like some honourable gentleman to explain
it. It says:
The value, If any, so determined shall not be
greater than an amount on which the annual
dividend at four' per cent per annum on the
aggregate face value of the present guaranteed
stock and the new guaranteed stock, taken to.
gether, would exceed $5,000,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend permit me to say that for
the delivering up, for instance, of the
preference stock, or the common stock, as
the case may be, we issue guaranteed stock.
There will be two issues of guaranteed
stock, namely, the existing issue, the 4 per
cent guaranteed stock, and such guaranteed
stock as we would issue for the delivering
up of the outstanding stock.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I understand that
quite well, but that is not the point I am
making. The aggregate face value of the
present guaranteed stock and the new guaranteed stock, taken together, would exceed
$5,000,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
to say, that a dividend of 4 per cent on
the face value of that stock, including the
two issues of guaranteed stock, must not
exeed $5,000,000 per annum. At 4 per cent,
that would represent a face value of about
$125,000,000, or, on the basis of 5 per cent,
about $ 100,000,000.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It would be much
easier to understand if it were put the other
way: "Is not greater than an amount by
which the annual dividende of 4 per cent
per annum on these two stocks taken together would exeeed $5,000,000."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, that
would be to say that they were to fix it at
$5,000,000. It must not exceed $5,000,000.
If you fixed it at $5,000,000 they would say
that you had already fixed the award.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The capital is not to be greater than an amount
that would eat up. $5,000,000 at 4 per cent.
Hon. Mr. BELOOTJRT: Will my honourable friend permit me to suggest something? "The value, if any, so determined,
shall not be greater than an amount that
the 4 per cent of the total sum," and so
on. Would not that be better?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Anything would be
better.

Hon.. Mr. MoLENNÇAN: Would it not be
better to leave out everything between the
new and the old stock?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: L regret
that I cannot see eye to eye with the
honourable gentleman from Hamilton. It
seeme to me that the amendment which I
have moved fully covers the amendment
he has moved, and that it is very much
less complicated.
The difficulty would be
to import into it an amendment. A conplex situation would arise touching
subsidiary
companies
such
as that
embodied in his amendment. We cannot
foresee the many considerations which will
have to be taken up by the arbitrators,
and if we once proposed to import into it an
amendment of this kind, a situation such
as my honourable friend bas described would
arise. Our attention was directed to this
last night by my honourable friend the
Minister of Labour.
The Grand Trunk
desired that the maximum should be placed
at $5,600,000. They insisted upon that, and
they still insist, I may say. As evidence
of that, they introduced into this discussion the statement which was read by
my honourable friend the Minister of
Labour yesterday as to the earnings, the
profits, and the resources of these -particular companies, and they said: "That
represents the difference practically between
the dividends which were paid over a long
period of years on the four per cent guaranteed stock and on the preference shares,
and that makes up the difference, and that
is -the reason we want the maximum increased to $5,600,000."
Now, if we begin
to go into those many considerations, and
to estimate what this group of subsidiary
or affiliated companies represent, and then
leave out others, and tie up the arbitrators,
we may find ourselves very much embarrassed, and throwing a series of complications around the whole transaction that
will render it very undesirable. L prefer
that it should be left in this open way. We
expect the arbitrators to go into every
ramification of value, of liability, and of
asset, and everything else in connection
with this oompany, and we have not, up
to the present, tied the arbitrators down to
any fixed condition of procedure, and it is
undesirable that we should do so. I would
prefer that they should have the greatest
freedom in going fully over the whole of
the property, and not be tied down in any
hard and fast way in regard to what may
be the earnings of any particular company.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. POWER: I do not rise to continue tha discussion, but I wish to get a
little information from the minister. I am
not a financial man at all, but there is one
thing that I have not been able to understand. Possibly an explanation of it bas
been given to the House or the Committee.
If so, I have unfortunately not heard
it. I cannot understand why the exception
is made to the four per cent guaranteed
stock of the Grand Trunk, amounting to

is treated differently from the other stock.
Perhaps it may show great ignorance on
my part, but I do not see the reason. The
amendments that were laid upon the table
by the honourable Minister of Labour, at
the last meeting of the House, put this
four per cent guaranteed stock into the same
category as the other stock. Now it has
been amended by the honourable leader
of the House, and I want to know why this
£12,500,000 of guaranteed stock is treated
differently froi the other stock.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I can
only repeat what I have said. This is a
different issue of stock, and it bas ranking

the preference shares that the holders of
that stock refuse to have it arbitrated.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
reference to the amendment proposed by
the honourable gentleman froin Hamilton
and why I think it should not prevail. The
amotnt mentioncd in his amendment is
based upon the average result over about
ten years of operation. It should be kept
in mind, in fairness to the Grand Trunk
Railway Company, that the earnings of
that company ten years ago were about

found that to be the case in another arbitration we were concerned in. I would
prefer very much to leave the matter to
the arbitrators since this House has deemed
it advisable to send it to arbitration. That
is one of the reasons why I will not vote
for either of the two. The second reason
is perhaps an important one, and it is because I am paired.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: When that amendment was proposed first this afternoon I
was under the impression the guaranteed
stock was going to be arbitrated upon, and
I feel like the honourable gentleman from
New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. Fowler), that
this is an invitation to the arbitrators to
come up to that figure. We had an arbitration before, and a maximum amount was
fixed, as is suggested here, and the result
was that the arbitrators awarded the
amount naned. Consequently, so far as I
am concerned, having been once deceived
in this respect, I do not propose to vote
for any of these amendments.
I observe that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
there is a fear in the minds of some Senators concerning the placing of a maximum,
because it may tend to persuade the arbitrators to award that maximum; but we
must not forget that the arbitrators will
have before them an offer made by the Government of $3,600,000, and, as I have stated
before, the arbitrators will be justified in
awarding at least that amount which bas

man from Hamilton desires to guard against
the free hand that the arbitrators would
have in valuing that immense system and
applying some amount for the prospective
value of that stock, .and he increased the
offer of the Government of $3,600,000 to $4,300,000. I am disposed to vote for that
amendment. I am not disposed to vote

of the Government, which goes up to $5.000,000; yet the reason he has given for
going up to $5,000,000 is that it was contained in the explanation of the honourable
Minister of Labour, who was given by the
Grand Trunk Company a statement showing that there were reserves in the subsidiary companies that would perhaps justify the arbitrators in going up to $5,000,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; $5,600,000. We rejected the proposai or request of the Grand Trunk. The $600,000,
they claimed, represented the additional
earnings of the companies to which he referred. Suppose we divide the sum in two,
making $2,500,000. That amount would represent only the dividends or interest which
during a long period of years had been
paid upon the issues of preference stock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I stated that
the Government had offered $3,600,000 to
be paid over in eight years to the shareholders. Now my honourable friend s.ays
that the Grand Trunk last evening suggested that the maximum should be $5,600,000. I think it is just the amountHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Which
they originally asked.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Whieh they
originally asked as their minimum figure
from the Government, without arbitration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, plus
one per cent on the common stock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amount is
£1,663,000, which, I think, is equivalent to
about $5,600,000. Now, the Government has
said: " We will make it $5,000,000; we will
give a few hundred thousand more than
the member for Hamilton suggests, because
of the reason given by the Grand Trunk
itself, that there are assets which have not
*been oomputed, which have been earned,
and which show- that those companies can
earn in the future." They must not be
suriprised if the member for 'Hamilton comes
back to them and says: " If that is true,
I will consent to increase the amount to
$5,000,000, but it must be true." I do not
see why the honourable leader of the Government would not accept the test which
is contained in the sub-amendment of the
honourable gentleman from Hamilton.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does not
my honourable friend think it will be the
duty of the arbitrators to determine that?
The arbitrators must make an examination
int - that question.

a0u

That would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
never have occurred to me as a sufficient
reason for increasing the maximum from
$4,500,000 to $5,000,000, because, as I stated
at the outset of this debate thie afternoon,
the arbitrators will have a wide scope and
they may reach $5,000,000 or $6,000,000, if
they please, by considering the prospective
value of the stock or by estimating the
present value of the terminals of the Grand
Trunk in towns and cities. I would not
have given that as a reason for increasing
the amount to $5,000,000; but it bas been
given by the Government, and the honourable senator from Hamilton says: " Well,
if that is your reason for raising my maximum, then let us test that reason to see
whether it will prove to be true." That
may be a consideration for increasing the
maximum to $5,000,000.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I do not wish
to weary the House nor to bring down upon
myself the indignation of its leaderHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Do not
put it that way.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: But I do feel
that the matter which I brought up before, namely, that for the Parliament of
Canada to interfere in the division of the
money that is to be paid to the Grand
Trunk is a serious mistake.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Let them correct it.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I beg that the
Government will take into consideration the
question whether we ought tofix a certain
amount that we will pay, and let the Grand
Trunk attend to their own affairs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the amendments before us do not settle that question.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I may be wrong,
but, as I have said, the amendment of the
honourable leader of the Government, which
I shall be glad to support, so far as the
amendment goes, seemed to me ta indicate
that the four per cent preference, the £12,500,000, was to continue getting its whole
dividend as before. That means that the
people who bought it at the current market
price, or at the price prevailing, say, two
or three months ago, get eight or nine per
cent on their investment, and that the
people owning other debenture stock will
get much less. That, iA seems to me, is
a matter for the Grand Trunk shareholders
to settle among themselves. To me it does
not look well for the Parliament of Canada
to single out one of the eight or nine different kinds of stock of the Grand Trunk

railway and to say that it shall get what
is, according to British standards, an exorbitant return, to the advantage of the people
who bought it within the last year, and
that the other people shall get less than
half. I would earnestly ask the Government to take that into consideration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We cannot avoid it, though.
Hon Mr. ROSS: As a matter of fact,
you could ,avoid it.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: You could avoid
it.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: By putting the present guaranteed stock into the arbitration
with the preferred and common, giving them
a round sum, and letting the English company call a meeting of the shareholders and
divide that among themselves.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Instead of allowing
them to do that, we are joining hands with
the present guaranteed stockholders and
enabling them to choke off everybody else
in the company while they get good value
for their own stock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I apologize for rising for the
third time; but I feel that if these amendments, that moved by the honourable leader
of the Government and the sub-amendment
of the honourable senator from Hamilton,
are ipassed, we close the door to the possibility of testing the Senate regarding its
desire to have the guaranteed stock valued.
We should know what we are doing.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: After we have disposed of the present amendment and subamendment, I propose to move another
amendment to clause 6, to bring before the
arbitrators the four per cent guaranteed
stock as well as the others.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend thinks that we are not prejudging the question of submitting to the arbitrators for valuation the guaranteed stock,
then I do not insist; but I supposed that,
taking clause 6 as it is and adding the
amendment, we were accepting, at all events
by inference, the principle of guaranteeing
absolutely the guaranteed stock and arbitrating only the preference and the common
stock.
'Hon. MT. BELOOURT: I am inclined to

ourable friend's (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton's) attention to something which is
rather vague, rather ambiguous, to my undierstanding. He says:

iShould, however, it appear to the satisfaction
of the arbitrators that the cash reserves of
subsidiary companies of the Grand Trunk as
claimed to exist were actually available for
dividends.
What

troubles me

is that there is no

point of time fixed. I think my honourable
friend should fix a time when this state of
affairs was supposed to exist. Apart from
that, I am disposed to vote for the suba mendment.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It shouid
read, "during the said period."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What is the
amendment.?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I will read it.
The value, if any, so determined shall in any
event be limited to an amount on which the
annual dividend at four per cent per annum
shall not exceed $4,372,262, being the average
dividend paid by the Grand Trunk during tho
ten years prior to 1914.
,Should, however, It appear to the satisfaction
of the arbitrators that the cash reserves of
subsidiary companies of the Grand Trunk ts
claimed to exist during the said period were
actually available for dividends and were not
offset by unpaid liabilities In other subsidiary
companles, the limit above mentioned may by
the arbitrators be raised to $5,000,000.

The amendment of Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton was negatived.
The amendment of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: J move that clause
6 be further amend'ed so as to read as follows:
The value, if any, of (1) the four per cent
guaranteed stock and (2)
the first, second
and third preference stocks and the common or
ordinary stock of the Grand Trunk now issued
and outstanding to the face values above mentioned (hereinafter together called the "preference and common stock") shall be determined
separately by a board of three arbitrators, one
to be appointed by the Government, one by the
Grand Trunk, and the third shall be Sir Walter
Cassels, Judge of the Exchequer Court of
Canada. Should 'Sir Walter Cassels die or be
unable to act, the sald parties shall agree upon
another third arbitrator who shall be either
the then Judge of the Exchequer Court of
Canada or one of the judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada. New guaranteed stock, to

an amount not exceeding the value, if any,

so determined, carrying a dividend as hereinbefore authorized, shall be distributed among
the holders of the four per cent guaranteed
stock to the extent or value thereof, determined
as above, upon the transfer to or vesting in the
Government of such guaranteed stock, and to
the extent or value thereof, determined os

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
above, among the holders of the preference and
common stock, upon the transfer to or vesting
in the Government of such stock in proportions
which shaH be determined by the arbitrators.

You will see that the arbitrators would
be called upon to value separately the four
per cent guaranteed stock, and, separately
the first, second, and third preference and
the common stock of the company. Then
the value, as determined by the arbitrators, would be paid over by the Government
to the holders of the four per cent guaranteed stock, and the value of the other
stocks, as determined by the arbitrators,
would be distributed in the proportions
determined by the arbitrators. The arbitrators, would not be called upon to disturb
the rights of the holders of the four per
cent guaranteed stock. They would continue to distribute the amounts of the
other stocks as provided for in section 6.
Apart from the fact to which I have called
attention, this stock might be worth only
forty cents or fifty cents on the dollar, as
determined by the arbitrators, and it would
not be fair to have the country pay one
hundred cents on the dollar for a security
worth only forty cents or fifty cents. I
would call the attention of the Government to the fact that there is a suspicion
in the public mind-I do not say that the
suspicion is well founded, but there is a
strong suspicion in the public mind that
this Bill is oipening the door to the making
of 325,000,000 or more by the holders of
that stock to the detriment of the Dominion
of Canada. I want to close the door to that,
and I think the Government should be
anxious to find a means of removing suspicion of that kind. The figures which the
honourable leader of the Opposition has
placed before the House show clearly that
the holders of those stocks will be paid
much more than the value of their stocks.
The market value is a good criterion of the
value of stocks. The holders have likely
bought that stock at the market price, but,
at any rate, we give them the advantage of
the greater value. In order to enable the
Government to better deal with them, add,
if you li4ke, a provision that the amount to
be determined by the arbitrators shall not
be less than fifty cents on the dollar. They
might even fix it at ten cents or fifteen
cents more than the market price of the
stock at the date when the Bill was introduced. I would not object to a clause
of that kind, because I want to give the
Government the means of dealing with the
holders of that stock on a fair basis; but I
do not want to subject the country to pay-

391

ing $20,000,000, $25,000,000 or $26,000,000 for
the benefit of a few holders of those securities.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We can perhaps
call it six o'clock.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We had
better deal with this when it is fresh in
our minds.
I understood
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
before we adjourned at one o'clock that
the guaranteed stockholders would have
their security tested by the arbitrators, and
there was a certain satisfaction amoug
honourable gentlemen, which would have
permeated the whole public opinion of
Canada, in putting that stock in the melting
pot with the preferred stock and the
common stock to see how it would work
out. The stock was worth 45 or 46 a month
ago, but speculators have jumped in and
have been buying it, with the result that
it has gone up to 70 or 75. I do not
know at what point it is just now, but
it will be a standing grievance of the electorate of Canada against this legislation
if, through our action, speculators are able
to run away with large sums of money. If
the Government think that these speculators are drawing unduly on our treasury
when it is at the lowest ebb, something
should be done. I know that the leader
of the Government would be most happy to
find a way by which the value of that
stock would be tested. It was with the
appearance of the greatest happiness that
he informed us this morning that the guaranteed stock would be arbitrated. This
afternoon he sees one objection in the fact
that the voting power of that guaranteed
stocK may be so entrenched that it wiih
defeat this scheme when it comes before
the special meeting of the shareholders of
the Grand Trunk in London, if they do not
gain their pound of flesh. I suggested a
moment ago that we should call it six
o'clock, because, if the amendment of the
honourable member from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) can eatisfy my honourable friend that the objection which was
in his way at three o'clock tas been removed, I know he will be most happy to
return to the frame of mind which he was
in at one o'clock, and throw the guaranteed
stock into the hands of the arbitrators in
order to ascertain its value. If the arbitrators come to the conclusion that it is not
worth $5,000,000, that, taking into consideration the liabilities of the Grand Trunk
in regard to the Grand Trunk Pacific, it
is worth only $1,000,000, their hands willl

be tied, and they must give $2,500,000 because we have so fixed the price of the
guaranteed stock.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As to
the ordinary stock, there are 479,108 votes.
It is not taken away until after ratification.

The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Béique waýs negatived.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do I understand
the preference stock and the ordinary
stocks, when they get into the hands of
the Government, are going to be kept?

Section 6, as amended, was agreed to.
At 6

o'clock

the committee took recess.

The Committee resumed at 8 o'clock.
Sections 3 and 4 were agreed to
Section 5 was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Does that refer tO
alil the stock in the latter part of a?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
for the purpose of retaining the property
during arbitration, whether it is a year or
a year and a half.
Sub-clause a was agreed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
have not equal voting powers. You will find
on the last page of this blue-book, page
57, the voting power of each of the stocks.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: My recollection is
that I found it very confusing. When the
Government is providing for the majority
of this stock, how is it done?
We get

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Is the voting of the
common stock equal, share for share, to the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it
is one in £100 for the common stock, and
the guaranteed stock is four in £100. We
take away the voting power of the
guaranteed stock.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: For the purpose of
ratifying we do not take the power away.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is the Committee

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is a
mutual arrangement between the two parties
pending the arbitration and the conclusion
of the purchase, for the operation and administration of the road.
Sub-clause b was agreed to.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8-agreement to provide for
arbitrators, oaths, evidence and award:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would like
to ask the leader of the Government how
it is intended that the Grand Trunk corporation shall be maintained as an entity
and administered by the Board of Directors9 Will the Board be appointed by the
shareholders called at a general annual
meeting, or will it be merged into the
National Railways organization,
which
will work under the Board of Management
appointed by the Governor in Council?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The legislation of last session provides for that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
So that the
administration of that railway system, as
well as the other railways which we own,
will apparently be in the hands of a company, but of a very flimsy and transparent
character, the company being the representative of the Government of Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
stock could be vested in that company, or
authority eould be given to the company,
entirely irrespective of the stock, under
Order in Council, though it is a matter
of domestic arrangement as to how it should
be done. Of course, necessarily, the company must be appointed by the Government in the first place, and then the

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
management of the road could be directed
by Order in Council. I should think instructions would be given them by Order
in Council simply to organize and operate
the road.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I had a note of the
railway legislation of last session, just to
see how this works out. The Canadian
National Railways would be operated by
a Board of not less than five nor more
than fifteen, appointed by the -Governor in
Council, but it has no stock at all. There
is a provision in the Act that the
Government may issue stock if it chooses
to do so; but at the present time they
have no stock at all. When, the Grand
Trunk is taken over by Order in Council it will be operated by the Board of
the Canadian National railways-not less
than five nor more than fifteen. So far
as I can see, the thing will be exactly
the same as if they had, said the railway
shall be operated under the Minister of Railwaye; that is to say, it will be a branch of
the Dominion Government, nothing more
ner lese, and the fiction of there being a
company is just as thin as the fiction of
there being a corporation, when you say the
Minister of Militia shall look after certain
things, or the Minister of Railways or certain others shall do certain things. As a
matter of fact, it is the Crown as represented by the Government of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I put the question, honourable gentlemen, because, in
reality, our system of railways will be administered by a commission of management
appointed by. Order in Council, or by a
board of directors-we may give it any kind
of name and call it a company. It is but a
fiction, and, realizing that it is but a fiction,
and that -the Government of Canada will be
administering a road that is owned by the
people of Canada, I ask myself the question,
how shall we be able to deal with the public
differently from what we would .if we were
administering a Government-owned railway?
In reality, how shall we be able to differentiate between the administration of the Intercolonial railway and that of the Grand
Trunk system, when it comes to the questi'on of paying taxes to the towns, cities and
municipalities through which the railway
passes? That is a point on which I would
like to have the opinion of the leader of the
Government, because I cannot see how the
Intercolonial railway will be freed from
municipal taxation, while the -Grand Trunk
will have to pay the municipal taxes along
its road. IR
cannot see how we can make

393

that difference when in reality those two
roads will be in the same position towards
the Government.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am informed that the legislation which has been
passed in no way changes the character of
the properties so far as taxation is concerned. The property remains represented
by that stock, just the same as if the transaction had not been completed. If the property is taxable to-day it will continue to
be taxable.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the stock
is all in the treasury of the Government of
Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
physical property is not. They could not
tax the stock because it is owned by the
Crown, but the title of the physical property
is just the same as it was before.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It was stated over and
over again in the House of Commons-and
I agree with the statement made by a minister of the Orown there-that the Government of Canada wouldi acquire the -Grand
Trunk by the purchase of its stock. There
is no getting away from that; and they may
so acquire this stock that, no matter where
they put it, whether in their vault or anywhere else, they may start in and manage
it under the Canadian National Railway
system. It is Government property.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Act is called
"an Act respecting the Acquisition by His
Majesty of the Grand Trunk Railway System."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Suppose
the Government wanted to sel the property, it would not make the title by a grant,
but it would simply transfer the stock, and
that stock continues to be Grand Trunk
stock.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Net at all. It could
sell it direct. The Crown could make the
grant and convey it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think that it would
be but proper to have some information
from the Government as to the present condition of these different things mentioned
here: the Grand Trunk Railway Company
of Canada Superannuation and Provident
Fund Association, the Grand Trunk -Pension Fund, and the Grand Trunk Railway
Insurance and Provident Society. What are
the conditions of those things?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say the intention is to carry on thos in-

SENATE

394

stitutions which have been establised onti.i the transaction is completed, and thon
the National railway nachinery will be exextended to cover all the railways owned
by the Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 think it is important that we should know just whether
this Government is acquiring or is not
acquiring the guaranteed stock and this
new stock to be issued. I take it that, under this Bill, the Governmnent may, at any
time after five years from the date of the
appointment of the said committee of managenient, on six months' notice, by advertisement, acquire or redeem this stock.
As bas been pointed out, the Bill is called
a Bill for the acquisition of this stock.
It is a Bill for the acquisition, not
now, but only after five years; so 'that
in the meantime, during the five years, this
stock is not going to be government property. This stock is going to remain in the
The present
hands of the shareholders.
holders of the guaranteed stock are going
to continue to be holders, and the holders of
the first, second, and third preferred and
comnion stock are going to have certificates
issued to thein, and this is going to be
guaranteed stock. The Government simply
pays a certain amount yearly as a dividend on the whole of this stock, so that I
for one think the Bill has been given an
iniproper name. This is not an acquisition
now. It can only be an acquisition after
five years. I am pointing out that while
honourable gentlemen have spoken for government ownership and government operation, and while my honourable friend
devoted a great deal of his time to endeavouring to convince the House that we had
been committed to this idea of public
ownership for practically all time past, t'his
is not government ownership in the way
that government ownership has been understood, or at all events has been practised anywbere else. This is an entirely new
thing. It is not government ownership, but
it is state operation of privately-owned
property for five years anyway. The whole
thing is called by a name that is should not
be called by. It is a very marked departure
from anything that has ever been practised
anywhere in the world.
Hon. Mr. POPE: No, not in the world.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know
of any instance like it. -My honourable
friend will find that he is wrong. We have
seen in some places government ownership
and government operation.
Hon. Mr. POPE: And the opposite.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have never seen
anywhere any case of government operation of private property. I do not know
that any nation in the world has dared to
attempt such a thing.
Hon. Mr. POPE: The honourable gentleman is absolutely wrong, and I want him
to be right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is important
that we should know that fact.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
said time and again to my honourable
friend that the stockholders abandoned the
voting power of their stock and were given,
not a guarantee but simply a certificate,
or practically a note of the Dominion Government to pay at a certain time in con-

sideration of the stock.

The stock is trans-

ferred to the Government.
The voting
power of this particular, stock is vested in

the Government, and it seems to me to be
quite manifest that the shareholders divest
themselves of all right of dominion over the
road. There is no -question about that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not speaking of the road; I am speaking of their
stock.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
hand their stock over to the Government
in exehange for non-voting certificates.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite so; but they
are still owners of the stock.
Hon. ,Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, they are, and
you cannot purchase it for five years.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
five years in which to do it.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: No; it says
"after five years." My honourable friend
ought to read that section over again:
5. The present guaranteed stock and the new
guaranteed stock, or any ,part thereof, may be
called in or redeemed by the Government, at
par, at any tirne after five yearsHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it the intention of the Government to, maintain as
separate entities all those subsidiary companies whose stock is held by the Grand
Trunk, and to appoint directors to those
boards, or will it endeavour to merge those
various companies into the whole?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There are
different agreements between the Grand
Trunk and those companies. It depends
entirely upon the nature of the agreements.
That is to say, where the Grand Trunk has

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
full authority, that authority would vest in
the Government and be transfexred. from the
Government to the National Railway Company. Some of thoise companies retain their
directorates and simply give us runiàng
rights, as I understand. 0f course, those
directorates 'wouldl continue to acmhnister
the companies as heretofore.
It depelids
entirely upon the agreements existing at
the present time between the Grand Trunk
and the companies.
Hon. Mr. DAINDURANTD: 0f course, in
the case of inany of those companies the
Grand Trunk appoints the Board of Directors. Is it the intention of the Government
to appoint those Boards directly, or to have
them appointed by the Board of Management which is to administer the National
railýwaysP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would be a matter of policy to be hereafler determined. No policy has been promulgated or determined upon with regard
te that. It depends upon the local conditions. I can very readily imagine conditionis existing, particularly in the United
States, in which. it might be desýirable that
the old directorate should continue, even
a8suining that we had the right to appoint
directors. Many considerations must enter
into the decision as to what step shall be
taken.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: What 1 wanted te
inquire from my honourable friend <Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) was, 'why it is that
the Government have deferred the redemplion of this stock for five years. Why is it
that the Government do not, acquire this
stock no-w? Why must they wait for five
years? I would like to have an answer.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Just wait a moment,
honourable gentlemen.
The honourable
me'mber for O'ttawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
has called into question the accuracy of
the statement I made when 1 interrupted
him, and my knowledge with regard to this
malter. Evidently the honourable gentleman is speaking superficially, as inany of
you honourable gentlemen opposite do. In
Hungary, in 1906, the total mileage owned
and operated by the state was 10,000 miles
and the miileage privately owned and operated was 2,000 miles. The cost was $64,842
per mile.
Somae of these railways were
owned by private corporations and operated by the government.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
say further tu my honourable fri;end (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) that the flve-year clause is
not inconsistent with what it is intended
to do, namely, te take away the voting
power of that stock.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understand that.
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
ineantirne, the holders will iprobably continue te hold that stock untîl money hecomes cheaper.
Hon. Mr. BEL COURT: (I quite understand that; but what I would like te know
is what determined the policy of the Government in putting off until the expiration
of five years the redemption of this stock.
Why is this stock not acquired now?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE'ED: That has
been determined largely by the rate of interest at which. roney is obtain-able to-day.
Money is not obtainable at less than five
and a hall ýper cent. It is to be hoped that
in five yeais it will be very much, less. In
fact, it was proposed originally that the
teýrm should be very much longer than five
years.
Hon. Mr BELOOURT: Thirty years,
Hon. Mr. BEIQUEý: Honourable gentlemen, a question of imxportance has been
raised, whether this property -shall be hiable
te taxation or not, and I must say that for
my part, while I do not want to express a
positive opinion, I amn not inclin-ed te the
view that has been expressed by same
honourable gentlemen.
As (I understand
the situation, it is this. The Grand Trunk
Railway under the statute is a-corporate
entity. It is represented by stock iseued
in the company, but that is .inerely accidental. A corporation may be represented
by stock, as commercial corporations are,
but a number of corporations exist that
are not se represent-ed. It seems te me
that the present position of the property, as regards taxation,- is not changed
becauise of the powers taken over by
the Government under this Bill. There
will stili be stock in the Grand Trunk Gùmpany. iTrue, alter the five per cent guaranteed stock bas been -acquired there wihl remain only the stock which will be issued
by virtue of this Bill and which will carry
no voting power, but there will again be
stock in the company; so it will continue

SENATE

in existence as a corporate entity. Therefore, it seems to me, the property does net
necessarily become government property.
Section S was agreed to.
Section 9 was agreed to.
On section 10-Orders in Council authorized to vest in Government any preference
or common stocks not transferred, or to
vacate office of director:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would like to ask
the honourable leader of the Government
why it is that in section 10 the guaranteed
stock is not transferred?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Because
it is dealt with differently. We are not
acquiring that.
Section 10 was agreed to.
Section Il was agreed to.
Hoin. Mr. BEIQUE: I hope the honourable leader of the Government will accept
this amendment which I propose.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is that the
amendment my honourable friend put in
this norning?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes. I move that this
clause be added to the Bill:
For the purpose of the valuation provided in
this Act, the obligations of the Grand Trunk as

guarantors of any title of indebtedness of the

Grand Trunk Pacifie Company or of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie branch Unes or otherwise and the
claims of the Government of the Dominion of
Canada against either of the above-mentioned
companies or against any company forming part
of the Grand Trunk Railway system shall not
be treated as extinguished or affected by anything contained in this Act.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend leave out the words
"title of" in the phrase, "of any title of
indebtedness,'' which is not clear?
Hon. Mr.'BEIQUE: Yes, I will strike out
those words.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Béique, so amended, was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported as amended.
THIRD READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
third reading of the Bill.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: It is important that before this Bill is read the third
time we should place on record an expression of our feeling and opinion on this
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE

whole question and the position in which
the House finds itself at present. This Bill,
brought up at the end of the session, has
been put through very hastily. We bave
given to it as much time and consideration
as we could, but have not been able to obtain from the Government all the information which we think we ought to have been
given in regard to it.
The proposed taking over and operation
by the Government of the lines in the Uniked States is, I consider, a very serious
undertaking for the Dominion of Canada.
The time devoted to the discussion of this
measure, in either the other House or this
Chainber, bas really been inadequate to

and

Grand Trunk stock will place upon this
country a liability the magnitude of which
we do not quite grasp at present. We have
tried to show the extent of the obligationa
assumed. The Government and the country become responsible for the liabilities
of the Grand Trunk Railway system, the

Grand Trunk Pacifie, and the affiliated
roads in the United States. As f pointed

out the other day, we have not had definite

information as to the liabilities of those
roads in the UnUed States. We do not
know to what extent we are rendering this
country lable for expenses in conneci.on
with them. They are under the legislative
authority of the several states and the Federal Government, and we have had neither
time nor opportunity to situdy th- laiws and
regulations in force in the United States
respecting the operation of railways, or to
ascertain what expenditures in connection
with those roads may have to be borne by
the Grand Trunk system, wbich we are
taking over, and therefore by the Dominion
of Canada. As honourable gentlemen are
well aware, there is in progress thrcugh-

out the whole Ainerican continent a movement for doing away with level crossings
on railways. Canada has enacted legisiatien on this same subject and we are of
course in a position to understand to some
extent the great expense which railway
companies will have to incur if they are
compelled to do away with level crossings
and construct eubways. Any honourable
gentleman who bas bad experience in railway matters knows well that a large
amount of money is required for such
works. It may be necessary for us to spend
enormous sums of money for the purnose
of making such improvements on the line.

NOVEMBER 7, 1919
in the United States, but on this point we
have very little information.
Then there is a question that has been
but little discussed during the passage of
the Bill through this House, and I do not
think it. was much discussed in the other
Chamber: that is the managemen't and
operation of the railways when the Grand
Trunk comes into the Government's possession. When the Government take oveT
the Grand Trunk they will be confronted
with the very serious problem of operating
20,000 miles of railway. A business may
look to be very prosperous and the price
paid for it may be considered reasonable,
but, as any honourable gentleman accustomed to business affairs is aware, unless
that business is managed by a thoroughly
competent, experienced man, it may become a great failure instead of a success,
and may result in a great loss to the owner
instead of bringing him proper returns.
The same is true of this whole railway undertaking.
We have not had any information from
the Government as to how they expect to
be able to run this system once they get it
into their hands. My honourable friend
said that this committee of management,
which is to be appointed under the Bill,
will look after the operation of the railway
for the time being. But I appeal to any
honourable gentleman in this Chamber, and
ask whether that is a satisfactory way of
handling a large railway business of this
nature, when that committee know that
they are going to be dispossessed as soon
as this transaction is completed and the
stock is brought into the hands of the Government. As I understand it, that committee of management is simply for the purpose of carrying on the operation of the
Grand Trunk Railway for a certain time,
so that a working arrangement can be
made between then and the other government railways. If the Government Railway
system is to be a success, and is. to be made
profitable to the Govenment, the mistakes
that are now being made will have to be
avoided and the system will have to be put
in better condition than it is in to-day.
We must appoint a Board of Management
which will have the confidence not only of
the Government, but of the country, so
that the people will feel that the operation of these roads is being carried on to
the very best advantage.
During this debate a great deal has been
said about the question of government
ownersh.ip. I think that every honourable
gentleman in this 'Chamber, whether he is

391

in favour of government ownership or is
opposed to it, now that this Bill is going
through and is going to become law, is
anxious that the operation of these roads
should be carried on so as to be of the
greatest' possible benefit to the country. I
do not think that we have had from the
Government sufficient information to enable us to know how this is to be attained;
but I think it is a matter of great importance to the people of the country that the
management of this enormous railway system should be such as to inspire their confidence. From one end of the system to the
other we have got to have men who will
realize that it is their duty and their business to make the whole system a success.
It would be a terrible thing for this country,
especially in its present financial condition,
if the large deficits of this railway should
continue. I want to urge upon the Goverflment, in the strongest possible way, that as
soon as possible they should see that the
whole government system of railways' is
placed in such a position that its operation will be maintained at the very highest
point of efficiency.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, there is one feature of the situation confronting us which I did not dwell
upon in the remarks which I had the
privilege of making to this Chamber when
we were considering this Bill upon the
motion for the second reading.
I take this opportunity of drawing the attention of honourable gentlemen to the
advantage we possess in having Hansard,
where in years to come we may see what
position we individually occupied on certain
questions; but that will not relieve honourable gentlemen of the responsibility of
voting for the third reading of this Bill. I
want to remind this Chamber that we are
about to adopt a measure by which we
assume the administration of an immense
railway system, one of the largest in the
country, covering the whole of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, with all the
risks that such an administration entails.
In doing that, we should realize tbat the
Government of the day, when it faced the
electorate in the last election, sought no
mandate from the people to go into this
venture.
I was not present at the caucuses held by
the so-called Unionist party, but from reports in the press, and perhaps from echoes
in another Chamber, I know that many important questions that were deemed to be

IMMIGRATION TO CANADA.
INQUIRY.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN inquired:.
1. Is the Government aware of the arrivai in
Canada of the undermentioned steamers each
carrylng a large number of steerage passengers:
October 24, 1919, Grampian, number of
steerage passengers, 70,8.
October 24, 1919, Metagama, number of
steerage passengers, 962.
October 24, 1919, Melita, number of steerage
passengers, 1,211.
October 2,8, 1919, Megantic, number of
steerage passengers, 978.
October 28, 1919, Empress of France, nurnber of steerage passengers, 939.
2. 110w many of these steerage pnssengers
are new Immigrants?
3. In it the policy of the Governient to encourage immigration to Canada at present?
4. la the Government willng to check immigration like the United States of America until
Industrial conditions becomenormal?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
1. The Governiment is aware that

the

steamships mentioned arrived on or about
the dates îndiçated, but the manifests have
not yet srrived at head office, and it is
impossible to say how many third-class or
steerage passengers were on each ship.
2. See answer to No. 1.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: This Bill has been made necessary chiefly through giving legislative effect
to the Orders in Council passed under the
War Measures Act. As honourable gentlemen know, the work carried on by this
department is largely of an emergent or
temporary character.
Gonsequently the

authority under which it has been acting
is largely that of Orders in Council. Certain recommendations have been made inx
the report of the committee of the Commons
touching the re-establishment of returned
soldiers, and that report has heen. adopted
in the Commons. I do flot purpose moving
the final reading, nor even for the committee stage at present, as -certain amendments
will bave te ho made which it was suggested in the House of Commons might be
made in the Senate. The clauses deal chief-

ly with the making of regulations touching
hospital workshops and other institutions

under the department, the appointment of
technical and temporary special staffs, the

making of artificial limbs and appliances,
and,80 forth.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does this Bill ex-

tend the power ta deal by Order in Council?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: ýSimply as
te regulations.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is ail?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

POSTMASTERS' SALARIES BILL.

A message was received from the House

to the salaries of certain Postmasters and
Assistant Postmasters.-Hon. Mr. Blondin.
The Bill was read the first time.

FIRST READING.

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 38, an Act to amend
The Immigration Act.-Hon. Sir James
Lougheed.
The Bill wàs read the first time.
ýSECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill is a very short one. It provides for
free transportation for immigration officers.
It amends chapter 27 as follows:
Transportation companies shall furnish to immigration officers such free transportation as
may be required in connection with their official
duties, as directed by the minister.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Has not the Government power to arrange this now? What
is the reason or necessity for this legislation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I fancy
it is for the purpose of giving the authority
which is embodied in the section. Apparently the Government has not the necessary
authority at the present time.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is it due to the
provision that was inserted in the Railway
Act last session?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I really
cannot tell my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: That is the reason
which was given in the other House-that
by the Railway Act all passes were suppressed. The transportation of these officers from one post to another costs the Government quite a large sum; so the Government has decided to authorize the railways
to grant passes to those officers.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY:
for employees, is it not?

That is only

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; it
is for the officials of the Immigration Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BOYER: I will have to join the
Government.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is for
those persons while acting officially.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Bradbury in the Chair.
On section 1-free transportation of immigration officers:
Who has the
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
authorizing of this transportation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The minister.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The authority must
all come from him?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, directed by him:
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I think the wording
of that clause is rather loose: " In connection with their duties." They might take
their families with them. Would not " in
pursuance of their duties " be better?
Hon. Mr. DANDU'RAND: There is nothing in this clause which will protect the
public against considerable abuses occurring through the exercise of this power. In
past legislation we have tried to minimize
the granting of passes. Now we are entering
upon the government ownership of railways,
and we should be very careful not to pass
any kind of Act which would permit of the
carrying of passengers to the detriment of
the treasury. Of course, it will be said in
this case that the situation is as broad as it
is long, inasmuch as the Government would
have to pay the transportation expenses of
its immigration officers anyway. I hope that
in .the administration of this legislation
there will be no false pretext, but that it
will be strictly limited to immigration officers engaged in publie duties.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is so
expressed.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: What about custom
house officials? We meet them on the trains
coming from New York when we arrive at
the Canadian boundary. Do they pay their
fare, or do they travel free?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:· The officers to whom my honourable friend refers
would presumably be the immigration officers, who travel up and down on the trains,

401

NOV-,EBER 8, 191P
particularly those crossing the line. Many
of those officiais are on the American side
for tid' purpose of putting questions, to persons entering ýCanadian territory. Those
officers are on the trains at ail times, and I
suppose that makes it desirable that this
provision shouid be embodied in the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not disposed to move an amend-ment to this Bill,
but I would commend ýto, my lionourabie
friend the advisability of considering the
introduction o! a very simple enactmnent to
provide tliat the minister and also the managemient of the Canadian National railways
should early in each session place on the
tables o! both bouses a list of ail persona
to wiom. passes have been granted during
tlie year. If that were done we would have
a very interesting and very effective clieck
upon requests made during the year for free
transportation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEP: (l would
point out to my honourable friend that the
legislation 'whicli the Government put
tlirougli last session will probably resuit in
an increase of several millions in revenue
to the diff erent railways of Canada by
reason of the suppression of passes.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I would suggest to

latest, early in February, in order that there
may be plenty of time to finish the session
before the hot weather cornes. We ail know
it is unpleasant to have to sit here during
June and July. It has always, seemed to
me that not only this Government but also
previous governments could by a littie effort

that it be another short session.

-On the Orders of the DayHon. Mr. BELCOURT: In view of the
imminence of prorogation, I_ desire to bring
to the attention of honourable gentlemen a
matter which has already been discussed
once or twice during this session, and which
ought to be disposed of now. Many members
have at various times express-ed their difficulty in understandýing amrendments to Bis
because those amendments were not printed
with the sections to be amended. My lionourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
lias on several occasions expressed his entire concurrence in the desirability of finding some means of overcoming that difficulty. He has told us in the course of the
present session that lie had not been able
to accomplisli the purpose whicli we al
'have in view, and lie lias suggested that
before the House prorogued some steps
ouglit to be taken towardis attaining that
purpose.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wouid
itnot be advisable to take action by means

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: J am quite pepared ta accept the suggestion of my honourahle friend.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: According to the
suggestion of my honourable friend, I understand that the section to be amended would
be printed in full, with the amendment
printed in italics. That method has been
followed in the Quebec Legislature, and it
bas worked exceedingly well. I think the
proper course would be ta appoint the
suggested committee immediately that they
may confer with the members of the House
of Commons without delay.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

That a special committee of this House composed of Hon. Sir James Lougheed, Hon.
Messieurs Bostock, Ross and Belcourt, be appointed for the purpose of conferring with the
honourable members of the House of Commons,
in order that ail Bills which purport to amend
any act of Parliament, upon submission for

in italices, in both English and French, the section or sections purporting to be so anended.

appointment of a committee of the other

Act.

*Hon.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill before the Committee contains certain amendments which
I shall ask the Chairman ta be good enough
to read when we reach them. They are
made at the suggestion of the House of
Commons. When the Bill was up for discussion yesterday it was proposed ta the

Hon. Mr. Calder, who had charge of the
Bill, that the amendments should be made

in the Senate, and we shall accordingly
make

then.

On section 1, new section 5, subsection 1-

minister to have control of civil re-establishment:

I move:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

an Act to amend The Department of Sol-

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is this an enlargement of the department over which my
honourable friend presides? Are we placing more work on his shoulders? I had
always understood that my honourable
friend had a large amount of work ta do.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This only
gives effect to the Orders in Council under
which the department is already acting. It
gives no additional power or authority except in a modified form, what is contained
in a recommendation made by the Special
Committee of the House of Commons and
practically accepted by that House, as to
tenporary appointments being made notwithstanding the Civil Service Act.

Subsection 1 of new section 5 was agreed
to.
Paragraph a of subsection 2, new section
5, was agreed to.
On paragraph b of subsection 2, new
section 5-technical and special temporary
staff:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: There is ar
amendment ta that:
Add to subsection 2 (b), of new section
5, the following:.
Provided, however that the rules and regulations referred to shall contain such appropriate
provisions as are necessary to have such
appointments from time to time as required
ce tilied by the Civil Service Commission.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:

Why is it neces-

sary to have this amendment? The department is to be under the control of the Civil
Service Commission as it is to-day, is it

not?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is in a
sense, but the Civil Service Commission.

NOVEMBER
recognizing the emergency character of the
work, has up to the present time permitted
the department practically to make its own
appointments, which are but temporary
appointments, and the commission afterwards certify to them, where necessary. But
it is desirable that this should be expressly
stated in the Act, so as to relieve the Civil
Service Commission of the responsibility
which rests upon it, and to give to the department the advantage of making appointments instantaneously where it may be
necessary to do so.
The amendment was agreed to, and paragraph b of subsection 2 of new section 5, as
amended, was agreed to.
Paragraphs c, d, e, f and g of subsection
2, new section 5, were agreed to.

On paragraph h of subsection 2, new section 5-penalties:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
that the following be substituted for subsection 2 (h) of new section 5:
(h) For imposing penalties not exceeding in
any case a fine of two hundred dollars or imprisonient for a term not exceeding three
months enforceable upon summary conviction
for the violation of any provision of any such.

The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is desired to insert the following as paragraph i:
(1) All regulations made hereunder approved
by the Governor in Council shall bè laid before
Parliament within fifteen days after they are
made If Parliament is then sitting; and if not,
then within fifteen days after the opening of the

next session of Parliament.
The amendment was agreed to.

was agreed to.
Subsection 3 of new section 5 was

Service Act, 1918, with respect to the salaries of certain postmasters and assistant
postmasters.
S-261

6, 1919

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this Bill is to make provision for
continuing the policy which has already
been in force ever since the Special War
Revenue Act was passed. Its effEet is to prevent postmasters and assistant postmasters
in city offices from drawing salaries on
any portion of the revenues derived fromn
the sale of war-tax stamps. The salaries of
the postmasters and assistant postmesters
in city offices are provided as shown by
the Civil Service List. The policy which I
have mentioned has up to the present been
enforced under the War Measures Act, but,
as the war is over, it is necessary to bring
these provisions before the House in order
that that policy may be continued.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Can the honourable
minister give us any idea of the quantities
of these stamps that have been sold through
the post offices?
Have the postmasters
made any clain for commission for handling
war-tax stamps.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: We have no exact
return of the numbers of war-tax stamps
sold.
Honourable gentlemen can readily
understand that it is pretty difficult to ascertain what proportion of those stamps
have been used for postage, and what proportion for the tax. We can make a fairly
accurate computation, however. It is estimated that about one-third, or 28 per cent,
of the revenue of the department is derived
from that source.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: Do you pay the
postmasters a commission or an additional
salary for handling staînps?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The salaries of the
city postmasters are estaiblished by the
Oivil Service Act, and are based on the
value of the stamps sold by them.
They
range fromn $1,400 to $4,000. I shall -give
the House the figures showing the revenues
upon which the different salaries are paid.
They are as follow:

The salaries of assistant postmasters
range from $1,400 to $2,800.
Hon. Mr. POWLER: Does the Government ipay the salary of a postmaster's assistant in a town post office or does the

SENATE
postmaster have to ipay that out of his own
pocket?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: There are two kinds
of offices. There are the revenue offices
where the postmaster receives the wbole
revenue and pays his employeesHon. Mr. FOWLER: The whole revenue?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: A percentage. They
are on a different basis from the other offices and are not provided for by the Civil
Service Act, but by regulations of the department. These are country postmasters.
Hon. Mr. POWLER: But in towns with a
population of say 2,500 or 3,000 people, how
are they paid?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The employees are
paid by the department.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Paid by the department and employed by the department?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: There are two
classes of postmiasters. The city postmasters
have nothing to do with paying their employees; these are iii the Civil Service. In
a revenue post office, as in a country post
office, the postmaster is paid a certain
percentage of the revenue and has to pay
his employees out of his own pocket.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I wouild like to
voice a similar protest in.regard to a most
incongruous state of affairs that exists in
my town. The postmaster has to be up
until one or two o'clock in the morning to
receive the incoming mail, and he has to
be up at five in the morning to deliver the
outgoing mail. He receives $1,100 for
doing this work. He has not time to go to
bed. The man who looks after public buildings receives an equal salary, and gets a
free house and a very good house.
There is another thing that I would like
to draw attention to. Where the revenue
of a post office is about $5,000 a year, two
clerks cost only about $500 each, so the
postmaster nets about $4,000; whereas the
postmaster in the city of Charlottetown receives only $2,000 a year. There are many
ragged edges in the Post Office Department
that require trimming.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would suggest
that one of the difficulties mentioned is
caused by the fact that public buildings
were erected in small hamlets.
Hon. Mr. TODD: Honourable gentlemen
from Montreal or Toronto may call my town
a small hamlet, but I object to my honourable friend from Sussex doing so.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And he appoints
them?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to
ask the Postmaster General how he is
going to determine what proportion of the
stamps sold in a city post office are used
for war tax purposes. If I go to postal
wicket and buy five hundred stamps, how
is the Post Office Department to know what
use I make of them?

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I do not mind tne
badinage of my honourable friend; but I
submit that it is a ridiculous state of affairs
that a man who has to work twenty-four
hours a day, and therefore has le employ
an assistant, receives only $1,000 a year.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The calculations
are based not so much on the number of
stamps sold as on the number of letters
handled by the post office. 0f course, the
result cannot be absolutely -accurat e, but
it is pretty close to the mark.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: In this case the
assistant is a lady, and takes charge of the
post office in the daytime while the postmaster is sleeping. This is no joke, honourable gentlemen. I submit that it should
be within the power of the Postmaster
General to correct an anomaly of this kind.

Hon. Mr. TODD: J would like to draw
the attention of the Postmaster General to
a case in my county that verges on the
ridiculous. A postmaster bas tio employ an
assistant, and the remuneration that he
receives for himself and his assistant is
about $1,000 a year, whi.le a caretaker of
the public building in which the post office
i8 located receives, under the new classification, over $1,000 a year, with free rent,
free beat, and free water.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: If he is up aIl
night and all day, what does the assish.nt
do?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
he sleeps for the postmaster.

Maybe

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It seems to me that
in these days of what might be called flamboyant democracy there is nothing wrong
in a caretaker receiving as large a salary
as a postmaster. They both have to live,
and surely one man is entitled to the same
luxuries as the other enjoys.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The caretaker does
not have to employ an assistant.

THIRD READING.

On motion of Ron. Mr. Blondin, the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CIVIL SERVICE BILL.
CONSIDEREJD

IN COMMITTEE.

On the order for the third reading of Bill
18, an Act to, amend the Civil Service Act,
1918.-Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move:
That the Bill be not now read a third time,
but be referred to the Committee of the Whole.
There are certain amendments recommended by the special committee which
have to be made in the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
went, into Committep on the Bill. Hon.
Mr. Blain in the Chair.

And nothing In this Act shali affect the
powers of the Governor in Council with respect to the appointment of any commissioner
or other member of any royal or other commission or board or any deputy head.

My attention bas been directed to the
fact that the old Act bas practically
operated as a repeal of the power -o! the
Governor in Council to appoint a deputy
head.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER : Is not there a reservation or exception in some part of the Bill P
HTon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Provision
is made in the classification, but it is
necessary to have it also in the Bill.
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon.. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: Proceeding now to, new section, 45, on page 6, I propose that subsection 2 of this section should
be amended as follows:
Mfter the word "Commission,"

In the second

line of subsection 2, Insert the words «Iupon the

SENATE
recommendation of the deputy head and," so
that the subsection will read as follows:
Promotion shall be made for merit by the
Commission upon the recommendation of the
deputy head and upon such examination as the
Commission may by regulation prescribe.

There is no way of setting in motion the
promotion except by somebody in the -department. The commissioners themselves

would not have any personal knowledge as
to the advisability or wisdom of such a
promotion being made. It must be set in
motion by somebody; then a recommendation is made by the deputy head.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would it not be set
in notion by a vacancy occurring? There
could not be a promotion without a vacancy.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Without a vacancy
occurring either by the death or the superannuation of the incumbent of the position or by the classification creating a new
position?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
promotion does not take place automatically.
Hon. Mr..FOWLER: No, but would not
the members of the Civil Service who were
in line for that promotion be alert enough,
if they saw an opening which meant promotion for them, to set in motion the application for it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It might
not be necessary to fill the vacancy; it
might not be necessary to take any action. But it seems to me noit unreasonable
that the deputy head, who is the head of
the department, should say to the Civil
Service Commission: "It is desirable to do
The commisision' then may
eo-and-so."
exercise its authority and judgment as to
whether it shall .act or not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We discussed this
matter very fully in the cemmittee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask Mr. Gisborne to come within the bar?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We discussed this
matter very fully in the committee and it
waa the consensus of opinion-I think I
am reflecting the judgment of the committee-that it was not necessary to have any
action taken on the part of the deputy minister, because the vacancy occurs by
reason of a new classification, or by the
death or removal of the present incumbent
of the position. It is perfectly well known
to the members of the Civil Service who
would be in line for promotion to that
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

position. Here is where the deputy minister comes in. He is supposed under the
new Act to keep an efficiency report regarding every man in his department, and
the examination held by the Civil Service Commission is based upon a certain
technical test and upon the nature of that
efficiency report which is under the control of the deputy minister. Otherwise
there might be favouritism on the part of
the deputy ministers, who are only human.
Human beings are very likely to have
favourites, and it is noit always the best
man who would win. But efficiency reports are kept, and if they are kept properly, as it is to be presumed they will be,
nothing unfair will be done, because
the commission have no interest in any individual and the appointment would be
made on merit. If the applicant has passed
the examination and the efficiency report
shows that he bas the necessary qualifications, he will be appointed. That argument
appealed to the committee, and I think I
am reflecting the committee's judgment in
that regard when I say that we thought
the Bill should be left as it is.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The amendment proposed by the honourable leader of the House
is a very desirable one. Fortunately, in
Canada nowadays the deputy heads, as a
rule, have no politics. There are a number
of deputy heads who were formerly known
as Liberals and there are a number who
have been known as Conservatives, but as
a rule the deputy ministers in this country
are above politics and do not allow their
actions to be influenced by their previous
party connections.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There is no question
whatever of politics.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The deputy head is
supposed to be familiar with the work of al]
his subordinates. The Civil Service Commission cannot be familiar with the merits
of the subordinates in the different departments, and I think that it was a defect in
the Bill as it came to us originally; that it
made no provision for a certain control by
the deputy head. If a vacancy occurs in a
department I think the deputy minister is
just the man who is most likely to know
which of his staff should be promoted. This
amendment is a step in the right direction.
We should not ignore the deputy heads,
who are a very capable and deserving class
of public servants.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I had no idea of
politics at all in my mind when I spoke,

NOVEMBER 8, 1919
and I do not think that politics would affect
these gentlemen. But there are other kinds
of favouritism besides political. It might
easily be that a man who was very subservient to his chief would earn the close
friendship of the chief, while another man,
whose work and merits were superior, might
by his manner not be so pleasing to his
chief; and that, therefore, when a recommendation was made, the time-server and
the supple-kneed gent would be the man to
get the promotion whether he deserved it
or not. I fail to see how the method of promotion prescribed in this section can be improved upon.
Fortunately, the salaries of the Civil Service Commissioners are now sufficient to
attract good men, and we have good
men in those positions. They have
done their work exceedingly well, and to
my mind they deserve the thanks and the
gratitude of this House and this country
for the manner in which they have performed a very difficult task.
They had
before them the great task of re-classification, in which they were of course as-sisted
by efficiency experts from the other side.
If we are going to make the Civil Service
in this country a success we must abolish
not only patronage on the part of the members of the House and of the Government,
but also a more pernicious, more evil system of patronage-that which may be exercised by the deputy minister or head of a
department, who has no such responsibility
to the country as a member of Parliament
bas. If you are going to abolish that, you
rust give the Civil Service Commission
an opportunity to show that the system that
you have adopted is the best system. You
must eliminate all chance of favouritism
in recommendations
for appointments.
Now the classification is in the hands of
the Civil Service Commission, and by a
scheme known as the Jameson scheme-for,
as I understand, it was devised largely
by Mr. Jameson, one of the members of
the commission-there is provided a means
whereby all the anomalies that at present
exist in the classification may be removed,
as you will see by section 44 of the Bill.
There is a Board of Hearing, of which one
of the members of the commission is the
head. The deputy ministers are represented
on that Board of Hearing, and also the
body of the service. Everybody will therefore have a fair show. This Board of Hearing ýprovides for the very thing that some
of the detputy -ministers were exceedingly
anxious about, in the case of the appointment of technical experts. I understand

407

that an amendment is to be moved with
regard to that. In the case of technical
experts, there will be on the Board of Hearing a member who will be an expert along
the lines of the position which i to be
filled.
The chairmnan of our committee is here
and will be able to say whether I am right
or wrong in this matter. I think it was
the judgment of the committee that the section should be retained, because otherwise
there would be an undue interference with
the principle that underlies this whole system of the control of government appointments by the Civil Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I agree with the
statement of the honourable member for
Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) that the committee examined this question very carefully.
We discussed it for probably half an hour
and after a full investigation came to the
conclusion, which was practically unanimous, that the clause should stand. There
were strong objections made by deputy ministers who appeared before the committee;
but notwithstanding all they could say
against the clause, we decided, for the reasons given bf the honourable senator from
Sussex, that it would be pernicious to turn
back and practically put the control back
into the hands of the deputy ministers,
leaving matters as they were. Any man
who has been about the corridors of the
public buildings for the past seven or eight
years knows something of the anomalous
conditions which have arisen from the recommendations of deputy ministers, especially when they had practically the absolute power of appointment; and it was with
a view to doing away with conditions of that
kind that this' classification was prepared.
As bas been pointed out, there is now a
board of review, and anybody who feels
aggrieved can bring his case before that
board. The deputy minister himself can
appeal to the board, and all parties are represented. If we are going to make and
keep the Civil Service Commission independent, it is for that commission to determine what is right in the circumstances.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I had not
the opportunity of being present when the
committee discussed this particular subject.
If the committee have given to it the consideration which my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) states they have, there
is no desire to disturb the committee's report in that respect. I may say that my
attention was directed to this matter by
some officials of the Government, and I
said I would submit it to the House.

SENATE

408

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Before the honourable leader of the House takes that stand,
I would point out that there was more than
one opinion in the committee about this
very matter. The question was considered
by the committee, and we heard the deputy
ministers of two of the departments with regard to it. So far as I am personally concerned, I think that the deputy minister
ought to have some say in the matter of
promotions. As the head of the department
he is responsible for the administration of
the department's affairs, and I cannot see
keep his department
can
ho
how
working u-p to full capacity and at the
highest notch of efficiency if he is not in
a position to say who is fit for promotion,
provided that the person recommended has
the qualifications required by the Civil
Service Commission. This particular subsection, I think, takes too m'uch away ftiom
the deputy minister and leaves too mulch
to the control of the Civil Service Commissioners, who cannot, so far as I can
sec, be personally in touch with the whole
work of the department, as the deputy
minister ought to be. The Deputy Mnister of Finance stated before the committee that ha feared there would be great
difficulty in handling some of his staff on
account of this provision. We had before
us also the Deputy Minister of Justice,
who pointed out certain objections that he
saw in this particular clause, and I think
taere was quite a strong feeling in the committee that it was not wise to allow this
clause to pas.s in its presant form, although I do not think that any amendment was actually proposed in the committee.
The danger which I sea in this Bill is
tihat in our desire to abolish patronage in
the Civil Service we are going too far, and
we may wake up one day to find that we
have put too much power and control in
the hands of the Civil Service Commission.
One honourable gentleman bas said that
he feared patronage would be exercised by
the deputy minister; but the deputy minister is responsible to the minister and the
minister is responsible to Parliament and
to the country. On the other hand, we
appoint Civil Service Commissioners for
ten years, and, as I understand, the only
way they can ba removed is by an address
of both Houses of Parliament.
I think that the amendment proposed
by the leader of the Government is a very
desirable one if the ministers and *their
deputies are to exercise proper control over
their departrnents. I think that we are in
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGEEED.

great danger of going too far in this matter
in our desire to do away with patronage.
We are going to the other extreme, and if
the Bill goes through, the chances are that
we shall have to amend the Act at a later
date.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I agree with the leader
of the Opposition. I think it is absolutely
impossible for the Civil Service Commission
to make promotions in any departnent,
and at the same time absolutely ignore the
head of the department.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They do not ignore
him.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Then, why not insert
the words, "on the recommendation of the
deputy head?"
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is a different
thing altogether. There is a great distinction
between the two.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: The Civil Service Commission conduct an examination. According te this, you may have promotions in
a department against the wish and the interest of the man who is charged with the
administration of the department.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: We want to destroy
nepotism.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: The commission would
kill nepotism. The deputy might say that
three men were open to promotion.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is not a
recommendation at all.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: He can recommend
three as well as one.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Their fitness for promotion is shown by the efficiency reports.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: He may say they are
efficient and make no recommendation; he
rnay recoimend one man, or he may reconmend ten.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The record of a
man's work is better than a recommendation of a deputy minister or any one else.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: How do you get at it?
You have to find out from the head of the
department.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: A record is kept.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: You have to have a
coroner's inquest on a lot of books and
papers.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Sometimes a coroner's inquest is not an undesirable thing.

NOVEMBER 8, 1919
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The report of
the coinmittee, leaving the section as it
was, was approved by the House. The
committee heard very full statements in
reference to this matter. We had two distinguished deputy mninisters before us, and
1 think they certainly would have liked to
have re.served to them the right to make
recommendations. I think they directed
their remarks more particularly to the propriety cf dealing with technical &officiais.
The board, by a wocrking arrangement, flot
under the Act, set up a scheme for choosing
technical experts, which I think ought to
work admirably. Everybody knows what
that was, so 1 need not go into it.
I agree with my honourable friend from
'Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) that if we are
going to have this Civil Service Act, and
we are committed to the principle of it,
we cut at the very root of the Act if we
make this amendment. If we find that the
Act does not work welI, we can go back to
the old system of recominendations by the
deputies. In any event, I think this method
ought to be tried. The deputy must report
to the Civil Service Commission when a
vacancy ccurs. The commission have an
efficiency report, and an examînation as
well. If we are going to stick to the principle of the Act, I do not know why we
should not adopt the method proposed. I
amn not going into the question o! whether
it is or is not the beut method, but it is the
method contemplated by the Civil Service
Act, and I think we should give it a trial.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: If there is any
one clause that we gave more attention to
than another, I think it is this one. If the
Civil Service Commission was appointed for
any particular reason, I think it was because it was, thought that this power should
be taken out o! the hands of the deputies.
My experience is that a great deal of
jealousy and bard feeling had been created
throughout the departmneuts, because of the
reasons mentioned by my honourable friend
from Sussex. These men are bound to have
their favourites. In the coxumittee we came
to, an almost unanimous, conclusion that
this question should be lef t lu the hands of
the Civil Service Commission. Two deputies
came before us, one of whom particularly
fait that it should be withiu his power to
select his own staff. It is, not very long
since a man holding a very important position resigned becausa hie was not parmitted
te choose his owu staff. He wauted to go
further than mneraly te choose men for technical positions; hie wanted te, go ail the way
down to the stanographers and to be entirely

409

free from the commission. In the Department of Justice thare may be some reason
wby this rule sbould be variad; but if it is
varied whare are you going to draw the line
betwaan one deputy and another? I am
very much in favour of the Bill being passed
as it came from the committee. I baliava
that nothing else will satisfy the Civil Service, and, after ail, that is what we are trying te do.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Unlese
any honourable gentleman desires that we
should take a vote, we will go on.
Hon. Mr. POWER: We may as well vote
on it. Thera is just one observation that I
s-hould like to make. lt has been claimed
that the committee were unanimous in connection with this matter. We are not supposed to tell what took place in the cernmittea, but onie may sýay this. For one, I
was in favour of the ameudment which bas
heen submitted by the leader of the House,
and I think the honourable gentleman who
acted as cbairman of the committee, and
who showed the greateat patience in daaling
with this Bill, will agree with me when I
say that the committae had been sitting
for, I think, three days, holding two and
somatimes three sittings a day, and that by
tbe time we got te this recommendation with
respect to the deputy ministers, wbich was
the last amandmant proposed, tbe members
o! tha committea were ail tired and fagged
out and were flot disjosed te, deliberata upon
the matter, and the Bill went through as it
was.
Hou. Mr. FOWLER: I did not say the
committee was unanimous. It was almosi
unanimous. The honourable member from
Halifax was a 'meinuer of the committee,
consequently it could not be unanimous.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: In order to, taka the
sense of the. House upon this question, I
move that the followiug amandment be
made:
On page 6, in Une 18, Insert, the words "upon
the recommaendation of the deputy minister and"
before the word Ilupon."
The ccmmittee divided ou tbe amendment:

yeas, 16; nýays, 16.
The Hou. the CHAIRMAN: I declare the
amendment lost, as it is not supported by a
majority of the Committea.

Hon. Sir JÀMES LOUGHEED: There is
another amendman-t te, be made which may
ba termed a cousequential oue. It seems

that, in anticipation of the classification
being put into force, certain appointnients

SENATE
They have
and promotions were made.
Leen held up until the classification should
go into operation. It is therefore desirable
that section 13 of the Bill should be amended by adding the following:
Provided, however, that any person who bas
been or is appointed or promoted to any position in the Civil Service after the first day of
April, 1919, shall, on such appointment or promotion, be classified and paid in accordance
with the provisions of the said classification or
any amendment made thereto under the provisions of this Act.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Those persons will
get the benefit of the classification from
April, 1919.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
those who were appointed under it. I
understand that the appointments were
made under the classification; and statutory effect should be given to them.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does my honourable friend know how many such appointments have been made?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I could
not tell my honourable friend. Mr. Gisborne tells me that all the appointments
made since that date were made on the
understanding that they would come under
this provision.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do I understand
that this makes them subject to the classification if we pass this Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I desire to move
an anendment to clause 38. It is as
follows:
That the following be added as subsection

2

of the new section 38 as enacted in lieu of the
former section 38, by section 9 of the Bill:
(2) In the case of an examination of technical character, the Commission shall confer with
the chief of the branch or division concernel
and prepare jointly with him the special subjectmatter of the examination; and shall likewise
consult with hii in making the appointment
concerning his branch or div-ision.

I believe that the chief of the branch
ought to be consulted as to the preparation

of the paper which is to be submitted to
the candidates for a technical position. Nobody knows as well as the head of the

branch what qualifications should be possessed by a candidate in order properly to
fill the position.
In other words, I
believe that the examination should
be strictly on the duties that are
to be -performed in the position for
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

which application is made. I have several
times heard of examination papecs which
a young fellow coming out of echool or college would have absolutely no trouble in
answering, while a very practical man,
competent to fill the position, would be at
a loss because the questions did not relate
to the duties of office. The interest of the
service is the only object we should have
at heart. It should be our desire to make
the .service as nearly perfect as possible,
and to remove the possibility of favouritism. I believe that if the departmental
chief were consulted regarding the preparation of examination papers, more efficient
men would be secured for the technical
positions.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does the amendment refer to promotions or to appointments?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: To either appointments or promotions. I believe that
in either case the departmental chief should
bo consulted.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: That is, for appointments to technical positions only?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: For the appointment of technical officers. To be frank,
I was referring only to appointments, but
perhaps it would Le just as well to have
it apply to promotions also.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: No.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: My amendment
refers only to appointments. I can see
the difficulty and perhaps the inadvisability of not having it apply to promotions. A
man's record is to be kept, and if he is
entitled to promotion lie will no doubt
receive it; but I think this aniendment
would he in the interest of the Civil Service.
While J aim on niy feet I would like to
refer also to the patronage question, which
was mentioned here a moment ago. Patronage lias been removed from the custodians of the people's in-terests, the men
who have been elected by democratie methode to represent the people in the different
counties, and the control of appointments
has been handed over to the Civil Service Commission. I believe that appointments to the service will be practically
safe in the hands of the Commission, and
I do not think it would be wise te have
deputy ministers or chief clerks in the service make the recommendations for appointment. My honourable friend referred
a moment ago to the political aspect. I

NOVEMBER 8, 1919

do not wish to interject politics into
the question, but in reply te my
friend I would say that the present deputy
ministers were appointed under the Administiation of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and all but
one, I think, are Liberal deputies. I do net
say that to their detriment, for I am net prepared te assert that these men are acting
unfairly; but I do say it would be unfaàr
at the present time te allow these men te
recomimend who should be prometed or who
should be appointed to office. That would
be simply te transfer te them the patronage
-that was exercised by the men who I
still believe ought te exercise it; for I
am not now, and never have been, in
faveur of what has been done in taking
the patronage out of the hands of the
representatives of the constituencies, elected
te look after the interests of the people.
In taking from the people's representatives the right te recommend Government appointments, what have you done?
Yeu have changed a democratic system into
a bureaucracy, and now the men who have
been elected by the people have absolutely
nothing te say regarding the appointment
of the humbles:t postmaster in a rural district. Some ridiculous things have occurred,
honourable gentlemen, in regard to the appointment of some of those rural postmasters, as you can understand. Instead of a
member of Parliament being relied upon te
recommend ia suitable iman, recommendatiens 'have been obtained from sources all
over the country. J know of one man
who was recommended for a position in
a Maniteba constituency under this bureaucratic system, and who, after he had been
appointed, was found to be a ticket-of-leave
man. I do net believe that this change will
ever work out in the best interest of Canada; but as the Government has adopted
it and the people seem to want it, I am
willing to give it a fair trial, and in order
te give it a fair trial we ought to make the
Civil Service Commission absolutely responsible by removing any possibility of
interference by the deputy heads of the
departments making recommendations.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The honourable gentleman's amendment would seem to confine
the commission te a conference with only
one individual, whereas at present they are
free te confer with that individual and with
any others frem whom they may receive
advice or instruction.
Hon. Mr. BRAD'BURY: This would make
A compulsory te confer with the chief of
the branch or division concerne<i.

411

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would net have a
strong objection te a mere conference with
him; but the amendment goes further; it
provides that the commission must prepare
jointly with him the examination papers.
I would be opposed te that; I do net see
any necessity for that. It is net to be supposed that the Civil Service Commission is
a walking encyclopedia of universal knowledge; therefore it would not be expected
of them that they in themselves, either collectively or individually, ipossessed complete
knowledge on every branch te which it
would be necessary te appoint an officer.
They are obliged te call in expert advice
with regard te technical positions. They do
that. It would net be fair te assume that
they would do anything unreasonable, and
I think that the matter should be left te
them.
I want te reiterate my statement regarding the position I take on this question. I
hold strong opinions, and I desire te impress upon the House that I am in earnest.
In the first place, like my honourable friend
frem Selkirk (Hon. Mr. Bradbury), I am in
faveur of having the patronage of recommendations of appointment to public office
in the hands of the men who are responsible to the people. I am glad te know that
my honourable friend from Selkirk is of
that opinion, because when that matter
came before the Senate, I think the records
of the Senate will bear me out in saying,
I was the only person who took a stand
against the presenit system and in faveur
of that. But we have adepted this principle,
and I now
eel
it te be
my duty and I think every honourable senator should feel it his duty, no
matter what his private opinions may be
with regard te the advantage or disadvantage of this system te try te make it as
nearly iperfect as possible and net te throw
into the machinery any sort of monkeywrench that would interfere with its smooth
operation. Therefore we must remove from
the commission every vestige of control, or
what might be sinister influence, and give
them a free hand in this matter:
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: We would understand the situation better if my honourable ftriend could tell us by whom the
examinations for technical positions, are
now set.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: As I understand,
the commission call in expert advice.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That is the information I wanted brought before the
House.

412

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I spoke of that before. The Civil Service Commissioners do
not profess to be fully informed in every
branch of human knowledge, but they bring
in technical men. They would call upon a
first-class lawyer if they were going to set
an examination for the appointment of a
legal man. If they wanted an engineer they
would consult a first-class engineer, the
very best. But the amendment of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Bradbury) would
restrict the conference to a man who was
in the .department and who might or might
not be first-class; for there are engineers of
several classes in the Government service.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: The head of the
departinent ought surely to know what kind
of man he wants to work under him.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The same is true of
the lawyers also. If in the past the selection has been made by the deputy ministers, I do not know that they have always
exercised such judgment in selecting their
subordinates as would indicate to us that
they were perfect choosers of men. I do
not know that even in the legal department
the men who have been selected by the
deputy minister are men of such outstanding ability as to justify us in infringing the
principle that we have adopted, in order to
meet the views of that deputy minister. I
say we had better leave the clause as it is.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Let well enough
alone.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Give the Commission full power, and then if the system does
not work they cannot say it failed because
of the obstacles we threw in the way.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Better withdraw
the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I introduced this
amendment for what I believed to be the
betterment of the service. Having a little
practical knowledge of technical matters, I
realize that the man who is in charge of a
technical branch ought to know what should
be the qualifications of an applicant for a
position in that branch. If he does not
know he ought not to be in charge. I do
know this, that there have been cases in
which the departmental chief was supposed to be consulted, but was not
consulted, and the consequence was that the
examination was such that, as I said a
moment ago, a young college graduate would
have no difficulty in passing it, whereas the
practical man, who is well qualified and
bas perhaps been performing for months
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER.

the duties of the position, may be easily
tripped up on some of the questions in the
examination paper. I do not think that
this House should want to have it made impossible for a first-class man who is properly discharging his duties to secure the
position. I have in mind now a man who
had been for months fulfilling the duties
of a certain position and who was giving
splendid service to his chief, but who, when
the examination took place, failed to secure
the appointment, which was given to a
young man without any experience at all.
I do not wish to press this amendnent,
although I would have liked to see it pass.
I do not desire to do anything that would
in any way hinder the Civil Service Commission. I realize how difficult is the task
which the Commission bas had to perform,
and, like my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Fowler), I believe that we have been fortunate in securing a very competent Coinmission, who have rendered valuable service
to the country, and we ought to support
them as much as we can. At the same
time I believe that if any of us can offer
amendments that would improve the conditions, it is our duty to -do so. However,
in view of the fact that the amendment
does not seem to be acceptable to the House,
I withdraw it.
The amendment was withdrawn.

exemptions are made. This ýadds, another
class of ships to the exemptions.

on the Pacifie?
IV says nothing about
exemptions on the Atlantic.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, the
Bill deala with the Pacifie coast.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does this mean
that the ships will noV have Vo use a pilot?

Hon. Mr. CROSBY: If they used a pilot
Vhey would have to pay.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Act
does not require them to, take on a pilot.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: This is of advantage
to Canadian-owned ships on the Pacifie.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We have had some
bad accidenta on the coast of British
Columbia, and the question that I raise is
whether, by providing that these ships do
flot have Votake on pilots, we are opening
the door Vo further accidents.
Every
honourable gentleman knows that the navigation of the inland waters of the Pacifie
coast is an exceedingly difficuit matter.
Because of se many ships being in a congested area, and because there are so many
rocks, there is more danger in this coasting trade than there is in navigation at sea.
I would like Vo know who asked for this
legisiation.

BRAN AND SHORTS ADULTERATION
BILL.
FIRST READING.

A message was received from the House
of Comanons with Bill 7, an AcV Vo amend
the Adulteration Act (respecting Bran and
Shorts or Middlings.)

SENATE

414
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: fionourable gentlemen, this is
a Bill which was introduced in the House
of Commons by, I think, the member for
South Oxford (Mr. Donald Sutherland), and
was afterwards taken up by the Government. It proposes to prevent the adulteration of bran and shorts or middlings. It is
said that in the making of bran and shorts
ground weed seeds have been introduced
to a very large extent, and there is nothing
in the present Act to prohibit the introduction of any foreign substance. Consequently it is not only desirable but necessary in
the interests of stock-and of good government likewise-that we should provide that
in the case of bran and shorts or middlings
it should be the product of wheat, and in
the case of corn bran it should be the produce of maize or Indian corn. We propose
to amend the Adulteration Act accordingly.
The legislation is unquestionably good, and
I therefore with confidence move the second
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not want to
oppose the principle of this measure; but I
do object to it being brought down in this
way, without our having any opportunity
of looking at it. I cannot even find on my
file a copy of the Bill as introduced in the
Bouse of Commons. I for one have absolutely no knowledge of this Bill beyond the
few explanations which my honourable
friend bas given to the House.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is one
of the earliest Bills brought down this session: it is No. 7.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It is not even on
my file of Bills introduced in the House of
Comnions. The object of the Bill appears
to be a good one. I quite admit that we do
not want to have bran and shorts adulterated.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend pardon me? The Bill is
on ny House of Commons file. I will read
the Bill, which contains only four lines:
In the case of bran and shorts or middlings, if
it contains anything that is not a product of
wheat, or in the case of corn bran, if it contains anything that is not a product of maiz
or Indian corn.

Then it shall come within the Adulteration
Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I find the Bill here.
It had not been placed in the right order on
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

mny file.

Whien I looked for it before I could

not find it.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The Bill provides:
In the case of bran and shorts or middlings,
if it contains anything that is not a product of
wheatIf that provision is carried out strictly
according to the letter pf the law, it will be
impossible to get bran and shorts. There is,
as a rule, no grain milled that does not contain something besides wheat, and whatever
else it contains is ground up with the wheat.
Grain is never so absolutely clean that it
contains no foreign matter.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: I look upon this
Bill as one of the most important pieces of
legislation that bas come before this House
this session. People in Ontario who have
been buying bran and shorts for the last
five years have been simply humbugged by
the millers of the West. Substances have
been sold as bran and shorts that did not
contain more than 25 per cent of bran. I
brought a sample to a public analyst two
weeks ago to-day. The substance had been
sold as a bigh quality of shorts, and it had
already killel six pigs in one herd to my
personal knowledge. The analysis showed
four distinct traces of poison. The principal
ingredient in that substance was ground
wild mustard seed; it contained also some
chicken weed and chalk and limestone. Is
that the proper way to obtain money from
the farmers of this country, who are trying
to improve their stock? Legislation of this
kind should have been passed years ago,
and I am very glad to sec that a member
from Ontario who has suffered very severely
from these conditions has had sufficient
nerve to bring in this Bill, and I want to
support it.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: The remarks of the
honourable gentleman from Brockville
(Hon. Mr. Webster) are quite correct so
far as they relate to weed seeds or other
substances that are injurious to the bran;
but, as the honourable member from Portage
la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson) says, it is impossible to get bran that is all pure wheat.
The Bill as it is now worded is too stringent
to be carried out. I quite agree with the
honourable gentleman from Brockville that
there is a great deal of fraud in the sale of
bran. If it contains noxious weed seeds the
quality of the bran is injured; but oats or
barley or peas are not injurious. There are
sometimes peas ground up in bran, and it
is none the worse for that. If the Bill were
amended so as to prohibit only injurious
substances, I would like to see it go through.

NOVEMBER 10, 1919
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: In reply to the
honourable gentleman, I would point out
that you do not buy oats or peas or barley
at $45 a ton; you are charged $56 a ton for
them. Dealers will sell you what they call
bran for $46 a ton. Undei this legislation
there will be no sawdust nor shavings mixed
with the bran we buy. For that reason
I want to see the Bill pass just as it is.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: Does not the honourable gentleman know that when wheat
is passing through the mill, oats or barley
or something of that kind may sometimes
get mixed with it?
'Hon.'Mr. WEBSTER: That is ail cleaned
out.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: In the grinding
some of that gets into the bran. It in no
way injures the quality of the bran, but
rather improves it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: May I suggest that
we go into committee on this Bill instead
of carrying on -a discussion of this kind on
the second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN

COMMITTEE.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into committee on the
Bill. Hon. Mr. 'Thompson in the Chair.
On section 1-bran and shorts or middlings, when deemed ta be adulterated:
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Honourable gentlemen, Iam in entire sympathy with the object of this Bill, but I think a strict interpretation of the wording might interfere
with its operation. A few kernels of foreign grain in the bran would sbe illegal according to this Bill. Like my honourable
friend, I do not think that bran should be
loaded up with noxious weed seeds. As
the honourable gentleman from Brockville
(Hon. Mr. Webster) has said, it is not only
injurious ta animais ta -feed them that
class of chop and bran, but it is a fraud
upon the purchaser, particularly when it
casts from $40 to $45 a ton, as it does now.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: There is no $40
bran now; it is $46 a ton.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That makes it ail
the worse. But, as the wording of the Act
stands, it would be hardly possible for any
person ta furnish bran that would come
' ithin the requirements of the Act.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: As my honourable
friend is an old miller, I would like to ask

415

him if ail this foreign matter is not cleaned
out of the wheat before it is manufactured into flour. If that is done, there
should be nothing but bran left. The
trouble is that the millers have been mixing seeds of ail kinds with it.
Hion. Mr. WATSON: I know that-mill
sweepings.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: But they do not
grind up these seede to make flour.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: There is barley or
oats.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: That is ail cleaned
too.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: If my honourable
friend will look -at the dictionary he will
find that bran is defined as the hull of
wheat, and that is what a man wants when
he buys bran. The millers will not mix
with it other grains which are worth $10
or $12 a ton more. But we do not want to
buy any moire brown chalk, shavings, or
sawdust, for bran.
Section 1 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed ta.
The Bill was reported without amendmènt.
THIRD READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGH>EED moved the
third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I just wish to make
this observation in connection with the
Bill. I think there is -a good deal of force
in what has been said by the honourable
gentleman from Portage la Prairie; but in
addition to that it has been announced, privately if not publicly, that we are ta have
prorogation this afternoon. The result is
that the Senate is not to have an opportunity of considering this Bill with a view
ta amending it. I think it is to be regretted that the Government have assumed
the position which they have. There are
other important measures to come before
us to-day, and, on the whole, I think it
would have been wieer and fairer to the
Senate itf the Government had decided not
ta have prorogation until to-morrow, so
that this House would have a chance ta
exercise its proper constitutional functions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Power) or my honourable friend from
Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson) has
any amendment ta offer, we will give ail
the time necessary for its consideration.

SENATE

416

Hon. Mr. POWER: The Bill ¯has just
been laid before us. The fact that the
draft of this Bill was laid before the Commons early in the session does not mean
anything. The members of this House, as
a whole, are not at all familiar with the
Bill. Apparently the Government have not
been able to frame a measure that would
meet the ends of justice, and they might
give us an hour to do so.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.
HOUSE OF COMMONS BILL.
FIRST READING.

Bill 9, an Act to amend the House of
Coimons Act.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a Bill which was brought in by a member
from Montreal, Mr. Jacobs, and which was
taken up by the Government. It bas to
do with elections to the House of Commons, and provides that a writ shall be
issued within six months alter the receipt
by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery of
the warrant. It also deals with the case
of a member who has been elected for two
electoral districts. It is a very desirable
Bill, and as it bas been approved by the
House of Commons, which is the only body
interested in the subject, I move the second
reading.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, as I understand it, this Bill deals entirely with matters affecting the House of
Commons, and I do not know that the
Senate should have very much to say in
regard to it. Of course, the same objection
that I took a few moments ago to another
Bill is applicable to this Bill. It is brought
before us in the dying days of the session,
and, as I have it before me, is in the form
in which it was introduced into the House
of Commons. J did not know that it was
coming up this morning, and I have not
had tinte to read it. However, as it affects
only the House of Commons, I think we
might let the second reading go through and
consider it more closely in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

On new section 1la of section 1-election
writ to issue within six months alter
warrant:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like to
point out to the House that this clause
simply fixes a date before which the writ
shall be issued, but there is nothing with
regard to the time when an election shall
be held. I have not the Election Act before
me, but I understand that although a writ
could be issued within six months, the
election might not be held for a year or
eigliteen months after that time. As I
understand it, there is nothing to fix the
date of the election.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The writ
fixes the date of the election, and my recollection is that it follows (within a certain
nuiber of days.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If a writ is issued
on the first of January, must the election
be held before the lst of March?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that there is a limitation in the Act
dealing with that.

been very unusual in the past, and I do
not know of any case where any great difficulty lias resulted from it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
it is very undesirable that a member should
run for two constituencies, and alter the
election resign one of them, entailing a
second election. It means that the public
exchequer is drawn on for the expense of
holding a second election.

An elaiborate -report was

Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-section relating to requisitions repealed:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We have practically substituted this section 22 for section 24, as I understand. Is that correct?
The new section will, I presume, take the
place of section 24?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. Section 24 provides:
All purchases made by the Superintendent
of Stationery as hereinbefore provided shall
be so made upon requisition approved by the
and, in the
minister or the King's Printer,
case of printing paper for parliamentary
printing, the Canada Gazette and departmental
reports, in accordance with contracts entered
into with the like approval after tenders have
been called for.

That is repealed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the effect
of repealing that clause?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It prepares the way for new section 30A, which
provides:
Until a general purchasing agency is established, the Superintendent of Supplies shall-

do so-and-so. He shall practically supersede those other officers who have had
charge of purchasing.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-new section 30A-Superintendent of Supplies to purchase stationery,

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This follows section 30, which reads:
The accountant shall, under direction of the

paid in, and render statements of accounts to
the clerks of the two Houses of Parliament
and the deputy heads of the several departments,
as and when the same are required by this
Act or by regulations made by, or instructions

received from, the minister.
Then this new section defines the duties
of the Superintendent of Supplies.

3. All such purchases made on the authority
of requisitions duly approved by the minister,

Hon. Mr. POWER: Does it not occur
to the minister that there is a sort of conflict between the clause we are now considering and clause 3? Clause 3 says that
the Superintendent of Stationery shall have
charge of the custody and supply of all
articles of stationery; and then it goes on
to say, " not including printing materials,
printing paper, and printing supplies, required for the use of members." The clause
that is now under consideration says th'at

of -Commons with Bill 26, an Act to amend
the Canada Temperance Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING.

Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it is
proposed to amend the Canada Temperance
Act by enlarging the scope of its provisions.
At the present time, as honourable gentlemen know, the Act applies to prescribed
areas in the province. It is now proposed
that upon receipt of a resolution from a
legislature requesting a vote upon the prohibition of the importation of liquors, the
Governor in Council may issue a proclamation, which will make provision for the
nature of the prohibition and also for setting
in motion the machinery by which a vote
of the province may be taken. We can discuss the provisions of this Bill more closely
in Committee, and any further explanation
that may be necessary can be given then.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, I think we ought to protest
very strongly against the policy of the
Government in bringing down a Bill of
this nature at this time in the session.
We were called here at the beginning of
September for the purpose of dealing with
the Peace Treaty, and the session has been
continued until this second week in November, and during part of that time the
Senate at any rate had very little business
to transact. If it was the intention of the
Government to bring down such legislation to be enacted, they ought to have
brought it down earlier in the session, in
order that every member of this House
might have an opportunity of studying it
and studying thoroughly the whole situation. But at this late day, when it is understood to be the intention to prorogue,
there is placed in our hands a Bill which
has been considerably amended in the
House of Commons since it was introduced
there. I -sent for a copy of the Bill this
morning and was handed a reprint of the
measure as proposed to be amended in
8-271

419

Committee of the Whole in the House of
Commons. The Bill, since it was introduced in the House of Commons, had been
so much amended that the Commons considered it necessary to reprint the Bill
with all the amendments, in order that
members of the House of Commons might
understand what they were dealing with.
Since the reprint was issued the Bill has
been further amended in the Commons. A
copy of the Bill in its present form has
only just been placed in my hands, and I
have had no opportunity of looking at it.
It comprises about five pages of very closely printed matter, and I do not see how
any honourable member of this House,
whether in favour of the Bill or opposed
to it, can possibly consider it intelligently
at this late hour in the session.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I was in hopes that the honourable
leader of the Opposition, before sitting
down, would make a motion regarding this
Bill. My first complaint with regard to it
is one that has been already mentioned,
and I do not need to occupy time in discussing it again: the other House has been
in session for quite a long time, and I
think it is unfair to us to ask us to deal
with it in the dying days or the dying
hours of the session.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: The dying minutes.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: There are questions
concerning the principle of the Bill, and
when we go into committee there will be
questions concerning all the details, which
will have to be very carefully dealt with,
and I do not see how we can deal with
this very important measure .as we ought
to do if prorogation is to take place this
afternoon.
There is this further consideration. The
House will be in session again certainly
before the end of March, because it will be
necessary to pass a Supply Bill by that
time. There is Cox waiting for this Bill,
and there does not seem to be any reason
on earth why it could not -stand over until
the next session of ParHiament without injuring any person in any way whatever.
I can understand men who are perhaps on
the whole sympathetic with this Bill, after
a proper consideration and discussion of it,
and being prepared to vote for it, itill insisting that this House should receivé moderately decent treatment from the House of
Commons in connection with iraportan
legislation of this kind.

420

SENATE

It is necessary for you to consider this
question. The Canada Temperance Act was
Dominion legislation. That Act was brought
into force in a county or municipality upon
the receipt of a petition from a certain proportion of the inhabitants of that particular
county or municipality. I think it was
necessary that the petition should be signed
by one-third, or at least a substantial proportion of the people, before the machinery
could be put in operation to take a referendum. This Bill introduces a new principle altogether. This is an enlarged or
glorified Scott Act. Instead of the machinery being put into operation upon receipt
of a petition from the people of the country,
it is done by a vote of the provincial legislature. There are nine provincial legislatures in the country, and you are liable to
have nine referendums on the question.
The cost of a referendum is said to be about
$1,000,000, and by this Bill you are putting
in the hands of the legislatures the power
to indulge in referendums the expenses of
which will have to be borne by the Dominion. That is a principle that I think
should be carefully considered, the principle which was at the bottom of the old Canada Temperance Act. There you started
with a vote of a substantial part of the
electors. Here you start with a political
vote, and you do not know what may be
the motive for putting the machinery into
operation. Unless some very strong reason were advanced against it, I would be
prepared to vote for an amendment that
would require the provinces to pay the cost
of the referendum. If the Legislature of
Nova Scotia wants a referendum, let the
Legislature of Nova Scotia pay for it. There
is no reason why they should throw part of
the cost of that referendum on the province
of New Brunswick or the province of Quebec, or any other province that might not
want it.
There is another feature of the Bill that
I think is bad. Honourable gentlemen will
remember that last year I opposed the Road
Bill in this House. My objection was that
under that Bill you gave money belonging
to the Dominion of Canada to another institution. My view is that that is contrary to
sound legislation, and contrary to the spirit
of our constitution. I say, that to entrust
to others the powers that the constitution
and the people have imposed on this Parliament is shuffling and side-stepping. This
Parliament should exercise the powers entrusted to it, and should not pass the buck
to the provinces. I take the same objection
to this Bill. Why should we import the provincial legislatures into it at all? If you
Hon. Mr. ROSS.

want to enlarge the Canada Temperance
Act, why not say that the petition must
come from a substantial part of the electors to guarantee that they want the Canada Temperance Act brought into force?
Under this Bill you become a tool in the
hands of the provincial legislatures, who
use you as they please. They come in some
fine morning and vote for a referendum.
They say: " The Dominion Government
will pay for it, and we will keep them
busy with referendums; the expense is a
matter of indifference to us."
This Bill has been brought down in the
last hours of the session, and, owing to the
fact that there will be another session in
not more than three months, I think that
this House, in fairness to itself and in fairness to the country, could defer the consideration of this matter until next March
or April, or some later date. I move:
That Bill 26 be not now read a second time,
but that the further consideration thereof be

postponed until the next session of Parliament.
That leaves it open for every man to reserve his judgment on this matter, and
gives him plenty of time to consider it. At
the same time, it is an intimation to the
Ho.use of Commons that we expect a little
better treatm'ent than we have been getting
in that House sending important Bills te
this House just a few hours before prorogation.
Hon. GEORGE G. POSTER: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not rise to take issue with
the leader of the Opposition when he protests against such legislation as this being
introduced at this late hour of the session;
nor have I any quarrel with what my honourable friend from Middleton (Hon. Mr.
Ross) has said upon that point. I regret
that the members of another House have
not caused this Bill to be sent here before;
but I -do not want the Senate, nor do I want,
to be placed in a false position in regard
to, this matter by voting for the amendment
which has been proposed by the honourable
senator from Middleton.
I find that there is throughout the country a misund.erstanding as to just what this
legislation means. Many people are under
the impression that it is intended in some
way to interfere with the rights of the provinces to have local option, prohibition, or
partial prohibition. No matter whether this
Bill passes or not, I understand that there
is nothing in it that does, or that intends to,

take away from the provinces the right they
enjoy to-day to have prohibition or partial
prohibition. I understand that this Bill

convictions for drunkenness were only six
per thousand. The Canada Temperance
Act bas been a perfect curse. Under the
Prohibition Act that we have had for a year
or so, Sunday has been the great night for
getting drunk, and Monday has been the
day when the people who got drunk have
been brought before the courts. If I thought
an amendment to the Canada Temperance
Act would improve things I would hold up
both hands for it, but I am satisfied that
it will not, and I shall support the amendment of the honourable gentleman from
Middleton.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentienien, I am very much in sympathy with
the remarks of the leader of the Opposition and the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Middleton as to the bringing down of important measures in the last
days of the session. But ever since I have
had the honour of a seat either in this
House or in the other House that bas been
the practice under all governments, Liberal,
Conservative, and Unionist, and in my
judgment it will continue to be the practice
for some time to come. Under these circumstances il do not think it advisable
for us to listen to the argument that we
should delay the passing of this Bill simply
because it bas been brought down to this
House at a rather late date. If there is
any one Bill or any one subject that has
come before Parliament upon which members generally are well posted, it is that
of prohibition. This question has been before all governments, Provincial and Dominion, for many years past. It bas been
shoved backwards and forwards; as the
honourable gentleman from Middleton said,
the buck has been passed by the Dominion
to the provinces and by the provinces to
the Dominion.
To my mind, the legislation we are considering to-day is a step in the right direction. It gives the province a right to have
bone-dry prohibition if they want it. My
honourable friend who has just taken his
seat says that the Canada Temperance Act
encourages the sale of whisky and is productive of drunkenness, and that it was
passed by the liquor people.
If it was
passed by the liquor people we could not
expect any other result. In the country
generally the Canada Temperance Act has
not been promoted by the liquor people. It
was passed at the instance of the temperance people. They want to have something
definite. They want it made possible for
either the province or the Dominion to have
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY.

a prohibitory Act of they so desire. I would
prefer to see a Dominion Prohibitory Act,
but I am not sure that, for the present at all
events, the mneasure which the Governmnent
is now introducing is not the proper one. It
will not satisfy everybody; no Act that you
can pass on this subject wil:l satisfy everybody; but it is a move in the right direction
and it should be given a tri-al. I quite
agree with my honourable friend beside me
(Hon. Mr. Foster) who suggests that if we
cannot finish our business to-day we ought
to take this evening and to-morrow to deal
with this matter. Better keep Parliament
in session for another day than break the
promise that the Prime Minister bas made
to the temperance people and disappoint a
great majority of the people of Canada.
I do not intend to labour this matter
further, but I want to say that in my judgment it would be a great mistake to vote
for the amendment of my honourable friend
I
fron Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross).
think we ought to pass this Bill and thus
give the provinces an opportunity of doing
what they think right in the matter.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I do not want to allow this opportunity to pass without expressing in a few
words my opinion on this subject.
In the
first place, 'I am satisfied that the views
expressed by the honourable member froi
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) do not represent public opinion in Nova Scotia. In
the next place, in ny view his armendnment
is not logical. At the present timne, under
the Canada Temperance Act, the Dominion
of Canada pays all the expenses of refererg
dums when called for by municipalities.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:

I admit that.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: It is perfectly logical, therefore, to my mind, that the policy
embodied in the law which bas been
on the statute book for many years
should be extended and that if a province desires a referendum in accordance with the established policy of the
present Act, the Dominion should pay
the expense of that referendum. In any
event, the honourable gentleman's ground
in regard to the expense of the referendum
is not a ground for defeating the principle
of the Bill, but is a matter which might
legitimately be considered when the Bill
goes into Committee. It is not a reason
for defeating the whole Bill.
I am not going to repeat what has been
se well said by honourable members who
have already spoken. I merely wish to say

NOVEMBER 10, 1919
that I am in perfect agreement with what
has been stated by the honourable member
from Alma (Hon. Mr. Foster) and the honourable member from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr.
Turriff). Without desiring to prolong the
debate, I wish further to point out this.
Last year, if I understand the situation
correctly, this House refused to assent to
the principle of this Parliament putting
Dominion-wide prohibition into operation.
In other words, this House, in deflance of
the vote of the House of Commons, refused
to assume the duty of deciding whether
there should be or should not be Dominion-wide prohibition. I am not discussing the question whether the House was
right or wrong, but that was the position taken. -What is the situation today? We are asked to leave the question to the provinces. Is this House
going to take the position that it will not
assent to Dominion-wide prohibition being
enacted by the Canadian Parliament and
will not assent to the principle of this Bill,
namely, that if a province wants prohibition it may have it?
The House of Commons, representing the
people, sent up legislation on this subject
last year, and the Senate, an appointed
body, refused to assent to that legislation.
I need not point out, what has been already. stated and what is well understood,
that this is not a new question. A prohibition Bill comes back to us in this form.
It has, I understand, received an overwhelming vote in its favouir in the Chamber representing' public opinion. A year
ago, when we were discussing the question
of daylight saving, one of the most powerful arguments used in this House by member after member was that the House of
Gommons was opposed to daylight saving,
and therefore this House should recognize
their position and not take a stand in opposition to them. If that attitude was logical then, it ought to be logical now. We
know that the overwhelming opinion as
voiced in the House of Commons is that
this legislation should go on the statute
book.
In this connection, honourable gentlemen, I want to state my view that' the
Senate assumes a very critical position if it
undertakes, on the grounds which have been
set out here, to defeat a measure of this
kind which has passed the House of Commons. It cannot be said that the Senate
is at all popular in the country. We regret
that it does not appear to have that grip
upon public opinion which we should like
it to have. As has been pointed out by the

423

honourable member from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Foster), there has been unquestionably in
this country, as well as in the United
States, a tremendous growth of public
opinion in favour of the enactment and
enforcement of prohibitory legislation. Is
this Senate going to set itself like flint
against that public opinion, as expressed
not only in the House of Commons
but also in the country P If it is, I
desire to say this- I regret exceedingly to have to say it, but it strikes
me as a very important element in this
debate: this Senate will invite a confliet,
not only with the people but with the
House of Commons; and any honourable
member who reads the history of conflicts
between elected chambers and appointed
chambers«muet inevitably come to the conclusion that the appointed chamber is certain to go down in the conflict. That has
been the history of conflicts in the old
countries of Europe between elected chambers and appointed chambers, and as
surely as the sun sets if this honourable
Chamber undertakes #ear after year to
defeat legislation which the people want,
and which the House of Commons decides
the people should have, then this House
will become engaged in a conflict which
will bring disaster upon itself.
The argument which has been used here,
that we have not time to discuss this
matter, is to my mind entirely fallacious.
Any honourable gentleman who has had
experience in public life, who has sat in
this House or in any legislative body,
whether federal or provincial, knows that,
as the honourable gentleman for Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) has stated, important legislation has always come down at
the end of the session, and as long as the
sun rises and sets that will continue to be
the case.
Under these circumstances, honourable
gentlemen, it is my intention to support
this Bill, and I shall sincerely regret the
action of this Chamber if it puts itself in
opposition to the will of the people in this
matter.
on. E. L. GIRROIR: In what I have
to say I am not actuated by any fear that
the representatives of the people and of
the provinces in this Senate, if their opinions run counter to the opinions of the
House of Commons or to those of any other
legislative body in this country, may be
swept away, as has been suggested by the
honourable gentleman who has preceded
me. I think that the prohibition senti-

424

SENATE

ment in this country is so strong, whether
it is ill-advised or wisely directed, that it
is impossible to resist it. I do think, however, that in voting for legislation on this
very important question we should be careful about its exact wording and about its
effects upon the rights of the provinces,
whose rights we are here to protect. It
was for this reason that last year I voted
against the measure of prohibition which
was before this House. I felt that it was
an interference with provincial rights, and
that. as I was here a representative of one
of the provinces, it was my duty to stand
for provincial rights. Therefore I felt justified in voting against that legislation.
This session a measure is introduced
which leaves the matter entirely in the
hands of the provinces. I would have been
prepared to go further than this legislation
goes, and provide that if a resolution asking for prohibition were adopted by a provincial legislature, it should be granted
them. Perhaps it .is better that the question should go to the people and that they
ýshould have a voice in deciding it.
Personally I believe that the prohibitionists are going too far. I believe that if
some liberty were allowed to the workingman to obtain light beers and wines of a
reasonable strength, it would have been far
better and wiser in the interest of prohibition itself. Mr. Gompers, the great
labour leader in the United States, for
whose opinion I have the very highest respect, argues very strongly that the extreme
measures of prohibition that are being enacted are having a very bad effect upon the
labouring people in the United States; that
men who work in factories and other places
where they are under great mental and
physical strain require some stimulant, and
that the extreme prohibitionists who are
preventing this will at some future day
have to pay for their extreme views on this
question.
But in the meantime it is quite evident
that the overwhelming majority of the
people, I may say on this continent, are
in favour of this prohibition. The members of this Senate are justified in deciding
these questions solely upon their merits.
What the prohibitionists may think, or
what the liquor people may think, should
not weigh with us at all. We are to consider
the best interests of the country at large,
and if we think that public opinion in
this country is behind this measure, and
that it is in the best interests of the country, then it is our duty to pass the measure
as it stands. I quite agree that the Bill
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR.

bas been brought down at a very late date
in the session. I quite agree that it is undesirable to bring in Bills of such importance at this late hour, when so little time
can be given for their discussion. But, as
bas been said, the question of prohibition
bas been before the country and before
both Houses of Parliament for a long time
now. The press has informed us as to the
different measures that were to be presented to us for consideration, and, viewing the importance of the question and the
desirability of having a proper test made
of this legislation within a reasonable time
and within as reasonable limits as possible,
I think it is best for us to pass the measure
as it stands. I wish to make this explanation in view-of the fact that last year, when
prohibition came before the Senate, I voted
against it. I voted against it because I
felt that it was an interference with provincial rights, which it was my duty to
protect. This measure does not so interfere with provincial rights, and therefore
I deem it to be my duty to support .it.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
gentlemen, I also have much sympathy
with the views expressed by the honourable member for Middleton (Hon. W. B.
Ross); but, representing the province of
Ontario and noting the overwhelming feeling of the people of that province in favour
of prohibition, if I am to give my support
to that overwhelming majority there is only
one thing for me to do. Only recently we
have had a referendum in the province of
Ontario, and, while I do not know what
was the majority in favour of prohibition, I know that it was very large,
and I think it would be extremely
unwise for a member of this Chamber
to oppose the will of the people. I shall
vote in favour of this Bill. At the same
time I feel that we are being imposed on,
inasmuch as we have not had this measure
before us until this morning, and have had
little opportunity to know what it really
contained. However, even with that handicap I feel that it is my duty to do what I
can to give effect to the wishes of the majority of the people in the province of Ontario.
I travel about considerably, and notwithstanding what my views, or the views of
others opposed to prohibition, may be, we
must come to the conclusion that, by hook
or by crook, the majority of the people in
the province of Ontario are determined to
have prohibition, and if we do anything to
prevent them from attaining that end it
seems to me it will not be to our advan-

SENATE
it is the duty of the Senate to reflect in a
large degree the sentiments of the people
of the Dominion. Our independent position
increases our responsibility because we can
de just what we ought to do. There is no
doubt that the opinions expressed in the
Senate in reference to this legisl'ation reflect public opinion. My honourable friend
from Middleton (Hon. Mr. Ross) did not
think it necessary for us to pass the legislation of last year because the Orders in Gouncil existed for one year after the declaratien of peace. He thought matters should
be left as they w-ere. The other day the remark was made that there were two ways
of killing a cat, which reminds me of how
easy i is for a legal man to suggest means
of killing legislation. Now the honourable
gentleman suggests that we should allow
this legislation to stand over until next

session. I say let us repeal this legislation
next session if we find that it has not the
support of the public; I think that is the
attitude that we should take. It may be late
in the session, but this is not a new question.
The progress of all reforms is slow, but
demands have been made and will continue
to be made in regard to this matter. The
platform of one of the new parties calls for
the abolition of the Senate. Without giving
any special regard to the attitude of the
farmers of Canada on that subject I support
this legislation. I am not a fanatical temperance man, but I believe that this legislation will be for the common good. The
people of the co.untry believe that it is for
the common good; and as the people of the
country have expressed their views, I -am
in favour of this legislation.
Hon. R. H. 0. PRINGLE: Honourable
gentlemen, the Bill that is before us at this
session has in it all the elements that the
Bill of last session had with reference to the
British North America Act and .the question
of its constitutionality. In this particular
legislation there is also involved the question of the abandonment to the provinces of
the sovereign powers of the Dominion. I do
not wish to enter into the merits of this
question at the moment. The whole Bill
bristles with constitutional points, and we
have, perhaps, an hour to deal with it. R
am going to read something that may interest some honourable gentlemen. It is
from the editorial columns of the Pioneer
of October 24, the leading prohibition journal in the province from which I come, and
voices, I presume, the opinion of the prohibitionists of Ontario. It is headed " InHon. Mr. THOMPSON.

adequate." After reciting the provisions of
this Bill, it goes on to say:
This method of dealing with the liquor traffic
la entirely unsatisfactory and cannot be accepted by the prohibitionists of the Dominion of
Canada. It is open ta two main grave objections.
First, it la distinctly an evasion by the Dominion Government of definite responsibility regarding legislation upon this important issue.
The duty of a province ta legislate is ta caterminous only with its contitutional powers.
The duty of the Dominion Parliament also extends ta the limit of its constitutional power.
At every stage of progress in the temperance reform efforts have been made by the
members of the legislative body approached ta
unload responsibilities on others.
Then it shows how that bas been done, and
further on it says:
Now the Dominion Parliament la seeking ta
sidestep its duty and throw the onus on the
provinces. Such a course is not creditable; t
is too shifty; it la not statesmanship.
Second, the Bill is inadequate and complicatad.
It does nat deal at all with the exportation of
liquor. To permit the manufacture of beverage
intoxicants in Canada for exportation is wrong.
Now, we are permitting nat only the exportation but the manufacture.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Would my honour-

able friend be prepared. to give them the

kind of statesmanship they want?
Hon. 'Mr. PRINGLE: I would give them
anything that is constitutional.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Would my honour-

able friend give theam a Dominion-wide Act?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would.
Hon. Mr. PRINGLE: Come along with
it. That is what is asked for here:
It would stand to the disgrace of Canada if
we prohibited the traffic in intoxicants ourselves,
but allowed the manufacture and shipment ta
China, South America, Africa, and other countries, ta debauch and degrade the citizens of
other lands.
It prohibits only the manufacture and importation in and into such provinces as, by
an absurdly roundabout process, follow certain
procedure and vote upon the question, and
allows freely the manufacture and importation
into ail other parts of Canada.
Ta call this a solution of the temperance
question would be a joke if that question were
net so serious.

I do not want to tire the House by reading the test of the editorial, but in the
light of what I have read, and in the light
of constitutional questions, no motion could
be 'better than that of my honourable
friend from Middleton (Hon. Mr. Ross).
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: I agree with
the viewpoint of the honourable member
who
for Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff),
said that maybe this was not al that the

NOVEMBER 10, 1919
tage. So far as I am personally concerned,
I concur in the opinion expressed by another honourable member, that neither fear,
favour nor affection, nor the possibility of
the abolition of this Senate, nor any consideration of that nature, should ever interfere with the way in which I give my vote
at any time. But I am particularly anxious
to have carried out the will of the great
majority of the people.
Hon. P. C. MURPHY:

Honourable gen-

tlemen, just a word in explanation of the
position I am going to take to-day. I feel,
like the honourable gentlem:an who has jusit
spoken, that measures of such importance
as this should not be foisted upon the Senate in the dying hours of the session. Last
session, when a similar Bill was under consideration, I voted against the decision of
the House of Commons. The present Bill
is of an altogether different character. The
reason why I voted as I did last year was
that I believed that the Federal Parliament
had no right to impose its will upon an
autonomous or semi-autonomous province.
This year the situation is different. The
proposed measure gives the province the
right of self-determination, such as is laid
down by the Peace Treaty, and I feel that it
would be wrong to reject it. For the reasons which I have stated I will vote this
year in -the affirmative.
There was another reason why I voted in
the negative at last session. The Bill of
last session would have caused all the distilleries and breweries to be scrapped. This
year, by an amendment introduced in the
House of Commons, the vested rights of
those who have money invested in such
establishments are protected, and the breweries and distilleries are allowed to continue manufacturing for shipment outside
of Canada or to any province in Canada in
which beer, light wines or other liquors are
allowed to be handled.
Coming as I do from the original prohibition province, I feel that the sentiment is
overwhelmingly in favour of prohibition.
We must deprecate as I. do deprecate, the
extreme position taken by prohibitionists.
I believe that, especially for the labouring
man, beer should be allowed. In the old
days the workingmen who took their lunch
to their work could get a bottle of cool beer,
which helped them to eat their midday
meal in the hot days of summer.
Now this is all done away with. The working man bas now to eat his bread dry or
with water, something that I think is very
wrong. However, as this Bill is evidently
in harmony with the sentiment of a very

large proportion of the people of this coun-try, I will cast my vote in its favour.
Hon. Mr. MoSWEENEY: Are the people
of Prince Edward Island in favour of it?
Hon. 'Mr. MURPHY: Yes, nine-tenths of
them.
Hon. ROBERT WATSON: As the honourable gentleman has just said, the legislation of this year is changed from that of last
year, but I do not think it is changed in
the right direction to suit the people of
Canada. I think they would like to stop
the flow at the fountain head. Some honourable gentlemen objected to the legislation of last year because under it distilleries
were going to be scrapped. The people of
the country, if I understand their sentiments, want the distilleries scrapped, because they realize that it is, almost impossible to stop the sale of liquor until the
manufacture of it is stopped. In that respect our legislation is retrograding, for it
does not carry out the wishes of the people.
The temperance people throughout the
world have been attempting to bring about
world-wide prohibition. By this legislation
we are going to permit the distillers to
,make liquor to be shipped to other countries. World-wide prohibition is not going
to be secured by such legislation.
As I understand the Bill, it provides that
when the question is submitted to a province a majority carries prohibition. I do
not think that is going far enough. I think
that any law which is to be enforced by
fines and penalties should contain some
provision empowering a provincial legislature to say what majority it would require
in order to pass such legislation.
I supported the legislation of last year
and will support that of this year.
Hon. F. P. THOMPSON: Honourable gen-

tlemen, I had almost supposed that my

honourable friend was opposed te this legislation, because Lt did not suit the people
throughout the country. I think it is proper
that the Senate should remember what the
sentiment of the people throughout the
Dominion is and should pass whatever legislation may promote better conditions. The
expense in connection with the administration of the Scott Act was paid iby the
Dominion. We have the Scott Act in the
county of York, and I do not hesitate to say
that conditions in Fredericton have been
improved te a marked degree since we have
done away with the bar-rooms. Every time
the question bas come before the citizens
they have supported the Scott Act. I think

Routine proceedings.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 5.
FIRST READING.

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 44, an Act for granting to His Majesty certain sums of money
for the Public Service of the financial year
ending March 31, 1920.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the total
amount of the Supply Bill is $62,916,000.
Honourable members, in perusing the cQntents, will observe that the major portion,
almost the entire sum, is made up of two
items which are the outcome of the policy
of the Government regarding the demobilization of our forces.
One item is
$20,000,000, which will be advanced on behalf of the Soldiers' Land Settlement scheme.
The other is $40,000,000 for the purpose of
carrying out the recommendations contained in the report on the soldiers' civil
re-establishment. These two items absorb
$60,000,000 of the $62,000,000, leaving
$2,916,000 to be applied to the different
items contained in the Bill.
One of the other items refers to expenses
incurred in connection with the Civil Service Commission, which were provided for
in a Bill considered in this House and duly
passed. There is an item of $2,000,000, an appropriation which is to be applied to payment
for necessary supplies, food, clothing, fuel,
and fodder for animals in the provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the necessity for which grows out of the shortage of
the crop during the past year.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, this Bill provides for the voting
of a considerable amount of money at this
session of Parliament. If this were the only
session held this year the matter might not
be so serious; but as this is an extra session, the voting of $62,960,039 in addition
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

to what was voted last session, involves the
raising of a large sum of money by loan
or by taxation and increases the burdens
on the people of this country. Of course,
as my honourable friend bas pointed out,
the greater part of this amount is for the
purpose of dealing with soldiers' civil reestablishment, as recommended, in the report of the House of Commons Committee
which has been sitting for a long time and
has considered a number of the questions
which have been exercising the minds of
the public, and conditions which the soldiers generally have 'felt to constitute an
unfair hardship to them. I hope that the
report of the committee will result in satisfaction being given to theae men, and will
allay the unrest in the country which has
been brought about to soine extent by the
feeling that a large number of the men
who fought so well for us at the front and
did such good ifor their country have not
received at the hands of the Government
the treatment to which they consider themselves entitled. I trust that the vote that
is now being granted may help to a considerable extent in removing that diasatisfaction.
There is, further, an amount of $20,000,000 to provide for "advances to soldiers
settling upon the land, and cost of administering the Soldier Settlement Acts of 1917
and 1919, including clerical -assistance." I
forget what amount we voted at the end of
last session, but the two amounts together
will, I think, make a considerable total
advanced for this purpose. The question
has arisen in my mind whether this money
has been handled to the greatest advantage for the men, whom presumably it is
intended the money should benefit. Several complaints have been brought to my
attention at different times regarding the
Way the soldiers have been treated in their
attempt to locate on the land. In a large
number of cases it bas been felt that the
machinery provided for the distribution of
this money or for making a grant in a particulur case has permitted of a great deal
of delay, and in certain parts of the
province from which I come the feeling has arisen among returned soldiers that the machinery is to cumbersome, and that there is too much
red-tape in connection with this matter.
The result of that has been that in certain
cases the applicants have been delayed in
getting onto the land and getting settled in
a way that everybody il had been hoped and
intended by that they should. I do not know
that this is a place where we can very

temperance people required. But the temperance people are reasonable, and they
look upon this as a step in the right direction. That is why I approve of this legislation. The voice of the people at large, both
in Canada and The United States, to-day
stands for prohibition. I regret that there
is nothing that we can say in favour of
whisky. I have travelled for the last forty
years, and have seen many sad cases
caused by -whisky; but I have yet to see
the first case of sadness caused by prohibition.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: The people of
Ontario a few weeks ago pronounced their
opinion, by an overwhelming majority, in
favour of tempera.nce legislation. I am one

of those who believe in democracy-that
the voice of the people should be heard.
The people have asked for this legislation.
Let us show our willingness to give it.
One honourable gentleman a few moments
ago expressed regret that the workingman
could not procure bis ale or beer to take
with his dinner. Let me say that for bailf
the noney that the liquor costs he can
purchase a pint of milk.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:

Hon. Mr. WEBSTER:
have to go far to see how wine and beer
licenses work out. Just across the river
in Hull they tried out the wine and beer
license, and with what result? The mayor
says tha:t on the 15th of November the
municipality will go bone-dry. That is the
kind of man who ought to he mayor. He
bas the people behind him, and he will be
mayor again. Let us show our willingness
to subnit to the people; let us give them
this Bill as it bas been brought into the
House.
Hon. L. G. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, it is not my intention to enter into
the ierits of this case, but I wish to make
an observation or two on the line taken
by certain honourable gentlemen in this
House. Those honourable gentlemen, somewhat to my surprise, toolk the ground that
th, Senate should bow to the popular will,
and told us that the action of the Senate
last session would perhaps be found to be
the first step towards the abolition of this
House. I agree with the honourajble gentleman from Middleton who said that we
should do our duty courageously and firmly
without regard to the consequences, and

I think that is what the Senate is here
for. We are not here to he guided by what
takes place in the Commons, or by what we
may think is tihe popular feeling of the moment. One of the objects of having a
second Chamber is that temporary popular feeling may not lead the country into
errer.
Speaking of the action of the Senate last
session, an honourable gentleman suggested the danger of a conflict with the Commons. Doos any honourable gentleman
here really and sincerely believe that the
action -of the Senate last year, or the action
proposed by the amendment now before the
nlouse, is going to lead to a conflict with
the Commons? It is not, for honourable
gentlemen know, or feel satisfied, that the
inembers of the Commons last year really
rejoiced at the action of the Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No. no.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The members of the
Commons held that the burden of responsibility had been taken off their shoulders,
and, as a rule, were glad that the thing had
been done. A timid policy is always a
mistaken policy, in politics as in war; and
while one honourable gentleman, referred
to the large majority in favour of prohibition shown by the recent referendum in
the province of Ontario, I direct attention
to the fact that while there was a very
marked majority, there was a very large
and considerable minority.
Hon. W. D. ROSS: It was not one-sided.
Hon. Mr. POWER: At any rate, there
was a very considerable minority, and I
believe that if it had not been for the woman
vote the result of the referendum might
have been different. Do not misunderstand me, honourable gentlemen: I am not
finding any fault with the woman vote;
but we have to consider that.
As I said, I do not propose to go into the
merits of this Bill. I quite concur in what
bas been said by the honourable gentleman
from Middleton, and J also agree with the
view of the constitutional question taken by
the honourable gentleman from Cobourg
(Hon. Mr. Pringle).
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonell, the
debate was adjourned.
PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT.
The Hon. the SPEAKER read a communication from the Governor General's
Secretary announcing that His Excellency

profitably dis-cuss this. matter; but I wanted
to draw the attention of the minister to it,
because I think we ail desire that the men
Iwho want to go on the land shouid be piaced
on the land they select as. quickly as possible.
There is -another item here of $2,000,000
for Dominion lands and païks. This is
sùmilar to items that we have had to vote at
diifferent times for the purpose of relieving
the situation in the West, 'where the farmers
have, been suffering from unfavourable
weather conditions. 1 do not know whether
my honourabie friend is in a position te tell
us te what extent -the money voted in the
past bas been paid back into the treasury
of the -Government, or whether this $2,000,000, and I presume the furtheýr amount of
$450,000, which appears on the last page of
the Estimates, wiil eventuaily corne back te
the Government. This is a considerable
amount te pay out, and I presume the Government -wiii endeavour te provide that in
future years, when things are progressing
more favourably, the men who get assistance
in this way shahl, as far as they are able,
pay back the money inte the treasury.
There is a further item of $25,000, for the
purpose of defraying the expenses, of the
Canadian delegates and advisers te the International Labour Conference at Washington. I understood the Minister of Labour
the other day to say that so far this Conference has' flot been able to do very much
business because it was awaiting the arrivai
of delegatest fromn Europe. I have not seen
any statement as, to what bas been. dene;
but fromn the fact that this item appears in
the Estimates Rl presumne that the *Government considers that this Conference, if not
now proceeding, -wilil preceed within a very
short time, and that some derfinite conclusions wiil be arrived at. The questions to
be deait with there are of great importance,
not oniy te Canada, but te the whole worid.
One important question that the Conference
bas to deal *with relates to the hours of
labour in different countries. I have been
wondering whether the delegates. who went
toe Washington from thia, country have had
an opportunity of discussing this. question
among themselves.- I have also wondered
what position the delegates from Canada will
occupy in regard te other questions that wiii
arise. Hýave the delegates representing the
business class, the labouring class, and the
farming class, decidýd what line of action
they will take? If not, I -do flot thihnk there
la very much hope of the various representatives coming to any very definite conclusion, because they wîill be approaching the

il429

subWets iromn different points of view, and,
on account of speaking so many different
languages wiii have difficuity in grasping
each other's point of view. If my honourable friend can give us any information
regarding this Conference I think it would
3e, of great value to the House.
The other items in this Estimate are of an
ordinary nature, and are more or less connected with expenses that have been incurred by the calling together of the present
session.
I would again refer to the fact that in incurring these expenses, and in voting these
large sums of money, we are putting additionai burdens upon the people. A member of the Govern.ment in another place the
other day made the statement, if I understood him correctly, that we wouid require
a very large sum, I think some $700,000,000, for the purpose of carrying on the business of the country. When one considers
that our population ia flot very much more
than 8,000,000, that is an enormous amount.
At the present time the Government is trying to raise $300,000,000 by way of a boan
in this country. We of course hope they
wili be successful; but if the statement
made by a minister in another place is
accurate, the Government will very soon
have to go to the country for another boan,
unless they intend te raise the additional
amount by way of taxation. The ex-Minister
of Finance, before the committee of the
other House dealig 'with the question o!
the soldiers' civil re-estabiishment, said that
the Government could hardly hope, te increase taxation to any great extent, and
that if they did se they would be placing
upon the shoulders of the people a burden
which might be heavier than they couid
bear.
I do not wish to take up the time of the
House further than te express the hope
that the Government wili restrict expenditure in every possible way, s0 that we may
look forward to a more economical and
more careful administration of the finances
of the country in the future.
Hon. J. G. TUIRRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I notice an item of $276,000 for the
reorganization of the Printing Bureau. I
understand fromn the press that this amount
is iargeiy for the purpose of giving retiring
allowances te employees who are being dispensed with. I would suggest that the
Government see that no-ne of those who
have been drawimg salaries for the last
five te twenty yeargs, and who for years at

SENATE

430

a time have not been on duty, should not
be among those to receive this allowance.
With reference to the item of $2,000,000
in connection with seed grain advances, I
would ask whether the time has not come
when matters of that kind should be left
to the local governments. They are matters

which can be handled by them much better
than by the Dominion Government. The
Dominion Government sends a man out to
take charge; he knows nothing about the
business and bas to obtain whatever information he can. From my personal knowledge I can say that in years gone by a
great deal of seed grain was advanced to
men who had no right to it, and the officers
could not very well help themselves.
There is an item of $20,000,000 for soldiers'
land settlement. I am of the same opinion

that I expressed last year, that that is a
foolish expenditure. Last session, if I remember correctly, we voted $25,000,000;
and this session we are voting $20,000,000
more. I would suggest to the Government
that they go very carefully

in connection

with that particular item of expenditure.
In reference to the item of $40,000,000, I
am pleased to be able to congratulate the
Governmnent uoon the decision which they
have cone to with regard to the re-establishment of the soldier. I was glad to see
that the Government had the courage not
to be carried off their feet by the hotheads
who wanted a gratuity of $2,000 for every
man, thus adding to the burden of the
people of Canada. The action taken now is
the better action. The previous action in
giving a general gratuity, which bas cost
the country $153,000,000, was wrong. If a
gratuity had been given then such as is
proposed now, to help those who needed it,
you would have had better results. Thousands of men who got the gratuity have not
done a day's work since they got it, although there bas been work for every one,
and they could have got work, but they
would not take it. Now the gratuity ends,
and we shall have to deal with them. I
take second place to no man in my desire
to do the right thing for those who were
wounded and those who have suffered, and
for the relatives of those who have been
killed; but to give a general gratuity would
have beén folly, and any party that advanced such a proposal would have been
left behind, because the good sense of the
people will recognize that the Government

bas done plenty, and more than plenty, for
these

men.

tuities and assistance; and yet we hear some
of them claiming that they have not been
fairly treated. I say they are being fairly
treated, and more than fairly treated, and
I am glad that the Government have come
to the decision that they have come to, and
that the expenditure in gratuities to returned soldiers bas probably ended.
Hon. GEO. H. BRADBURY: I desire to
say a word or two with regard to the Estimate of $25,000 for coal operations. I should
like to draw the attention of the House for
just a moment to a report made by a gentleman sent out by the Interior Department
to investigate coal lands in the West. In
speaking of the Hoppe leases, he says:
There is ample evidence of an abundance of
coai, net one or two seams but many of them,
aIl of workable thickness and no doubt of a
high grade. Regarding the quality of the coal,
I will advise yeu later when the results of the
analyses are known.
This coal area is perhaps the most extensive
unexploited deposits In Canada to-day. In the
meantime the country does not require this coai.

I .should like to draw the attention of the
House to the phrasing of this clause.
In the meantime the country does not require
this coal. Any shortage in the past has been

any lack of that commodity.

last year, the greatest in point of production,
only 6,000,000 were mined.
I believe, therefore, that the coal of the
Smoky River district is net required just now,
and that the mines now In operation in this

province are amply able to take care of the

market.

If the Government is to continue and extend
operation of a National system of railways, it
will require coal reserves of its own. Even if
it does not operate its railroads, I believe it
would be in the interests of conservation to set
aside this block for future use. When the time
arrives that this coal is required for domestie
and industrial purposes,-and it will net be required for many years-the Government, if it so
desired, would then be able to dispose of it at a
handsome figure. In the meantime, I believe it
would be a wise and proper measure to make
a coal reservation-

In spite of the fact that this gentleman,
who bas just come from the West, makes
this report, stating that this coal is not
necessary, but that the coal of the Drumheller and other mines can supply all that is
needed, I find one of the wesitern members,
Mr. E. E. Myers, of Kindersley, referring
to this item, and inquiring if the director
is at work now, and stating that many

to the Chamber for determination. More
than a generation ago the principle on
which this Bill is founded was introduced
and incorporated into a law which was
placed upon the statute-book and is known
as the Canada Temperance Act. Hence it
cannot be said that the Government in introducing this Bill has submitted a new
principle requiring the further consideration of the Parliament of Canada. The Can.
ada Temperance Act has been amended from
time to time. It has been in force, I think,
in every province of the Dominion; and,
while opinions may vary as to whether it
has been successful or not, it has been
retained upon the statute-book and is to-day
the chief temperance legislation in this Dominion. A generation ago the desire for
prohibition had not become as articulate as
it is to-day. There has been a wonderful
growth in the sentiment respecting prohibition. In the course of time progressive
legislation has been passed by the Dominion Parliament and the legislatures of the
various provinces along the lines followed
in the Bill. At the time the Canada Temperence Act was passed it was not thought
desirable to foist that legislation upon an
entire province, but to apply it to counties,
or groups of counties, or to the areas specified in the Act. As time went on and sentiment in favour of prohibition increased,
we saw the propriety or wisdom of applying
this legislation to larger districts or areas.
Consequently to-day the different provinces
ot Canada have manifested a desire that,
instead of the Canada Temperance Act applying to linited areas, as it does under the present law, it should be
extended to the wider area of a province.
So this legislation is not of a radical character, but is such as I think every intelligent man must necessarily approve. InTHIRD READING.

from the country. If the money were lying
about the streets and the Government had
nothing to do but pick it up, I could understand .it; but these enormous sums have
to be squeezed out of the working people
of this country-and practically all our
people are working people-and I think we
should have some little consideration for
them -and not bestow all our consideration
on the returned soldiers.
There is one item to which I desire to refer. It does not appear here as a separate
item, but from the report of the proceedings
in another place it appears that a considerable sum of money is to be practically
contributed to the Imperial Treasury; it is
to be paid to the men who enlisted in the
Imperial Army. Why should Canada pay
for those men?

Canada.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Is it not the duty of
the British Government to do whatever is

Canada, witb ber small population and
comparatively small income, be called upon
to contribute to the support of the Imperial
forces? I think Canada bas done remarkably well in raising over 400,000 men, paying their way across the ocean, and paying
for their services at the front; and I think
this further payment is highly objectionable We should be a little businesslike,
and I must say I do not think that in dealing with the returned soldiers the Government or Parliament has shown very much
business capacity.

we have had an opportunity to go into
this Bill and discuss it and judge it as
we ought to judge such an important measure.
The honourable member from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner), ever since he came into this House, seems to have been haunted
with the fear that some day he might give
an independent judgment on something
and forthwith be abolished. Il this House
is to degenerate into a rubber stamp, for
ifear of being abolished, the sooner it is
wiped off the face of God's earth, as being
of less use than any dunghill, the better
it will be for the country. I have functions
to discharge here, and I am going to discharge them, despite any threats from outside this House, no matter from what source
they come. It is perfectly useless to tell
me that this House will be abolished if
this Bill is .postponed until next session.
The honourable gentleman from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Foster) observed that the whole
temperance sentiment of thie country was
behind the Bill, as if that settled .the question. Even if that is so, there are other
people in the country, and they have a
right to be heard. In Ontario, although
prohibition carried, there was a very heavy
vote against it. As a matter of fact, the
opinions of the temperance people themselves are not unanimous in regard to this
Bill.
I have documentary evidence of that lack
of unanimity, and it is for the purpose of
reading that evidence more than for anything edse that I have risen. This letter,
which is from the Rev. Benjamin Spence,
also throws light upon Bill 27, which is
coming up. After I read it, I think that
honourable gentlemen who have spoken
against the postponement of the Bill will
have very good grounds for changing their
minds and agreeing that it should stand
until next session. Mr. Spence's letter is
written to Mr. Porter, a member of the
House of Commons, and says:
Toronto, November 8, 1919.
E. G. Porter, M.P.,
Parliament Buildings,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir:
Permit me te respectfully call your attention
te some features of the proposed temperance
legisiation as embodied in Bill 26 now before
Parliament, which are of very grave importance
te us in the province of Ontario and indeed,
in every province where a provincial prohibitory
law is in operation, aise te the tremendous importance and significance of the present Dominion situation.
Were a license condition existent in the provinces and were the last part of the second
paragraph of subsection 4 of section 154 eliminHon. Mr. ROSS.

ated, then the Bill would be commendable as
substituting a form of prohibition for license.
We face the fact however that in eight of the
nine provinces of Canada laws are now in
force prohibiting the liquor traffic practically
te the full extent of provincial power.
Any
Dominion legielation therefore, must be considered in the light of these provincial laws
and with a clear understanding of the exact
effect of such legislation upon these laws and
their administration.
It is generally accepted that, where there Is
concurrent jurisdiction of the Dominion and
province and over-lapping legislation, as in
regard te the prohibition of the sale of liquer,
and
Dominion legislation takes precedence
supersedes the provincial law. A case in point
is the present Canada Temperance Act. Where
that Act is now in force in Ontario, the Ontario
Temperance Act is net operative.
The Dominion Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction regarding the manufacture, importation
Se
and inter-Provincial shipment of liquor.

wholly with manufacture and importation It
does net Infringe upon Provincial law. Regarding the sale of liquor there le admittedly

parisen of this section with section 40 of the
Ontario Temperance Act shows a marked similarity in purport and its enactment would at
once open the way te serious complications, inasmuch as there does net seem te be any other
or further safeguarding clause In this Bill.
With Bill 26 in force, could a person be
prosecuted under the Ontario Temperance Act
for the Illicit sale of liquor? It would appear
net. And if this section of the Ontario Temperance Act is superseded or set aside, what
about other sections of the Ontario Temperance
Act that are closely related te section 40? Many
sections that now are important and helpful
because they are complementary te section 40
would become nugatory.
Then other questions arise in connection with
the exemptions provided for by sub-section 4

carriage, transportation, sale

or agreeing te sell li<uor for sacramental, medicinal, manufacturing or commercial purposes.
Compare this with subsection 3 of section 41
of the Ontario Temperance Act. They cover
the same ground.
The Ontario Temperance Act further contains exceedingly stringent and complete provisions by which liquor may be obtained for
the purposes provided in sub-section 3 of section 41. If the main section is set aside, are
net the subsidiary sections aise practically
nullified? If se, where are we at in regard te

Act, for Bill 26 dees net in any detail make

Does this conflict of jurisdiction

NOVEMI3ER 10. 191943
These provisions cover the aame ground as do
similar provisions of the Ontario Temperance
Act, and thereore no doubt take precedence
over the enforcement sections of that Act. Are
we net re-opening at once the whole old difficulty of enforcement which existedl ln the Scott
Act days in the -province of Ontario, and invitinz sirnilar chaotic conditions?
Indeed, la there nlot grave danger of vexations
and prolonged litigation involving these and
other constitutional questions that will prevent
the effective administration of the law s0 essen.
tial te good resuits from measures of this kind?
The Ontario Temperance Act indeed the Provincial law in each province centaine enforcenment -provisions, prevides penalties and enforcement niachinery particularly adapted to local
conditions ln the province to which they apply.
If these are set aside and the provincial authorities are cailed upon to enforce an inferior and
less suitable Dominion 'Iaw which practically
repeala their own leg'islation, will there be the
sanie enthusiasm .and earnestness in enforcement
or as good resuits as would obtain were the
provincial authorities working with their own
laws, and using their own enforcement machinery?
cfrankly, the Bill. as it now stands does net
seem to at ail ment the need of the situation
and even if passedl by the Dominion Parliaiment
is not such that any province would Ïbe likely
to put it into foroe.
While the door would lie shut dloser ln regard
to the Importation of liquor for beverage purposes, which, will be a serious evil If war-time
prohibition lapses, In other regards it would lie
thrown wider open. That together with the
legal doubte that -are involved would mean that
we would probably lose on the one hand as
much as we would gain on the other. The
intention of the Bill is undoubtedly good, but
the provisions seem to be faulty and impracticable.
This Bill could be very easily amendefi by
simbly maklng provision that would prohibit
the shipment of liquor from any -province Into
another province to any persen net entitled by
the laws of that province to selI the sanie.
The effect of this in Ontario would be that
the only legal consignese of shipments of liquor
would be the chief Government vendor ef the
province who would then have isole control of
the distribution of liquor for perniittedl purposes
within the province. The prohibitive, restrictive
and enforcement provisions of the Ontario
Temperance Act would then remain intact, and
the werk of administering the law greatly aided.
Sucli an amendment would apply ln an equally
helpful way in every ether province.
If this were done and provincial Gevernments
were given direct power te brIng the provisions
of the Act into force ln such a way as theY
might determine, then two main objections to
the Bill would disappear.
Bill No. 26 as it now stands really ls not
adequate or satisfactory at the present juncture.
It is not ln harmony with the united. and expressed desires of the temperance -people of
Canada. The cumbersome and tedious methods
reQuired for bringing its provisions Inte force

and the Hon. C. J. Doherty, the Minister of

Commons te hear the objections and arguments
of the Citizens' Lîierty Lague against the contemplated legislation. On Tueasday, the 28th of
October. the League were notifted ln the following words .by the Acting Premier:-

SENATE
'As intimated to you on Friday, it does not
seem possible to arrange for a Committee of the
House to hear a delegation from the Citizens'
Liberty League, among other reasons owing to
the near approach of the end of the Session."
The League desire to point out that through
the appointment of a Committee of the House of
Commons they would have been afforded an
opportunity of presenting their views, arguments
and objecions to this legislation, and it was
their intention, had such a committee been appointed, to have a large delegation of business
and professional men from different parts of
this province attend to express to the committee
their views with regard to such legislation, and
we now petition you to at least refer these Bills
back so that a Committee of the H'ouse of Commons may be appointed to give an opportunity
to the League and its members of voicing their
objections to this legislation which may interfere greatly with the personal rights of a large
portion of Ontarlo's citizens.
In addition to the above, we desire to be
permitted to point out that the rights of even a
minority, especially where these .rights are personal, should not by any Parliament be interfered with, unless the reason therefor is grave
and important ; and further, in the opinion of
the League, the British North America Act
does not contemplate such legislation, but empowers the Federal Parliament to pass legislation which shall be applicable not solely to one
part of the Dominion, nor to a particular class,
but shall be of general application throughout
the entire Dominion. It will be contended that
the legislation particularly asked in these Bills
is in direct contravention of Section 121 of the
British North America Act in that it purports
to prevent the produce and manufacture of one
or more provinces from being exported to another province and thereby interferes with interprovincial trade.
Then again it is urged that such legislation
amounts to the delegating to a provincial electorate by the Federal Parliament of the legislative duties cast upon the Federal Parliament by
the British North America Act, as same is initiated by a resolution from a provincial legislature bringing the Act within the decision
lately made in the Privy Council regarding the
Initiate and Referendum Act of Manitoba, and
it is contended that the contemplated legislation
is beyond the authority of the Federal Parliament.
For this and other reasons we humbly petition
that in the interest of justice and for the protection of the personal rights and liberties of
the citizens of this country you refuse your
ratification of these BIls.
And your petitioners will ever pray.
On behalf of the Citizens' Liberty League,
H. A. Machin, President.
T. L. Carruthers, General Secretary.

That is the whole case iso far as I am
-concerned. According to the temperance
people, the Bill is important; but it is
clearly not satisfactory. Therefore I feel
that I ought to insist upon my motion that
the Bill stand over until next session.

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Comimittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
On section 1, new section 152-upon receipt of resolution of Legislative Assembly
or of Yukon Council requesting vote on
prohibition of importation of liquors, the
Governor in Council may issue proclamation:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will the
conrmittee permit me to bring Mr. Gisborne within the bar?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can the honourable
leader of the Government tell us on what
basis the Government decided to adopt the
proposal to put this Bill into effect on receipt of a resolution of the legislative assembly of any province? Would it not have
been better, if they really wanted to put
this legislation into effect, to have taken
a proposal made by the executive council,

NOVEMBER 10, 1919
which is sitting all the year round? The
members are -always in office. If you have
to wait for a resolution of the legislative
assembly, you must wait until the assembly
meets, and in that way it miglit take a
much longer time before 'the resolution
could be passed and the Act put into operation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
more expressive than a resolution of the
executive of the province. That is the only
thing I can say.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Would it not be well
to extend the tlme for taking the ballot?
Paragraph b says the time shall be from
9 o'clock in the forenoon until 5 o'clock in
the afternoon. It seems to me you ought to
make some provision in this Bill whereby
everybody will have an opportunity to vote.
For instance, in urban districts, when a
vote is being itaken, it is jperhaps inconvenient for men to get off from their work
to record their vote during working heurs.
The principle of extending to 9 o'clock at
night the trne for receiving votes in urban
districts has been adopted in the case of
provincial elections. I think 'that is worth
considering.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The hours
provided in this. Bill are practically those
adopted by municipalities, and, I think,
under the Election Act of each province. It
would be undesirable, it seems to me, to
depart from the well-established hours.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: In cities and urban
di'stricts the polls are open, I think, until 9
o'cleck.
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHKED: If it is
found hereafter that the time for polling
is inconvenient, it will be an easy matter
to amend the laxw in a detail of this kind.
It would be very undesirable to aimend it
at the present moment. I do not know
that 'the Commons will be in session when
we pass this Bill.
New section 152 was agreed to.
New section 152 A was agreed to.
'On nerw section 153-proceedings thereafter

Part Il of Canada Temperance Act into

Hon. MR. WATSON: Honourable gentlemen, I wish te repeat here the suggestion I
have already made, that in a matter of this

437

kind there ought to be a majority of more
than one-half of the total vote in faveur cf
the measure. Any law of this description
that is to be enforced by fines and penalties
ought to have behind, it, it seems to me, a
very strong public sentiment; otherwise
there is a disrespect for the law-not only
for this law, but also for others. -I suppose
it is of no use to suggest an amendment; we
expect the Governor to arrive in a few
minutes; but I do submit that a law of this
kind> should, be approved by more than 50
per cent of the voters.
New section 153 was agreed to.
New sections 154 and 155 were agreed te.
On new.section 156-revocation of prohibition:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: As l understand this
Bil, if prohibition is adopted in a province
it will remain in force for three years, and
after that an appeal may be made to. the
Secretary of State to have another vote
taken in order to see whether the people are
still in favour of it or not. Is that the intention?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
must be a poll to repeal it. The repeal is
brought about by practically the same
machinery as that for the adoption of prohibition.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: And if prohibition
is to be repealed must there be a further
resolution of the legislative assembly?
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; it
is done on the initiative of the legislative
assembly.
New section 156 was agreed to.
Section 2 of the Bill was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported.
THIRD READING.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Bill was read the third time and passed;
INTOXICATING LIQUORS BILL.
FIRST READING.

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 27, an Act to amend
an Act in aid of Provincial Legisilation Prohibiting or Restricting the Sale or Use of
Intoxicating Liquors.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.

SENATE

438

Honourable gentlemen, in 1916
passed certain legislation supthe powers of the provinces,
its objects the prohibiting or
restricting of the sale of intoxicating
liquors. In 1917 we amended the legislation of 1916. Experience is a very satisf4ctory teacher in matters of this kind.
It has been found that the legislation of
1916 and 1917 did not go far enough. Each
Province has had opportunity to give effect
to the legislation we then enacted, and it
has now been represented to the Government that it is necessary to go farther than
we did on those two occasions. It is therefore proposed to extend the law so as to
prevent the manufacture of liquor that
would be used in violation of the provincial
law. The Bill before us, which practically
supplements the authority that a province
can exercise, includes a manufacturing
clause. Another clause, namely, section 2,
provides that if any designing person ships
liquor into a province for the purpose of
violating the law of that province, such
person may be prosecuted. Honourable
gentlemen will doubtless recall that when
similar legislation was before the Senate
in 1916, the Senate disapproved of the
clause w-hich was then imported into the
Bill, because of the absence of safeguards
in the matter of prosecutions. The former
Bill provided that the offender might be
brought into the province into which the
liquor was imported. It is now proposed
that no prosecution shall be brought against
a person outside of a province in which he
is, except <with the approval of the attorney general of the province in which the
prosecution is to take place. I think the
necessity for securing the consent of the
attorney general is a sufficient safeguard.
If it is sought to prosecute any one shipping
liquor into the province interested, the attorney general of that province may insist
upon a prima facie case being made out.
It is thought that with this safeguard added
there can be no objection to the provision
which the Senate formerly rejected.
He said:

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I do not know whether it is of any
use my repeating the remarks that I have
:already made to-day with regard to legislation being brought down in this way,
right at the end of the session, when we
have no tirme at all to examine it. We have
just had a vote from which it appears
that the members of this House do not support me in that contention, and I do not
suppose there is any use in saying anyHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

thing further on the subject; but I do personally very strongly object to the Government bringing down legislation within a
few hours, even a few minutes, of prorogation, and asking us to pass it.
As my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) has said, one of these clauses
at any rate was previausly before this
Chamber, and we objected very strongly
to the Government placing on the statute
book such a clause, which would permit of
a man being brought all the way from Nova
Scotia right out to British Columbia, even
up to the Yukon, to be put on trial there.
Then, having been acquitted, he could be
left there to find his way back home as he
was best able.
The leader of the Government has said
that there is a change in this Act to the
effect that application bas to be made to
the Attorney General of the province; but
to my mind it is not clear as to where the
application has to be made to bring a man
say from Nova Sceotia te British Columbia.
Probably we can get more information on
that point when we are in Committee of the
Whole. I think it is objectionable to bring
a man across the continent and put him to
the expense of a prosecution of this kind.
I am as much opposed to this clause as I
was on a previous occasion, when I voted
against it.
Hon,. W. B. ROSS: This Bill looks very
innocent on its face. Really it is not. It is
very far-reaching, and involves an entirely
new principle. Any member of the House
who will look at chapter 19 of 1916 will see
that 'that legislation -was, meant to protect
the provincial legislation, or to supplement
it if you like. The position itaken by the
two Houses of Parliament at that time was
that they would allow the provinces to legislate within their own boundaries, as their
powers were defined and settled by the
Privy Corncil; but Parliament said: "If any
one outside the province, over whom you
have no jurisdiction to legislate, proceeds
to violate your law or to assist other people
in violating your law, we will come to your
assistance." The two things, the provincial
legislation plus what is commonly known
as the Doherty Act, covered the temperance situation, and worked pretty well. The
Dominion let the provinces work out their
own salvation.
This Bill lets the Dominion into the
provinces. Chapter 19 of 1916 deals with
a person selling, and so on, "knowing or
intending that such intoxicating liquor will
or shall be thereafter dealt with in viola-

NOVEMBER 10, 1919
flou of the law of the province into which
such intoxicating liquori & 6ent shipped,"
and so on. That legisiation is confineçl altogether to what is doue outside the province.
This Bill says:
Any person who manufactures any Intoxicating Ufquor knowing or intendIng that such Intoxicattng liquor will or shall be thereafter
dealt with ln violation of the. law of the. province in whlcii such intoxicating liquor la manufaetured.
Ail prior legisiation was directed against
the man manufacturing liquor outside a
province, knowing or intending that it was
to go into the province. Now the Dominion
atep~ lu and overrides the provincial 1egislatures. *The provinces have jurisdiction ta
deal with that question themselves; 'but the
Dominion steps in and interferes with the
provincial legisiatures-the very thing that
Mr. Spence points out. That seems a very
small thing, but next year it will be somethting else; andc piece by piece the provincial legielature will be altogether des4royed.
This legislation is altogether at variance
with the weil-stated opinion of Parliament
wlien it came to a conclusion with regard
to the so-called Doherty Act. When the
provinces had jurisdiction we let them
handle mattera themselvee; where they were
handicapped by lack of jurisdiction we gave
theïm the Doherty Act to help them out.
I think the Hlouse sehould adhere to the
position that we took iu 1916, and flot agree
to this section.
Section 2 of this Bill is an old friend.
This ITousel in 1916 refused to entertain
sueh a proposition. Under this section a
man in the- city of Ottawa may be accused
by a man in the Klondyke of having sold
a bottle of whisky to hlm in the city of
Ottawa, knowing that lie was going to take
il. to the Klondyke- The man muking the
accusation may be a man of eharacter or a
man of no character. A warrant can be
isaued in the Klondyke, and the man from
Ottawa, whetlier he is guilty or not, can
be takeu out there. A stipendiary magietra te has to decide wha is to ha believed.
You eau see liow the man from Ottawa is
handicapp.ed. He is -the person charged,
anJ hoe cannot have what every British
citiz~en bas' beau entitled .ta since Magna
EJharta, the, right to lie fried by bis pears.
H'ow oan lie take wituesses ae to his good
character away up there, unies s lhe is a
very ricli ménP It ias antirely out o the
question for him. to do so. There is nô one
to whom the stipendiary magistrate can
appeal. as to the man's character. What
wjuld be the result? The trial would be a

439

farce. Even if the accused were f ound not
guilty, what would become o! himP The
temperance people tell you that they do
not care what becomes of him-that lie can
foot it home.
Hou. Mr. DENNIS: What about the protection that lie Sets froxu the Attorney
General?
Hou Mr. BOSS: I have not yet corne
to that phase of the question. Theposition
to-day le this: il a charge of 'selling liquor
is made by a maxi in the Kiondyke against
a man in Ottawa, the Minister o! Justice
can put the accused on trial here, and, if
the evidence warrants it, can have hlma convicted. That was regarded by this Hous
as being satis4actory. But now the matter
comnes back again in another form.
In temperance, as in some other thiugs,
the more zealous people become, the more
intolerant and tyrannical they are. The
temperance people want to have a mani
hauled from. one and of the Dominion to
the other iu order to be tried. Why are
they flot content witi liaving him tried
wliere lie lves, andc wliere lie lias committeid
the offenee? Why turu the criminal law
upside.down? It is not doue in auy other
casa, except perhaps in tha case o! tre ason
wlien the country ia in danger. They want
a law under which a man can be taken
from. Toronto to Nova Scotia, no-t by leave
of the Attorney General o! Ontario, wliere
this provision miglit be some protection to
hlm, but by leave cf the Attorney General
o! Nova Scotia. As a matter of fact, these
temperance zealots cati make charges and
get the consent o! the Attorney Genaral as
a matter of course. Wb'at intereet lia& the
Attorney General, or how is lie going to
withstand a deputation, ;headed perliaps

thie mari a thousand miles away. Thay say:
" He sold a bottie o! whisky iutendinýg
thet it should be drunk down liere. Get
hlma down liera: that la the way we wil
smash these tjiings." It is au a ttempt to
establisli a tyranny aud autocracy that I
venture te, say was neyer practîsad in
Russia lu tlie time of the Czar-lt may have
been ln the time of Trotsky and Lenine. I

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Sena.te went into committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Thompson in the Chair.
On section 1-manufacturing intoxicants,
knowing, etc., that they are to be unlawfully used forbidden:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have not had an
opportunity to compare this Bill with the
Act to which my honourable friend from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) referred. I
think the honourable leader of the Government should give us information as to
this change and what it means.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: J do not
know that I can explain to my honourable friend more clearly than by the language need in the clause itself. It makes
any intoxicatillegal the manufacture cMf
ing liquor by any person "knowing or intending that such intoxicating liquor will
or shall be thereafter dealt with in violation of the law of the province in which
such intoxicating liquor is manufactured."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But my diffliculty
is that I cannot get a copy of the statutes
to compare this amendment with the law of
1916, which is referred to in it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
.amendment is a substantive clause added
to the existing legislation. It simply prohibits the manufacture of liquor in a province to be used illegally in that province.
It does not exclude the manufacture of
liquor for purposes outside that province;
Hon. Mr. ROSS.

that is to say, for shipment to where the
liquor can be legally used or consumed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The Act of 1916, as
it stands, will allow the manufacture of
liquor in a province?
H.on. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Act
of 1916 does not deal with the manufacture
of liquor.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does not deal with
it at all?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, simply with importation and sale.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2--prosecution may be where
intoxicants were unlawfully sent, etc., or
where accused resides, but no prosecution
against a person outside of province in
which he is except with approval of Attorney General of province:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I wish to move that the words " such
province " at the end of that section be
struck out and that these words be inserted: " the province in which the accused resides."
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Hear, hear. That
is plain-as plain as A, B, C.
The amendment of Hon. W. B. Ross was
negatived: yeas, 13; nays, 13.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3--forfeiture of liquor, etc.,
seized under Act and not claimed, etc.:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
the same clause that we inserted in former
Bills.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
that this section, known as the sacramental
clause, be added at the end of the Bill:
The said Act is amended by adding thereto
the following section:
Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid
the selling or causing to be sold, or the manufacture or the sending, shipping, taking, bringing or carrying, or the causing to be sent,
shipped, taken, brought or carried, into any
province from or out of any other province, or
the importation into any province from any
place outside of Canada, of any intoxicating
liquor for sacramental or medicinal purposes
or for manufacturing or for commercial purposes other than for the manufacture or use
thereof as a beverage.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is there a similar provision in the old Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, but
there is in Bill 26.

Honourable Gentlemen of the Benate:
Gentlemen of th&e House of commons:

In relieving you from further attendance on

this session, I thank You for the diligence and

qfficiency with which you have dlscharged your
dptles.

Measures of great significance and importance
have engaged your attention.
The Treaty of Peace concluded by the A1113d
and Associateci Powers with Germany and
slgned at Versailles on the 28th June, 1919, and
the Treaty of Peace between the same Powers
and the Repflblc of Austria, signed at St.
Germain-en-Laye on the lOth September, 1919,

M4

SENATE

have been presented to you and have receîved
your approval.
These Treaties having now been approved by
Germany and Austria, on the one hand, and by
at least three of the Allied and Associated
Powers on the other hand, await only the exchange of ratifications to enter into fuil force
and effect.
1 fervently trust that the provisions of these
Treaties, marklng as they do the termination
of hostilities, may usher in for humanlty an era
in which great wars may be prevented and the
blessings of world peace effectually secured.
Canada bore a large part in the operations
of the war and contributed notably to Its successful completion, and it is therefore gratlfying to be able to note the distinguished Position
accorded to hier in the conduct of the negotiations in the Peace Conference at Paris.
The visît of Bis Royal Highness the Prince
of Wales to Canada has been a source of deep
and widespread satisfaction.
The universai
welcome which has been extended to him is an
evidence of the devotion of the Canadian people
to the Throne and to British institutions. This
welcome, so whole-hearted mn character, Is an
undoubted tribute to the high personal character
and qualities of Bis Royal Highness, who, in
peace as in war, has closely identified himself
with Canada, and shown his earnest desire to
promote the welfare of the people of this
Dominion.
The acquisition of the Grand Trunk properdies and their addition to the existing national
railways will materlally promote the successful
and economic administration of the whole systemn, and greatly aid In the solution of the
important problems of Canadian transport.
The adoption of the report of the Committee
of the Bouse of Commons on Bill No. 10 will
extend the scope and application of the Important measures already taken for meeting the
needs of returned soldiers and their dependents.
The adoption of the Classification of the Civil
Service of Canada will make it possible for the

Commission to proceed at once with the further
organization of the Service.
The success which bas greeted the Inauguration of the Victory Loan la a tribute to the
patrlotjsmi andi organlzing capacity of Canadian
business men, and fully demonstrates the determination and readiness of the country to fulfil
its obligations to its soldiers, maintain the credit
of Canada, and strengthen Its trade position.
In a survey of the economie and social
conditions throughout the world, it is satisfactory to note that Canada's position compares
favourably with that of any other country and
is far more favourable than most. With the
accordant action of labour and capital, aided
as It has been by the Industrial Conference
lately held, and with the continued application
of our people to productive pursuits, accompanied by rigid adherence to thrif t and saving,
we can face the coming years of reconstruction
and adjustnient with hopeful confidence.
Gentlemen of the House of Commons:
1 thank you for the provisions made for the
public service along the Unes of reconstruction
and aid for the returned soldiers.
Honourable Gentlemen of' the Seaate:
Gentlemen o>' the House of' Commons:
I devoutly pray that Almighty God may incline our minds to sane and prudent counsels,
may inspire all our people with the will to
work and to save, and continue the blessîngs
of peace and prosPerity within our borders.

The Speaker of the Senate then isaid:
It is Bis Excellency the Governor General's
will and pleasure. that this Parliament bie prorogued until Saturday, the 2Oth day of Decemnber
next, to be here holden, and thîs Parliamient is
accordingly prorogued until Saturday, the 2Oth
day of December next.
