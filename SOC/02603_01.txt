lective defence and in the close collaboration

My Government will continue to contribute
to the development of the Commonwealth
ties which are of major importance to the free
world and to the improvement of relations
between the continents. My Prime Minister
will attend the forthcoming Conference of
Commonwealth Prime Ministers which will
discuss, among other things, the expansion of
trade and the establishment of a Commonwealth secretariat.
My ministers attach great importance to
Canada's neighbourly relationship with the
United States and to the development of
practical, mutually beneficial arrangements
within that relationship. You will be asked to
approve a resolution concerning the important
agreement on the automobile industry recently
concluded with the United States.
Members of the House of Commons:
My ministers believe that it is imperative
to reform the procedures of the House of
Commons in order that it may accomplish the
large volume of work required to meet the
needs of the Canadian people in modern
times. My ministers therefore will submit to
you proposals for reform, based both on the
valuable work of your committee on procedure and organization and on my Government's study of the procedures which, in the
Parliaments at Westminster and elsewhere,
have enabled effective debate and criticism
to be combined with effective dispatch of
public business.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
My ministers will continue their policy of
promoting the strength and unity of the Canadian Confederation. This policy has made
possible the achievement and reinforcement
on a nation-wide basis of programs, in pensions and in other fields, which would not
have been attainable but for better procedures
of consultation and concerted action with due
regard for the federal character of our country. My ministers will continue to improve
the procedures and practices involved in the
federal relationship so that all Canadians may
feel equally served by Confederation.
After the appropriate provincial concurrence has been signified, you will be asked
to approve an Address to the Queen to provide that the Constitution of Canada may be
amended in Canada by the procedures which
have been agreed between my Government
and the Governments of all the Provinces.

April 5, 19,65

You will be asked to authorize my Government to provide that "O Canada" shall be
the National Anthem of Canada and that
"God Save the Queen" shall be recognized as
the Royal Anthem in Canada.
Our country is achieving a high rate of
economic growth. Trade is expanding. With
growing industrialization, Canadians are enjoying rapidly increasing employment opportunities; incomes and living standards are
rising; the number of people out of work has
been reduced to lower levels than for many
years.
All the great potentialities of our economy
are not, however, being realized. The talents
of some of our people are wasted because
of poverty, illness, inadequate education and
training, inequality in opportunities for work.
To combat these problems, to improve the
opportunities of people who are now at a
disadvantage, is to put new power into
economic expansion and to enhance the unity
of our country.
My Government therefore is developing a
program for the full utilization of our human
resources and the elimination of poverty
among our people. It will include improved
measures for regional development, the reemployment and training of workers, the redevelopment of rural areas, the assistance of
needy people, the renewal of areas now
blighted and congested in our cities, and the
establishment of new opportunities for young
Canadians. Besides strengthening and broadening measures within the federal sphere of
responsibility, the plan will be designed to
concert them more effectively with provincial
programs. Because of the importance of this
plan, my Prime Minister will take direct
responsibility for its co-ordination, assisted by
a special secretariat. My Government will
propose the calling of a special federalprovincial conference to seek full co-operation
and co-ordination with policies of the
provinces.
As one of the major elements in this plan,
my Government's area development program,
which has already been of substantial assistance to industrial expansion in areas of high
unemployment, will be expanded, in consultation with the provinces, to other areas where
incomes are low. You will be asked to approve measures to aid industrial expansion
in these areas and to help people to take
full advantage of such improved employment
opportunities.
My government will also propose improved
measures to assist the re-employment of
workers displaced by automation or affected

April 5, 1965

Apri 5. 995SENATE
DEBATES

by other economie changes. These measures
to develop our country's human resources will
include grants and boans for workers moving
to new jobs, improved training programns in
industry, extended vocational services particularly for the longer-term unemployed, and
an expanded programn for agricultural manpower. These measures will be taken in cooperation with management and labour and,
where appropriate, in conjunction with the
provinces.
You will be asked to approve the creation
of a fund for rural economjc development
and, in order to provide for fuller integration of action for rural development, amendments to the legisiation regarding ARDA
wiIl be placed before you.
You wiil be asked to approve the establishment of a Company of Young Canadians,
through which the energies and talents of
youth can be enlisted in projects for economic and social development both in Canada
and abroad.
After further discussions between my Government and the provinces, you will also be
asked to enact a measure to establish a
Canada Assistance Plan, providing for federal sharing in the cost of comprehensive
programs under which people can be assisted
on the basis of their need.
My Government believes that public policy should be directed to improving the
quality of health services and to ensuring
that all Canadians can obtain needed health
care, irrespective of their ability to pay.
Accordingly my Government will at an early
date meet with the goverunents of the provinces in order to discuss with them the way
in which federal and provincial action can
most effectively contribute to programns that
will provide health services to Canadians on
a comprehensive basis.
My Government will propose the re-establishment of a special committee of the House
of Commons on food and drugs, and will
facilitate its work with the aim of reducing
the prices paid by the public for drugs.
My Government is developing new policies
to enable farmers generally to achieve larger
and more reliable incomes so that their living and working standards will be comparable to those enjoyed in other sectors of our
economy. You will be asked to consider
measures of special assistance to the family
farm in both eastern and western Canada.
My Government's recent action to raise
the incomes of dairy farmers will be followed by a comprehensive measure to make
possible the development, in co-operation
22624-là

with the provinces, of new national poJicies
for major farmn products, lncluding the establishment of a Canadian Dairy Commission.
Action will be taken to improve the movement and marketing of feed grain in eastern
Canada and British Columbia.
In order to raise the level of income of
Canadian fishermen, a measure will be
placed before you to provide for an expanded
national fisheries development program.
In order to improve the position of veterans, you will be asked to approve measures to amend the Veterans' Land Act, the
Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act, the War Veterans' Allowance Act
and the Army Benevolent Fund Act.
A measure will be placed before you to
amend the Canadian Citizenship Act, particularly in order to ensure full equality of
rights for aIl Canadian citizens wherever
they were born.
You will be asked to approve a revision of
the Immigration Act in the light of a White
Paper which will be placed before you,
reviewing immigration policy and procedures.
You will be asked to enact legislation to
establish an Indian Claims Commission.
A measure to establish an age of retirement from the Senate will be placed before
you.
My Government will seek to provide more
encouragement to the cultural development
of our country. You will be asked to consider
a measure to strengthen the position of Canadian publications, amendruents to the legislation deallng with broadcasting, and a
measure to help the development of a feature
film industry in Canada.
In order to encourage the progress of
scientific research in Canada you will be asked
to enact legislation to establish a Science
Council of Canada. You will also be asked
to authorize a program for the advancement
of industrial technology, designed to make our
industry more competitive and efficient.
Arrangements will be made for you to
decide the issue of capital punishment. My
Government will appoint a special committee
to study and make recommendations on a
comprehensive policy for the correction and
rehabihitation of prisoners.
My Government will appoint a royal commission to study the status, form and procedures of adjudicative and regulatory bodies
and to investigate the desirability of Instituting a parliamentary commissioner or Ombudsman for Canada.

April 5, 1965

the Bank Act, the Quebec Savings Banks Act

That the evidence received and taken
on the subject at preceding sessions be
referred to the committee; and
That the committee be instructed to
report to the Senate from time to time
its findings, together with such recommendations as it may see fit to make.
He said: Honourable senators are aware
that the Speclal Committee on Aging, which
it is now proposed be reconstituted, has been
sitting for several sessions. It has done considerable work, and a report is now being
prepared. I understand that it stili may have
to hear evidence. On that latter point, I amn
not clear. In any event, it is desirable that

April 6, 1965

the committee be set Up r1ow, SQ that when
work is to be done during a recess of the
Senate it can be undertaken without delay.
On behaif of the former chairman of the
committee, may 1 say that if the motion is
approved the committee will meet in room 356
immediately after the Senate rises this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
listened to what I supposed to be the terms
of reference of the committee to be set up
this session. Are the termns of reference the
same as last session?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Croll: With the exception that the
evidence already heard is to, be passed on to
the committee.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It sounded to me rather
as if we were going to legisiate in co:nmittee.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No. The
terms of reference are identical to those used
on the last occasion, and the membership of
the committee is the same. The only addition
to the motion is the reference of the evidence
that has already been taken, which will form
part of the proceedings of the commîttee
for this session.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I have no objections.
Motion agreed to.
EMERGENCY

SITTINGS

CON VENE SENATE DURING
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. John J. Connolly moved, with leave
of the Senate, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Vaillancourt:
That, for the duration of the present
session of Parliament, should an emergency arise during any adjourniment of
the Senate, which would in the opinion of
the Honourable the Speaker warrant that
the Senate meet prior to the time set
forth in the motion for such adjourniment,
the Honourable the Speaker be authorized
to notify honourable senators at their
addresses registered with the Clerk of
the Senate, to meet at a Urne earlier than
that set out in the motion for such
adjournment, and nonreceipt by any one
or more honourable senators of such call
shall not have any effect upon the sufficiency and validity thereof.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
customary motion at the opening of a session,
with a view to accommodating the work of
AUTHORITY

the Senate and the convenience of senators.
At any time that the authority conferred by
this motion is used, it is done with the consent of, in consultation witli and under the
direction of the Speaker of the Senate.
May I congratulate His Honour the Speaker
that he has seen fit to cail the Senate only at
such times-I think with one exceptionwhen ail of us had work to do.
Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I move, with leave of the
Senate, that when the Senate adjourns today
it do stand adjourned until Tuesday, May 4
next, at 8 o'clock i the evening.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Government if he will tell
us why he chooses that particular day, and
what prompted his decision?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): One of
the determining factors of the decision was
a discussion which I had, and which I always
welcome, with the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Brooks).
Hon. Mr. Brooks: You told the Leader of
the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Cannolly (Ottawa West): Speaking
seriously, it is proposed that today the mover
of the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne and the seconder will address
honourable senators. Normally, thereafter the
debate is continued by speeches being delivered by the Leader of the Opposition and
the Leader of the Government, and then
other honourable senators who wish to speak
do so.
The other place will be debating the Speech
from the Throne under their rules for a
period of eight days, unless they shorten the
debate by unanimous consent. When they
have concluded it I understand their intention
is to adjourn for Easter, probably until April
26, although I arn making no announcemnent
in that respect. This is what I understand is
generally thought will happen.
The other house cannot possibly deal with
any legisiation until the Throne Speech is
disposed of, and if it resumes on April 26
it is unlikely that it will provide us with any
legisiation with which to deal within that
week. However, it is proposed that when we
return we will immediately embark upon the
debate in reply to the Speech from the Throne
in this chamber; and at that time there will
be a number of pieces of legislation which will
22624-2

be introduced in the Senate with which we
shall be able to deal at our own convenience.
I should say that during the month of
May, and certainly for the first weeks of
June, honourable senators can expect to have
a busy program. The committees-particularly
the committees of study like the Aging Committee which has just been set up, and the
Finance Committee to which the estimates
will be referred-will be having a rather
active time upon the return of the Senate to
normal sittings.
Perhaps that is ail I need say at this time.
Motion agreed to.
DIVORCE
NOTICE 0F MEETING

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called
may 1 draw attention to the fact that the
Divorce Committee wiil meet immediately
following the meeting of the Aging Committee. 1 merely wish to say to the members
who are here-and there are few enough of
them-that the matters to be considered are
important but the time that will be taken
will be short indeed.
I hope ail members of the Divorce Committee will attend on this occasion.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech
at the opening of the session.
Hon. Romuald Bourque moved, seconded
by Hon. John B. Aird:
That the following Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor
General of Canada to offer the humble
thanks of this bouse to His Excellency
for the gracious speech which he has
been pleased to make to both Houses of
Parliament, namely:
To His Exceilency, General the Right
Honourable Georges P. Vanier, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order,
upon whom has been conferred the Miiitary Cross and the Canadian Forces'
Decoration, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
May it please Your Exceliency:
We, Her Mai esty's most loyal and dutifui subjects, the Senate o! Canada, in
Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer

SENATE DEBATESApi6,15
our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the graciaus Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to bath Houses of
Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, before proceeding witb my speech, 1 sbauld lîke ta
commend the Honourable the Speaker of the
Senate far the ability and skili with which. he
bas presided over the proceedings of this
assembly. I also want ta congratulate the
Leader of the Government in the Senate for
the care hie has shown in the preparation of
the legisiation we will be considering and for
the deference with which hie presides over
these debates. Bath are discharging their
functions brilliantly. I arn sure I arn expressing the feelings of ail the senators sitting
bere.
Honourable senators, I arn deepiy consciaus
of the banour and privilege bestowed upon
any Canadian who is asked ta represent bis
feilow citizens in the Senate. I aiso fuiiy
realize the respansibility that lies with anyone wbo gets up ta speak in this bouse. I do
flot assume such a responsibility iigbtly.
Canada is today on the threshold of its
greatest national development. Ail those sitting in this bouse are fuily aware of the
great deveiopments that took place in the last
two decades. We are consciaus o! the tremendous industrial progress that was carried out
and o! the major improvement in aur living
standard. We want a new spirit of Canadian
unity ta preside nver the creation o! a cauntry with unequalled possibilities. We believe
that the administration under the able leadership of the present Prime Minister reflects
such new spirit.
However, we must be on the loakout at al
times. It is necessary, on many occasions, ta
keep consciously away from parochial spirit
and from pressures which tend to divide and
whicb, in other countries, have caused confusion and despair. Canada is not a totalitarian country. It wants to give free expression ta any opinion that does not exceed the
bounds of decency and is not akin to treason
or sedition. It holds dear the preservation of
ail rights and privileges of those in opposition, in order that they rnay render service,
as it is their duty ta do so as constant and
vigilant critics o! government legisiation.
The over-ail purpose is ta protect the public.
It is the very foundation o! aur political
system. However, criticismn must not degenerate into a mania, it must not be indulged
in for the sake of criticizing and it must not
consist o! a series o! attacks and insinuations
against the worthwhiie activities o! those

April 6. 1965

who are entrusted with the administration
o! the country. I must say here that I disapprove of the disparaging campaign of insinuations and attacks iaunched by a bandful
o! maicontents in Canada.
Our country is very prosperous at present.
More people are at work now than in the
past severai years. Unemployment is going
down. During the week end, I read in the
March 28, 1965 edition of a Montreal newspaper, Le Petit Journal, an editorial dealing
with the situation in Canada and I sbould
like ta quote a single paragraph frorn it:
At first glance, one feels satisfied when
readîng about statistics concerning employment in Canada last February. During
that montb, whicb is usually the worst
month of the year so far as unemployment is concerned, the number of unemplayed persans not oniy decreased, compared ta February of last year, but it even
decreased compared with January. This
is ail the more significant since the
number o! workers is increasing daiy in
this country.
As 1 said a while ago, there are more
people at work today than for severai years
previously. Unempioyment Is on the wane.
Our industries are busier than ever; the
average salaries of Canadian workers are also
higher than they have ever been. Our Canadian citizens neyer had it so good; they enjoy
many things which. they neyer had bef are,
for instance, a home, an automobile, a refrigerator, an electric stove, a radio and a
television. Ail classes and groups benefit from
this new prosperîty.
It is true that some people are already
camplaining, but is it not humnan that intelligent people sbouid complain? We have
not reached Utapia, and no one wlll ever
reach it, because, whatever aur standard of
living may be, some people will always wish
that it be higher. Nowhere in the world, with
the exception of the United States, is the
standard of living higher than in Canada.
Besides, aur feliow Canadians benefit from
famnily allawances, youth allowances, ôld age
pensions, pensions for the blind and the disabled and, thanks ta the legisiatian recently
passed, every Canadian will benefit !rom a
universal contributary aid age pension plan.
Those are but a few o! the advantages ta be
found ini a fiscal poiicy whîch guarantees ta
every Canadian a better and happier life.
We in the Senate are under an obligation ta
the country as a wbole. It is nat one ta be
!ulfiiied merely by passing legisiation or resolutions, but above ail by shawing the way ta

April 6, 1965

DEBATES

the rest of the people. The press, radio and
television are giving particular attention to
the proceedings of the Senate and the House
of Commons. During the session, the Canadian people turn to Parliament in the hope of
finding there inspiration and leadership refiecting their own confidence in their country.
They hope to find in aur words and actions
the expression of a true Canadlanism, which
will boister their courage and their enthusiasm for the performance of their individual
tasks. Therefore, it rests with Parliament ta
provide them with the inspiration and example they are seeking.
Any citizen rnay criticize the methods and
legislation already introduced or passed. Such
crticism, made on good faith and not out of
personal spite, is accepted as a contribution
ta the weifare of the Canadian people. It has
nothing in common with criticism directed
against every goverrnent undertaklng, casting refiection on ail our administrators and
whlch may go sa far as to, pit one section of
the people against another.
For seventeen years as its mayor, I had
the privilege to preside over the destiny of
the city of Outremont, located i the province of Quebec. After ail, a municipaiity is a
miniature country. Its population is made up
of various ethnic groups, variaus religions. In
Outremont; ail kinds of national backgrounds,
ail sorts of interests can be f ound, but we al
join i a common belief i eur own city,
first, and in aur country, afterwards. We
wauid not welcome in Outremont thase
forces which would divide us. We are not at
ail happy about seeing them at work in aur
country. We believe that in Canada there is
roam and opportunites for everyone, and we
believe that it is desirable ta make sure that
those who live and wark among us have equai
opportunities.
As a newcomer ta, the Senate, after sitting
in the other place for twelve years, I have
much ta, iearn. I appreclate the klndness and
the attention bestowed upon me by ail honaurable senators. 1 was happy to, be welcamned here as a loyal Canadian, anxious ta
cantribute something ta the welfare of this
cauntry. 1 have confidence in the numerous
measures which have already cantributed so,
much ta the welfare and the happiness of aur
people as a whole. I believe in the spirit of
the legisiatian passed and implemented sa
efficiently bythe Government during those
years.
Canadians neyer had a better appartunity
ta enhance Canada's reputatian and prestige.
Let us take advantage of it and, whatever
22624-2à

aur 0wn political views may be, let us ail
show aur love for aur country and work tagether ta attain the same goals.
Honourable senators, I think that the many
measures outlined in the Speech from the
Throne which His Exceilency the Governor
General so, graciously read ta us, and ta,
which I have the honour ta, move the address
in reply, can be taken as steps leading aur
country's development in a spirit of Canadian
unity.
I dare hope that when those measures are
considered individually by Parliament, aur
debates will refiect that basic unity which
we are ail trying ta preserve.
[Text]
Hon. John B. Aird: Honourable senators,
my first wards in this chamber are dictated
by my great feeling of gratitude ta ail honourable members of the Senate who have
extended ta me such a warmn welcome, and
I am indeed grateful ta each af yau for your
many kindnesses.
I will do my best ta justlfy my appaintment
and dedicate myseif ta, the fuil and proper
discharge of rny duties i this chamber. I
arn very weil aware of the signal honour that
has been paid ta, me by the Leader af the
Government i the Senate (Hon. Mr. Cannofly,
Ottawa West) in asking me ta, second the
motian for an address ini repiy ta the Speech
fromn the Thrane. In this regard might; I say
that 1 have been most impressed by his
leadership I tis chamber and by the distinguished manner in whlch he performs his
duties with sklill and cansideration. In addition, might I say that the dignity and stature
of the Senate are greatly enhanced by the
warmth and charmi displayed on every occasion by His Honour the Speaker. I am particularly grateful ta him for his advice and
caunsel ta me.
I arn advised that I arn repiacing the late
Senator G. Peter Camnpbell of Toronto I
tis place. I do not knaw if many senators
have had the privilege of succeeding a ifetime friend, but I do wish ta record my
feeling of deep humillty in assuming the
place of the late Senatar Campbell who, for
rnany years, was a close personai friend of
my family, as weil as being a mentor and
adviser ta, me. He was a fine man and a
great Canadian.
A cursary appreciation of the Speech from
the Throne indicates that it contaIns many
proposais which menit the close attention of
Parliament. I do flot propose ta, discuss these
measures in detail at this time, as I know
that ample opportunîty will be given for

SENATE DEBATES
debate when these measures, each in its turn,
come to this chamber for consideration.
The Government has now placed before
Parliament its outline of priorities of an action
program. These are the key words, "priorities
of an action program," and in this context I
would like to comment in a general way on
a matter which I shall generally describe as
the "effectiveness of government." In my discussion I would like to emphasize that I
am raising this question in the hope that it
is being thoroughly examined so that we may
have some understanding of the nature of
government participation in the economic and
social life of Canada. In view of the comprehensive program contemplated in the Speech
from the Throne, I believe that this understanding of the priorities of government action
is especially timely.
In this regard I would refer honourable
senators to the lectures by Peter F. Drucker,
which were delivered at Convocation Hall,
University of Toronto, early in March, under
the auspices of the School of Business of that
university. These lectures were extremely well
attended and have caused considerable comment in the Canadian press. They deal with
entrepreneurship in business enterprise, or
the "effectiveness of business." It seems to
me that the principles outlined by Professor
Drucker have a real bearing, at least in my
opinion, on the business of government.
His fundamental premise is that entrepreneurial skill is the thing which makes
business an effective instrument. He points
out that historically certain business enterprises have been more consistently successful
than others, and he seeks the reason therefor. He states that in a modern business enterprise there are three fundamental characteristics-the first being entrepreneurial skill,
the second efficiency, and the third the impact of business on the social scene. It is
pointed out that the latter two fundamentals
cannot exist without the first and that, therefore, it is the basic necessity. It is the creative element and is, therefore, the most important.
I believe that this reasoning is applicable to
the business of government, and that it is a
particular area that should be studied and
appreciated at this time because I believe
that more entrepreneurial skill can make
government more effective. If government
becomes more effective, it follows that our
country will prosper accordingly.
Thus the question becomes: Which priorities of action will be of most benefit to Canada? To illustrate my premise with an ex-

April 6, 1965

ample that clearly involves every Canadian
in every walk of life, the Economic Council
of Canada has provided a most excellent
framework of forecast to the year 1970. It
points out that an average annual increase in
output per man-hour of 3 per cent is required
in the productivity factor. If the other targets as set out in that report are to be met,
surely this required increase is the item
which should be most concerning to management, labour and government. Here is an
area where strategy must be employed on a
partnership basis so that the effect may be
realized. Here is a priority that should be
attacked, because if Canada is to succeed in
reaching its goals it must attack its problems.
Although people are inclined to say that
there is no common denominator in the
Canadian character, I am not sure that I
agree. I believe that one salient common
characteristic of all Canadians is that they
enjoy competition. If my opinion is a correct
one, then now as never before this common
characteristic must be brought into focus, developed and achieved if this country is to
maintain and improve its position as a
factor in world affairs. If Canada is to become more effective, and if Canadians are to
compete in world affairs, then the goals as
set out by the Economic Council provide the
target, and the critical decision becomes one
of priorities. I suggest that increased productivity is one touchstone of development,
and government should be supporting or
creating an action program to achieve it.
Surely the achieving of the productivity
goals postulated by the Economic Council is
fundamental to the realization of all our
plans for Canada. An effective economic
growth rate is the only base which can sustain programs to realize such objectives as
full employment, a favourable balance of
payments position, resource development,
maintenance of consumer income, and an expanding gross national product.
Let us acknowledge that the role of government in Canadian developments bas been
an essential one. When this country was
created as a political entity, the Fathers of
Confederation established the framework
within which our subsequent development
would take place, and implicitly the Government of Canada accepted a role and a
responsibility for providing a climate in
which industry could take root and flourish.
Indeed, the greatest Canadian undertaking of
the nineteenth century, the building of the
transcontinental railway, reflected the essential contribution government would have
to make, and continue to make, in the devel-

April 6, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

opment of our nation, so, too, in its own
way, did the national policy.
To date in the twentieth century we have
witnessed a steady expansion of the role of
government in Canadian society arising primarily from the fact that government has
been striving, and is still striving today, to
insure the realization of objectives which are
not only economic but social as well. My purpose in making this point is to indicate the
extent of the involvement. I believe there is
a very wide consensus in this country about
the goals which government should ultimately pursue. There is much less unity on the
question of the methods by which government realizes its objectives and the instruments of participation which it utilizes.
There is a growing feeling-and I have
sensed it many times in the brief period during which I have been a member of the Senate-that the present devices of government
participation are not always adequate for the
tasks at hand. This feeling, I believe, stems
from the fact that the Canadian nation has
reached a complex and sophisticated level of
development. The economy, for example, has
rapidly become highly diversified and in each
sector and in each region-and indeed within
each sector and region-are circumstances and
situations which are unique, and perhaps nonrecurring. Our social composition is equally
mixed, being a cross section of peoples and
occupational groups, each with their particular
characteristics. It is not surprising therefore
that there is a need for new approaches in
government policy and procedure, and these
new approaches are very much indicated in
the Speech from the Throne. No longer can
one legislate a general principle into law and
assume that its application will be beneficial
merely because the principle is. The divergencies in our society are too intense for this
easy solution. The result is more likely to be
some inequitable application and subsequent
dislocation. The Government has the tools for
realizing its ultimate objectives. These tools
are familiar to all of us and include such
concepts as monetary policy, tariff policy, and
fiscal policy, in addition to its power to
make law.
My major point is that, in addition, the
Government must develop, and quickly, if
the historic balance between the public and
private sectors of our nation is to be preserved,
a strategy whereby these tools will be used
in a manner which will be effective in our
modern circumstances. An example of such
a strategy is the proposed setting up of a
special secretariat under the direct control of

the Prime Minister to co-ordinate a new program of economie and welfare legislation in
a broad campaign to abolish poverty and
equalize opportunities for all Canadians.
Therefore, in essence, I say that we can,
through constant effort, create a relatively
efficient government, and that it can be adjusted to the Canadian and world social
scheme, but if Canada is to forge ahead its
government must be concerned with strategy
and effectiveness. No amount of planning can
foresee world events, and at this particular
time when the tJnited States and Britain are
both endeavouring to put their international
finances in order, certain external strains over
which we have no control may be imposed on
the Canadian economy. It is possible that
these or other strains, which can neither be
foreseen nor forecast, may restrain the present
substantial growth in our economy. It is for
this reason that at this particular time great
courage, flexibility, imagination and creation
are needed by the Canadian Government.
This is not to say that long-term planning is
an undesirable feature, but I do say that it
should be tempered by considered judgment
and strategy on both a short and long-term
basis.
I am, therefore, suggesting that there must
be a quality of entrepreneurship in government, and I actually prefer the substitution
of the word "strategy" because it has a specific concern, and that concern is effectiveness.
Effectiveness is concerned with doing the
right things-it is concerned with what things
to do and with their priorities of action. It
is essentially the acceptance of change as an
opportunity.
In closing, I note with interest and gratification the inclusion of many proposed
measures in the Speech from the Throne that
do indicate the present Government is concerned with and is proposing to enact measures which are calculated to have effective
results. Such a measure is the automotive
agreement, which refiects and embodies the
principles which I have been discussing. This
agreement is a modern and comprehensive
approach to a matter of great national concern, as it affects a most substantial portion
of Canadian industry. Such measures as this
reflect great credit to the present administration.
Honourable senators, I have great honour
in seconding the motion for an address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
take this opportunity to congratulate both the
mover and seconder of this motion on their

CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, April

nor General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Aird, for an address

in reply thereto.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, in rising to participate in this debate
on the motion for an address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne in the absence
of the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Brooks), may I at the outset congratulate both the mover and seconder of
the motion, Senator Bourque and Senator
Aird. Their contributions to the debate were
in the best traditions of this chamber. They
will share not only in the good fellowship
but the onerous responsibilities of this body,
and their addition to our membership is most
welcome.

May 4. 1965

May 4 1965SENATE
DEBATES

We are happy to see His Honour the
Speaker and the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa
West) in their recently assumed places. They
have acquitted themselves nobly and have
done credit to the Senate. It is therefore
somewhat sad to refiect that their tenure of
their high offices is bound to be short.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You can
dream, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Although my good
friend the honourable Leader of the Government says I arn dreaming, I point out that
I have a pleasant dream, and I arn going to
report it ta this chamber.
1 do not know how many honourable
senators have read the open letter written
by the honourable Leader of the Senate to
the Globe and Mail and published this morning, but in that letter our esteemed colleague
said things that should have been said some
time ago because this place has been too
much maligned for toa long. The points made
in that open letter could flot have been made
more forcefully or more convincingly.
Perhaps, in his absence, I may steal the
opportunity ta express on behalf of this side,
and I arn sure on behaîf of the Government
benches also, a word of tribute to Senator
Brooks, aur leader, a distinguished parliamentarian and a great Senator.
Hon. Mr. Cannolly (Ottawa West): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I have rather more
difficulty in paying unreserved tribute to the
Speech from the Throne. It is a vague and
general document which appears ta be against
poverty and in favour of progress. We al
share these great abjectives-they are part of
gavernment-but what does it ail mean
behind the vague generalizations and piaus
hopes therein expressed? I have neyer been
much good at chasing will-o'-the-wisps or at
swatting flies with a hammer.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Or chasing rainbaws!
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We will abviously have
ta await specific legislative measures as they
reach us before passing final judgment on
any of them. As of naw it is difficult, if not
impossible, to anticipate these matters.
In this connection, perhaps I might quote
a passage or so from "Capital Report" by
Walter Stewart, delivered over the C.B.C. on
April 11, 1965:
This week the Liberal Government
doffed its old coat and put on a new

one, just in time for spring showings.
Last year's Throne Speech was about
worn out, anyway; it didn't fit too well,
it was ripped and torn, and across the
back were several stains that laoked suspiciously like dried blood. The new
Throne Speech, delivered to a new session
last Monday, is a much more satisfactory garment, a bright and swirling
cloak of many colours.
It has a number of advantages, flot
least of which is its large size; it is s0
big and billowy that the government
may take several steps to the right or
lef t within ifs cancealing falds without
the rest of us knowing which way it is
headed. It has anather advantage, too:
it is cornpletely reversible. If the government should faîl, or go ta the country
of its own accord, Presto-Chango! the
Throne Speech becames an election manifesta, waterproof enough ta withstand
carnpaign storms and lined inside with
rnany pockets, each holding a little something for ail of us.
Honourable senators, others will deal with
the specifics of the Speech from the Throne,
but perhaps I may be allowed some general
remarks at this time. We have before us, indeed, a helter-skelter assartment of sugared
goadies, many of them resurrected and rewrapped Easter gifts of several years aga.
There is little in it ta "excite the daring or ta
test the strong." In the first place one wonders whether it was not, like the Budget
Speech, written by the Eastern Bunny himself. It appears indeed ta be redolent of an
election: nobady who might be expected ta
cast a ballot appears ta have been entirely
neglected.
I cannot really fault the Government for
this. It is an ald political gimmick, that af
buying the people with their own money. Al
I can do is ta expose it for what it is and
hope that the people of Canada will not be
lulled inta any sense of false security.
I say this because, as is of ten the case,
the Speech fram the Throne is really more
notable for what it does not contain-far its
cardinal sins of omission. It skirts the fringes
and plays upon the symptoms of the Canadian
economy, but it does not meet the problem
head on. Where are the measures ta stimulate
and increase productivity in this country?
How will the millions of new jobs which
the Economic Council has said will be needed
be provided for Canadians? In this area, there
is a vast and disturbing silence. I arn sure

22

SENATE: )EBATES

that Senator McCutcheon will have much
more to say on this at a later stage.
But there are still other conspicuous omissions, even in respect of Liberal campaign
promises. Where are the 10,000 university
scholarships, and where is the guaranteed $2wheat? One wonders now how serious these
undertakings were. The latter appears to have
been pigeonholed indefinitely, whereas, apparently in lieu of the former, we are to have
a Peace Corps along American lines. Similarly, we are apparently about to wage war
against poverty, also along American lines.
Honourable senators, nobody is against this
sort of thing: everyone should of course be
an Eagle Scout. What we are concerned about
is the best way of achieving the maximum
prosperity of all Canadians. The dialogue
must go on this issue, and we on this side
are not convinced that the present Government has the best answers, if indeed it has
any real answers, to Canada's future.
Honourable senators, there are still other
conspicuous omissions which I must mention.
Here again I do not really fault the Government, because in politics unpalatable truths
are to be buried, and if they cannot be buried
they are to be ignored, and if they cannot be
ignored they are to be dismissed lightly.
I say again that I cannot, in a political
sense, fault the Government because it "accentuates the positive and eliminates the negative." This is traditional politics, though one
wonders whether this is the "new politics"
to which the Prime Minister once dedicated
himself. All I can do is expose the omissions,
which I suggest speak for themselves.
The matters which are not referred to in
the Speech are honesty in government, executive assistants, furniture, the Sefkind bankruptcy, race tracks, dope-peddling, dopesmuggling, jail-breaks and international
gangsterism. As I have said, as a politician,
I cannot blame the Government for these
particular oversights.
Now, honourable senators, I propose to
run through briefly, and comment on, the
main features of the Speech from the Throne.
I suppose we must leave to the House of
Commons the reformation of its own procedures. All I can say is that I hope something will be done so that we will not have
to await inordinate lengths of time for Commons legislation to reach us. We are all
agreed that it is neither dignified nor efficient
for us to stutter from adjournment or adjournment awaiting such legislation.
As to the Canadianization of the Constitution, we all favour that in principle. The

May 4, 1965

previous administration brought it almost
to fruition, and I have myself advocated it
as a measure necessary to the completion
of Confederation. But we must be sure that
the so-called Fulton-Favreau formula will
not bring with it either the frustration of future constitutional growth or what has been
termed by some the "balkanization" of
Canada. We must study the proposal with
cautious care, and not be dismayed by the
allegation that it is based upon a fait accompli, an arrangement that, like a treaty, cannot
be adjusted in any particular. After all, what
has been done by one federal-provincial conference can be modified by another, if the
adjustments are in fact in the interests of
Canada as a whole.
I would like to see a joint Commons-Senate
committee study the matter, and, in any
event, it must go to a standing committee of
the Senate.
The Company of Young Canadians is offered to us, apparently in lieu of 10,000 university scholarships, which do not now seem
to have a very high priority. We will examine
this proposal with interest, and I should
think with sympathetic interest.
It is difficult to generate much enthusiasm
for royal commissions or special committees
of inquiry, some of which are foreshadowed
in the Speech. Al we can do is await their
final reports, and see what the Government
will propose as a result.
Amendments will be proposed to the Bank
Act and related statutes. Though we have
had a clear indication as to part of what
is in store for the banking legislation, and
perhaps could guess shrewdly as to the
balance, we will have to await the specific
measures.
Honourable senators, may I now refer to
the unemployment insurance legislation, to
which fleeting reference is made in the
Speech from the Throne. The virtual bankruptcy of the Unemployment Commission
Fund is attributed by the Gill Commission to
two basic causes. One is the "gradual dissipation of the sound actuarial basis on which
the original plan was founded" and the other
was "the change in the economic climate
which started in about 1957."
The Gill Commission pointed out that a
plan which was originally sound, in the sense
that it conformed to recognized insurance
principles, has over the years become unsound.
The fund, which reached a peak of $927
million on December 31, 1956, must now be

May 4 1965SENATE
DEBATES

May 4, 1965

maintained by tiding-over loans from the
Government.
The Gili Commission reported that the depletion of the fund is flot attributable to undue increases in benefit rates. The destructive changes have been those relating to eligibility. At the outset the claimant had to be
able to show that hie had made 180 contributions ini the preceding two years. This was the
equivalent of 30 full weeks of employment.
A weekly calculation was introduced in the
revision of 1955. This was based on 30 such
units. There was, however, an extremely important change. As littie as one day of employment in each of the 30 weeks mlght
suffice to establish a dlaim.
Much has been made of the amendment of
1956 extending coverage to self-employed
fishermen. There is no estimate i the report
of the magnitude of the resulting drain on the
fund. The investigators are sure, however,
that the change was a mistake. Coverage of
the self-employed is, they say, not consistent

The

abl

with the insurance approach because it becomes impossible to determine satisfactorlly
when they are employed or unemployed.
For fishermen the scheme was not even
equitable as a form of social assistance; ini
fact, it meant that the largest benefits were
paid to those with the best record of fish
sales.
The Gili Commission, in summation, stated
that unemployment insurance is "neither a
valid insurance plan in its present form
nor is a socially desirable type of income
supplement."
Honourable senators, I do not wish to
burden you with a lot of figures. I have prepared here a series of figures on boans and
borrowings which had to be made by the
Commission at the end of each fiscal year
from 1958-59 up to the present. With the
unanimous consent of the Senate, I should
like to niake this part of the record.
Hon. Mr. Connofly (Ottawa W..t): Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Choquelie: Whatever it is, it now
survives on handouts from general revenues.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would

the honaurable senator tell us whether the
table he has placed on Hansard indicates the
amounts from year ta year that were in the
fund?
Hon. Mr. Choque±±e: Yes. That is there,
too-the balance left in the fund and the
borrowings that had ta be made.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Thank
you.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: The Gi Commission
recommended the expansion of the present
plan which at present extracts premiums from
and pays benefits to employees making no
more than $5,460 a year; 50 almost ahl employees participate.
The Commission, in its recommendations,
also sought to make a clear distinction between
unemployment insurance and welfare. It suggested that the insurance provision should
apply to those who were out of work for a
maximum of 26 weeks, and that beyond this
period some welfare became involved and
this should be the responsibility of the whole
nation.
The underlying principles which governed
the Commission's recommendations were two:
universality and a division of the insurance
functions of the program from its welfare
f unctions.
The Gîll Commission recommended that all
employees, no matter how much they make,
be required to pay premiums on a stated
portion covering income-with matching contributions from their employers-and be entitled to benefits. This would vastly broaden
the insurance base of the plan, thus giving
the plan greater stability.
This part of the new program would be
entirely insurance and would provide benefits
for a maximum of 26 weeks. Unemployment
lasting beyond this period, the Commission

reasoned, involved some welfare. It therefore
proposed the creation of the new plan which
would provide benefits, without a means test,
for a further maximum of 39 weeks and
would be paid out of federal taxes. Unemployment lasting longer than a total of 65
weeks, it also reasoned, was a social problem
and should be treated whally as welfare. At
this point a chronically unemployed person
would go on welfare, with a means test. Benefits would be provided on a 50-50 basis
by the federal and provincial gavernments
through exîsting welfare departments.
What reference do we find in the Speech
from the Throne to this urgent matter? We
find the following, probably as an afterthought:
My Government will propose a revision
of legislation on unemployment insurance.
This, like other portions of the Speech, could
menn anything or nothîng. But unless it
means that the Gill recommendations are
about to be implemented, the legislatian will
have a stormy passage, at least in this House.
Honourable senators, the Governmnent is
very fortunate in inheriting an upsurge in
the economy, an upsurge which is basically
due to the far-sighted policies and corrective
measures initiated by the previaus administration. The present Government has dane little
or nothing to contribute ta thîs upsurge and
a great deal ta resist it or slow it down. I
refer ta the ill-advised tax on building
materials and the variaus discouragements
ta aur friends who would like ta invest in
the future of Canada, and whose help we
need. Moreover, no tax relief is apparently
ta be given ta aur principal producers of
goods and services, on whomn our economy
basically depends.
I have mentioned before that the Speech is,
on the whole, an example of the fine art of
wooing the people with their own maney. No
price tag has yet been placed on the plateful

May 4. 1965

May 4 1965SENATE
DEBATES

of goodies, but they are flot going to corne
cheap. One newspaperman has estimated that
if ail the projects outlined or hinted at in
the Speech frorn the Throne were brought to
fruition, the ultimate annual tax bill would be
$9 billion, or three times the cost of government in 1952. Can we really afford ail this
and heaven too? On the contrary, as the
Leader of the Government is fond of saying,
"We mnust dare to be prudent."
Honourable senators, I cannot vouch for
these astronomical figures, and it is apparent
that ail these projects will not be brought to
fruition overnight. I do say, however, that
their mere contemplation takes much of the
warmth out of the Honourable Mr. Gordon's
so-cailed "sunshine budget." The tax reductions made have been disappointingly low,
in the opinion o! most experts, and corporation taxes have been maintauned at their
present high levels. Nevertheless, when the
Liberals are running scared, they immediately try to out-C.C.F. the N.D.P. I think it
was Mr. St. Laurent who said a few years ago
that a C.C.F.'er was a Liberal in a hurry.
Today I think we could easily reverse this
and say that a Liberal is an N.D.P. in a
hurry. AU I can say is that if the Government
is to continue with its large-scale programns
of socialized welfare, without full regard to
the costs and the ability o! Canadians to pay
them, this may be the last "sunshine budget"
for sorne time-even though the present sunshine is spread thinly and is filtered through
the overcast of another large budget deficit.
I arn not a trained economist: I find as rnuch
difficulty in comprehiending unlimited credit
as I do in contemplating infinity. I have
always believed that, leaving aside technical
gibberish, national economics are not far different from barnyard econornics. If the cost
of running a farm becomes too great, either
the cost must be reduced or the farm rnust be
sold. It is as simple as that. Canadians do not
realiy wish to walk again, as they did in 1929,
arm i arm over the hill to the poorhouse,
even if it has been air-conditioned and redecorated. There is, in rny opinion, a greater
need now than ever before for what Sir
Robert Borden once terrned "the commonplace
quality of common sense."
On top o! ail this, we must fear the increasing power of the state, under the guise
of paternalisrn, and its weakening effect on
individual initiative and character. As an
eminent American essayist, Albert Jay Nock,
has put it:

In proportion as you give the state
power to do things for you, you give it
power to do things to you, and the state
invariably makes as littie use as it can
of the one power and as much as it can
of the other.
What we often forget is that the state has
no money, produces nothung, is but a parasite,
and maintains itself in power by levying taxes
and irnposts upon the people. It should flot
be allowed to destroy us.
This impels me to say a few words about
the much touted Canada Development Corporation-the C.D.C.-which has been described by Donald Fleming, a man flot unversed in budgetary matters, as "supremely
dangerous and HI-advised." The vast increase
in public ownership contemplated by this
proposai, hie describes as both a snare and
a delusion. It was, in fact, rejected out of hand
by the previous administration as an unwarrantable intrusion into the private enterprise
sector o! our econorny. I propose to discuss
this later, if the proposal in fact ever reaches
US.
Ail I can say now is that the Speech from
the Throne and the budget taken together
and ini ail their implications do flot amount to
4creeping socialism."l This is socialism rampant. While the N.D.P. have been trying for
years to explain away, live down and forget
the Regina Manifesto, there is now little room
to the left o! the Liberals. But we in the
Senate have a responsibility which rests upon
us ail, and not; just upon those of us who sit
to the left of the Speaker, to preserve and
conserve what is good in our society. We are
indeed a bastion of conservatisrn in the best
and least partisan sense of that terni. We
simply cannot watch the erosion of our way
of life, and in particular the steady invasion
of the private sector o! our econorny, without
notice or protest. We must neither kill nor
cripple the goose that over the years has
laid golden eggs for Canada.
Honourable senators, I will not anticipate
further the debates which will corne as the
several matters raised in the Speech !rom the
Throne are brought before us. But I would
like to say this now, as I have said before,
a minority government has a mandate to govern so long as it can commnand a majority vote
in the Comxnons. On the other hand, flot
having been returned to Parliament with a
majority, it has not received a popular mandate for any specific piece of legisiation it may
introduce. The Senate does not; therefore
labour under any inhibitions in this regard. It

SENATE DEBATES
is our clear duty, one which rests upon all
honourable senators, whether in or out of
opposition, to scrutinize and criticize any
government legislation that comes to us from
the Commons. None of it can be said to have
the will of the people behind it, except perhaps by guess or surmise. A minority government, as we know, has always a difficult
task before it. Whatever bold declarations may
be made by the Government that it will act
as if it represented a majority of the people,
it does not do so, and there is an ever-present
possibility of compromise, even of principle.
Shakespeare has wisely said: "When clouds
are seen, wise men put on their cloaks."
We must watch for all the things I have
mentioned, and we will be duly watchful.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
let me at the outset thank and congratulate
the mover and the seconder of the Address.
[Translation]
Senator Bourque had a most distinguished career as a representative for Outremont-St. John in the House of Commons.
He was elected five times in a row in that
same constituency. At the same time, he
served his fellow citizens for 17 years as
mayor of Outremont.
His career has been one of dedication seldom surpassed. It must be satisfying for him
to find that those who know him best showed
so many times their confidence in him.
We need in the Senate members who have
had experience in the public affairs of the
country. I thank him for the great contribution he made to the debates in this house.
[Text]
I thank Senator Aird for the sound and
thoughtful speech he made, although it may
be superfluous for me to do so having regard
to the favourable press it has received.
Senator Aird is a relatively young man, and
that fact alone is good enough reason for
welcoming him to the Senate. However, there
is more. He had a fine record of service with
the Navy in the last war, and he also had
a thorough academic training. He has had a
most successful professional and business
career, and has followed worthily in the
footsteps of a distinguished father and grandfather, both of whom were outstanding in
the business and community life of Toronto.
All these things might have been sufficient
to warrant his summons to the Senate. He
realized, however, that if Parliament is to
function as it should in these days, the infrastruceture of political parties must be

May 4, 1965

strengthened. Research, communications, and
competent people to work in these fields
responsibly and intelligently are basic requirements. He has been active in this area.
Parliament is a political place. Its work
influences the lives of people deeply, as much
as do the schools and universities and, in some
respects, as much as do the churches. We are
beyond the frontier now in Canada. Parliament and political parties can use the capacity
of all men like Senator Aird. I am sure the
Senate will be a better place because of his
being here.
At this stage I feel it is appropriate to
review the work done by the Senate in the
Second Session of the Twenty-Sixth Parliament, the session which has just closed. In
that session some 42 bills were received from
the House of Commons, two of these being
private members' public bills. These 42 bills
were studied and in due time were passed
and received Royal Assent.
In addition, the Senate initiated 48 bills.
Thirty of these were private measures which
were passed, and 13 were Government bills,
which also were passed. Perhaps the 13 Government bills introduced here were a record
for one session. As honourable senators know,
public bills cannot be introduced in this chamber if they involve an expenditure of money.
Such bills require the resolution stage of
consideration in the other place before Parliament can deal with them. In addition, of
course, there are measures of important Government policy which the ministers in the
other place usually want to introduce in their
own house, even if there are no financial
implications. This is understandable.
I want to assure the Senate that I am ever
alert to the desirability of introducing Government measures here and, within the limits
imposed upon us, I think I can say that I
have been able to get every bill available.
In addition to the measures I have mentioned which will find their place in the
statute books, the Senate last session approved
six major proposals by way of resolution. All
these involved substantial debate here. They
were:
1. The Peace-keeping Force for Cyprus
under the aegis of the United Nations.
2. The treaty with the United States for the
development of the Columbia River.
3. The I.L.O. Convention on Discrimination
in Employment.

May 4. 1965

May 4 1995SENATE
DEBATES

4. The amendment to the Constitution to
provide survivor benefits under the Canada
Pension Plan.
5. The resolution for the adoption of a distinctive national flag.
6. The resolution for the approval of the
Royal Union flag.
As well, the Senate adopted terms of reference for studies by five standing, special
or joint committees: Aging, Consumer Credit,
Tourist Traffie, the Estimates, and the Canada
Pension Plan. On other occasions I have
referred to, the fine work done by members
of these committees and their chairnienand, indeed, their chairwoman. Finally, the
Senate adopted 859 divorce resolutions which
came to us from the Divorce Committee.
Without derogating fromn the value of the
other work, I would refer especially to three
public bills, all of them relatively non-contentious, but upon which the Senate exercised commendable influence. I believe that
in every case these were public bils which
were introduced here. They were: the Canada
Shipping Act, the Harbour Commissions Act,
and the Companies Act. These measures were
all of great importance, and the study given
them by the Senate and the improvements
made here are more than could be ýexpected
from the other place.
I think it fair to say that the volume and
quality of the work done by the Senate during
the last session made it a session of real
achievement. Perhaps my friend Senator
Choquette-and his remarks would lead me
to this conclusion--does not quite agree with
that; but if he has followed me so far, for
bis furtber reading I would suggest that he
peruse the Prorogation Speech delivered so
early in the morning of the final day of the
last session. There he will have further confirmation of the very large volume of work
which Parliament discbarged last session.
In the Senate at times we have experienced,
as Senator Choquette has said, delays and
frustrations that were not of our making.
The session was the longest in the history
of our Parliament. The unusual composition
of the other place and the very slow progreas
made on much of its legisiation made the
meetings of this body rather precarious. We
adjourned often, sometimes flot knowing
when we would be able to resume our work,
but the judgment and forbearance exercised
by the Senate was helpful, and, i addition
to, that, we had some good luck. I sbould
like to pay high tribute to the co-operation
and the sense of responsibility shown by al

members of the Senate from aîl parts of tis
house. The attendance here during the last
session was seldom below 65 per cent. This
speaks highly for the attention given by
senators to their duties here.
If I may, I should like to thank the Leader
of the Opposition, Senator Brooks, for the
co-operation and helpful understanding he
displayed. I am sorry he is not here tis
evening, but, as we know, he has not yet
returned from Europe where be has been
attending the Executive Meeting of the Interparliamentary Union. That body was preparing for the meeting of the Interparliamentary Unionwhich will be beld in Ottawa i
September. Without the attitude and approach
which Senator Brooks showed, we should not;
have had as productive a year. He understands the purpose of a second chamber, and
be performs ini its highest tradition.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, the Speech from the Throne
contains the sentence:
Our country is achieving a bigh rate
of economic growtb.
Senator Choquette will say this is an inberitance fromn a great Government. Since
that statement was made, Parliament has
had an opportunity to examine the Economic
Review for 1964. That document contains a
statistical report on the operation of the
Canadian economy last year. The Gross National Product advanced by almost 9 per
cent. This is the largest year-to-year gain
since 1956. The value of our GNP in 1964
was over $47 billion, as agalnst $44.6 billion
in 1963. This rate of growtb is encouraging
in itself. It is also encouraging in comparison
with the rate experienced in other western
countries.
In addition, the budget accounts are now
in virtual balance, and for the first time since
1957-58. The deficit for the fiscal year just
passed was announced at $83 million. The
surplus in the Old Age Pension account,
which would reduce this considerably, was
$64 million. These are figures that are on the
record.
In 1964 the labour force increased by over
108,000, but the number of employed rose
by 230,000. As a resuit, the average of unemployment as a percentage of the labour
force i the year 1964 was 4.7 per cent. Tis
is a gratifying improvement. It continues the
year-to-year improvement we have been experiencing since the high average of unem-

SENATE DEBATES

ployment in 1961 of 7.2 per cent. But unemployment persists at rates higher than
acceptable in the Atlantic Provinces, in
Quebec and in British Columbia, despite the
fact that the greatest decline in unemployment in 1964 took place in these three areas.
The job is not finished, though I submit
considerable progress has been made.
In the field of trade there has been a
further improvement in 1964, and the figures
are given at page 43 of the document to which
I referred earlier. Foreign trade will always
be an important index for the economy of
Canada. The current accounts of our international payments showed gross receipts of
$10.6 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over
1963.
The increase in merchandise exports has
been striking. It is 16 per cent, providing a
surplus of over $700 million. There has been
a steady growth in traditional exports-the
products of our mines, our forests and our
resource industries. The wheat exports, especially to Russia, continued at a high level as
a result of the wheat agreement of 1963 with
that country. At the same time, there was a
striking difference upwards in some of our
newer exports, especially those of manufactured goods.
Honourable senators, despite the buoyancy
in Canada's exports, there was an imbalance
on international payments, and the deficit was
$453 million. That figure was over $100 million less than the deficit on the same account
in 1963. That in itself is welcome, but it is
still not good enough. Unfortunately, the deficit with the United States widened considerably. This presents a challenge not only
to Government but to our producers and exporters. It will be a continuing challenge.
In both the public and private sectors of
the economy there was an upswing in capital
formation in 1964, reflecting the confidence
of the private sector in the general prospects
of the economy. In housing, and in both buildings and equipment for business, the increase
has been some 18 per cent. Capital investment
by government was increased by 15 per cent.
The total of public and private investment
exceeded the $10 billion of 1964. This exceeded the previous peak reached in 1957.
The confidence of the business community
continues this year, because the figures for
capital investment now available indicate that
it will be some 12 to 14 per cent higher than
it was in 1964.

May 4, 1965

Al of this adds up to the simple statement
that times are good, the economy is expanding, unemployment is falling, and Canada is
experiencing a growth gratifying, I am sure,
to every honourable senator. To sustain this
growth and, if possible, to increase its tempo,
must be the first objective of government.
The policies required must be practical. They
must be realistic. They must touch the areas
that can produce the most fruitful results.
Our products must be competitive both at
home and abroad. This means our costs must
be constantly subject to scrutiny. To achieve
this we must have a highly skilled labour
force. For this purpose training both in schools
and on jobs is essential. We must take advantage of the opportunities which increased
automation affords. Automation does not affect only the manufacturing industries. It
affects the resource industries as well. Canadians must be conscious of the need of training and of developing competitive skills in
what has become a very competitive world.
There is room in this country, honourable
senators, for redevelopment. Redevelopment
can affect our urban areas. It can affect also
the rural slum, the sub-marginal farm, and
Government must search out constructive
policies with respect to it. There is need for
action in both areas. As the legislative program develops, practical proposals designed
to achieve this purpose will be placed before
honourable senators. In the meantime, the
Government has established, as the gracious
Speech indicates, a special secretariat to coordinate the activities of every department
of government which can influence this
problem. This is not planning for pie in the
sky. What it is intended is to plan with those
engaged in the various sectors of the economy to meet the competitive requirements
for Canada in the sixties.
There is much to be done abroad as well.
All of us were gratified at the result of the
wheat sales to Russia and the increased
wheat sales to China in the past two years.
We have welcomed in this house the new
treaties with other eastern European countries. But bad weather in Russia and famine
in China are not to be expected year after
year. Windfall, in one sense, may be welcome
-and I intend no pun for the benefit of the
people from Toronto-but aggressive salesmanship, both public and private, are more
durable qualities.
The agreement in respect of the automotive industry recently concluded with the
United States is a heartening development,

May 4, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

and I hope, not only for our country but for
their country as well, that the Congress will
soon approve that proposal. It can do much
for our automotive industry at home, and it
should improve our position in the export
field. This step more significantly might be a
guide to what might be done in other sectors
of our economy.
We can hope also for a liberalization of
trade if the Kennedy Round at GATT succeeds. What is essential is the establishment
of a set of priorities for economic development and a steady determination to maintain
the pace of our economic growth.
When I spoke on the motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne
at the last session, I indicated that a measure would be introduced in the other place
to provide for the retirement of members of
the Senate upon their attaining their 75th
birthday. The proposal was on the Order
Paper for most of last session but was never
reached. Last week this proposal passed the
resolution stage, and the bill is now public.
If the bill should become law, then by its
provisions all future appointees to the Senate
will be required to retire at the age of 75,
or earlier if incapacitated by poor health, on
a pension to which they will contribute. That
pension will be based upon the same arrangements that prevail in the House of
Commons.
In addition, the bill provides the option for
existing senators who have been appointed
for life to retire if they so desire on certain
conditions. They may do so on the ground of
age once they have attained their 75th birthday. They may do so also on grounds of
health, whether they have attained the age
of 75 or not. Senators who enjoy a life tenure
and who retire will be granted an annuity
based upon two-thirds of the indemnity they
receive at the date of their retirement. Their
widows will be entitled to an annuity of onethird of that granted to a senator who exercises the option to retire. The annuity proposed for the senator with life tenure is
based upon arrangements currently applicable to judges of the superior courts of the
provinces. I trust the measure will reach us
in due course, and will carry the approval of
this honourable bouse.
I should add that it is proposed that a
retired senator will retain his position in the
Table of Precedence and that, although retired, he will be entitled to be described as
"The Honourable" for life.
Hon. Mr. Choquelte: That is not in the
present proposed act.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No.
The Speech also proposes the mobilization
of the talents of our young people to help
promote desirable social and economic purposes, both at home and abroad. This is not
new either here or in other countries. The
population explosion in our schools and colleges dictates the need for a growing supply
of instructors in all fields at home. So, too,
does the increase in training required to
meet our economic targets. The first report
of the Economic Council, the reading of
which I commend to all honourable senators,
greatly emphasizes this point.
Our position as a relatively opulent middle
power, however, casts an onus upon us to help
the many developing countries achieve a
status of social and economic stability. We
give material help of many kinds now. But
there is a limit to our capacity to do this.
There is also a question as to whether material gifts are best for the recipient countries
after the necessary minimum amount of material help has been supplied.
There is one area, however, in which
foreign aid of the proper kind is of special
value; that is, when we provide the means to
insure that thereafter the help provided will
enable that country to help itself. For this
purpose the area of education and of training
is unquestionably the most promising. When
good technical training is provided and, in
addition, when the basis for good technical
training, namely basic education, is provided,
we can help lay the foundation for selfsustaining progress within the developing
nation.
Some Il western countries have national
voluntary programs for overseas service. At
the moment they are supplying some 10,000
workers in the field of technical assistance
in over 80 countries. The best known may be
the American Peace Corps, and they have
many thousands in the field. Australia, New
Zealand, Denmark and Holland are also engaged in this pursuit. The British have about
1,000 people in this work.
I remember hearing Lord Listowel-the last
Governor General of Ghana before her independence-in speaking at the Economic
Committee of the NATO Parliamentarians a
few years ago, suggest that British foreign
officers whose services were being dispensed
with in many of the newly-independent
African countries might make useful contributions in other areas. He was speaking particularly of South America, and I believe his
idea was a sound one.

SENATE DEBATESMa4.96
In its modern formi the foreign missionary
work of the churches can be classified in this
way, although no one would suggest that
public funds be used to subsidize the Christian
mission. However, it is appropriate to observe
that many people who are sent abroad in the
interests of the missions, in fact, perform
work of the character I now discuss, almost
to the exclusion of their activity in the field
of religion.
A Canadian engineer or a business executîve who is sent by his company to explore
a foreign mining property or a hydroelectric
possibility is, in fact, rendering a form of
technical assistance abroad. So, too, is the
archaeologist.
Honourable senators, since 1961 an organized effort has been made to induce young
Canadians to devote a few years of their lives
to this work after they bave acquired some
professional competence at universities or
other training schools. The agency which does
this is known as the Canadian University
Service Overseas-CUSO. It is now an associate committee of the Canadian Universities
Foundation. CUSO now bas some 200 volunteers abroad. There are 39 in Asia, 122 in
Africa, 33 in the West Indies and seven in
South America. Among them are teachers,
agriculturists,
doctors, nurses, engineers,
foresters, social workers. Their modest pay is
roughly equivalerit to, the pay of their counterparts in the host country.
Recruitment and selection is adminîstered
by the Ottawa office of CUSO in co-operation
with some 40 faculty-student committees at
as many Canadian universities. Placement is
arranged in co-operation with authorities in
the host country.
Some indication of the success of the plan
derives from the fact that CUSO cannot keep
pace with the demands made upon it. In
1961, the first year, 17 Canadian volunteers
went out. This was increased to 62 the folIowing year. In 1963, 98 were added and in
1964, 148. Some, of course, have returned.
They have gone to some 23 countries. About
one-third of the total are French speaking.
The CUSO undertaking was originally
financed by local appeals in various parts of
Canada. In 1963 a relatively modest campaign
for funds was undertaken. In 1964 the Canadian Govemnmerit provided substantial help
in the formi of transportation.
It seems to me that there is an imaginative
appeal here for many able young Canadians.
They will, of course, be trained to supply the
most effective help possible to the people

May 4. 1965

among whomn they wlll live. Nothing would
be more futile than to send an underdeveloped volunteer to an underdeveloped
country.
I have read a few of the reports made by
some volunteers. Not only are they intensely
interesting, but one is filled with admiration
for the sacrifice and enterprise which they
refiect. I am sure, too, that notwithstanding:
all the frustrations these young people experience, they wiil derive a great satisfaction
from the help they give. However, they also
do much for themselves. They are acquiring a
graduate education on conditions and prospects in the lands they serve, lands with
customs and practices vastly different in
many cases from those they know at home.
When they return to take up their life work
among their own people, they will be in a
position to inform and embellish Canadian
public opinion in a way which could flot
otherwise have happened.
I think it fair to say that it is the CUSO
experiment which will form the basis for a
general approach to the same problem at
home and nbroad. Haîf a million dollars has
been provided fromn External Aid funds. It
will be undertaken by a corps of young Canadians, which the Speech appropriately calls
The Company of Young Canadians. This namne
bas an historic ring. When Canada was very
much of an underdeveloped country itsel!,
during the French regime, perhaps for a di!ferent purpose, "The Company of 100 Associates" was formed. Later, and especially in
the Northwest under British and Scottish
auspices, we had "The Company of Gentlemen Adventurers o! England trading into
Hudson's Bay."
While this name is likely to be highly
acceptable abroad, it may give rather special
emphasis to the work which can be done in
Canada. Within the federal jurisdiction alone,
in respect o! Indians and Eskimos, there is
need for energetic effort.
The gracious Speech from the Throne also
refers to a proposal to establish a Canada
Assistance Plan. Honourable senators are well
aware that a welfare program, because of the
divided jurisdiction in this country, involves
co-ordination between the provincial and
federal authorities. What appears to be required at this time is a co-ordinated approach
to public assistance.
The wel!are field is now a patchwork quilt.
There is the Old Age Assistance Act of 1951,
the Bind Persons Act of the same year, and
the Disabled Persons Act of 1954. These are

May 4. 1965

SENATE DEDATES

known as the categorical prograxns. In addition, there Is the Unemployznent Assistance
Act of 1956, the application of which was
substantially widened by axnendment i 1957.
Ail of these, of course, are joint programs.
The federal contribution la one-half of the
$75 a month maximum provided for recipients
o! Old Âge and Dlsabflity Assistance. It is
75 per cent of $75 montiily maximum available to blind persons. In respect o! Unemployment Assistance, the federal contribution is
50 per cent of the benefits payable to
reciplents.
Each of these programs la administered primarily on the basis of means. It is now proposed to discuss with the provinces a comprehensive programi which will be administered
on the basis of need. A dominion-provincial
conference is to be convened at the enid of
this month and wrnl consider this question.
Honourable senators, I believe it opportune
to proceed with such a programn at this time,
for at least three reasons. First, the provinces
are anxious ta see such an approacli to wellare implemented. Secondly, when the economy is i a period of expansion, as indeed
it is naw, it seema pravident to undertake
such a study. Thirdly, the recently adopted
Canada Pension Plan will have an important
bearing on the operation o! our welfare programs as they now stand.
As honourable senatars know, the Canada
Pension Plan gaes a long way towards providing some security in the period known as
old age. The Old Âge Security provisions
will be fully effective fromn age 65, in five
years. The wage-related portion of the plan
will become avaiýlable to persons retiring aver
the next 10 years, year by year.
Many people, hawever, who have flot been
able to provide for themselves and who are
unable ta take advantage in full o! the Canada
Pension Plan will present a problem ta themselves and to the country. Under the proposed assistance plan, people now over age 70
wrnl stand to benefit on the basis o! their
need. Those between the ages of 65 and
69 who are not adequately covered by the
Provisions of the Canada Pension Plan wil
also be assisted.
Honourable senators, may I canclude with
this short remark. It is important that the
comniittee work of the Senate be developed
as effectively as possible. I do not; know of
any other branch of our work which holds
a higher place i public esteem among people
who knaw about us, than the work which is
done by our standing comniittees and special

31

committees. The trouble is that enough of
the public do not understand and do not appreciate the value a! the parliamentary contribution made by the committees of this
honourable bouse.
The Coznmittee on Aging has been set up
and will shortly produce its report. We will
very soon refer the estimates to our Standing
Committee on Finance, as we did last year.
I expect that we will be asked shortly ta
nominate membership for the Joint Committee an Consumer Credit. We shail also be
asked to appoint senators to a joint cammittee to consider the state of penitentiaries
under the contraI of the Government of Canada.
Last session Senator Thorvaldson and 1
desired ta make the Committee on External Relations more active, but with
the kind of session it was, an opportunity was
not provided. However, Senator Thorvaldson
has been energetic in this field and he will
shortly indicate his imaginative intentions.
There will, of course, be other committees
whose chairmen will be anxious to undertake
special studies.
I urge honourable senators to do all they
can to ensure that these committees achieve
the same high standard of performance which
las characterized their work in the past.
1 hope also that there will be a very wide
participation in this debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hoilett, debate adjourned.

I do not want an immediate answer. Perhaps lie would be kind enough ta give an

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I will
deal with it now. The honourable senator
wishes to know about the superannuation
or retirement benefits for senators who are
not appointed for life.
These remarks do not apply to anybody in
the Senate at this time. When a new senator
is appointed he will contribute, as is the
case of the members in the other place, to
a pension fund. When he retires or dies he
or his estate will have an entitlement based
upon the contributions he has made to that
fund. That entitlement will be on the same
basis as the entitlement of members of the
other place.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: My question was not
at all in regard to future appointments. It
was in regard to all of us. I want to know
if any senator who presently sits in the

Senate will have a limitation of time in
which to make his choice for a pension. If
there is no limitation of time, we should
know about it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): I am
sorry. I realize now that the honourable
senator is asking about the right of senators
with the life tenure to apply for the annuity.
As the legislation stands now, I think there
is no limitation. I think all honourable senators with a life tenure have an option to
apply, if they meet the other conditions of
the act.

Hon. Malcolm Holleti: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to delay the
proceedings of this honourable house to any
great extent. The matter upon which I am
to speak bas been so thoroughly discussed
outside of this house and in the other place
that it is difficult to find a subject to talk
about.
First, let me congratulate the honourable
Senator Bourque and the honourable Senator
Aird for the masterly way in which they
moved and seconded the address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne.
I well remember, back in January, 1962,
when I followed the honourable Senator Méthot in the capacity of seconder of the motion for an address in reply, as did Senator
Aird on this occasion. I can tell you I felt
like a 12-year-old, I was so nervous. I do
not think the honourable senators who moved
and seconded this motion felt nearly as nerv-

ous as I did on that earlier occasion. After
listening yesterday to the splendid addresses
of Senator Choquette and the Leader of the

Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa
West), with all the facts and figures they
presented, I must say there remains very
little for an ordinary senator, as some of us
are-and we have been described differently
by some people in the other place-to say.
I have read the Speech from the Throne
very carefully and, to be honest, apart from
a half dozen or a dozen new items, it is
practically

22624-3

I said with regard to the Speech from the
Throne of this year, and that of 1964 and

1963 that many of the same items appeared in

SENATE DEBATESMa5,15

each. I arn going ta refer ta just a few items
ta show that what I arn saying is correct.
For example, the Speech fram the Throne
of this year carnies the following statement:
My ministers will continue their policy
of promating the strength and unity of
the Canadian Confederation . . . My
ministers will continue ta improve the
pracedures and practices invalved in the
federal relatianship so that ail Canadians
may feel equally served by Confederatian.
That is in the Speech that we are naw discussing. If we read the Speech from the
Throne delivered in 1964 we find these words:
My Gavernment will attempt ta, make
its full contribution . . . ta the strengthening of aur national unity thraugh a caoperative federalîsrn...
In the Speech from the Throne of 1963 we
read:

Government will in ahl things strive ta
strengthen and ta, give new direction ta
aur Canadian Confederatian. It will faster the spirit of co-operative federalism,
fully respecting the rights of the provinces ...

May 5, 1965

My Government therefore is developing a prograrn for the full utilization
of our human resources and the elimination of poverty among our people. It
will include improved measures for reglanai development, the re-employment
and training of workers, the redevelopment of rural areas, the assistance of
needy people...
In the Speech from the Throne of 1964 we
flnd this:
My Governrnent will attempt to make
ta
its full contribution. ... fostering the
full emplayment of aur people and the
efficient growth of aur econorny; and ta
broadening the opportunities for a good

Then, away back in 1963 the Speech from
the Throne contained these words:
Steady work is the basic need on
which men and women depend for the
wellbeing of themselves and their familles.
Unemployment, on the serious scale of
recent years, is therefore the most urgent of aur domestic prablemns. To provide the many new jobs that are needed
every year, we must create new industries. The fiscal and manetary policies
of the Gavernmnent will give priority ta
the encouragement of soundly-based industrial expansion.

In other words, we had it in 1963, again in
1964, and today we have it again. Unity-the
present Government stands for unity.

May 5 1965SENATE
DEBATES

My ministers will propose a variety
of measures which will further increase
employment and raise the standard of
living by strengthening and expanding
the primary and secondary industries of
Canada.
In 1963 the Speech from the Throne said that
there was ta be established a Department of
lndustry which wauld foster industrial expansion an*d ta which. industry could look
for consultation, stimulus and assistance.
The sarne applies to 1965 and goes back to
1964 and 1963. There was to be established an
area development agency ta work with the
provincial governents and other arganizations ta co-ordinate programs for parts of the
country where, because of chronic unemployment, a special thrust for development is
needed.
Here 1 would like ta say a word or two
about the province of Newfoundland from
which I came, and give you somne idea of
how beneficial these programns outllned in the
last three Speeches from the Throne were ta
that province. I arn going ta quate again from
APEC, the Newsletter from the Atlantic
Provinces Ecanomic Council.
Newfoundland, yau know, is part of Canada.
When we speak of Canada we include that
province ini the same way as we include
Prince Edward Island and ail other provinces.
The total of investments i Newfoundland
drapped from $261 million i 1962 ta $236
million in 1963. In 1964 it dropped ta $235
million. It is forecast that for 1965 the total
investment will be in the nature of $196
million. In other words, there has been a
drap of $65 million in the total yearly investments aver the period. It does nat appear ta
me, therefore, that these plans of the present
Govemnment did very much ta increase the
industrial development of Newfoundland.
Again I quote from the same newsletter:
Construction expenditures in Newfaundland are ta faîl from, $166 million ta
$138 million...

Mrs. Inman) will pardon my reference ta her
province-the new per capita investment was
$401 in 1962, and it dropped ta $388 in 1964.
In Newfoundland, new investment expenditures per capita in 1962 reached $556 per
capita and dropped ta $478 in 1964.
It will be seen, therefore, that the capital
investments i the twa provinces of Prince
Edward Island and Newfoundland have
dropped. Is that because the present f ederal
Government has been aiding the industrial
development of these areas, or what is the
cause? I suppose we can anly came ta, the
conclusion that the present Gavernment's
effort ta increase the economy of those twa
provinces, since it came into office, has not
been beneficial in bringing about increased.
prasperity and the provision of new jobs for
the unemployed.
Speaking of the unemployed, in the City of
St. John's, Newfoundland, a strike of longshoremen has been in existence for many
manths. The federal Governments of the past
few years have spent some $22 million ta
make the Port of St. John's really beautiful.
Awonderful job was done but, unfortunately,
this strike is holding up practically ail the
shipping in that area.
Since the Part of St. John's now cornes
under the jurisdiction of the federal Government, it should step in and make seriaus effort
ta put an end ta this strike, which is crippling
the whole port. The federal Governmnent has
flot done sa yet, ta my knowledge. Therefare,
1 wauld suggest ta the honourable Leader of
the Government that he mention this fact ta
the apprapriate member of the Government
who might take an interest ini it. 1 am nat
saying the members of the Gavermnent do

do samething ta end the drastic situation in

of agriculture in both eastern and western
Canada. You will be asked to consider
other measures to assist in the improvement of farms and of farm income.
Going back to 1963, the Speech from the
Throne said:
A new Department of Agriculture Act
will be placed before you, to provide for
two ministers in order that the needs of
agriculture in both eastern and western
Canada may receive closer attention. My
ministers will institute new programs
to make farming as a whole more stable
and more prosperous.
To what extent the plans of the Government
over the past two years have assisted those in
rural areas, I am not certain, but one thing
of which I am certain is that they neglected
to appoint the second minister.
Honourable senators, I am pointing out
these things to show that there has been laxity
somewhere since the present Government took
office in 1963. These are vital issues. Fisheries
is one of the most vital, not only to the Atlantic provinces and the western seaboard around
British Columbia, but all across Canada. Our
fisheries are most important when it comes
to the prosperity of our nation. In pointing
out these facts and in quoting these statements, I wish to show that the Government
seems to have a habit of repeating itself from
year to year. This is what they say about the
fisheries in the 1965 Speech from the Throne:
In order to raise the level of income of
Canadian fishermen, a measure will be
placed before you to provide for an expanded national fisheries development
program.
What did they say in 1964? In 1964, the
Government contented itself with promising
that they would
undertake a national fisheries development program, reflecting the outcome of
the Federal-Provincial Conference on
Fisheries.
This was exactly the same. Back in 1963,
when the present Government came into
office, they said in the Speech from the
Throne:
The government is initiating consultation with the provinces to work out a
program for national fishery development.
Those were three Speeches from the Throne
and each time the Government promised to
do something, which they have not done.

May 5, 1965

Anything which has been done regarding
fisheries has been done by the provinces
themselves.
You will notice, therefore, that since May
16, 1963, the federal Government has been
consulting with the provincial governments
concerned over the fisheries but, so far as I
know at the present time, no fisheries program has been initiated as a result of those
consultations. At least, it may have been
initiated but we have seen no results from it.
It does seem rather strange to those of us
who live in maritime areas that the Government will grant subsidies to farmers and
dairy producers-and we are not objecting
to that-on almost everything they produce;
but when it comes to subsidizing the fishermen on their production, it seems to me that
the fisherman, as yet, is the "forgotten Canadian." In Newfoundland recently, however,
an effort seems to be in process by the provincial government to assist the fishermen
to some extent.
In the Speech from the Throne of April 5
of this year, we find the following:
A measure will be placed before you
to amend the Canadian Citizenship ActIt should be quite a simple thing.
in order to ensure full
-particularly
equality of rights for all Canadian citizens wherever they were born.
In 1964, the Speech from the Throne said:
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Citizenship Act which will
ensure full equality of rights for al
Canadian citizens wherever they were
born.
Going back to the year 1963, the Speech
from the Throne said:
A change in the Citizenship Act will
be proposed to ensure full equality of
rights for all Canadian citizens wherever
they were born.
It does not matter where they were born.
We have had these three Speeches from the
Throne. In each case they promised to do
something about it. I am afraid some of these
citizens are likely to have passed on long
before the present Government comes to a
final decision on this matter.
Honourable senators, may I refer now to
the matter of Senate reform. It has been on
the carpet a long time. In recent days, you
have been subjected to al sorts of what I
call insults, nasty descriptions, by some of our
parliamentary colleagues in the other place.

May 5.1965

May 5 1965SENATE
DEBATES

You have been described as "party hacks."1
What is a party hack? As far as I can learn
from. Webster's dictionary, a hack is 'la horse
worn out in service." Besides that, it means
many things. In any case, you are ail "party
hacks."
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): "We"
are ail.
Han. Mr. Hollett: We are ail. Thanks for
the correction. Particularly you.
We have been described as "bagmen." 1
do flot know what a bagman is. I suppose he
is a man who carnies a bag to coilect money
or something like that. We are ail "bagmen."
Some of us have been described as "party fund
raisers." What a crime for you, honourable
senators, to have been guilty in years gone
by, when you were younger than you are
now, to have been fund raisers. Some have
stated openly in the other place that this
institution, the Senate, should be abolished
at once and for ail time.
Honourable senators, I do flot; know what
your feelings may be on this matter, but I,
at any rate, resent the description of "fund
raiser," "party hack"l or "bagman." 1 do not
know what the latter is, but I do not; like it,
and I do not want to meet that mustachioed
trout who stated these things. I do flot; want
to meet hlm. By the way, there is another
definition of a hack, which I intended to give
you. In one case, it is "a horse worn out in
service." But Webster gives "hack" also as
"a writer whose writings are mostly of
commercial success rather than of literary
quality." If you find anybody in the other
place who conforms to that description, you
will know to whom, I arn referring.
Honourable senators, getting back to our
so-called "reform," you wiil find in the present Speech from the Throne the following:
A measure to establish an age of retirement from the Senate will be placed
before you.
These words occur in the Speech from the
Throne with which we are now dealing, but
I would point out that the same words
appeared in the Speech from the Throne in
1964. In deallng with this subject we can
even go back as far as 1893 when the Liberals
at their convention-and you will excuse me
for saying this because I ar n ot talking in
any political sense-made the following commitment to the people of Canada:
The present constitution of the Senate
is inconsistent with federal principles in
our system of government and is in other

respects defective as it makes the Senate
independent of the people and uncontrolled by the public opinion of the
country and should be so amended as to
bring it into harmony with the principles of popular governrnent.
You wiil find, therefore, honourable senators, that your "reform" has been advocated
as far back as 70-odd years ago. Some of you
may flot have been around then, but I was. I
arn one of these old "bagmen" or "1party
hacks." Even at that time the Liberals
wanted to reform. the Senate. I do flot; blame
them; we need reform. Every institution
needs a littie reforrn frorn year to year. But 1
would say this: If reform is needed anywhere, it is needed in the other place. Great
reforms are needed there, and I wish the
present Government would do something
about it.
There are many other instances in the
present Speech from the Throne which are
but repetitions of programs which were supposed to be initiated two years ago, and it
is to bring these items to your attention that
I have quoted so freely from the last three
Speeches from the Throne.
I could comment on the Government's plan
for a Canada Development Corporation, but
I would prefer to leave this very serious proposai to be dealt with by men who are far
more familiar with financial matters than I
arn. To the mind of a layman, however, I
fear the proposal is fraught with ail sorts of
dangers and wiil make great changes in our
way of hf e. 1 doubt if these changes wiil be
for the betterment of our people in Canada.
To me it seems to be a first step towards the
nationalization. of ahl industry, and if I were
a businessman in this country today, I would
fight to rny financial death to prevent anything which leans towards nationalization.
I hesitate to detain you longer, honourable
senators, but I want to say a word about the
devaluation of the dollar, that terrible crime
committed by the former federal Government. We ail well rernember how that Government was criticized. Did I say criticized?
I should say crucified, for the very audacity
of devaluing the dollar. We all heard the
expression "the Diefendollar." It was a
dreadful thing to do. Ahl across Canada people
were going to be ruined; small businesses
were going to be finished; big businesses were
going to be crippled. We ail know what happened. In this connection I want to quote
from page 6 of the Budget papers presented
by the Honourable Walter L. Gordon, Min-

SENATE DEBATES

ister of Finance, in connection with the
Budget for 1965-66.
Exports, of course, played a very important part in the general advance of
1964.
We all admit there was an advance.
Apart from the special wheat salesI hope you will excuse me for injecting
And
another remark here, but in that regard you
will remember the criticism levelled at the
former Government because of the sales of
wheat to communist countries. Those criticisms were made by people in the present
Government. They did not like it at that
time, but now they have doubled those sales.
Apart from the special wheat sales,
there was steady growth in most of the
major traditional exports, the products
of our mines and forests. This was a
reflection of continued strength in the
foreign markets for our products. At the
same time, there was a striking advance
in some of the newer exports, especially
manufactured goods. Exporters have
been helped in this field not only by the
lower value of the Canadian dollar in
international markets since 1962, followed by relative cost and price stability,
but also by increased use of export financing facilities.
I quote that to show that the devaluation
of the dollar was not such a dastardly thing
after all. It was something that had to be
done, and it was done. But, as I have said,
certain people were more or less crucified
because they had the courage to do it.
Honourable senators, I come now to another matter which worries me somewhat.
Newfoundland has-and it is part of Canada-in Labrador the celebrated Hamilton Falls,
now renamed Churchill Falls. If these falls
were properly developed and utilized they
could supply sufficient power to meet the
requirements of practically all of Canada.
Now, much has been said in the past, honourable senators, about unity in Canada; and in
my view, this is one area where there should
be unity rather than disunity. There we have
a power potential capable of supplying al
eastern Canada and some of the United
States as well, according to what I am told,
but its development is being blocked.
Honourable senators, I would appeal to al]
Canadians in every province for that unity
which is necessary for Canada to develop
this undertaking. Let us be Canadians all,
not English-speaking, not French-speaking,

May 5, 1965

not Dutch-speaking, and so on,-let us be
simply Canadians. If we achieve this, then
there will be no problems whatever about
the development of the Churchill Falls. Let
us be Canadians as distinct from being merely
Newfoundlanders or Quebecers or New
Brunswickers and so on. If we are to become
a great nation, and it is the prayer of all of us
that we shall, then we must unite and be
Canadians. We must not and cannot be provincially bound, but must work together to
achieve this goal of unity. What does it matter what language a man speaks? We have
here in Canada people from every country
in the world, Chinese, Japanese, Irish, Dutch,
English, French, and Russians. Why cannot
we all be Canadians? Why cannot we also
rise above our merely provincial identities?
Let me return for a moment to the reform
of the Senate. If they want to reform us, so

much the better; I hope it will be an improvement. But as I look around me, honourable senators, I see men who were here many
years before I came here and who are many
years older than I am, and I see them and
know them as the ablest men it has ever
been my privilege to meet. I think it would
be disastrous to throw these men out or to
ask them to retire. They are the brains of the
Senate. I would to God that when I become
as old as they are-though I am old nowI hope I shall have retained my mentality
and ability to even a proportion of the extent
to which they have retained theirs. They are
the men upon whom the structure of this
Senate depends; they have brains and they
know how to use them. Why in the name of
Heaven should we have to get rid of them?
Why should it be necessary to get rid of any
of us? I hope the proposal for reform will be
a sensible one and that you and I will be able
to vote for it when it comes before us.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
may I first congratulate the mover and
seconder of the Address for their eloquence
and for the subject matter of their speeches.
I would also like to pay tribute to the other
honourable senators who have already spoken
in this debate. The speeches have been of
a very high standard up to the present, and
I hope that I shall be able to contribute something of value on one particular subject.
In the speeches that have already been
made I have detected some partisanship. I
shall not attempt to reply to any of the
charges that have been made, but I hope it is
not out of order for me to say that I and
I think the great majority of the men and

people who are not insured, and the province
is trying to induce them to become insured.
They are mostly young people who simply
do not pay much attention to it or do not
feel the need for this protection.
According to the Canadian Tax Foundation,
about $466 million is paid annually by people
for medical services, and the Royal Commission on Health Services proposes to transfer that amount from the private to the
public sector. That is, instead of it being
paid by the person who receives the services,
it will be paid by the taxpayers of the country in general. Based on 1963 prices, the
personal income tax revenue of that year
and the cost of medical care, the taxpayer
would have to pay 50 per cent more in income
tax to meet that obligation.
The Hall Commission feels that the Government and the people of Canada can afford
it, provided that actual incomes increase
greatly, that the Government revenues increase rapidly, and that revenues increase
more rapidly than expenditures. The uncertain part of that is that most governments
spend all they can get by way of revenue,
and this service would be a tax burden.
There are certain conditions the Medical
Association would like to see included in any
agreement. First, they would like to see no
interference with private practice. They would
like the doctors to be permitted to practice
outside of any organization. They would like
the patient to be able to make an arrangement with a doctor without losing his benefits.
Then there is the whole question of who
pays the first dollar or so; that is, the coinsurance or the deductible features. This is
a prominent part of the agreement in Australia, but it is hard to put into operation.
Indigents and people who are short of money
simply cannot provide the first amounts. It
would be very confusing, and this is a point
upon which the doctors would like some
negotiation and a certain amount of understanding.
The doctors all agree that the Royal Commission on Health has made an exhaustive
and valuable report. The fact that the doctors
disagree with one part-that is, as to the
best method of getting the best medical services available for everybody-does not in
any way detract from their appreciation of
the great value of the findings of the commission. They agree with the commission in
almost every other recommendation it made,
but they feel that some things are more important than others.
I wonder if any honourable senator has had

May 5, 1965

occasion to make an appointment with a
doctor or a dentist lately. If he or she has,
they probably obtained an appointment for
a day next week or the week after. More
doctors are required at the present time, and
in the country three or four more medical
colleges are needed to graduate the necessary
number of doctors. There are bright, wellqualified young men today who cannot obtain
entrance to a medical college.
I should like to mention also the whole
question of research. Today we have heart
disease, cancer and strokes as the captains of
the men of death, and a united onslaught
against these diseases towards finding better
means of treating them or curing them would
be a great blessing. Much has been accomplished in the recent past with respect to
blood diseases, infectious diseases, childhood
diseases and so on, and these other great
scourges could be brought under control by
united action.
For instance, many experimenters are convinced that the eating of unsaturated animal
fats tends to bring on disease of the blood
vessels, but others say that that is not according to their findings. The whole problem lies
in the shadowy land of doubt and conjecture,
and more research is needed to ascertain
whether the eating of fats and cholesterol
products does cause arterial disease. No one
feels sure enough about it today to make a
definite statement, or to advise all people to
avoid these foods.
There is a serious shortage of hospital beds.
In this city it may take three or four months
for a hospital bed to become available to a
person whose condition is such that it is not
imperative that he enters hospital immediately.
There are many elderly people in this
country, and some of them are in a sad state.
More shelters are needed for them. An old
person should no longer be required to sit
beside the kitchen stove. He should be in a
shelter where he can stay in dignity and comfort, and where loneliness and boredom will
not shorten his days.
There are many things that are urgent, and
these problems should be looked at in the
order of their priority. It is my hope that
all Canadian people will be able to live in
happiness and contentment as a result of
this welfare measure.

EDUCATION
QUESTION OF JURISDICTION TO SIGN
TREATIES-NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I wish to give oral notice of an
inquiry which I intend to make on Tuesday
next. It is as follows:
Whereas, in virtue of the B.N.A. Act,
the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction
concerning education, does the Government of Canada have exclusive jurisdiction for signing treaties with foreign
countries concerning education, and, if
so, in virtue of what authority?
COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS
MOTION TO EMPOWER COMMITTEE TO MAKE
INQUIRY-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved, pursuant to notice:
That the Standing Committee on External Relations be authorized to inquire
into the question of Commonwealth relationships with particular reference to the
position of Canada within the Commonwealth;
22624-4

That the Committee have power to
send for persons, papers and records, and
to sit during sittings and adjournments
of the Senate; and
That the Committee be instructed to
report to the House from time to time.
He said: Honourable senators, for some
time views have been expressed in this house
to the effect that the Standing Committee
on External Relations might serve a beneficial
purpose by taking under advisement some
phase of Canada's external relationships.
There exist now many of these relationships
in regard to the United Nations organization
and its many agencies, as well as innumerable
others in most parts of the world.
There are three main reasons for selecting
the topic contained in the motion now before
us. Firstly, by virtue of the size, wealth,
geography and growing strength of Canada as
a nation, it is one of the senior partners of
this grouping of nations referred to as the
Commonwealth. Secondly, I am assured that
there are in many circles in Canada, including the universities, a growing interest in the
question of just what our ever-changing
Commonwealth relationships consist of, and
how they can be translated into greater usefulness in a disorderly world. Thirdly, we in
this age are prone to forget that the form and
structure of the Commonwealth which emerged after the First World War, and resulted
from the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, resulted from ideas developed
in Canada and which were so ably put forward at various Imperial Conferences by
three Canadian Prime Ministers, namely,
Borden, Meighen and King.
In this regard may I remind the house that
although the Statute of Westminster applied
only to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South
Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland, nevertheless after the Second World
War, in 1947 and 1948, India, Pakistan and
Ceylon, by distinct Acts similar in principle
to the Statute of Westminster, became members of the Commonwealth as it was then
constituted. The point I am making here is
that the terms under which these three countries joined the Commonwealth in 1947 and
1948 were identical in principle with those of
the Statute of Westminster.
One thing seems clear, however, that Canada plays a most important role in the sphere
of Commonwealth relationships, and it may
be of considerable value for Canadians to
put on display in the manner proposed in this

SENATE DEBATES
motion Canada's actual position within the
Commonwealth.
It will be observed that the resolution is
broad and general in scope. Hence, it is perhaps easy to believe that the proposed inquiry
could become merely an exercise in futility,
and without tangible results. On the other
hand, the Commonwealth is very much a fact
of Canadian life. Canada spends large sums
of money on projects that are of the Commonwealth. Furthermore, only in July of last
year at a meeting of Commonwealth Prime
Ministers an important new step was determined upon, namely, the formation of a
Commonwealth Secretariat. This is a step that
has been consistently opposed by Canadian
statesmen for two or three generations, but
which now appears to be accepted without too
much controversy.
Many significant developments are responsible for this departure from previous policy,
and assuredly it would be of interest to our
committee to consider the matter of these
changed conditions.
I might remark here that we are all aware
of the fact that a conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers is to be held in June
of this year, in London, at which the Canadian Prime Minister will, as usual, be an
important figure.
A very few years ago Canada's then Prime
Minister, seemingly with an all-party Canadian approval, took a firm stand with reference to the doctrine of apartheid in South
Africa, and the question of whether the racial
policies of the South African Government
were consistent with continued membership
by that country in the Commonwealth. Repercussions of that stand were, in important
places in the Commonwealth, anything but
friendly, indeed hostile.
About three years ago Canadian newspapers
abounded with news of the United Kingdom's
bid to join the European Economic Community, generally referred to as the Common
Market. Rightly or wrongly, Canada seemed
to be deeply concerned-perhaps on both
sides of the question-as to the outcome of
this endeavour by the senior partner in the
Commonwealth. For instance, did this effort
by the United Kingdom mean that this senior
partner had no further interest in preserving
the Commonwealth?
I merely refer to these isolated instances
to indicate that Commonwealth affairs are
still seemingly important to Canada. Nevertheless, as we all know, the Commonwealth
today is much changed from the Commonwealth of 1948, namely, just after the admis-

May 6, 1965

sion of India, Pakistan and Ceylon as
partners in it. The Commonwealth has now
been expanded to include many other countries-Ghana, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone,
Tanzia, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago,
Uganda, Kenya, the Federation of Malaysia;
it includes also various colonies of Great
Britain and Protectorates, as well as several
Territories under trusteeship.
In regard to these additions to the Commonwealth, it is of interest to recall that the
Imperial Conference of 1926, on whose deliberations the Statute of Westminster was
based, defined Great Britain and the Dominions, as they were then called, as:
-autonomous
communities within the
British Empire, equal in status, in no way
subordinate one to another in any aspect
of their domestic or foreign affairs,
though united by a common allegiance
to the Crown and freely associated as
members of the British Commonwealth
of Nations.
It would greatly stretch one's imagination
that this definition can include all of the
newer membership of the Commonwealth.
To complete the record of membership in
the Commonwealth, I just wish to recall the
fact that South Africa withdrew from the
Commonwealth in 1961 on the issue of racial
discrimination.
These matters I have referred to are, it
is true, of a general character, and some honourable senators have suggested to me that
the committee must not bury itself in generalities, but rather let it get down to consideration of specific problems. That is quite right;
otherwise, its work might become an exercise
in futility.
So what are some of the specific problems
that should come before the committee? There
is indeed no shortage of them. It may, and no
doubt will, be proposed that the committee
study the contemporary Commonwealth of
Nations as an institution, as an aspect of
Canada's external relations, and as a group
of nations representative of all continents, in
relation to which arise such important international questions as economic and technical
assistance, trade between developed and developing countries, decolonization and racial
tensions.
It might also study the present state and
nature of the Commonwealth with reference
to its institutions for consultation and collaboration, the special problems in the various
areas, intra-Commonwealth disagreements,
commercial and financial relations, security

SENATE DEBATES

May 6, 1965

questions, relations between developed and
developing, aligned and neutralist nations, and
in particular Canada's interests, commitments
and policies in the Commonwealth and including perhaps the French-speaking countries
of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean which were
former colonies of France.
Here is a thought to which little, but some,
deliberation has been given-and why should
we not give some thought to such a development? We in Canada are in fact a biracial and
bicultural people, and as such we may in time
want to fulfil our bicultural mission to the
extent of showing concern and of lending
assistance to those developing countries of
Africa, Asia and the Caribbean where the
French language is spoken. This is not a new
thought; it has already been developed to the
extent that our program of aid to underdeveloped countries has been extended to the
French-speaking new nations that I have just
referred to. They are now receiving aid from
Canada in a manner similar to that extended
to countries of the Commonwealth.
For those who may perhaps feel that this
resolution may have less meaning to people
in French Canada than in other parts, let me
quote the words of the Premier of Quebec
on a certain day last October. Mr. Lesage said:
... the Commonwealth remains, for the
whole world, an inspiring example of how
nations can get along together despite
differences in outlook and of how they
can pursue common objectives, albeit by
differing

ways

and means. And ... the

Commonwealth, in the relations that exist
between its various members, affords to
Canadians a striking illustration of collaboration based, not upon uniformity,
but of a community of purpose born of
mutual respect and understanding.
I would now like to say a few words about
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. One of the numerous governmental organizations of the Commonwealth is the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.
This association came into being in the years
1948 and 1949, and was a successor to the
former Empire Parliamentary Association
which had been formed as long ago as 1911.
It should be of great interest to us in this house
to recall that in 1949 the General Council of
the association met in Ottawa and that its
President at that time was none other than
our colleague, Senator Roebuck, and that
later, in 1950, Senator Roebuck presided at a
general conference which was held in New
Zealand in that year and at which the new
constitution of this body was adopted.
22624-41

The last conference of the C.P.A. was held
in Kingston, Jamaica, in November 1964;
and among other delegates to this conference
from Canada were two members of this house,
Senator Roebuck and Senator Grosart. I have
read the speeches made by these colleagues
which are contained in the report of the proceedings of the conference, and I want to say
that their remarks are of a high order and
that these gentlemen deserve the commendation of this house for the capable manner in
which they represented this body at the conference.
It is of interest also to observe that there
were represented at this conference no less
than 66 parliaments of the Commonwealth,
coming from 38 states and representing approximately 750 million people.
Another point of interest to us is that the
1966 meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association will be held in Canada.
This pending event may have had something
to do with the selection of this topic of the
Commonwealth for the consideration of the
Standing Committee on External Relations.
I commend this resolution to the house.
Before it goes to committee, I am sure that
it would be of much value if other senators
saw fit to express their views upon the merit
or otherwise of this project.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, may I, in the first instance, thank
my colleague who has just spoken for the
kind remarks he has made with regard to
Senator Grosart and myself. May I also
compliment him on giving this incisive personal thought to this great subject of the
Commonwealth.
Too long has the Standing Committee on
External Relations been quiescent. I am sure
other honourable senators will remember, as
I do, that the one activity of this committee
has been the excellent speeches heard from
Senator Gouin when he was its chairman.
Otherwise it has been stagnant. In my view
it is the most important, or one of the most
important, of the standing committees of the
Senate. Therefore, I compliment the honourable senator who has just spoken for his
incisive thought, for the originality of his
approach and for the prospect of something
worth while to come from this committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, debate
adjourned.

EXCISE TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. John J. Connolly: I have asked the
honourable Senator Cook to move second
reading of this bill.
Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading
of Bill C-96, to amend an act to amend the
Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, those of you
who followed the proceedings in the other
place during the passage of the supplementary
estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1965 will remember that there were two $1
votes which were not proceeded with by the
Government at that time. These votes were
the subject of some critical comment, not
because of the purpose of the votes themselves, but because it was considered that
what was to be accomplished should be done
by way of separate legislation, and not by
way of a vote in the supplementary estimates.
The Government accepted this view and
in due course Bill C-96, which deals with
one of these votes, namely Vote 3d, was
passed in the other place without debate and
without division.
Bill C-96 when enacted makes a quite
simple amendment to the Excise Tax Act.
You will recall that the Excise Tax Act
was amended in 1963 to provide that the sales
tax exemption for production machinery and
for certain building materials be withdrawn
or discontinued. The 1963 amendment also
provided that in the case of contracts entered
into before June 13, 1963, a person who was
obliged to pay the sales tax on materials
called for by the contract, but who could not
increase the price specified in the contract,
would be entitled to relief. The period during
which relief could be claimed ended on
December 31, 1964.
It has now been brought to the attention
of the Government that a few contracts were
not completed by December 31, 1964, and it
has been decided that to be fair a refund
should be permitted in the case of these
contracts on the same basis as for those completed before the December 31, 1964 deadline.
The legislation being amended is in two
parts. One speaks of a "refund of tax" and
the other part refers to a "payment of an
amount equal to tax." This is necessary

May 6, 1965

because contractors in a strict sense are not
usually the taxpayers under the Excise Tax
Act. They have to construct buildings or other
structures under a contract, and to do so they
have to buy building materials which became
subject to sales tax on June 14, 1963. The
taxpayer in the case of these building materials manufactured in Canada is the manufacturer of the materials. The contractor
merely pays a higher price because the sales
tax payable by the manufacturer has been
added to the selling price of the goods he
sells. However, the person caught between a
firm price contract and additional taximposed costs is the contractor and he is the
person to whom the law authorizes a payment
of an amount equal to tax.
On the other hand, the manufacturer or
importer of a machine, which under a contract he has to provide at a stipulated price,
is a taxpayer under the Excise Act. The law
authorizes that a refund of tax may be made
to such persons caught between a requirement under a contract and the requirement
to pay tax.
In all cases the firm price contract must
have been entered into before June 13, 1963,
and this is not being changed. The requirement that the goods must be sold and delivered before December 31, 1964 is now to
be withdrawn.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Cook: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, is
this bill not going to a committee? I think it
ought to. It is not at all simple to me. I
would like to see it referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): If the
honourable senator feels it should be referred to committee, there is no objection
whatever. I am sure Senator Cook will not
object. This bill, as my honourable friend has
said, deals with matters which were included
in the supplementary estimates and which
were subsequently withdrawn. If they had
remained in the supplementary estimates
they would not have gone to a committee.
However, as I have said, if Senator Roebuck
wishes the bill to go to committee, there is
certainly no objection.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think that should be
done.

BILL TO AMEND CERTAIN ACTS-SECOND

READING
Hon. John J. Connolly: I have asked the
honourable Senator Cook to move second
reading of this bill.
Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading
of Bill C-97, to amend certain acts respecting
the superannuation of persons employed in
the Public Service, members of the Canadian
Forces and members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-97
deals with the second item in the supplementary estimates to which I made reference
a few moments ago in speaking on Bill C-96.
The second $1 vote was Vote 18d under the
heading of Government administration. In this
case also there was no objection to the purpose of the vote, and accordingly Bill C-97
was also passed in the other place without
debate and without division.
Bill C-97 amends three acts, all of which
deal with the superannuation accounts of (i)
the Public Service, (ii) the Canadian
and (iii) the Royal Canadian Mounted Forces,'
Police.
As I understand the provisions of the
bill, no new pension rights are conferred, but
the bll is required to give effect to the Government's policy to amortize new deficiencies
in the various superannuation accounts by
crediting the amount of the deflciency as a
deferred charge and amortizing it over a
five-year period commencing with the year in
which. the amount of the deficiency becomes
known.
Section 4 is, I understand, for the purpose
of correcting some injustices which may have
arisen in a few cases where civil servants
received erroneous advice regarding the contributions which they were obliged to make,
and the Governor in Council is now empowered to make regulations to adjust any such
injustice.
Section 5 is to give effect to a decision by
the Treasury Board that the staff of the
Canadian Council of Resource Ministers
should be brought under the Public Service
Superannuation Act, provided that the Council pays the employer's share of the current
contributions required under that Act.
The Council has subsequently requested
that parallel action be taken to make the

Hon. Mr. Cook: Honourable senators, unless any honourable senator wishes to refer
the bill to committee, 1 would move that it

reading at the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This bill is somewhat
sirnilar to the one we have just considered;
it too arises from the supplementary estimates. We have no cause to hurry at the
present moment-we are not about to adjourn or anything of that kind-and I can
see no reason why the bill should not be
referred to a committee. I would like to
hear a further explanation of it by the officials ini charge. Offhand, it seems to me it
is a most necessary bull and that what seem,
to be injustices in connection with the
Superannuation Act should be corrected, but
1 see no reason for not referring it to coinmittee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Cook, bull referred

PRIVATE BILLS
THE

ALGOMA CENTRAL AND HUDSON
RAILWAY COMPANY-SECOND
READING

BAY

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved the second
reading of Bill S-4, respecting The Algoma
Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company.
lIe said: Honourable senators, The Algoma
Central Railway has had two bis before us
in recent years. In 1958 Parliament; ratified
a scheme of arrangement reorganizing the
capital structure of the company, consequent
upon many years of rather troubled and
difficuit financial conditions. That reorganization proved successful, and in 1960 Parliament passed a further act completing the
changeover fromn control by the bondholders
of the company, which. control had been in
effect for something like 40 years, making
effective the control by the shareholders of

SENATE DEBATES

the company, so that from that time on the
company operated in the usual way, under
shareholders and directors selected by the
shareholders. The company has continued to
progress and expand, and this bill now before us is, in part, evidence of that expansion.
The Algoma Central Railway is a railway
running north from Sault Ste. Marie, crossing
the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway at Franz, and continuing on and joining
the main line of the Canadian National Railways at Hearst. It also bas a branch line
running from the Helen Mine to Michipicoten
Harbour on Lake Superior, and it has some
seven cargo vessels on the Great Lakes.
Dealing with the bill itself, clause 1 changes
the name of the company. The words "Hudson
Bay" are dropped. These now have no significance for the company and indeed constitute
a misnomer, as the railway does not go to
Hudson Bay.
The word "Company" has also been dropped
from the title, because the railway is
popularly and commonly known as The
Algoma Central Railway, and its trade name
design in initial form is A.C.R. The wording
of subsection 2 of clause 1 makes it perfectly
clear that the change in name does not affect
the rights or liabilities of the company.
Clause 2 is a result of the reorganization
that took place in 1958. The company was
authorized to issue, among other securities,
250,000 preferred shares. Actually, only
80,000 were issued, and since that time these
shares have either been paid off or have been
converted into common shares. As there is
no provision in its legislation similar to the
provisions in the Companies Act dealing
with companies incorporated under the Companies Act, it is necessary to have this clause
2 reducing the preferred shares and the
capital stock of the company by the 80,000
preferred shares that have been paid off or
converted.
Clause 3 deals with that part of the preferred stock which was redeemed in cash.
The amount in dollars so redeemed was
$508,800. That redemption took place out of
the ascertained profits of the company, but
without any special provision the result was
to create a capital surplus, and clause 3 now
returns that capital surplus of $508,800 to
earned surplus, where it was, as the result
of the ascertained profits.
Clause 4, as explained in the explanatory
note, is to provide that in the case of future
redemptions this same reduction of capital
would take place without it being necessary

May 6, 1965

for the company to come back to Parliament
for a special act to cover a similar situation.
Clause 5 removes a limitation on the total
obligations of the company. This was a limitation of some $11 million which the company
voluntarily put upon itself at the time of
the reorganization in 1958. In view of the
progress that has been made since then, it is
felt that this limitation upon its borrowing
powers is no longer appropriate.
Clause 6 is ancillary to clause 5, and gives
to the directors similar powers as to future
borrowings as the company had with respect
to its limited borrowing power under the act
of 1958. This additional authority may now
be implemented by the directors. I may say
that all provisions of this bill have been
ratified by a special meeting of the shareholders. Consequently, clause 7 provides that
no further approval by the holders of shares
of the company shall be required with respect
to the issuance of bonds authorized by the
act.
There are two corrections I should make
to the explanatory note to clause 7. There
is a reference there to a special meeting of
the shareholders on December 4, 1964. That
is a clerical error, and the date should be
December 5, 1964.
The explanatory note goes on to say that
the application to Parliament was approved
unanimously. The word "unanimously" should
be struck out. There was one shareholder
owning ten shares voting by proxy who was
recorded as voting against the motion when
there seemed to be some doubt as to just
what was the effect of his proxy.
These changes in that explanatory note
do not affect the bill, and do not require
further reprinting of it. However, in any
additional printing the corrections will be
made.
Clause 8 adds to the company's powers the
ancillary and incidental powers provided for
in subsection (1) of section 14 of the Companies Act. These are powers of a general
character that are granted to companies incorporated by Letters Patent under that act.
They are numerous. There are probably 30
different provisions, and I have not studied
them in detail myself to see how far all of
them are or should be made applicable to
this company. I suggest that while there is
no objection in principle to this section,
it is something upon which we ought to have
some further information when the bill
reaches the committee stage.

May 6, 1965

May 6 1965SENATE
DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Every
company incorporated by Letters Patent has
such powers.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Yes, but they may be
restricted, and one reason for having a statutory company is that it does differ in certain
aspects from a Letters Patent company. It
ia just a matter of checking ta make sure.
I should mention that the bull has been
before aur Parliamentary Counsel and, according ta my information, as far as he la
concerned it is in order.
Clause 9 provides that the Railway Act
shall stili apply to this railway, except in
s0 far as any of its provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this bill.
That completes my explanation. If the bill
receive second reading I propose to move
that it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications.
Hon. A. K<. Hugessen: Perhaps the House
would allow me to indulge in a short reminiscence. Mention of the name of The Algoma
Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company
brings back to my mind something that happened 34 years ago.
This railway company is extremely prosperous at the present time, but during
the flrst 30 or 40 years of this century it
went through many financial difficulties, and
it was consistently reorganized every few
years. In 1931 I was one of the counsel
engaged in such a reorganization, and we
came to Parliament at that time, as my
honourable friend is coming to, Parliament
today, with a bill changing the company's
capital structure. I was a young counsel at
the time, and, so far as I can recail, the only
member of the Senate still with us who was
present at the meetings of the committee
which. considered the bill of that year is
my honourable friend sitting opposite, Senator Aseltine.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, you have been very kind to my friend
in allowing him to reminisce, and perhaps
the samne indulgence may be extended to
me.
I am pleased at the progress made by the
railroad as indicated ini the clear and lucid
explanation given by my friend Senator
Leonard, the sponsor of the bill. My memory
goes back quite a number of years to a time
when I was the nominee of the men on a
conciliation board which brought about an
agreement between them and the management. What was ta my mind remarkable
about it, and which has ahways stuck in my
memory, was the fact that after I got back

to Toronto both the men and the company
wrote thanking me for the part I had played.
That is the only time I can remember when
both the employer and the employees feit
grateful for my efforts.
That agreement ran out in due season. I
cannot remember the date, but it ran for a
number of years. A second meeting was held
of a conciliation board of which I had the
honour to be a member, once more as the
nominee of the men. The resuit bas been,
of course, that I have had a most kindly
remembrance of and feeling towards both
the company and its empioyees. I rise now
only ta express my pleasure at the progress
that appears to have been made over the
years in the management and conduct of this
raihway company, and ta say ta my fellow
senators-and with this I am sure they will
ail agree-that if there is anything we can
do to hring about greater progress and more
success ta this railway company then we are
most happy ta do it.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, 1
have no such competence as Senators Hugessen and Roebuck to reminisce. I rise merely
ta ask Senator Leonard if there is anything he
wishes ta say as to the necessity or wisdom
for the retroactive provision in clause 8? The
clause provides:
It is hereby dechared and enacted that
the company bas and always has had...
certain powers.
Hon. Mr. Leanard: Honourable senators,
that is a good question. In the time I had in
which ta deal with this matter I asked the
company's counsel what it had i mind in
connection with clause 8. The answer I was
given was that it was thought wise for the
company ta have these general powers. I do
not think I can give any better answer than
that. I suggest that this section might be
given fuither scrutiny when it is dealt with
in committee. That question could and, in fact,
should be asked at that time.
Motion agreed ta and bill read second time.

MUTTART

MORTGAGE CORPORATIONSECOND READING

Hon. Daniel A. Lang moved the second
reading of Bill S-6, respecting Muttart Mortgage Corporation.

SENATE DEBATESMa6,15
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
simple bill and is in the usual form providing for a change of corporate name, and a
French equivalent of the new name.
Muttart Mortgage Corporation is a comnpany incorporated under the Loan Companies
Act. Honourable senators will recali that
during the hast session that act was amended
to give the Secretary of State power to approve of French equivalents of corporate
names, thus removing that procedure from
the legisiative process. However, this bill not
only provides for a French equivalent of
the company's name but also changes the
name of the company, which does require
legislation.
This company was originally incorporated
under the Letters Patent Act of Canada in
1958. Its purpose was to purchase mortgage
boans on dwellings built by construction firms
under the control of Mr. Merrili D. Muttart,
a successful builder in Western Canada.
For some time now the company bas been
operating in a wider field than it originally
anticipated. Although there are stili only
four sharebolders in the company, apart from
the directors' qualifying shares outstanding,
the widening scope of the company's activities makes the personal connotation of the
founder's name less appropriate in the company's operations.
I amn advised by the Superintendent of Insurance that tbe new naine provided for in
this bill, namely, Cambrian Mortgage Corporation, is not objectionable and is acceptable for use by the company.
Honourable senators, clause 1 of the bill
is the actual operative clause, providing for
changing the name of the company to Cambrian Mortgage Corporation, and for adding
a French version to the name. Clause 2 is
the usual clause which safeguards the existing rigbts and liabilities of the company and
ensures that these are flot affected by the
change of name.
If this bill receives second reading, I shal
move that it he referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator what is the significance of the
word "Cambrian"? Does it refer to Wales
or to the Cambrian Shield, that great rock
shield across the northern part of Ontario
into Manitoba? Has the namne any significance?
Hon. Mr. Lang: I think aIl honourable
senators are aware of the difficulty experienced these days by companies in choosing a

May 6, 1865

name which does not become confused with
any other naine in use. I arn advised that
originally this company submitted a list of
about il namnes for search by the Secretary
of State, none of which were acceptable because of possible confusion with namnes of
other companies. Further names were submitted, and from them this appeared to be
the only one which was flot objected to by
the office of the Secretary of State. For that
reason I think it is most likely that the name
has no particular significance.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY AND
GREAT NORTHERN PACIFIC & BURLINGTON
LINES, INC.-SECOND READING

Hon. Thornas Reid moved the second reading of Bill S-5, respecting Great Northern
Railway Company and Great Northern
Pacific & Burlington Lines, Inc.
He said: Honourable senators, the legislation now before us is a private bill being
sought by Great Northern Railway Company
and Great Northern Pacifie & Burlington
Railway Lines. The merger began in the
United States some years ago and bas made
slow progress before the Interstate Commerce Commission. Commissioner Rupert L.
Murphy released bis proposed report at the
end of August last year and interested
parties have since then been filing obj ections, replies, etc. I understand that the matter will be formally argued before the I.C.C.
late this spring.
I amn sure that many senators are aware
of the conditions surrounding the steps
being taken by major railway companies in
the United States to merge and thereby
obtain operating economies.
As you may know, Great Northern is the
only one of the parties presently operating
in Canada. It proposes to merge with Northern Pacific Railway Company, which is a
company of comparable size. Both railways
operate throughout the Middle Western and
North Western states. Both Great Northern
and Northern Pacific have about six million
shares outstanding, which are widely owned
in the United States. I do not expect that any
substantial number of these shares are held
by Canadians. Pacific Coast R.R. Company
is a small operation and is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Great Northern.

May 6. 1985

May 6 1965SENATE
DEBATES

Following the merger of Great Northern,
Northern Pacifie and Pacifie Coast into Great
Northern Pacifie & Burlington Lines, Inc.,
the latter company will, in another transaction, merge with Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy Railroad Company and lease the Uines
of the Spokane Portland & Seattle Railway
Company. The entu'e operation will then
cover in excess of 24,000 miles of railway
lines in the United States. The second merger
will not affect any properties ini Canada and
will be accomplished by, i effect, the taking
over by Great Northern Pacifie & Burlington
Lines, Ine. of the assets of Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company. The reason
for this complicated form. of transaction
stems, I arn told, from the provisions of the
bond mortgages of the various companies
presently outstanding and the desire to
maintain certain priorities of the charges
thereunder.
The operations of Great Northern in Canada are very limited, covering some 130 miles
only. Its railway uines run from Blaine,
Washington, to Vancouver, B.C., from the
United States border up to Keremeos and
from the United States border up to Nelson.
In addition, a part of the line owned by
Great Northern running between Kettie Falls
and Republie, Washington, crosses into Canada near Grand Forks and runs a very short
distance in Canada.
Great Northern and Northern Pacific each
own one-haif of the outstanding shares of
Midland Railway Company, which is incorporated under the laws of the Province of
Manitoba. The latter company owns railway
lines within the limits of the City of Winnipeg and has acquired from the Canadian National Railways running rights from Winnipeg
to the United States border near Emerson,
Manitoba. Pool trains of both Great Northern
and Northern Pacific are operated by Midland
Railway Company fromn the United States
border up to Winnipeg.
The proposed transactions do not entail
any real change of control of railway limes in
Canada or removal of control of any lines
from Canada to the United States. Great

Northern presently owns the lines in British
Columbia, and the ownership will be transferred to the new company. Similarly, the
shares of Midland are owned by Great Northern and Northern Pacifie and will, following
the merger, be owned by the new company.
The shareholders of the existing companies
will receive shares in the new company.
The Province of British Columbia was represented at hearings before the Interstate
Commerce Commission and was concerned
that there be no limiting, by reason of the
merger, of the rail service from southern
British Columbia down into the United States.
The only conflict appears to be that Great
Northern operated from the United States
border at Blaine directly into Vancouver,
whereas Northern Pacific operated to the
United States border at Sumas and interchanged traffic at that point with Canadian
National Railways. The proposed conditions
contained in the draft report of the I.C.C.
for the benefit of competitive rail carriers
appear to adequately protect the interests
of the province. Specifically there is provision to the effect that competing United
States rail carriers shall be entitled to obtain,
if they so wish, trackage rights to operate
freight trains over the limes of the merged
company so as to have access to southern
British Columbia.
The proposed legisiation is, as you will
realize, enabling legisiation only, and upon
the passing of the act it will be necessary
for the parties to proceed before the Board
of Transport Commissioners and obtain its
recommendation to the Governor in Council
for the sanction of the mnerger agreement.
Full information will be given when the
bill is considered i comxnittee.

is it not a fact that none of the provinces,

the right to sign treaties of any kind? I am
not a legal expert, but that would be my

with a province's right in the field of education.

made by my friend Senator Gouin. It may
be that, not being a member of that committee, I am not familiar with all its activities, So far as I can recollect, however, very
little has come from the committee for a long
time on this most important subject.
I am inclined to think that Senator Thorvaldson has undertaken a rather heavy assignment, as chairman, if he attempts to
carry through the program of inquiry and
report-and, I presume, advice-which his
speech foreshadows. However, I am not the
only one who welcomes what he is doing. On
Saturday last, May 8, the Toronto Globe and
Mail published a short but comprehensive
editorial, headed "Useful Study." It reads:
The Senate study of Canada's position
in the Commonwealth, to be undertaken
by the External Relations Standing Committee, should be able to make a useful
contribution to Canadian understanding
of this important world institution.
Though it is more often defined in
terms of what it is not, than of what precisely it stands for, the Commonwealth
is undeniably an influential and constructive association of new and old
countries. Canada is a member by tradition and, even more importantly, as a
matter of self-interest.
The Senate study will no doubt begin
with this assumption and go on to consider what further contributions Canada
can make toward strengthening the Commonwealth relationship.
I am sure that if this committee's study and
report and advice tend to do what the Globe
and Mail expects it to do to strengthen
Commonwealth relationships, it will meet
with the approval of everyone in this chamber.
I was struck by a remark made by Senator
Thorvaldson-I regret that he is not in the
chamber tonight. He said it had been suggested, or words to that effect, that this
committee must not bury itself in generalities but must get down to consideration of
specific problems. That, he said, is quite right;

otherwise, its work might become an exercise in futility. Honourable senators, I think
everyone will agree with me in this, too, that
if its work consists of platitudes it will be an
exercise in futility.
What are these problems of the Commonwealth to which the senator has referred?
He has not listed them-and neither can I.
What are the problems which confront us
that we should inquire into? Perhaps I should
not say "we," because I am not a member
of that committee.
First, I would like to know what is the
Commonwealth, and of what countries it is
composed. We were told in Jamaica, when
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association met there in November last, that there
were delegates present from 66 parliaments.
That was not by any means all the parliaments of the Commonwealth. Delegates from
those 66 parliaments came from 38 individual states and represented 750 million
people. That is a lot of people-about onequarter of the population of the world. Therefore, the problem is great and the senator has
certainly taken in enough territory.
The influence which an organization of this
kind, whatever its principles, would have in
world thought and in world politics must
necessarily be very profound. I would like
to know what is the basis of this association,
what brings us together, what holds us together, and what we could do to increase
the good will among ourselves and so extend
the membership in the association and thus
its influence in foreign affairs.
Senator Thorvaldson mentioned South
Africa, which, he said, had withdrawn from
the Commonwealth because of racial discrimination. Well, there is not very much to be
gained by threshing that old straw. It is too
bad that South Africa left the Commonwealth, but why inquire into the responsibilities in that connection? I suppose that no one
here agrees with the policy of South Africa
with regard to the black people who inhabit
that country, but I do suggest that we could
have had a considerably greater influence in
bringing about better conditions in South
Africa had that country remained a member of the Commonwealth than we have now
that it is on its own.
As I have said, there is not much advantage in threshing old straw, but something
might be gained could we settle the general
principles involved, and decide what is required for membership in the British Com-

SENATE DEBATES
monwealth of Nations. If racial discrimination is sufficient to bar South Africa from
membership, what about some of the other
states? To mention just one, what about
Ghana with its one-party system and the
suppression of the opposition? This does not
accord with our ideas of democracy or parliamentary governments. Is it not obvious,
honourable senators, that it is difficult, if not
impossible, to draw lines of that kind? As
soon as we interfere in the internal problems
of the members of the Commonwealth we
are on the way to breaking up the association. I refer to internal or national problems
as distinct from the international problems.
The Globe and Mail suggests that we study
what Canada in the future can do to improve
the Commonwealth relationship. In my judgment the best tool we have for this task,
and the one most ready to hand, and indeed
the most potent tool, is that of trade. Nothing draws people together more effectively
than international trade. The association of
people depending one upon the other, the fact
that no deal takes place unless there is a
profit to both parties, and the confidence that
one must place in the other in doing business
-all these things draw people together, inform them of each other and show them their
mutual advantages.
Now, what do we buy from our Commonwealth neighbours? In money values, how
much and what is it? On a previous occasion
in this chamber I stated that were I intending
to develop trade, for instance, with the new
Negro states of Africa, I would not be so
concerned with what we sell to them as I
would be with what they have to sell to us
that might contribute to our industrial efficiency and to our standard of living. If by
buying from them we furnish them with
Canadian exchange, we may be quite sure
that they will, in turn, buy from us, because
we have many things which they need and
which they desire.
What then can we do to increase trade
within the Commonwealth? What are the
voluntary obstructions that we ourselves have
constituted to block trade and interfere with
the exchange of commodities? Is there something we could do to assist in removing the
quotas, the tariffs and the monetary obstructions as between ourselves and other members of the Commonwealth? That is the first
matter into which this committee should
inquire.
Then there is the very important problem of
financial aid. How much do we give? To whom
do we give it? In what form do we give it?

May 11, 1965

And what is its effect on the economic conditions prevailing in the recipient country? I
have heard that much of the money we spend
abroad in our aid program simply goes into
the pockets of the landlords and that very
little of it reaches the poverty-stricken
masses.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order! I am very
sorry to interrupt the honourable senator, but
I must once again ask honourable senators to
refrain from audible discussions when another
honourable senator is speaking. It is disturbing
for anyone to attempt to speak while others
are talking. Therefore, I would ask all
honourable senators to help me keep order.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: For instance, we are
building a hydro plant somewhere in India,
and I am told that it has increased the land
values of the district. The answer I have heard
given to that statement is that it is supplying
light to quite a number of municipalities. If it
does supply light both physically and intellectually and so teaches the people concerned
how to build hydro electric generating plants
on their own, it will have been worth while;
but if it simply goes, as I have said, into the
pockets of the privileged classes and does not
help the masses of the population, then I am
no longer interested. If we are to raise taxes
in order to bonus landlords, I think we ought
to bonus landlords at home rather than abroad
-I am not in favour of bonusing landlords. I
would like to have the situation thoroughly
investigated. Those who know what is happening should tell us all about it. On the other
hand, I have been tremendously impressed by
the work of our medical services, the men and
women who rescue children, and adults too,
from such maladies as trachoma in their eyes
which condemns them to darkness for the
rest of their lives, a condition that can be
cured with very moderate expense on our
part. Then there are those, both adults and
children, who suffer from elephantiasis, that
is, the hardening of the skin and the swelling
of the limbs, the skin becoming as hard, thick
and coarse as that of an elephant. It is a
terrible disease, and yet I understand it is not
very difficult for us, with our medical knowledge, to take care of it. There is beriberi, a
disease which develops as a result of lack of
vitamins, and there is scurvy and a few other
diseases. Our contribution towards combatting
these diseases has been great, but has cost us
comparatively little. If we inquire into this
situation we might wish to increase our contribution in that direction.

May I1, 1985

SENATE DEBATES

We are doing great work in the field of
education. As you know, our secondary
schools are open to men and women from the
Commonwealth countries, and as well from
some countries which are not members of
the Commonwealth. We teach Chinese and
Japanese boys and girls. Quite a number are
coming up from Jamaica. In our schools they
learn our know-how and are exposed to our
culture. They carry our learning back to
their homelands where they will put it to
good use. That is wonderful work, and work
that we should continue, though my friend
Senator Pouliot says that education comes
under provincial rather than dominion jurisdiction.
Lastly, although many other subjects will
no doubt suggest themselves to the committee, there is immigration. How many come
to Canada from the Commonwealth countries,
which countries, and why? What impediments are there, if any, to immigrants from
the other Commonwealth countries, and
what assistance do we give to those who
come to this country? Australia pays the expenses of transportation of emigrants coming to Australia from the United Kingdom.
We have done very little in that regard.
Honourable senators, I know of no agency
for the promotion of goodwill more effective
than the satisfied immigrant who writes home
to his parents, his brothers and sisters, his
relatives and friends, and tells them of the
freedom to be enjoyed in Canada, the comfort and civilization of this nation and our
cultures, and advises them to come too. There
is nothing that equals the letters which our
satisfied immigrants write home to their
relatives in the old land.
These are just some of the specific subjects
that occur to me which this committee
should thoroughly investigate. I think the
committee should call before it those who
actually know something about the matters
in question. The committee should discover
the facts and lay them before us, and make
valuable suggestions to be transmitted to
other agencies, including our own Government.
Of course, I wish the Commonwealth well.
My connection with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for many years is
proof of my interest. I hope that the bonds
which bind the Commonwealth will tighten
as the years go by, that its possibilities will
develop, and that it will continue increasingly its influence for good throughout the
world.

I compliment again the chairman of this
committee for the initiative and boldness of
his address, and I look forward to a contribution by the committee and a number of
reports by the chairman which will be interesting and informative.
On motion of Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton),
debate adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
INTERPROVINCIAL PIPE LINE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. Hariland de M. Molson moved the
second reading of Bill S-7, respecting Interprovincial Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I rise to
explain this bill almost with some embarrassment because I do not think it is complimentary to this house, or my colleagues
present, to suggest it is necessary to repeat
a story that has been told, considered and
acted upon. Bill S-7 is, in fact, the same as
Bill S-42 of the last session, which was introduced and explained on second reading by
myself, was considered by the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, and
passed by the Senate. When it reached the
other place, however, it was not acted upon.
It was talked out and, therefore, it died. In
consequence, I am forced to beg your indulgence while I reintroduce it as Bill S-7.
I do not intend to repeat all that I said on
the last occasion. I would instead refer you
to the Debates of the Senate of November 25,
1964, page 1121, where you will find my
explanation. However, if you will bear with
me I should like to add a few salient points
to the general explanation I gave at that
time.
The purpose of this bill is to permit the
Interprovincial Pipe Line Company to split
its shares five for one, from 40 million shares
to 200 million shares, from $5 par value to
$1 par value.
On the last occasion I made a considerable
number of comments about the company,
and I should like now to remind honourable
senators of only a few important features.
This is a great Canadian company. It is a
transportation company, transporting crude
oil from the oil wells of western Canada to
refineries in eastern Canada, and on the way
providing about 25 per cent of its throughput
for export to the United States. It is a company that is owned 88 per cent by Canadians.
It has 14,000 shareholders. It has invested in
its facilities-plant, equipment and pipe lines
-$320 million since its inception. It has over

SENATE DEBATES

3,400 miles of pipe line with which to carry
out its function, and in its last year of operation it moved on the average the very large
quantity of 500,000 barrels of oil a day.
In the course of its relatively short history
it has consistently reduced its rates, so that
with the reduction in December last it is now
moving oil at a cost approaching 50 per cent
of the original tariff with which it commenced
operations. That is, as I am sure all honourable senators will agree, a very creditable
performance.
The reasons for the splitting of the shares
are given in the explanatory note. This is a
very common practice of companies. There
is nothing unorthodox or unusual, and there
is certainly nothing unethical, on the part of
a company in splitting its shares. On the
contrary, I would say, as I said last November, it is a common practice for successful
companies to split their shares if they have
been so successful that the prices of them
have risen greatly.
I know it is not necessary, but as a result
of comments I have heard outside I think it
wise to remind the house of one further
thing in connection with the prinçiple of
splitting shares. I do this because I have heard
it said, in effect, if a company has 1,000
shares authorized which it splits into 5,000
shares, then all that company has done is to
give itself an additional 4,000 pieces of paper
to sell to the unsuspecting public. This is,
of course, quite ridiculous. Nothing could be
further from the truth. All that happens when
a company such as this splits its shares is
that the day after the shares are split five
for one the price of each share becomes
approximately one-fifth of the price of the
original share the day before.
This creates no benefit for the management or the directors. There are two classes
of people who do benefit from such a
procedure. One class comprises the small investors who find $95 a very high price to pay
for a share of a company in which they wish
to invest, and who find it much easier to buy
a share at $15 or $20. The other class of
persons who benefit-this is not necessarily
always true, but it is certainly true in the
case of this company-are the employees of
a company which has an employee's savings
plan whereby some of the money saved may
be invested in the shares of the company.
This particular company has such a plan, and
when the price of a share is, say, $18 instead
of approximately $90, it will be easier for the
employees to invest in the company.

May Il, 1965

Honourable senators, there is nothing
obscure about this bill. Its purpose is very
clear. This is a good company, and I would
recommend that the Senate give its approval
to its application.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, as
has been explained, this is a good company,
and a bill similar to this one was before
us during the last session. I do not think
any objection can be taken to this bill.
However, I should like to ask the honourable sponsor (Hon. Mr. Molson) how
many shares have been issued. Have all
the 40 million authorized shares been
issued and, if not, what proportion of them
has been issued?
I should also like to ask, if all the authorized shares have not been issued, how many
are left for sale, and how much of the stock
has been taken up by the employees? It
is an excellent thing to find companies such
as this offering their employees the opportunity to buy the stock, and I should like
to know what advantage is being taken of
this opportunity by the employees. From
my reading of the explanation, I take it that
this plan has not been as altogether satisfactory as the company had hoped.
Another matter that has occurred to me is
that of the protection of the great pipe lines
we have across the country. I am referring
not only to pipe lines for crude oil but also
to those for gas and for the conveyance of
other products. We have heard of certain
subversive elements whose aim is the destruction of our pipe lines, and we all realize
how the sabotage of the pipe lines in time
of trouble could be very dangerous.
I should like to ask the honourable senator what effort would be made by this
company, which is an extremely wealthy company whose activities extend interprovincially and right across the country, to protect
its own property. Does the company depend
entirely on our police and other law enforcement bodies for protection, or does it make
some effort itself to protect its property? I
ask this because, should subversive elements undertake to make trouble in this
country we would find ourselves in a chaotic
condition.
Perhaps the honourable senator is not in
a position to answer questions such as these
at the present time. The subject matter of
this bill has already been considered in
committee. I could not follow whether or
not the honourable senator was asking that
the bill be sent to committee again. How-

May 11, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

ever, I think these are questions which could
very well be answered, and I ask the honourable senator if he could give us some information along that line.
Hon. Mr. Molson: The honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Brooks) is quite
right in his observations. With regard to his
third point, I did not say anything about my
intention to refer the bill to committee. I
am afraid that I forgot to do so. When the
bill has received second reading I shall move
that it be referred to committee.
In reply to the honourable leader's first
question I may say that at the end of 1964
there were 5,087,282 shares outstanding out of
an authorized number of 40 million.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: That is, about 35 million
had been issued?
Hon. Mr. Molson: No. There were 5,087,282
shares issued and 40 million authorized. That
number, however, does not affect the ability
of the small investor or the employee to
purchase the shares. It is the present market
price which is the deterrent. I believe the
price recently bas been around $91 or $91a
a share, which is very high.
In reply to the honourable gentleman's second question, as to how many shares have
been taken up by the employees savings plan,
I am afraid I have not that figure, but I will
be glad to have that brought out in committee, if that wrl satisfy the honourable
senator.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: What about my other
question?
Hon. Mr. Molson: With regard to the protection of the pipe line, you brought up a
large subject. I do not know the answer, but
I shall be glad to inquire. It seems to me
that the pipe lines are vulnerable in common
with all our other great public works. I know
that during the last war I used to think of
what would happen at some of the great
power plants up in the Lake St. John area,
for example, if a few pieces of dynamite
were put in them. The railroads are extremely vulnerable, as are all telecommunications. Whether or not the pipe lines
have any program I do not know, but I shall
certainly be glad to inquire and have that
brought out in committee, if that would be
acceptable to the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The pipe lines are extremely vulnerable.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, may I draw to the attention

of the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Brooks) on the question of the security of
the pipe line, the fact that during the last
war a committee was established called the
Vulnerable Points Committee. He will remember a good deal of the kind of work that
committee did. The committee was under the
direction of the Minister of National Defence for Naval Services. It was generally
presided over by the Commissioner of the
R.C.M.P., but it worked in close collaboration with industry generally. It considered
questions such as the guarding of plants of
various kinds, but it also considered security
in respect of communications, transportation,
and industry in general. There was a great
deal of co-operation and collaboration between the official and public side of the work
that was directed mainly by the R.C.M.P.,
and industry and business generally in respect of properties that were considered to
be of national importance at the time. If
this company had been in existence at that
time perhaps it would fall into that general
category of companies that would participate
in this kind of work.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: May I ask the honourable sponsor (Hon. Mr. Molson) why this
particular bill is not being referred to the
Transport and Communications Committee?
It seems to me that a large number of committees should be kept busy with various
bills. The custom here seems to be to refer
every bill, whether important or not, to the
Banking and Commerce Committee. I think
this particular bill is strictly a matter for the
Transport and Communications Committee.
Hon. Mr. Molson: I have not the least
objection. I have just noticed that the bill was
referred to the Transport and Communications Committee last time. I therefore move
that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: That is satisfactory.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Molson, bill referred
to the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.

SENATE DEBATES
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR

ADDRESS IN
CONTINUED

REPLY-DEBATE

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, May
5, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Aird, for an address in
reply thereto.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
I welcome the opportunity this motion gives
me to add my compliments to those already
expressed to the mover (Hon. Mr. Bourque)
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Aird) for the
highly skilful way in which they commended
the motion to the Senate.
Senator Bourque has that great advantage,
which some of us envy, of being able to
express his views with easy facility in both
languages. Senator Aird gave us a perfect
demonstration of the logic of his mind, and
it seems to me that for that reason he made
the most conservative speech I have heard
since I came to this chamber.
I pay my respects to Your Honour and take
pleasure in passing on to you some of the
compliments I have heard on the manner in
which you maintain our goodwill and good
humour most of the time, and particularly for
the guidance in the rules that from time to
time you are able to give to some of us more
needy members.
I pay my respects, of course, to my own
leader (Hon. Mr. Brooks). I am sure we all are
glad to see him back in the Senate tonight,
after being away on Senate business. I
understand that within a month or so he
will be celebrating his fortieth anniversary of
consecutive service in one or other of the
Parliaments of Canada. We on this side
certainly owe much to him for his continuing
guidance and wisdom, which are among the
ornaments of the Senate.
Honourable senators, I turn now to the
motion before us. Whatever else may or may
not be said about the document on which
the motion is based, it is certainly a comprehensive program. Indeed, it is hard to
think of anything of current interest in the
Canadian political scene that it does not
comprehend. One has the feeling that one of
His Excellency's advisors might have been
told a month or two ago to read the newspapers, make a note of everything that any
group or person said the Government should
do or say or think, and make sure it was
included in this document. It is all here.
According to my own count, the document

May 11, 1965

promises us at least 53 pieces of legislation,
to enact new laws or to amend existing laws.
Some people called it an election program.
Indeed, one of the leading newspapers
supporting the Government headed its report, on the day after we heard the speech
here, with the very succinct headline: "It is
an election!" Personally, I think it may have
closer affinity with one of the hobbies or
avocations of the Minister of Agriculture. I
find it to be very obviously a dual-purpose
program, designed to be milked perhaps pail
by pail if the session can be prolonged, and,
if not, to be fattened up for election purposes
later on. If my experience with such things
is worth anything, I would say it will need
quite a bit of fattening if it is to serve the
latter purpose. The skeleton is there all right.
Careful attention has been given to emphasizing most of the important points in
the body politic. There is something for the
urban voters, for the rural voters; for the
employed, for the unemployed, for the reemployable and for the past-employed. There
is something for the supporters-and I am not
criticizing it on this ground-of U.N., NATO,
and the Commonwealth. There is something
for the would-be reformers of the House of
Commons and even for that very small group
of Canadians who feel there might be some
value in proceeding with some reform of the
Senate. There is something for those who
have profound feelings about "God Save the
Queen" as an anthem, as well as for those
who have profound feelings about "O
Canada". There is something for the young,
something for the old, something for veterans
and something for ethnic groups, new and
old.
If you are a supporter of Canadian publications, you are told that their position is to
be strengthened. On the other hand, if you
have favourite American magazines, they are
at the same time to be given what appears
to be a perpetual monopoly of magazine
dumping rights in Canada. I hasten to say
that I have nothing against Time or Reader's
Digest-I read and subscribe to both of them
-but I do wonder why it is that they are
to be given these magnificent privileges.
Indeed, if there are those who think that
too much money is spent in this country on
elections, they are told there will be limitations on such spending. On the other hand,
it is also suggested that the Government will
now be required to spend more money than
ever on elections.

May 11, 1965

DEBATES
May 11 1985SENATE

So it goes through the 53 projected pieces
of legislation. If they are not all implemented, at least we can be sure that we will
be told that we were promised them i the
Speech from. the Tlirone. A very wise man
has said that it is futile to gild reflned gold
or to paint the lily. Nevertheless, 1I might
make a few comments on itemns in the Speech
fromn the Throne that are of particular interest to me. I arn sure my coileagues in this
debate will fill in any gaps that I leave and
will indeed cover much more competently
some of the points I mention.
In the first place, I was very pleased,' as I
arn sure we ahl were, with the graclous reference to the presence o! Her Mai esty at the
celebrations last autumn in Charlottetown
and Quebec in connection with those con!ferences which preceded our Confederation. To
those who are interested in history, it is a
rather fascinating !act that almost every day
now is an anniversary of some event of
importance in the march o! those years towards union. For example, 100 years ago this
month a group o! four delegates from. the
Parliamnent of Canada, or as it was then, the
Parliament o! the Province of Canada, were
in England, carrying with themn what is
described as:
address to Her Majesty
... a humble
"praying that she may be graciously
pleased to cause a measure to be submitted to the Imperial Parliament for
the purpose o! uniting the Colonies of
Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island
in one government based on the Resolutions which were adopted at a Conference o! Delegates from the said Colonies
held at the city of Quebec on the 10th
of October 1864...
Now, exactly 100 years later, we are told
in the Speech from the Throne that Parliament
will be asked to approve an Address to
the Queen to provide that the Constitution of Canada may be arnended in
Canada by the procedures which. have
been agreed to. ..
between the federal Governrnent and the
governments of ail the provinces.
There is a rernarkable similarity in the
language and a remarkable sirnilarity in the
occasions. There are 10 provinces now. There
were five then in the contemplated union;
two withdrew, Prince Edward Island and
Newfoundland, leaving three.

Honourable senators, as those founders of
Confederation-Macdonald, Cartier, Gaît and
George Brown-were in London, they were
faced with the prospect that New Brunswick
would very shortly vote against the union
and that the popular leader in Nova Scotia,
Joseph Howe, would corne out against Confederation. Yet they persevered. Whether they
were fully aware of the troubles a-head, I do
not know; but they carried on with a resoluteness, with a high sense of purpose, far
above politics, which one finds somewhat
lacking in some of the approaches to the problem of the union today. Perhaps they were
successful because they did not always take
themselves too seriously.
Honourable senators may be interested in
knowing what they were doing in England,
almost 100 years to the day, in this month
of May. They were watching a French horse
corne in first in the Derby. In Sir John A.'s
words:
We ail went down to Epsomn in company with Russell, of the Times, by road,
in order to see the fun. Russell invited
me (there was room only for one) to
Mr. Wiheatley's (the great wine merchant's) stand, which was just opposite
the Royal party. When Gladiateur passed
the winnlng-post, about the length of his
nostrils ahead of the second horse, I
could have dropped my handerkerchief on
his head ... Coming home we had lots of
fun; even George Brown, a covenanting
old chap, caught its spirit. I bought him.
a pea-shooter and a bag o! peas, and the
old feilow actually took aim at people
on the tops o! 'busses, and shot lots of
peas on the way home. Russell, too, was
great fun. In the drive, as we stopped,
he would suddenly declaim to a gaping
crowd, making a speech à la Jack Cade.
Striding up to a stupid policeman, he
exclaimed suddenly and with great earnestness, as he caught his arm, "Is the
multitude a.ppeased?" "Ah! no, no, sir,
no more peas; do not gîve them any more
peas! they have had enough already,"
was the reply.
I made twenty guineas on that race,

SENATE DEBATES

of state. Therefore I believe the next step
will be a general meeting, and I think this
can contribute greatly to the usefulness of
the Commonwealth in the world today.
I would go a step further and even suggest that the time may come when the Commonwealth will have its own High Court of
Justice. It is true that international high
courts of justice do not have a very eminent
record of success, but perhaps such a court,
taking over to some extent some of the prestige and useful work of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, might tackle and
solve some of the problems such as Cyprus
and Rhodesia with which the Commonwealth
is concerned today and which, for reasons that
are not difficult to explain, those countries
were reluctant to take before the International
Court at The Hague.
We are also told in the Speech from the
Throne that our Constitution is to be amended
by an address to Her Majesty. Honourable
senators, I am sure you have read the excellent White Paper published by the Government on this matter. I think it makes extremely clear what is intended, even to a
layman such as I. As I understand it, that
document describes four ways for amending
the Union. I was almost going to say breaking up the Union, but at the moment that is
perhaps going too far, although I have very
serious doubts myself as to the end result
of some of the things being done in that
connection, particularly under the heading of
what is called "co-operative federalism." I
regret to say that we are faced with the fact
that ever since we have had this theory of
co-operative federalism widely talked about,
we have had a continuing deterioration of
relationships within the Union.
Reference was made in the debate which
was ruled out of order to the question of
treaty-making powers. From my own study
it is obvious that it is not quite as simple
as was suggested. The fact is that since the
treaty-making power was obviously retained
by the Imperial Government in 1867, it has
certainly not been fully allotted to the federal
Government under our Constitution. I have
read the Constitution very carefully, and while
there is a section there-I think it is section
132-which refers to the matter, there is no
clear transfer of the treaty-making power, as
I understand it, to the federal Government.
We are also painfully aware of the fact
that the federal Government never had the
power to make a binding treaty with any
nation in any matter covered by section
92 of the British North America Act. That

is why from time to time we have had bills
before us here purporting to implement international treaties entered into by the Government of Canada. On one recent occasion
at least, and not an unusual one, we were
told that such a treaty was being implemented in full because some letters had been
received from provincial premiers saying that
it was all right to go ahead and do it. I do not
agree with this kind of procedure. It is
untidy and unconstitutional. That power is
given to the legislatures of the provinces, and
not to the governments of the provinces, and
I cannot see how a power given by section
92 exclusively to the legislature of a province
can be dealt away by any provincial government. Some people will argue, of course, that
the Government says, in effect, "Yes, that is
all right because we will in due time get the
approval of the legislatures." The fact is in
most cases they have not bothered to do so.
It is for that reason I describe that type of
procedure as being untidy.
Quebec has a much better record than any
other province in that respect, and even in
amendments to the Constitution, Quebec has
far more often than any other province
referred the matter to its legislature, maintaining its stand over the years of the supremacy of the legislature in matters assigned
to the legislature under the act.
We hear talk of an associated state with
treaty-making powers. I am not too concerned whether any province asserts the
right to make agreements. It is pure semantics whether you call it an "agreement," a
"convention" or "treaty" in this context. If
they have the right to enter into agreements
in matters exclusively under their authority,
then I say it matters little what we call it.
But this theory is now extended beyond a
mere assertion by certain ministers in Quebec. We are told it has been discussed in the
cabinet of the Government of British Columbia. I wonder if this assertion is not attributable to the talk about co-operative federalism
which, to some extent, seems to me to have
tended to cover up the lack of real action.
As I see the suggestions for carving up the
Constitution-because we are now to have
more formal ways in which it can be
amended-I wonder if we are not finding
ourselves in the position immortalized in the
British House of Commons by the Irish member Sir Boyle Roche, who rose in that house
in speaking on some matters relating to the
Irish Constitution and said:
It would surely be better, Mr. Speaker,
to give up not only a part but, if neces-

SENATE DEBATES
sary, the whole of the Constitution to preserve the remainder.
Or, when I think of all the talk about
co-operative federalism I am reminded of
Heinrich Marx's famous remark about his
illustrious son, Karl. He is reported as having
said on one occasion:
If Karl, instead of writing so much
about capital, would make some capital,
things would be so much better.
I pass quickly now to another subject
in which I am interested, and one to which
Senator Roebuck referred. We are told that
there are to be changes in our immigration
laws. We are to have a White Paper. I hope
this document will tackle the question a little
more honestly than it has been tackled in
the past. It is no secret that we have had
immigration policies that have said one thing
and have meant another, and I am quite
aware of the difficulties at the present time.
Immigration into Canada is allowable in
two broad categories. One, where there are
family connections and where immigration
is considerably freer, based on the theory
that Canada does not want to be in the
position of breaking up families. But the
main category is one in which there is a
test of job availability. We are told the purpose is to make sure that any prospective
immigrant fits into the employment pattern
in Canada. I think we would all agree this
is something that has to be carefully watched.
Unfortunately, in other countries they just
do not believe that is the real reason for
that test. We were told this in Jamaica over
and over again. We were told of the embarrassment of our own officials in having
to confront those who said that this is really
just a way to "keep out blacks." And it is
understandable if people feel that way, because the discrimination or the test, because
it is against the unskilled, is therefore most
applicable against the developing nations,
and it so happens that most of the developing nations today are what we, for want
of a better word, call "black".
There have been honest attempts to get
around this. Canada entered into an undertaking with Jamaica not long ago to alow
a certain number of female domestics to enter
Canada. The intent was good in this case. The
thought was: Here is an area of job availability, and we will take in 500-I think that
was the number. This was completely misinterpreted in Jamaica, even though they had
asked for it. What we heard was, "Under

May 11, 1965

your Canadian laws you have to be a domestic to get into the country." I say these
difficulties arise because of this "double
standard" in our immigration laws, and I for
one would hope that the White Paper would
face up to this and give us an honest assessment of our immigration policy, no matter
how hard it may be for us or others to take.
I would like to say a word now about the
suggestion in the Speech from the Throne
that there will be legislation to facilitate-if
I may use that word-the retirement of
senators having reached a certain age. I have
no strong views on this, except that from my
experience here it seems to me that there is
a danger of Senate reform being attacked
from the wrong side, perhaps even from the
wrong end. I need not mention names, but
it is my own view that much of the area of
the greatest worth of the Senate is to be
found in the age group beyond the three
score years and fifteen. If it is meant to be
Senate reform, then I say somebody is not
being very realistic. We have to face the fact
that there is a demand across the country for
some measure of Senate reform, and I use the
term "reform" because that is the one currently in use. I have spoken to honourable
senators about this and they have said, "Don't
get worried about this, because this great
outcry goes on every few years, and then it
dies down."
I would like to suggest that this occasion
may be different. If the Constitution is to be
repatriated there is almost certainly going to
be a constituent assembly of the provinces.
I would say that in that constituent assembly
the Constitution of Canada may well be examined section by section, paragraph by paragraph, and I would like to see somebody
there to speak for the Senate. I would respectfully suggest to the Leader of the
Government that it might be worth thinking
about having a committee appointed, to consist of the wise men of the Senate, to face up
to this problem and do a job of selfexamination.
Is there any substance in this criticism? It
is certainly not for me to say. Are we burying
our heads in the sand? It is not for me to
say. But I would like to see a committee of
the Senate examine and analyze these criticisms, and recommend to this house what
action should be taken by the Senate, if any
action is necessary.
Finally, may I just make a comment on
another matter that is suggested as the basis
of legislation that will be introduced by the

May 11, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Government in due course. That is the limitation on election expenses. I am sorry the
phrase used is "the limitation and payment of
election expenses", if that means the Government bas already decided it is not only
going to limit the election expenses of candidates for election to the House of Commons,
but it is also going to pay them. From my
experience, I would be strongly in favour of
limiting those expenses.
I have the honour of being called before
a committee of the House to describe experiences I may have had, and with permission I shall be doing that. In the meantime I
should like to say for the record that I believe
the limitation of election expenses can be
made effective. There are others who say it
cannot, that it is a lot of humbug and there
are many loopholes. I believe it can be made
effective if two conditions are met. One is
that there be a limitation not only against
the candidates themselves but also against
the national parties, as in Quebec. The second is that the sanctions imposed be not
the paltry fines that are now provided by
the Election Act, but that there be a forfeiture of the seat in cases of substantial infractions of the law. Anybody who bas had
close and active experience with candidates

and their problems in this respect will agree
that when they weigh the possibility of a
fine of $200 or $300 against the chance of
taking the seat, then they take the chance.
Forfeiture of the seat is a very powerful sanction, of course, because inherent in it is a
strong incentive to the defeated candidate
to invoke the sanction.
With the increase in salaries it would be
very unwise for the federal Government to
imitate the Quebec legislation-which I do
not mean to criticize, because it is in another
field-and make arrangements to pay a per
capita contribution to every candidate who
obtains 20 per cent of the vote. I may be
premature in saying that. It may well be
that when the question of reform here is considered I will be among those who will be
very glad to have their election expenses paid.
Honourable senators, that is al I have to
say. There are some other matters I should
have liked to mention, but I see that time
is getting on. I thank you for the courtesy
of your attention.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pouliot, debate

MOTION TO EMPOWER COMMITTEE TO MARE
INQUIRY-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson:
That the Standing Committee on External Relations be authorized to inquire
into the question of Commonwealth relationships with particular reference to the
position of Canada within the Commonwealth;
That the Committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records, and to
sit during sittings and adjournments of
the Senate; and
That the Committee be instructed to
report to the House from time to time.
Hon. M. Gratian O'Leary: Honourable senators, before the close of the last session, in
a few words which I spoke on the occasion
of the fiag debate, I ventured to say that I
thought that a good fresh look should be
taken at the United Nations and perhaps at
the Commonwealth. Therefore, I suppose that

May 12, 1965

you will bear with me in a few ill-chosen
words on this motion moved by Senator
Thorvaldson.
I would like to join with Senator Roebuck
in the tribute ho paid to Senator Thorvaldson
for his informed and intelligent interest in
external affairs; but I must add at once that
I am not happy with the wording of this
motion. I fear that, if carried out too literally,
it will lead to the thing which he himself
deplored, namely, that we might get into the
bog of an exercise in futility. And I am not
relieved of this uneasiness by Senator Roebuck quoting last night some support for this
motion from the Toronto Globe and Mail.
John Bright used to say that he never felt
sure he was right until the London Times
said he was wrong. For myself, having followed the ramifications of the Globe and
Mail for the past year or two, excellent
newspaper though it be, I would almost be
sure that I was wrong if the Globe and Mail
said I was right.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Other
people feel somewhat the same way about
other newspapers.
Hon. Mr. Choquelte: But with not as good
reason.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Another thing
about which I feel a curious unease is that
this motion is concerned only with the Commonwealth. Why restrict any inquiries we
may have to make to the Commonwealth
and to our relations with it? Surely if there
is anything urgent or of moment in our
external relations it is not with the Commonwealth. What about Cyprus? I shall have a
few words to say about Cyprus later on.
What about NATO? What about the United
Nations? What about Viet Nam? But before
coming to these I do wish to say a word
about the Commonwealth. What is it today?
I remember the famous English editor,
Mr. J. A. Spender of the old Westminster
Gazette, who used to refer to the old Commonwealth as an Act of Faith. I am very
much afraid that the faith which many
people had in the Commonwealth has diminished in recent years, and for very clearly
defined reasons.
I attended my first Commonwealth Conference, then called an Imperial Conference,
45 years ago. I went there, as a correspondent
for the Canadian Press, with Arthur Meighen,
who at that time almost single-handedly was
opposing the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance. In passing I may remark that in
the light of the pomp and circumstance of the

May 12, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

world vagabondage of our diplomats and
statesmen today, it is interesting to recall
that in going to that conference where Mr.
Meighen was to oppose the greatest minds
in England at that time-Lloyd George,
Churchill, Curzon, Birkenhead and, last but
not least, that famous character from Australia, Mr. Hughes-he took along with him but
one assistant from the External Affairs Department, Mr. Loring Christie, his private
secretary Mr. Charles Armstrong, and another
gentleman who acted as his stenographer,
three in all. Yet in that month in London,
as I said, when he was opposing the cream
of British statesmanship, he fought singlehanded until he won his point which resulted
in the calling in that same year of the Washington Disarmament Conference.
The point I want to make about that
meeting is this: Here you had the old Commonwealth of the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, India and South
Africa. Now, in that conference when they
were discussing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance,
with all its implications of world policy,
naturally there had to be a tremendous
amount of discussion concerning security of
the most delicate kind. What I put to you
today, gentlemen, is this: Could a conference
of that kind take place in the Commonwealth
as it exists today?
Another question which must occur to all
of us in considering the Commonwealth is
this: What tests today apply for membership
of the Commonwealth? In the case of the
United Nations the test used-observed rather
loosely, I admit-is that a nation shall be a
peace-loving nation. Do we say that the test
for membership in the Commonwealth shaîl
be that a nation has regard for human
freedom, for liberty, for civil justice, for
civil liberty, for the right of free assembly
and for the freedom of the press? I ask you
to look at Ghana where Mr. Nkrumah dismissed his own Minister of Justice out of
hand, suppressed his Parliament, created a
one-party state, and took the image of Her
Majesty the Queen off his coins.
I ask you to look at Mr. Ian Smith's record
in Southern Rhodesia. What there do you
find now of regard for justice? They had
an election there last week, a sort of doublebarrelled election, one in two categories. Certain people were allowed to vote for 65 seats
in the assembly and certain people for 15
seats. Mr. Ian Smith, having got his majority
by these means, now says that if this is not
acceptable to the United Kingdom he will

declare Rhodesia's independence. Well, Rhodesia is not a full-fledged member of the
Commonwealth, but would be welcomed there,
and I think if we are going to deal with the
Commonwealth in this proposed committee,
a fair question to be asked is: What about
countries like Ghana? What about countries
like Rhodesia? What about countries like
Kenya?-and so on down the line. Honourable senators, I am convinced that
you are weakening, you are diminishing the
affection, the respect, the love which people
have for the Commonwealth when you have
a membership of that kind.
I know there are answers to what I am
saying, and one is: Well, why not keep them
in the Commonwealth? Mr. Nkrumah will
not always be with us, and maybe his successors will be of a different state of mind.
That is one argument, but I do not think it
is a convincing one. What is more, I know
that in Britain today there is steadily declining respect for the position of the Commonwealth. In fact, the first time I had
the honour of speaking in this chamber I
had to point out what I think was true,
that members of Mr. Macmillan's ministry
in London, supported by a wing of the Conservative party but not by the British people,
were engaged in downgrading the Commonwealth as a trade potential. And last night
my distinguished friend Senator Roebuck said
this was one of the things we might discuss
in this committee, the trade potential of the
Commonwealth. The trade potential of the
Commonwealth was not too readily accepted
or supported in this country two years ago,
and that at a time when Mr. Heath and
his accomplices were selling the Commonwealth down the river.
I come now to Cyprus. When it was decided a year ago to send Canadian troops
to Cyprus, the Leader of the Government in
this house, Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
made an announcement on the position
taken by the Government. I think that
was in line with his wish, which he
has carried out fairly and with distinction,
of enhancing the prestige of this chamber.
But, honourable senators, what have we heard
about Cyprus since? On the night the Leader
of the Government made his announcement
I ventured to ask him whether any other
countries, and if so how many, were joining
with Canada in this peace-keeping mission.
He answered, and quite properly, that the
matter was then a subject of confidential
negotiations and he could not answer at that

SENATE DEBATES
time, but that this information would be
given to us later.
A few days later the honourable Senator
White placed upon Hansard a series of questions addressed to the Leader of the Government about the position of our troops in
Cyprus, about their mandate there, the limitations placed upon them, who would be responsible for their pensions in the case of losses,
and so forth.

I have not seen a reply to those questions.
It may be they have been given privately
to Senator White, although I do not believe
so because I do not think that Senator White
and Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) would regard Cyprus as their private domain. As these
questions were placed on Hansard they should
be answered on Hansard,and if security prohibited their answer we should have been
told. This is one of the things that a committee such as that proposed could do. It
need not restrict itself to some vague ideas
of what we might do about the Commonwealth.
There is the question of the UN. Surely a
committee of this kind should try to get more
information about our position with respect to
the UN. Mr. Paul Martin, the Secretary of
State for External Affairs, speaking yesterday
in London said that there was some uneasiness
about that position. Indeed, he said that he
was urging that some other nations now come
in and help us with respect to Cyprus. But
we do not hear much about these things here
in the Parliament of Canada. That is my
complaint. These things should be discussed
here in Canada.
We have our statesmen going abroad and
making speeches at universities and other
places and declaring what is purported to be
Canadian policy. Honourable senators, the
policy of Canada with respect to foreign affairs, with respect to its position affecting
any country, should be stated in Canada, in
the Parliament of Canada, and nowhere else.
I do not know what our position is with
respect to the United Nations. It is almost
impossible to get authoritative information.
We had last summer a meeting in this city
of many nations, and UN Secretary-General
U Thant was among those present. U Thant
was asked whether he believed there could
be a settlement of the dispute over the payment by Russia, France and other countries
of their dues to the United Nations. What
did he say? He said he was in no doubt whatever about the fact that the matter could be
settled, and would be settled. Well, it was not,
and you have to ask yourselves: What was
U Thant thinking about?

May 12, 1965

Incidentally, I am referring to the meeting
at which he said that Mr. Goldwater should
have his head read for suggesting that bombs
be used in North Viet Nam. I do not know
what he thinks about what is happening in
North Viet Nam now.
I could go on about these things, but
I come back to this test of membership to mention one more thing. We are told that there is
going to be set up a secretariat for the Commonwealth. Honourable senators, if that secretariat is going to be merely a clearing house
for Commonwealth information, well and
good, but if it means only that, then why
are we discussing the possibility or the probability of one of the ablest foreign officers in
this country, Mr. Arnold Smith, becoming
a member of it? If it is to be merely a
clearing house, what will Mr. Arnold Smith
be doing there?
I do not know what is being set up, but I
think this committee could very properly
ask: (1) How is such a secretariat to be appointed; (2) Who will decide what matters
are to come before it; (3) What authority is to
be vested in it; (4) To what representative
body will it be responsible; and (5) Will it
operate from London, Ottawa, or Canberra?
It may well be that such a secretariat could
do good and useful work, but if it represents
a trend back to the thinking of Mr. Lionel
Curtis and Mr. Philip Kerr, to the old Round
Table group, to the thinking that still goes
on at Chatham House, then I am against it,
and I think this country traditionally has
been against such things from the days of
Wilfrid Laurier down to the days of the
present Prime Minister. These are the things
that this committee should inquire into.
Honourable senators, I would be sorry if
any of you, because of what I am saying,
concluded that I am against the Commonwealth. I am very much for the Commonwealth. One of the dearest wishes in my heart
for years has been the wish that Ireland,
free, united and independent, would return to
it-that Ireland, united north and south,
will be in the commonwealth where she
belongs, and with which so much of her
history and a lot of her blood are co-mingled.
As one of the greatest of Irish patriots, Henry
Grattan, said:
The Irish Sea cries out against union,
but the Atlantic thunders against separation.
That is why I believe in the Commonwealth.
But I also believe we should look on the
Commonwealth and know what it is we are

May 12, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

believing in. It is no use having the same
old loyalty for something that is new. What
is it that we are now supporting? Is it Ghana,
Kenya or Rhodesia? This is not the sort of
Commonwealth to which we gave our loyaity
and devotion in days gone by, and it is not
the sort of Commonwealth we would like it
to be.
I should like to have all of these questions
asked in this committee, and that is why I
think this motion is too general and too ambiguous. While ambiguity is safer than definition, I still think that definition will get us
further in the long run.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape
Breton), for Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, debate
adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Aird, for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I intend to be very brief in the
remarks I have to make today on the Speech
from the Throne. In the first place, I wish
to congratulate the mover of this motion
(Hon. Mr. Bourque), who is a personal friend
of mine. He is a self-made man and he is
highly respected in the City of Outremont,
in which he lives in the Province of Quebec,
and also in Canada at large. He has been the
mayor of Outremont for a number of years,
and he has represented that riding in the
House of Commons. His presence here is an
asset for the Senate.
To the seconder of the motion, Senator
Aird, I say he is most welcome. What we
admire about him is his great humility. He is
a young man, but a prominent lawyer. He
comes from a well-known family of Toronto.
His grandfather did much for the progress
of radio in its beginning. He also is an asset
to this chamber. He is much younger than my
contemporaries and myself, but he is capable
and will make great contributions to the
debates of this house.
I have known His Honour the Speaker for
many years. If some unpleasant remarks
have been made about him by those who do
not know him, I am sure that if those
who made such remarks had been better
22624-5

acquainted with him they would have spoken
very highly of his career in politics.
I remember, sir, when you were the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Public
Works, that you took the same care over all
problems that were left to you, whether they
came from supporters or opponents of the
Government. The number of Members of
Parliament you have helped is very great.
I must tell you, honourable colleagues, that
the Senate is a place where everyone expresses himself or herself freely, and I wonder
what would be the use of a debate on a motion
for an address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne if at times suggestions were not
made for the reform and improvement of public business. Naturally, a suggestion for reform
is a suggestion for a change, and it is most
difficult to have a change in the routine that
has existed for a number of years.
At first, in order to be well understood, I
must tell you that according to my experience,
whenever someone conveys that anything
wrong has been done by anyone of his race,
he is considered a traitor to his race, and if
he does not belong to that race he is considered a cannibal. I do not exaggerate, but
it is very difficult to complain about anything
wrong that has been done by anyone, for that
very reason. I told one of my friends, who is
a Jew, that such things do not happen to
them because they never criticize any one of
their race. Perhaps that is wise. On the other
hand, if we want progress we must indicate
what is wrong to improve conditions in this
country.
Another observation I wish to make is that
freedom and liberty and human rights are
subjects that are widely discussed by many
people who do not seem to know what freedom, liberty, or democracy mean. They do
not know what human rights are any more,
but they are now so full of it.
I will give an example to show how badly
freedom, human rights and democracy are
understood in my own province. A young
man, a teacher in my province, belonged to
a religious order. In his class was shown on
both sides of the crucifix two pictures, on one
side a picture of Our Lord, and on the other
side a picture of Hitler. This happened at La
Mennais School in Montreal.
What would any one of you have done if
you had been the director of the school?
You would have fired him at once. They did
not see it that way. In the land of liberty,
freedom and human rights, democracy, etc.,
they decided to have an investigation made,
and that investigation is still in progress to

SENATE DEBATES
decide whether he had the right to do that
and to teach his pupils that Hitler was as
great as Our Lord.
This shows that something is wrong somewhere-and you know it. You have seen it in
the press, and it is mentioned like a serial.
On another occasion in the Province of Quebec a teacher was found with some sticks of
dynamite. There was some kind of preliminary inquiry. I do not know what happened
to it, but it shows the spirit of some of the
teachers.
What can we do about those wrongs? We
can do nothing. We supply money for education in the Province of Quebec and in the
other provinces, but the federal Government
cannot be informed about the manner in
which the federal subsidies for education are
spent by the provinces.
Moreover, when subsidies are paid by
Ottawa to the provinces for education, then
the provinces refuse to render account to
show how the money has been spent. Is there
any businessman in this house-and all of
you are businessmen-who would agree to
that idea of giving money to the provinces
for education without control as to whether
or not the money has been spent on education?
We have to revert to fundamentals, and
this is what I will try to do in a few brief
remarks. However, with regard to education,
I have asked a question. I did not ask for the
opinion of the Government, because I know
what it is, just as well as I know what is
my own opinion. I have given my authority
-the B.N.A. Act. What I wanted to know is,
what was the authority of the Government of
Canada to have an exclusive right to sign
treaties with regard to education with other
countries? This is the point. I have put the
cards on the table, and I would like the
Government to do the same. What is its
authority? It has not been given.
When I stand by the Constitution of this
country, I find that I am safe. What is the
trouble now? It is that the Constitution of
Canada, the B.N.A. Act, is treated as nonexistent by Ottawa and by the provinces.
They pay no attention to it.
I remember that at the time I was first
elected there was great respect for the Constitution. I remember that when Mr. Heenan
was Minister of Labour, in 1930, he moved
a bill to consider a minimum salary for the
employees of the Government of Canada, but
he did not go farther. At the time, I contemplated that employees engaged in public

May 12, 1985

works and other departments in the Province
of Quebec were paid less than those who
were doing similar work in the Province of
Ontario, and I remember that Mr. King himself corrected some of my notes. However,
what I want to point out is that at that time
there was a great respect for the Constitution, and Mr. Heenan wanted to stay within
the Constitution to pass legislation to improve
the condition of those who were working
for the Government of Canada in public
works.
That was in the past. At the present time
there are many difficulties because the spirit
of the Constitution, as well as the letter,
is not observed.
You have all read the B.N.A. Act. If you
will permit me to say so, I felt it was my
duty to check the fact that you could get all
those books free of charge from the Printing
Bureau, one copy of each in English and
one in French, printed by the Queen's Printer.
I wanted you to have the text of all publications that come from the Printing Bureau.
In my humble view, the Parliamentarian
should be served by the Printing Bureau
first. It is essential that you should have at
your disposal the acts passed by Parliament,
and all the other publications that are printed
by the bureau.
Before I analyze the Speech from the
Throne, another observation I want to make
is that in this country it is a fact that very
many people speak about liberty, freedom,
human rights and democracy, and all that.
Contradiction is not admitted, and it is not
accepted. For instance, you may go for a
walk with a friend on a perfect day. If
your friend says to you, "Well, is it not
beautiful weather?", and you say in reply,
"Yes, but don't you see the clouds there?",
immediately you will have a certain feeling
of uneasiness, because your good friend who
is with you does not say, "Beautiful, indeed,"
after you said that the weather was beautiful.
Therefore, it is very difficult to contradict
anybody.
With regard to the general achievements of
the Government, to the vigorous economic
expansion, in improving incomes and employment opportunities, here I must praise unreservedly the Minister of Trade and Commerce. He is making efforts everywhere to
boost Canadian business, to encourage the
exportation of Canadian goods throughout
the world. Besides that, he has always a message of cheer wherever he goes, to encourage all those who are engaged in business in

May 12, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Canada. Trade is the life blood of a country,
so the work he does so well must be highly
appreciated as it gives many good returns
to the Canadian people.
In regard to making federalism work, I do
not believe in co-operative federalism. What
is it? It has been described or defined as follows by one of the provincial ministers. When
the federal Government paid $10 million for
improving a highway he said, "This is co-operative federalism. Cheers! The Ottawa
Government is paying $10 million for the
construction of a highway."
It seems that, according to the letter and
the spirit of the Constitution, each legislative
body should be completely independent of
the other financially, in this sense, that the
provinces should not expect subsidies, and
progressively increased subsidies, from Ottawa and they should get enough from their
taxes to pay for their expenditures.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier used to say that it
is always a dangerous thing for one government to advance money to another one. I
find that the formula of co-operative federalism is wrong, because the increase in gifts
of subsidies from Ottawa to the provinces
will never end. We will never know where
we are.
Is it not a mistake to grant to the provinces
everything that they ask for in matters of
subsidy? There should be a definite and final
understanding between Ottawa and the provinces with regard to the collection of taxes
and the spending of money.
In regard to social progress, pensions, youth
allowances, student loans, I will deal with
those later.
Canada's influence in the world, apparently, is good. I have not the time to discuss
that matter today, otherwise I would have
spoken in reply to my good friend Senator
O'Leary (Carleton).
With respect to the constitutional amendment formula, we hear people speak of the
"repatriation" of the Constitution. That could
be said if the Constitution had been made
law in Canada and had been sent to London
afterwards; it could be "brought back" to
Canada. But it is an English statute, drafted
by the Fathers of Confederation and passed
by Westminster. Why is there not unanimous agreement between the provinces and
the Government of Canada before having the
Constitution brought to Canada?
There is something which is much simpler.
As the provincial governments and the Government at Ottawa are composed of men
22624-si

of good will, they should meet together and
agree to a new Constitution which could be
approved by the Parliament of Canada and by
the provinces and assented to by Her Majesty
the Queen of Canada. If a petition is made
to the Queen with regard to that Constitution, it should be addressed to the Queen
of Canada and not to Her Majesty the Queen
in any other capacity.
What would be the use of bringing the
Constitution to Canada while it is still unsettled? I do not believe in the F-F formula.
It should be F-F-F-for factitious, fictitious
and factious-factitious because it is artificial;
fictitious because it is imaginary, and factious
because it may lead to trouble.
In regard to redistribution by independent
commissions, the view has been expressed
that this should have been done by Parliament, but if it has been decided to have it
done by independent commissions, I shall
not insist on that point.
With regard to the flag, I have fought for
a distinctive Canadian flag with the maple
leaf as emblem. The flag which has been
adopted by this Parliament and approved
by Her Majesty the Queen is satisfactory
to me. We can provide one for $28.24-if
you want to buy a large national flag, six
feet by twelve feet, in nylon, that is what
it costs.
In regard to defence integration and policy,
I wish to felicitate the present Minister of
National Defence, the Honourable Mr.
Hellyer, for having succeeded in accomplishing a thing which has not been done
since Confederation, bringing the "brass hats"
to order. It had to be done, and he did it.
There were some complaints, but he has
done this very successfully.
Moreover, Mr. Hellyer is the only minister, to my knowledge, who has publicly
praised his former associate Minister, Mr.
Cardin, when the latter was appointed Minister of Public Works. This is a good note
for both.
On the improvement of the provinces' tax
position, equalization and increased federal
abatement, I refer to what has been said. As to
"opting out," the same thing.
In regard to constitutional amendment for
those on widows', orphans' and disability pensions, here the Government shows respect
for the Constitution. If they amend the
Constitution for that purpose, so much the
better.

SENATE DEBATES

In regard to the Canada Pension Plan, it
is a good plan and it deserves the appreciation of all.
The Old Age Security increase to $75 and
the making of it payable from age 65, are
also good measures.
As to youth allowances for those age 16
and 17, at $10 a month, I have no objection
to that. It is a continuation of the Family
Allowance policy for one more year.
On the question of student loans, these have
been asked for by nobody-neither by the
universities nor by the provinces. This means
it is a free gift to the students, which was
not asked for. I cannot understand why it has
been done, because it is a controversial matter
which will give much trouble to the Government. If the money is paid to the provinces,
the Government here will not know what is
done with it.
On the federal Labour Code, the present
policy is different from what was done in the
time of Mr. Mackenzie King and Mr. Heenan.
As to farm credit, bigger loans and their
extension to machinery partnership purchases, that is very good.
Support of crop insurance, that also is
very good.
Improved veterans' allowances: I have no
objection to that, provided that the grant of
allowances is not refused to veterans who
have served in a theatre of war and who do
not already get a pension. It is most difficult
for a veteran to get a pension in the first
instance. The rate of pension is improved for
those who already have it, and for those who
are not getting a pension it is quite a fight
to get it.
Here I should remark that all those who
have served in the armed forces and have
suffered the hardships of war are naturally
predisposed to diseases and disabilities from
which they would not suffer if they had not
been in the forces. The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Brooks), who has served as
Minister of Veterans Affairs, will understand
what I mean. These things should be taken
into consideration when a case comes before
the pension board. There are allowances
granted to those who do not receive a pension, but an allowance is a kind of charity
while a pension is a matter of right. The
veteran who is qualified must have a pension
provided by the state to compensate for the
hardships he has suffered while serving in
the armed forces, and allowances must be
reserved only for exceptional cases. The
granting of pensions should be on a broader
scale.

May 12, 1965

A 12-mile fishing zone: That is very good.
The automobile agreement: I am not familiar
with that matter.
Divorce bills: I find the legislation we have
with regard to divorce is the most absurd
that has been passed by any Parliament. I
do not criticize the membership of the committee, but I find the manner in which the
legislation was drafted is positively absurd.
The Columbia River Treaty: I feel it was
wrong to approve the policy of the Province
of British Columbia to sell the power to the
United States. Later on when that country
makes progress and the population increases,
it will be very difficult to make adjustments
with the Americans who already have agreed
to purchase the power from British Columbia.
Economie Council: I am doubtful about the
purpose of this. In 1936 I presented a bill to
abolish legislation concerning the creation of
an economic council. On this I had the support of Mr. Mackenzie King. The three readings were completed in five or ten minutes
in the House of Commons, and Mr. King
said he did not need an economic council,
that he had sufficient advisers on his staff.
Department of Industry: It is doing very
well.
Area development program: This could be
simplified if computers from the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics were used to obtain calculations which otherwise take a long time
to obtain.
Atlantic provinces development fund: Very
good.
Municipal development fund: Also very
good.
Housing expansion, winter works program,
reduced N.H.A. interest rates, more assistance for urban renewal and law: Probably
that is good.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Is there anything bad
in it?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I give the benefit of the
doubt.
Expansion in technical and vocational
training: This is a matter of education. I am
not familiar with the matter.
Then we come to the question of assistance to individuals. For instance, if anyone
employs a person two days a week, it is better for that person to keep his employee for
two days instead of sending him home and
making him work only one day.
The tax structure committee is very complicated because the imposition of taxation
depends on the expenditure, and as long as

May 12, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

the expenditure is not adjusted it is very
difficult to reduce taxes.
The Bilingual and Bicultural Commission:
I cannot understand this; it is the policy of
the defunct bloc populaire of the Province
of Quebec. One of the commissioners, whom
I shall call "fiasco"-and you all know who
that is-has given an interview to a large
newspaper in Montreal to say that the Members of Parliament here are half aldermen
and half church wardens. He was pouring
ridicule on the Members of Parliament; and
the chairman, Mr. "Snobissimo," has often
been unjust to the Members of Parliament.
However, we all know that Members of Parliament deserve a lot of credit, and it is most
unfair to abuse those who work very hard
and do their best for their electors and the
people of Canada.
I do not believe in culture; I do not believe
in bilingualism. I may be called a traitor to
my race because I say that, but I consider
that the good Canadians of my former constituency and those of any other province
are most alike, and I do not see why the
people down home who speak French should
be obliged to speak English, or why those
in British Columbia or Orangeville should be
forced to speak French. To have the principle of bilingualism extended to all is to
have a Utopia. On the other hand, I believe
that the two official languages should stand
together, and should be used in publishing
all official papers, and that the French-speaking Canadians should be on a footing of
equality with those of any other race anywhere in this country. This is my opinion.
But to preach bilingualism to the extent to
which it is being done, and to ridicule the
Members of Parliament, is pure nonsense.
Now, with regard to culture, I do not
believe in it. I do not believe in what is
called culture, for the very good reason that
culture does not exist in this country. The
teaching is so superficial and the programs
are so far from the fundamentals, it is impossible to speak of culture.
Immigration review: To have an open door
to all immigrants to this country is a mistake,
because they all should be screened. There
are various dangerous elements that come
from Europe, and this country should be
very careful about accepting them freely. I
have the utmost sympathy for the present
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration who
has so much to do because he is also Acting
Postmaster General at the present time. He
is a fair gentleman, and I hope to have an

opportunity to discuss some matters with
him in due course. However, the idea of
opening wide the doors of Canada to all immigrants would be a great error.
Reform of parliamentary procedures: One
reform with which I agree entirely is the
simplicity of the opening of Parliament.
There is nothing more ridiculous than to
have the opening of Parliament performed
in the old manner. The opening of this Parliament was done soberly and was appreciated by al those who had the opportunity of seeing it on television.
Farm assistance: Good.
Election expenses: It must be difficult to
adjust that problem.
Encouragement of science and technology:
So much the better.
Capital punishment-here we are! I remember Mr. Lapointe, a former Minister of
Justice, told me that when he had to consider a case of capital punishment he did
not sleep for a week. He had to do his duty,
but it embarrassed and pained him. It was
painful for him to make a decision in such
matters. But, on the other hand, society must
be protected, and just because it is a most
difficult matter to deal with that does not
mean to say it can be avoided. When a
Member of Parliament accepts the portfolio
of Minister of Justice he must realize that
he will have to fulfil the same obligations as
those of his predecessors. I read one day in
the press that capital punishment was
abolished until legislation was passed by the
Parliament of Canada.
There was a Mr. Bickerdike, the member
for St. Lawrence in Montreal, at the time
of Laurier, who advocated the abolition of
capital punishment at every session for a
time, and then he left politics. The matter
was again brought to the fore by a young
member who was elected by the largest
majority in Canada. After he had succeeded
in having legislation passed regarding noncapital murder he was not re-elected.
People are very concerned about what
happens in this country when so many are
exposed to persons who suffer perhaps from
a mental disorder of some kind, but is it
because they suffer from a mental disorder
that capital punishment should be abolished?
To my mind, the best example that could be
cited is that of a lioness that was kept as a
pet in Quebec City. She killed a child, and
a constable came and shot her. I feel it was
the way to deal with that case, in the manner
in which such cases have been dealt with at
all times to get rid of dangerous beings,

SENATE DEBATES
whether they belonged to the animal kingdom or not. Then, at the present time, when
I was coming to Ottawa I read in the press
that a man who had killed a woman with an
iron bar to steal her purse, and had been
found guilty of murder and sentenced to the
scaffold, had had his sentence commuted.
It is a very sad thing, and the matter will
have to be reconsidered in due course. I am
not surprised that the Attorney General of
Quebec said that those who were for the
abolition of capital punishment were the
criminals themselves. It was hard to say, but
it was said by him.
Take for instance the recent case of the
young woman of 16 who was kidnapped,
raped, killed and buried. Nothing was done
until recently to discover who was the murderer, though the people of the vicinity knew
about the case. Then the murderer confessed
his crime. What will happen to him? He
will be sent to jail for a certain period of
time if be is found guilty by the court according to his confession, and then he will
be set free.
Why should we encourage those who are a
danger to society? There are certain societies
-- there is the John Howard Society to which
Members of Parliament belong, and Mr.
Arthur Maloney of Toronto has started another one of a similar type. I wonder how
many members of both houses belong to the
John Howard Society and the other organization for the abolition of the death penalty for
criminals.
When you have children or grandchildren
you do not know what will happen to them,
unless all those dangerous perverts and criminals are dealt with in a way that bas been
considered the best one for all times.
Then, the last item is the Senate retirement age. There was a suggestion I thought
of making to the Government, to appoint the
Leaders of the Opposition groups-except Mr.
Diefenbaker, who is the official Leader of the
Opposition-to the Senate: Mr. Thompson, to
fill the vacancy in Alberta; Mr. Douglas, to
fill the vacancy in British Columbia; Mr.
Caouette, to fill the vacancy in the Province
of Quebec. There is also a vacancy in Ontario
for Mr. Fisher. Then we will have livelier
sittings in the Senate.
That being said, I must say that the present
Government, the Pearson Government, has
treated the Senate as well as the House of
Commons. In that regard we must appreciate what bas been done by our Leader, Senator Connolly (Ottawa West), and Senator Ross
Macdonald, who is doing exceedingly well as

May 12, 1965

Chancellor of the University of Waterloo.
They have eliminated the differences that existed before with regard to travelling expenses, etcetera. To be fair, I must mention
that our colleague, Senator Croll, was with
them and supported their recommendations to
the Government. Those recommendations were
accepted.
There is now a bill before the House of
Commons for the reform of the Senate. The
Senate could be reformed by the Senate itself, and the Government could help it. I
have thought of this, and I have spoken to
some of my colleagues about it. When the
bill for the retirement of senators comes before us I wonder if it will be possible to leave
aside all political considerations in respect
to amending the bill, and to institute a nonpartisan committee composed of an equal
number of senators on the Government and
Opposition sides, which will decide what senators should retire. I think that that could be
done in a just manner if the pension is adequate for the incumbents.
Naturally, all senators are not rich men, in
spite of current rumour. Some of us are more
fortunate than others in respect to wordly
possessions. I wonder, therefore, if it would
not be possible to come to a satisfactory conclusion on the matter.
I must say that among our senior colleagues there are some who are younghearted, and who work hard and regularly
attend the sittings of the Senate. They perforn their duties just as well as any younger
man. It is not a question of age. In the first
place it is a question of attendance and, in
the second place, of physical fitness. This bill
will release those who suffer from illness of
some kind from the obligation of coming here.
The manner in which the Senate could proceed to that kind of reform, a manner that
would not be painful, would be to strike from
the list of the committees the names of those
senators who do not attend half of the sittings.
I remember that Senator Marcotte from
Saskatchewan used to say that a senator held
public office, and he should first be a senator, and place his private business second to
his public business. Mind you, it is a sacrifice
for us to come to Ottawa fron distant parts
of the country. I wonder if the matter could
be considered successfully to the benefit of
the Senate. It is not a question of infringing
upon the rights of individuals. The object is
just to give certain members of this house the
opportunity of enjoying a well-deserved rest.

May 12, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Among the membership of this house there
are some who are over 75 years of age, and
some who are over 80. Our older senators do
very well. If those who complain about the
Senate attend its sittings and its committee
meetings, they would realize that attendance
is not a question of age but a question of
good will and physical ability.
I wonder if honourable senators are satisfled with the amount of pension that is mentioned in the bill, and whether they are willing to retire. We should consider whether
a pension that is almost equal to the indemnity that is paid now, less travelling expenses,
is sufficient to induce those who are not well
to retire. The pension proposed for widows
of senators is far from being adequate, especially when the amount paid to judges, who
make no contributions to their pensions, and
to their widows, is considered.
Having said what I have, I regret that I
have spoken longer than I intended, but I
wanted to discuss these matters in the friendliest manner with you. I hope that what I
have said will be taken in the spirit I intend, because I am proud of being a member
of the Senate, and I want my colleagues to be
happy and to continue their good work in
this chamber.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Fournier
(Madawska-Restigouche), debate adjourned.
OTTAWA TERMINAL RAILWAY BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill S-3, to incorporate the Ottawa
Terminal Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill to
incorporate the Ottawa Terminal Railway
Company comes before the Senate as a
sequel to Bill S-33 of the last session that
was, passed by this house on July 22, 1964,
but which failed to pass the other place before prorogation.
I am sure all honourable senators will remember that as a result of a thorough discussion of Bill S-33 in the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications last
session, consideration was given to certain
proposed amendments relating to the licensing of services having to do with the transfer of goods and passengers by means of
trucks, buses, cabs or other highway vehicles,
as provided in paragraphs (e) and (g) of section 10. The present bill is a revision of the
previous bill, in so far as those provisions
are concerned.

In paragraph (e) of section 10 the word
"license" in the last line has been deleted.
This particular amendment was made by
the Minister at the request of the City of
Ottawa, which pointed out that the right to
grant licenses to third parties as provided
for in the old bill might unintentionally grant
such licensees immunity from the city's
by-laws.
In paragraph (g) the words "and passengers"
and the words "buses, cabs" have been
deleted. This change was made at the request
of the Ottawa Transportation Commission,
which claimed that its franchise to operate
public passenger transportation services in the
city was being transgressed by paragraph (g).
A third change has been made in Part II of
the schedule attached to the bill, section 26
on page 17, referring to the date for the
closing of transfers of land. As set forth
in the explanatory note to clause 26, the parties to the memorandum contained in the
schedule have agreed to extend again the
date of actual transfer to March 31, 1965. The
original understanding was that that transfer
would be completed by the end of last year.
If this bill as amended meets with the approval of honourable senators, I think it
should be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Commnuications to
clarify this particular provision in the schedule.
The reason for delay is not made very
clear, and there were a good many estimates
or guesses expressed at the committee as to
the valuation of the lands that would be
exchanged between the railways and this
commission, and vice versa, at that time. I
think therefore it would be apropos if the
committee looked at this revised bill, and
obtained some evidence by the officials as to
what the prospects are for the bill and what
the reasons are for the delay in connection
with the transfer of these lands.
I do not think there is anything else in
connection with this bill that is not repetitious of the one we considered last session.
I therefore move that second reading be
approved now.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have read the bill as carefully as possible. I have also gone through the Memorandum of Understanding, perhaps not with a
fine tooth comb, but reasonably carefully,
and I can find nothing in this bill with regard
to the employees of the railways. There is
something about the directors and the president, and how much they are to be paid,

SENATE DEBATES
and about the transfer of property, and various things of that kind. Apparently it is not
only a question of the road and the terminal,
but I understand there is to be a change in
the lines. However, there is absolutely nothing with regard to the employees, with one
little exception, that in paragraph 30 of the
memorandum, it is stated:
... the Commission shall in no instance

be liable hereunder where such injury
or damage results from negligence on
the part of one or more of the railway
companies, their employees, servants or
agents.
So, apparently the railroad is not to run
itself, and there are to be employees. Other
than that, there is nothing suggested in either
the bill or the Memorandum of Understanding with regard to the men who must run
this road, the running trades, the non-ops
and so on.

My mind goes back a long way in this
matter, not quite so far as this in detail, but
I have before me an act entitled Canadian
National-Canadian Pacifie Act, passed in
1932-33. It had a number of purposes. There
is the organization to some extent of the
Canadian Pacific Railway, and something
about the Canadian National Railway. The
real purpose of the act, as I see it, the core
of the act, is to provide for co-operation
between the Canadian National and the
Canadian Pacifie.
Somewhat later on during the war, when
it was most necessary to conserve both our
material resources and our manpower, there
were proposals made for the running of pool
trains. The late C. D. Howe was in charge
at that time. Under Part II of that act, under
the heading, "Co-operation between National
Railways and Pacific Railways," in section
17, paragraph 1, I find it speaks about authorizing the parties to agree
...
upon such co-operative measures,
plans and arrangements as are fair and
reasonable and best adapted (with due
regard to equitable distribution of burden
and advantage as between them) to effect
such purposes...
That is to say, these parties were to agree,
if possible, on a fair deal. I think that is
pointed particularly at the pool trains. The
paragraph goes on to say:
... and they are further directed that
whenever they shall so agree they shall
endeavour to provide through negotiations with the representatives of the

May 12, 1965

employees affected, as part of such measure, plan or arrangement or otherwise,
for a fair and reasonable apportionment
as between the employees of National
Railways and Pacifie Railways, respectively, of such employment as may be incident to the operation of such measure,
plan or arrangement.
Nothing of that kind appears in this bill
with regard to the welfare of the employees.
Not only that, but over many years
gone by, agreements have been entered
into between the employees and the employers, and the agreements have developed over
the years with a good deal of discussion and
wisdom applied. So far as this bill is concerned, however, all those agreements go by
the board. The railway is to be transferred
to independent parties, but so far as this
proposed act is concerned, the new managers
are to be free from any obligations or benefits that may be derived from these agreements developed over the years.
In the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific
Act, which is before me, where co-operation
of the kind that is envisaged in this bill was
under consideration, you will find in section
17(3), the following paragraph:
The National Company and the Pacifie
Company for and on behalf as aforesaid
are directed to endeavour to provide
that any new company, created as in subsection (2) referred to, shall give preference for work to employees in any
services or any works taken over by
such new company.
That is to say that the employees in the original companies now taken over by another
company shall have a preference. There is
nothing of that kind in this act.
Another provision, too, is important in a
much better considered act than the bill that
is before us. It says:
29.(l) The rates of pay, hours of work
and other terms and conditions of employment of employees, of National Railways or Pacifie Railways, engaged in
the construction, operation or maintenance of National Railways or Pacifie
Railways shall be such as are set out in
any agreements in writing respecting
such employees made from time to time

SENATE DEBATES

or terminal, such as we have under consideration, the agreements between the railroad
company's employees and the railroad shall
be adopted and shall apply. I suggest that
this bill should be amended along those lines.
I am not prepared to draw the exact phrase
that we should add.
Certainly, honourable senators, we should
not pass this bill as it is. It sets up a commission for the operation of the road and deals
with the transfer of the property, the protection of the management from the negligence
of its employees, and all that kind of thing
with regard to management; but it takes no
consideration whatsoever for the welfare of
the employees.
This is not the time on second reading
to amend the bill, but I am pleased to hear
my friend, Senator Lambert, say that he
will ask that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications. I trust that when the committee meets
it will hear the representatives of the railway unions. I know they will have something to say about this matter before we
pass this bill, and they should be invited.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: They are a little late
in presenting their case, not having presented
it before the committee when it did sit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am not sure that
they were notified of the bill or invited to
be heard. Anyway, that is threshing old
straw. The bill which we passed before did
not pass the House of Commons. I am quite
sure that if this bill as it now stands goes
to the Commons, it will be attacked there
very vigorously indeed.
However that may be, we in this chamber
have always taken special care to invite
before our committees those who are specially
affected by legislation which we propose.
Therefore, I suggest to the chairman of the
committee that notice be given to all the
railroad employees affected, through the
unions, and that the unions be heard in
this connection before we pass this bill.
I am sure that we in this chamber are
as much concerned about the welfare of
the employees of the railroad as we are
about the welfare of the management and
the railroad itself. That is all I wish to say
in connection with the matter.
I am glad to see that we are making
progress with the enterprise itself. I have
no doubt that the new terminal will serve
the public and I am not in any way criticizing that. However, I do point out the very
22624-6

evident and obvious omission from this bill
of any reference whatever to the employees
who must carry on the business.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I am a little surprised at what my honourable friend has just said. I was the
chairman of the Committee on Transport
and Communications which considered the
previous bill last session, and I must say it
never occurred to me or to any members of
the committee at that time that this was a
bill in which the employees as a union were
particularly concerned. It seemed to us that
this was merely an enabling bill to incorporate the Ottawa Terminal Railway Company with certain powers. Certainly, when
we considered the bill last year-and we
considered it quite carefully over two or
three sittings, as I recall-nobody made any
representations to us that the railway unions
should be heard.
I am quite certain the committee will be
only too glad to hear the unions if they wish
to be heard; and I will take note of my
honourable friend's suggestion. The railway
unions certainly will be notified of the hearings on this bill, if it gets second reading
and is referred to the Committee on Transport and Communications.
I really do not quite see that, at this particular stage when the company is being
incorporated, the unions will have any special
interest in the matter. The bill states that
the Railway Act shall apply to the company
and its undertaking. I would normally suppose that, once the company is incorporated
and starts its operations, it will have to enter
into negotiations with the railway unions,
just like any other railway company.
I must say, honourable senators, that from
what one believes generally to be the case,
the railway unions in this country are very
active in the interests of their employees
and certainly would not allow any matter to
go by default in relation to the interests of
their employees in connection with this bill.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: The Labour Code, too,
will apply to them.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, undoubtedly. If I
had had any idea last year that my honourable
friend was going to take this position this
year, I would certainly, as Chairman of the
Committee on Transport and Communications,
have made certain that the railway unions
were notified of our hearings on this bill. As
I say, the hearings took place on two or three
days, spread over two or three weeks. They
were not confined to one hearing on one day.

SENATE DEBATES

As to when the new station will be completed, it is supposed to be ready in time for
our anniversary in 1967. That is one reason
why I am rather concerned about the amendment in the schedules to the effect that the
time for the completion of the transfer of lands
has been deferred still further, until the end
of March. I think that by having the committee hear further evidence from the officials and, as Senator Roebuck has said,
from the railway officials or the unions connected with the railways, we might have
more light on these different questions that
have been asked.
In the meantime I can only say that the
memories of those who attended the committee meetings last session must be very
short, because this whole project was very
thoroughly discussed then, without any
reference whatever from the labour interests
involved. Apart from the representatives of
the trucking trade, no exceptions were taken
to the proposal.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Senator Lambert
has said that the centre of the city is changing its location. Does he think it will be necessary to change the site of the Parliament
Buildings and the Chateau Laurier to have
them in the new centre?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: If the sessions of Parliament continue to last as long as they have
lasted in recent years, there might be something to be said for that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the mover of
the bill if the question of moving the station
was outlined when we discussed this matter
last year? Was it stated at that time that the
station was to be moved to what he now
calls the centre of the city? I do not remember.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes. Our good friend
the chairman of the Transport and Communications Committee referred to it in this
way, that it was going to be moved to the
sticks.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Where is that?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hurdman's Bridge,
three miles out.

22624-6j

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If I may speak again,
some years ago I objected rather strongly
to moving the station out from the centre
of the city. My feelings were along the same
lines as my friend Senator Macdonald (Brantford) has in mind. For this reason, I was particularly interested in the evidence given
by both railway companies on this point at
the sittings of the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications last year. I
had been very much concerned that they
would feel that they were being pushed away
from the centre of the city, and that thereby
they would lose a considerable amount of their
passenger traffic to the air line companies
and the buses. However, the railway representatives did not take that view at all; they
said, as an honourable senator said today,
that the centre of the city is moving out
in a southerly direction, and they felt that the
majority of people living in Ottawa who
desire to travel by train will be better served
by the station in its new location than they
are by the station in its present location where
there is considerable traffic congestion. Apparently the new station will be situated
where there will be a convergence of through
highways which will make it very easy to
get to.
There is the further consideration that a
number of important government buildings
are moving out to the perimeter of the city in
the southerly and easterly directions, and it
will be easier to get to the new station from
those buildings than it is at the present time.
As I have said, I was rather surprised that
this should be the attitude of the railway
companies. But, as they explained, they do
not expect to lose traffic by the relocation of
the station to the proposed new site.

Hon. John J. Connolly moved, pursuant
to notice:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be authorized to examine and
report upon the expenditures proposed
by the Estimates laid before Parliament
for the fiscal year ending 31st March,
1966, in advance of the bills based on the
said Estimates reaching the Senate;
That the said committee be empowered
to send for persons, papers and records
and to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; and
That the quorum of the said committee
be reduced to seven members.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, this is a self-explanatory motion and one
with which I think all honourable members
of this house are in agreement. As Senator
Aseltine pointed out on another occasion
when a similar motion was presented, this
was not always so.
I am told that the first occasion upon which
the Estimates were referred to a standing
committee of the Senate was in 1943, at which
time there was considerable debate as to the
appropriateness of the Senate's making such
a study as was proposed in the motion. However, it was so resolved, and the study was
undertaken.
That procedure was followed again in 1950
when there was another fairly wide-ranging
type of proposal, which resulted in the same
step being taken. Since that time the principle of adopting a motion of this kind has
been generally recognized as a proper step
for this chamber to take.
Since 1950 the Estimates have been referred to the Standing Committee on Finance
on seven different occasions. Many honourable senators will remember the study made
in 1959 on the problem of inflation. On each
occasion that the committee met, witnesses
were called, documents presented and examined, and a thorough study made. These

THE ESTIMATES
FINANCE COMMITTEE EMPOWERED TO
EXAMINE AND REPORT

SENATE DEBATES
studies were not made into the details of the
Estimates-the Estimates were not examined
as they are in another place-but certain
aspects of governmental activity were discussed, and the committee's reports were
usually fairly comprehensive. I should add
that in every case the report of the committee
has been deemed very good and useful.
In 1950 the committee's report, presented
by Senator Crerar, the chairman at that time,
dealt principally with the form in which
the Government's accounts were presented.
As a result of that study changes were made
in the form in which the book of Estimates
was prepared. In 1964 the committee undertook a study of the operation of the Government establishment itself in the light of the
recommendations of the report of the Glassco
Commission.
A few weeks ago I was reading the Debates of the House of Lords for a year or so
back, and discovered that that house had
initiated a debate on the structure of the
Government. The debate covered a wide
field, and some very experienced political
people took part. That is the kind of debate
we have had in this chamber, but we have
gone a little further in referring the subject
matter of the motion to a standing committee
which has arranged for the hearing of
evidence and production of documents. This
is a more effective way of looking into problems of public interest, because the work is
done in a forum that is unique in this country. The work performed by the committee
last year made a useful contribution to
government.
I could even go back to 1956 when the
Senate Finance Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Hawkins, explored the
concepts of gross national product and gross
national expenditure. This was a good public
service, and the report of the committee was
very favourably commented on in the press.
The terms of reference in this instance are
as broad as they can be. They refer the Estimates to the committee, and it will be for
the chairman, in consultation with the members, to set up a steering committee to decide
upon what particular subject matter they are
to pursue, and to make the necessary arrangements for the calling of witnesses and the
presentation of documents, in order to make
a report upon the topic selected for study.
Before I resume my seat, L would pay
tribute to the Senators who have served as
chairman of this committee in other years.
I have already mentioned Senator Crerar. I
will also mention the late Senator Hawkins,

May 13, 1965

whose report was presented in the Senate
almost an hour after his untimely and sudden
death.
I would also refer to the report of the
committee of which Senator Emerson was
chairman, as well as that of last year when
Senator Leonard was chairman. Once again
we are indeed fortunate to have Senator
Leonard as chairman of this important and
significant committee.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
I have only a few words to say on this
motion.
First, may I join with the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly) in expressing our appreciation of the
work done by previous chairmen of the
Finance Committee, and also our great satisfaction that the committee will be chaired
this session by Senator Leonard.
There is no objection to this committee
being set up. It has done excellent work in
the past, as the Leader of the Senate has just
stated, and has presented some excellent
reports. Anyone who reads Senate Hansard
will realize how much work has been done
by this committee.
Last year the committee discussed and
studied the Glassco Report. Sometimes I wonder how much is gained from such reports,
unless recommendations are made and implemented. I know that some of the recommendations of the Glassco Report have been implemented, but I understand that the majority
of them have not been touched. That report
dealt with many subjects, and I think the
general public feels it was an excellent report,
and that perhaps there should be some further
study this year of the Glassco Report and that
its recommendations should be further implemented.
With respect to a study of the Estimates
by this committee, may I say that the Leader
of the Government expressed himself very
well. It is simply a fiction to say that all
the Estimates can be studied by the Finance
Committee, since there are some twenty or
more departments with which to deal. It
would be impossible. The Estimates are
studied for weeks in the other place, and I
understand that they are now trying to reduce the time for debate to some thirty days
or so, according to a report which is being
brought down.
Those who have had to present Estimates
before the Commons know that the studying
of them is a long and tedious matter. There
are thousands of items to be studied. This
cannot be done thoroughly here, and we

May 13, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

should not expect it to be done. I have heard
members in this house ask questions as to
how much was spent on this or that item.
It sounded ridiculous to me, because the
Leader of the Government in the Senate is
not sufficiently familiar with the Estimates
to answer such questions. He has no one in
front of him to assist him, nor bas he the
record to deal with the information.
Honourable senators, I simply wish to say
that we are heartily in agreement with the
setting up of this committee. If any honourable senator does not understand some
item which is in the Blue Book, or wishes
information about it, he has only to refer it
to this committee and he can get all the
information he needs. Therefore, the committee is really a safety valve, as it were,
so far as the Senate is concerned. By means
of this committee, the Senate, as in the past,
will be able to make a worthy contribution by
its study of any particular item or items
which may be brought before it. We are therefore strongly in favour of the committee
being set up.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
am happy to congratulate both the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly) and
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Brooks) on the remarks they have made. I
think it is expedient and proper that such a
resolution be introduced in this house, as
was done in previous sessions.
I was elected to Parliament for the first
time in 1917. I believe that the honourable
Senator Power, the honourable Senator
Crerar and myself are the only three survivors in Parliament of that election. I refer
to that only for the purpose that I do not
believe I have ever sat during any session
of Parliament when some remarks were not
made on the necessity for the Senate being
given sufficient time to examine the Estimates
properly. The motion to set up the proposed
committee is precisely to correct that situation.
There is nothing in the British North
America Act or in the Rules of the Senate
to prevent such a motion or such a committee
from sitting.
There are various opinions at large, and
even accepted as being words of the Gospel,
which are absolutely incorrect. People are
sometimes prompted to think that the Senate bas nothing to do with financial bills, the
Estimates, or with the financial undertakings
of the Government. That is altogether wrong.
This impression has been created owing to
a miscontruing of sections 53 and 54 of the

B.N.A. Act, which do not say anything of
the sort. Section 53 reads:
Bills for appropriating any part of the
public revenue, or for imposing any tax
or impost, shall originate in the House
of Commons.
Section 54 reads:
It shall not be lawful for the House
of Commons to adopt or pass any vote,
resolution, address, or bill for the appropriation of any part of the Public revenue, or of any tax or impost, to any
purpose that has not been first recommended to that house by message of the
Governor General in the session in which
such vote, resolution, address, or bill is
proposed.
Therefore, the only restriction imposed with
respect to financial bills is that they shall be
introduced in the House of Commons. Once
introduced there the powers of the Senate
and the powers of the House of Commons
are exactly the same. This is clearly indicated in section 18 of the B.N.A. Act,
which reads:
The privileges, immunities, and powers
to be held, enjoyed, and exercised by
the Senate and by the House of Commons and by the Members thereof respectively shall be such as are from time
to time deemed by Act of the Parliament
of Canada, but so that the same shall
never exceed those at the passing of
this Act held, enjoyed, and exercised
by the Commons House of Parliament
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland and by the Members thereof.
Therefore, outside of the provisions of section 53 of the British North America Act
-which provide that a financial bill or a
tax bill must be introduced in the House of
Commons first and submitted to the bouse by
a minister of the Crown, with the approval
of the Governor General-the powers of
members of the House of Commons and of
members of the Senate are exactly the same.
It has been held in the Commons a number
of times that a member of the House of
Commons cannot introduce a motion with a
view to raising expenditures which have
been suggested by the Government in the
budget provisions. However, once a financial
bill is introduced in the House of Commons
by a Minister of the Crown, with the approval
of the Governor General, the powers of members of the House of Commons and the members of the Senate are exactly the same with
respect to such financial bill.

mover and the seconder, Senator Aird and
Senator Bourque. Senator Aird, a new and
welcome member to this house, carried out
his duty in the high tradition of this chamber.
Senator Bourque, who has a vast experience
both in civie affairs and politics, and who is
a perfect gentleman, was at his best. He
was gentle, polite, soft-spoken; and he did
a wonderful job with the material on which
he had to work. When I heard his address I
was inclined to think that the honourable
senator had read a different Speech from the
Throne from that presented to the Canadian
people on April 5. However, I am sure we
all agree that both deserve high praise for
their accomplishment.
Honourable senators, I am sure I am in
order in praising His Honour the Speaker
on the impartial and fair way in which he
conducts the business of this bouse.
Our two house leaders, honourable Senator
Connolly (Ottawa West) and honourable Senator Brooks, are really an inspiration to us,
the younger group, who can learn more by
listening and observing than by "bragging".
In their own capacity these two gentlemen
are giving us an example of leadership which
I hope will be followed for a long time to
come--but naturally by a reversal of their
roles.
Reading the Speech from the Throne leads
one to believe that it was prepared by a
nervous group, not knowing too well whether
they were coming or going. There were many
newspaper comments on it. Here are some
of them: Toronto Star, by Peter Newman,
"Shows fear of the N.D.P."; Toronto Telegram,
by Lubor J. Zink, "A great basket of attractive Easter eggs. A ballot bait"; Ottawa Citizen editorial, "A massive welfare platform
for the campaign trail"; Peterborough Examiner editorial, "Imitation of American programs"; Hamilton Spectator editorial, "As
big as the sky and as far away"; London
Free Press editorial, "Should serve to polish
the Government image"; Calgary Herald
editorial, "Potentially controversial"; Toronto
Globe and Mail, by Fraser Robertson, "Snub
to businessmen"; Sudbury Star editorial,
"Weak imitation of Washington"; Victoria
Daily Colonist, "Loaded with attractivesounding thought, ill-defined proposals";
Sudbury Star editorial, "Nothing very original
or inspiring-mostly borrowed"; Financial
Post editorial, "Speech tells half the storymore crucial half in budget." And I could
go on for quite some time. Personally, I will
call it something else. It has great similarity
to an octopus, a jellyfish, with lots of legs
feeling its way around in the dark.

Honourable senators, let me assure you that
I will direct my remarks specifically to the
Speech we heard this year, not the one we
heard last year, nor the year before nor
the one which may be anticipated next year.
I have perused the Speech from the Throne
for many hours. It is hard to find in it any
immediate measure to improve the welfare of
the Canadian people except at a very high
cost to the taxpayer. The Speech refers to
several measures, but fails to state how long
it will be before they are implemented and
how costly they will be to the Canadian
people. Some people and newspapers have
estimated the cost of this whole scheme at
some $3 billion. One must bear in mind
that someone has to pay for all these gratuities, social services and government assistance of all kinds.
The Speech refers to a war on poverty.
I can see in this a greater war on the wealthy.
Many honourable senators will remember
that years ago there was an American bandit
group which had as a philosophy to rob the
wealthy and give to the poor. I do not agree
with the methods used by the gang nor do
I agree with the word "robbing" but otherwise I see quite a similarity. I feel that the
wealthy have an obligation towards the poor.
Not so long ago a statement was made to
the effect that a country which cannot support its poor cannot survive. But, honourable
senators, the wealthy have a right to know
how their contributions, whether by taxes
or in other forms, are to be used.
We know what bas happened to the unemployment insurance scheme, which was in
itself a very good social measure. Social
assistance was also a good measure, but we
also know what has happened to it. Old Age
Assistance combined with unemployment
insurance and social assistance plus some
other benefits have in many Canadian families
reached a vicious circle not only to the parents who are living on those services, but
for the family-usually a large one-which
they are raising with the apparent philosophy,
"Don't work, the Government owes you a
lifetime pension; get everything you can from
the Government and contribute nothing."
Honourable senators, war on poverty is not
a handout, but is carried on by making jobs
available as promised by the Government
of the day. Canadians are not a lazy people;
give them employment with a reasonable
salary and they will be happy. But let us
give them enough so that they can live a
decent life, have enough income to educate

SENATE DEBATES
their children and provide food and shelter
for their families. Let us make it possible
for them to enjoy the facilities for living
which are now available to mankind.
May I refer to a statement made with all
the wisdom of the honourable Senator Macdonald (Brantford). It is to be found in
Hansard of the Senate of October 4, 1962, at
page 39, when the honourable senator, as
Leader of the Opposition in this house, was
very doubtful of the mandate and authority
of the Government of that day, being a
minority group. I would like to quote just
the last part of his statement on that
occasion:
It has no clear mandate from the people,
either as to general policy or as to
specifie measures. We must, as a responsible second chamber, take the general attitude that no piece of government
legislation which might come before us
in the current session could be said to
have behind it a clear popular mandate.
Therefore, it will be necessary for us
in each case to give all legislation even
more searching investigation than has
been our custom following a conclusive
popular verdict.
Being a newcomer in this house at that
time, I listened with close attention to his
declaration, and it appeared to be made
with such sincerity that he had me almost
convinced he was right.
I wonder if the honourable senator still
thinks in the same way. I would like to
add that in those days, even if the Government was a minority group, it was a group
where integrity and public interest were of
prime order. Following the honourable senator's advice, I feel that this house bas a
duty not only to give searching investigation
to all legislation, but also to some legislators.
The Speech from the Throne outlined some
good measures, and I would like to mention
some of them. The interest in and assistance
to the underdeveloped countries will be maintained, and our collaboration with NATO and
the United Nations and our peace-keeping
efforts will be maintained to the high standard
expected of Canadians. The efforts to
strengthen the unity of the Canadian people
will be given special consideration. I have,
however. some different views on the method
of approach and I fear some of the results.
The proposed establishment of a Canadian
Dairy Commission would be only a duplication of many provincial dairy commissions
already in existence, and would be very little

May 13, 1965

help to the industry. I fail to see where yet
another commission can be of any assistance
to the dairy producers.
The proposed establishment of an Indian
Claims Commission deserves a lot of merit.
The proposal regarding limitation of election
expenses is long overdue, and I hope this
will not be a one-way street whereby Opposition parties would be limited to a narrow
path, but that the same measure will apply
to all parties, including the party in power.
Canadians should be left free to vote as they
see fit and should not be subjected to bargaining. The amendment to the Immigration Act
will be welcomed.
The proposed measure to establish an age
of retirement for senators is, in my opinion,
a step in the right direction.
I note with interest that it is the intention
of the Government te:
consider comprehensive legislation to reform public regulation of the railways
and to facilitate the adaptation of the
railway system to present and future
needs . . .
I hope that the measure will net be te assist
the railway companies but rather te establish
passenger and rail services for those Canadian
people who by their taxes are assisting the
railways in their financial difficulties without
having such services provided. Their only
means of transportation is by private automobile which they must use on roads which
often leave much to be desired. A railway
passenger service is greatly needed in my
own region along the St. John Valley. I wish
to compliment the Edmundston Chamber of
Commerce which is at the present time giving
this matter special attention. I wish them
every success.
The Speech from the Throne, to my mind,
has very little in the way of immediate assistance te New Brunswick. It includes nothing
constructive about the Prince Edward Island
causeway, the development of the tidal power
of Passamaquoddy, the Chignecto Canal,
which honourable senators have heard about
for the last 50 years, and the proposed corridor road through the State of Maine. It is
true that this corridor road seems to have
met with some objections from a few people
in my region. However, I do net share the
views of the objectors, for experience has
now taught us that such new projects arouse
the ire of some people in some areas presumed to be affected. But when such projects
are completed and in operation, they are
usually successful and promote the economy
in one way or another.

However, I regret to say that politics have
infiltrated to a very dangerous level into the
proposed full development of the St. John
River. 1 arn referring to the great electric
power potential of the 'Upper St. John River,
the so-called Rankins Rapids power project.
I recommend strongly to the federal Government on both sicles, Canadian and American,
that they arrive at a decision without further
delay, once and for all. either to build it or
kill it and bury it. People are getting disturbed over this waiting and buck-passing
attitude, and the whole Upper St. John
economy, Canadian and American, is staggermng while waiting for a decision on this
immense power project.
One of the recommendations contained in
the Speech from the Throne reads as follows:
You wrnl be asked to approve the
creation of a fund for rural economic
development and, in order to provide for
fuller integration of action for rural development, amendments to the legisiation
regarding ARDA will be placed before
you.
Honourable senators, I arn sure that the
purpose of ARDA-which stands for Agridultural Rehabilitation and Development Actwas to assist farmers in the solution of agricultural problerns, to promote assistance ini the
farming operation, and not to build recreation
facilities-such as motels, dance halls, beer
parlours, swimming pools and bowling alleys
-which are flot relevant to agriculture. While
I arn not suggesting that this is now done
to the extent that I have mentioned, I do
flot say either that it is not done to a certain
extent in my province. I belleve that a dloser
watch has to be kept by the Senate over
the people who have the responsibility of
spending the taxpayers' money and to ensure
that such money be spent for the purpose for
which it was voted.
I arn sure that the matter of the abolition
of capital punishment will be of great interest even to those who are not members
of the legal profession, and I hope to have

a few words to say on this matter when it
is presented to this house for consideration.
On two occasions not too many years ago
I witnessed the administering of capital
punishrnent, and I hope that these experiences
will be of some value when the proper time
cornes.
I regret and deplore some of the statements
made in the other house about the Senate
and senators. It is difficult to believe that
such statements could be made by responsible people, unless for the one purpose of
clearing the way of any obstruction which
could save our democratic principles from
the evil of socialist principles, which socialisrn
is today camouflaged under the name of New
Democratic. This should be a warning to the
Canadian people that when such statements
are made by so-called responsible people
who proclaim to have aIl the answers, they
act with little responsibility and our freedorn,
liberty and free enterprise are in danger.
It is a public admission that those honourable
members know very little of the work being
done by the Senate.
[ Translation]
Honourable senators, I would have liked
to discuss briefly with you the question of
bilingualismn and biculturalisrn. However,
since the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission has
not yet completed its inquiry, it would be
advisable to remain sulent for the moment.
You can rest assured, however, that when
the commission will have completed its work,
I shall then have the opportunity to express
my views on this important subject.

Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, in participating in the debate on the
motion for an address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne I should like to join with

May 18, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

my colleagues in congratulating those who
have preceded me and, in particular, Senator Bourque and Senator Aird who moved
and seconded this motion. It was Senator
Aird's maiden speech in this chamber.
I propose to deal with a few of the items
in the Speech from the Throne, and those
only briefly. Reference has been made on
frequent occasions to the amount of material
in the Speech. It was certainly a substantial
plateful. It might even be called an omnibus speech. I see nothing wrong with that. It
is always a good thing, I think, to put more
material before the people than can possibly
be dealt with, because it provides a target
for continued work into the future.
I propose to discuss first the proposals that
are presently before the other place for the
revision of the rules of the House of Commons. The present rules have long had their
day. They are "horse-and-buggy" rules which
have been, in some respects, retarding the
speed with which legislation can pass the
Commons. It is time they were brought up
to date so that the Commons can deal efficiently with the tremendous amount of business that is placed before it. Many of these
rules were put into effect when the Government's business was measured by a few
hundred millions of dollars. The Estimates
for this year will total something over $8
billion.
In addition, the business of government is
becoming increasingly difficult and complex,
and the rules need to be streamlined so that
the country's business may be expedited
without impairment of the rights of the
people's elected representatives. This can be
done, in my opinion, without too much difficulty.
I wish to comment briefly next on what
has become known as the war on poverty.
Remarks have been made to the effect that
this is a program lifted holus-bolus from
another country. I see nothing wrong with
taking a good idea from any source, and I
think we would be wise to do it more often.
In that connection I have here a little
pamphlet put out by a group of businessmen
in my old home town of Edmonton, known
as the Collective Group. It is a financial
group.
In that document is a statement which
would seem to suggest to me that there is
some need for a war on poverty. This is
apropos of the necessity of encouraging Canadians to save and invest in their own country.
It reads:

Take any group of 100 Canadian men
at age 25, and follow them through to
age 65.
Statistics show that of these 100, 28
will have died, one will be rich, seven
will be well-to-do, 22 will still be working and self-supporting, but the other 42
will be dependent on assistance of some
kind.
Yet the average Canadian will earn in
excess of $200,000 during this time. And
he will get to 65 with less than $800.
That suggests to me, as I have said, that there
is some need for a war on poverty, some need
to encourage people to save and to make more
provision for their retirement years.
The next point I want to comment on
briefly is what I believe to be the most exciting piece of legislation in the whole Speech
from the Throne, that is, the Canadian Development Corporation. In this respect, I am
sorry that our friend Mr. Donald Fleming,
the former dedicated member of the House of
Commons, does not find anything very good
about it. I think it is probably the most
significant piece of legislation in the current
program, in that it is a means of encouraging Canadians to invest in their own
country.
The bugaboo which bas been raised that
this legislation will be government interference with private enterprise, that government
will be doing something that private enterprise ought to be doing, calls to my attention
that Mr. Maurice Strong, the President of
Power Corporation, which is not an insubstantial organization, said he saw no danger in
this particular piece of legislation.
I happened to be in Vancouver at the time
that Premier Bennett announced the establishment of his savings certificate plan, at $5
each-that was either 1959 or 1960. The
next day the morning papers decried this as
a harebrained scheme which the Premier had
hatched. They are not singing that tune today,
because it was partly as a result of the encouragement which that scheme gave to
Canadians to invest in their own resources
that some spectacular developments in the
Province of British Columbia were undertaken. Therefore, I think the Canadian Development Corporation is a step in the right
direction, and is a means through which the
small people, as well as the big ones, can
share in developing Canadian resources.
The next point I wish to refer to is the
Company of Young Canadians. Again, remarks

SENATE DEBATES
have been made that this is a copy of something being done in another country. So what?
It is a good idea. Canada was the first country
to establish a youth corps-long before the
Americans did so. We had from 60 to 80
young men from the universities working in
Africa and other parts of the world. The
Americans took on the program in their usual
spectacular way, and it has become an
imaginative part of the American aid program. However, Canada has not been slow in
developing this program on a voluntary basis
with some assistance from the Department of
External Affairs.
But we do not need to go out of Canada
to find a challenge for young Canadians. As
I understand it, this program proposes to
enlist the energies, enthusiasm and idealism
of young Canadians, to go into some of theperhaps "depressed areas" is too strong a
term-areas where there are Indian settlements in the various parts of Canada, particularly in the northwestern part, and some
of the areas of rural poverty where there is
a tremendous job to be done. They can find
a useful place in the developing ARDA
program.
May I say in passing that the ARDA program, which was started under the previous
government, is an excellent program, and
also that we are fortunate in having as the
head of the ARDA program today the Honourable Maurice Sauvé. I think he is one of
the most qualified Canadians ta attack that
imaginative and constructive program.
There is a challenging place for young
Canadians to work in this particular program, and that is all to the good.
The Speech from the Throne also had an
announcement to the effect that encouragement will be given ta cultural development.
With all respect to my seatmate Senator
Pouliot, I think we can do something about
the development of culture. We have not
done too much. Certainly, the Canada Council
has made a tremendous contribution toward the training of Canadians in the arts
and humanities in the last 10 years. Therefore, the $10 million grant, which I understand
is a temporary grant for the next three or
four years, has been quite a new shot in the
arm to meet some of the tremendously important further training for Canadian artists and scholars. It will pay big dividends
in the future.
Honourable senators, I had the good fortune to attend the National Conference on
the Arts at Ste. Adele last January. It was a

May 18, 1965

very fine and successful conference. It sometimes happens when Canadians are talking
about the Royal Commission on Bilingualism
and Biculturalism that they overlook the
contribution of many ethnic groups when
they think only in terms of the two founding
races. But let me point out a significant fact.
I was sitting in the dining room at the
Chanteclerc one night, looking over that
group, and I remarked to my wife that if
you took Canada's immigrants out of the
groups, 70 per cent of the people participating in the conference would have to leave
the room. Something that we Canadians do
not think about often enough is the tremendous debt which we owe to the people who
have come to this country and made it the
land of their adoption. This is encouraging
too.
There is mention in the Speech of the establishment of a Science Council for Canada.
I think this is a logical development. We
established the Economie Council of Canada
and it has made its first report. It is rather
logical that we follow that with a Science
Council of Canada. I am making the suggestion now and will have something to say
later on about some kind of a national office for education.
I realize that there have been fears over
the years that this may mean an invasion by
the federal authority in provincial rights.
That need not be so. If ever Canada is ta
become a nation, united and strong, we
must have some co-ordinating body which
will focus the aims and needs and the drive
for education in terms of national unity,
national problems and a Canadian identity.
Honourable senators, I should like to
spend the remainder of my time in this debate on the implications of the technological
revolution for education, business and government. While marvellous things are happening today in education, science and
technology, the implications of what is happening are recognized by too few people. I
should like to mention only the highlights of
some of the development.
To my mind, it is important that this body
realize just how important these changes are
and the necessity to make plans now which
will have to be translated into legislation
and action ten years from now.
Honourable senators, you will remember
that on November 22, 1960 the Government
of Canada-or, rather, the Senate-set up
the Senate Manpower Committee. That
special committee of the Senate was charged

May l8, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

with examining the manpower situation in
Canada and analysing the quality of our
manpower, our labour force, and of making
recommendations. The report of the Man-'
power Committee is one of the documents of
which this chamber can be justly proud. Out
of the report of that committee has really
come the establishment of the Canadian
Economic Council, under the distinguished
leadership of Dr. John J. Deutsch.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It was
he who directed the research for the Senate
Manpower Committee.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: That is quite true.
Members of the Senate are aware of the fact
that it was Dr. Deutsch and his committee
who did the research for the manpower
survey. The Economic Council of Canada was
the logical extension of that particular report
and it is logical that Dr. Deutsch should be
set the task of heading the very important
Economic Council. He has the co-operation of
a lot of distinguished Canadian businessmen,
to study the economic situation in Canada.
The Council made a first-class report last
November and the report set the economic
goals for Canada for the next five years.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: It was after the Senate
report.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Yes, the Senate report
was the beginning. I like to give the Senate
credit for having initiated the steps taken
to establish the Economic Council. Among
the things which this committee did was to
analyse the labour force in Canada.
Honourable senators, I wish to give you a
brief picture of it-and I shall not bore you
too much with statistics.
One of the first things they examined was
the composition of the labour force. In 1961,
6,342,000 Canadians, men and women, were
in the civilian labour force. This was broken
down into categories: white-collar occupations, 38.6 per cent; manual workers, 34.9
per cent; agricultural and resource workers
13.1 per cent; service occupations, 10.8 per
cent; and non-stated, 2.6 per cent.
The most significant occupational trend in
the period was the rapid increase in the
white-collar and service workers, the relatively slow growth in the manual occupations,
and an absolute decline in agricultural and
resource occupations.
Honourable senators, I do not propose to
go into details, but there are one or two
observations which I should like to make
on the analysis of the labour force. I was

interested to get the information on the
changing relationship between the manual
groups and the white-collar groups. The
slowest growing group was what is known
as the managerial group. Those of you who
have been following the situation carefully
know that we have been experiencing one
of the greatest industrial booms this country
has ever known. Under those circumstances,
one would think that the managerial group
would be growing at a more rapid rate.
However, the facts are that the managerial
group in Canada has been the slowest growing section of the white-collar group.
If we are to achieve the economic goals
for Canada in the next few years, more attention will have to be paid to getting more
and better trained people in this managerial
and entrepreneurial group.
The Economic Council of Canada states
that we must provide 1,500,000 new jobs
between January 1, 1963, when they made
their tables up, and 1970 if we are to have
97 per cent of our work force at work. This
means that 4,120 new jobs must be provided
in every one of the 354 weeks between January, 1963 and December 31, 1969. Put another way, it means we must provide 214,285
new jobs every year just to absorb the young
Canadians coming into the labour market.
This is part of the challenge to be faced
today.
In the statistics-which I found rather
shocking and it may be that you will find
them shocking also-are those on the
manpower situation in the field of public
health. You are familiar with the tremendous
interest in Canada today in medicare problems, health problems of one kind or another.
Here is one instance where we need a real
mobilization of manpower. Unless we train
many more people, doctors, dentists and
nurses, it is doubtful if any of our medicare
programs will ever come to fruition.
In view of the country's increasing concern with more and better health programs,
and the long-range program required to provide additional numbers of doctors, dentists
and nurses, it is well to know the proportion
of those persons in the labour force. There
were only 5,500 dentists in Canada in 1961;
and the increase over 1951 was only 800. It
is no wonder that one has to line up to get
dental care in this country. Only 800 dentists
were a.dded to the dental corps in Canada
from 1951 to 1961.
In the field of medicine also conditions have
been getting rather difficult. In 1961 there

SENATE DEBATES

were 21,000 doctors in Canada; in 1964 the
number was 23,390. This is compared with
14,000 in 1951. In 1961 there were 61,500
graduate nurses and 23,000 nurses in training. However, because of the increased demand for doctors and nurses, it is estimated
that by 1970 we will need five new medical
schools and 10 new nursing schools.
In that connection, and in case some
honourable senators may become frightened
about the costs, here is something which will
make you shudder a little more. These figures
come from the most reputable sources. They
refer to the medical schools. These statistics
came from the doctors' convention in Toronto
in 1964. There the doctors recommended that
at least $470 million be spent by the federal
Government on medical schools and research
in the next 10 years, that $200 million be
spent in renovating existing schools, and $210
million be used to build new schools. I hope
that in this particular case the recommendations of the doctors will fall on fruitful soil,
for if we are to have the kind of medical service that people are talking about, the first
thing we need is more training facilities, more
people to teach in the medical, dental and
nursing schools and more people to go into
this great service to humanity.
I do not propose to go into this matter in
any greater detail. I am just taking the
highlights from an address I gave to 7,000
educators in Toronto in January. I mention
that number as evidence of the interest people are taking in what is happening in the
field of education today.
In 1960 the government of the day passed
the Technical Training and Vocational Assistance Act which has had rather spectacular
results. Despite those results we still have a
long way to go. For example, in 1960 when
the act was passed we had places in Canadian technical training schools for 108,000
young Canadians. As a result of the provisions of that act under which the federal
Government would underwrite 75 per cent
of the cost in some situations and 50 per
cent in others, $684 million was spent on
facilities, of which $410 million was federal
money. The result was that in three years
the number of places in technical and training
schools in Canada was increased from 108,000
to 197,000. We provided 30,000 new places
per year for three years. Many people felt
that this was quite an accomplishment, and
it was. But if we are to achieve the target
set by the Economic Council for the year
1970, which is only five years from now, we
shall need 500,000 places to train Canadians

May 18, 1965

in the technical aspects of our industrial
society. In other words, if we provided
roughly 30,000 places per year from April
1, 1961 to December 1, 1964, we shall have
to provide places in the order of 60,000 a
year from now until 1970 to train the necessary number of Canadians.
Another result of the passing of the Technical Training and Assistance Act was that
between 1961 and 1964 five new institutes of
technology, 53 new trade schools, 11 combined trade schools and institutes of technology, and 276 technical and vocational high
schools were established in addition to the
number already existing. As I say, we did
pretty well between 1961 and 1964, but we
have to greatly exceed the efforts of those
years if we are to achieve the goals set by the
Economic Council, to keep our unemployment figures down to 3 per cent of the labour
force, provide 1,500,000 jobs, and develop
the economy in this country in the manner
suggested as necessary by the Economic
Council.
I would like to give you some idea of the
number of people in Canada who are being
displaced by the electronic revolution and
who must be absorbed into the labour force.
I have collected some figures. If we take the
Canadian population as being approximately
one-tenth of that of the United States, and
the figures of the obsolescence and disappearance of jobs in our country as about
one-tenth of theirs, we come up with some
rather alarming results. To obtain some of
these figures I wrote to labour leaders in
the United Kingdom, to the Secretary of
Labour in the United States, and to Walter
Reuther, the distinguished American labour
leader and President of the United Automobile Workers Union. He was supposed to
have made the statement some months ago
that 36,000 jobs a week were disappearing
in the United States. I asked if that were
true and I received a letter in reply from
his director of Special Projects and Economic
Analysis, from which I read the following
paragraph:
. . . we in the U.S. need to create the
equivalent of 80,000 jobs a week in order
merely to prevent unemployment from
increasing. The 80,000 figure is a composite, in round terns, of the effects
of technological change and growth of
the labour force. We calculate that the
potential-although not currently realized
-rate
of productivity advance in our
economy is approximately 4 per cent
annually. That would translate, on the

May 18, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

basis of roughly 70 million employed persons, into the disappearance of 2,800,000
jobs a year or 54,000 a week.
Now, these figures can be misleading because the disappearance of jobs is not an
absolute disappearance. This is where we
get into the realm of controversy and where
the experts do not always agree. Reuther said
there is a disappearance of about 6 per cent
per year in the American labour force. Peter
Drucker, of New York University, an outstanding authority on management, says the
net disappearance is between zero and 2
per cent. The one thing there is substantial
agreement about is that there is a substantial loss of jobs each year, and we must take
this into consideration as we go along.
From time to time we hear a lot of talk
about the electronic age and what is happening as a result. I gathered some information on the number of electronic computers
and data processing machines we have in
Canada, because that is one of the main
reasons for the displacement of labour. There
are, of course, others as well. On January 1,
620 large
1965
we had in Canada
electronic computers. In the United States
they had something less than 24,000, and the
number is increasing each year. Here again
it is difficult to get figures that are accurate
and which can be verified, but the estimate
is that the displacement of labour by electronic computers varies according to industries and systems from 25 per cent to 75 per
cent for some offices. Again I would quote
from the report of the Manpower Committee:
In general, an outstanding requirement
for, and consequence of, technological
change is to raise educational and skill
requirements. In the main, increasing use
of more complex and costly machinery,
operating with finer tolerances at greater
speeds, together with other manifestations
of technological change require a human
response at a different and higher level
than was often needed in the past. Alertness and a greater measure of responsibility are called for, as well as a heightened ability to communicate. Advances
in materials handling eliminate, of course,
many tasks for which little was required
in the way of basic education or training.
In contrast, these qualifications are in
growing demand with higher standards
of maintenance required for intricate
equipment and for planning, control and
technical functions. Generally, new and
expanding occupations and the very

nearly indispensable ability to adapt to
change itself require a higher platform
for basic education than is necessary
for routine manipulative and clerical
tasks.
If we may summarize the characteristics
required for the new manpower coming on
to the labour market today, they would be
as follows:
1. They must possess a higher standard of
basic education.
2. They must have a broad base in English,
mathematics and the sciences.
3. They must possess adaptability and resourcefulness far beyond the average of previous generations.
4. They must accept mobility, between jobs.
between industries and between geographic
areas as a normal concomittant to employment.
5. They must be psychologically adjusted to
the idea that they may require training for
three, four or more types of employment in
their lifetime.
6. A much higher percentage than ever
before will have to possess advanced technical
training and higher university degrees.
I could go on at greater length in that field,
but I have said enough to underline how
important it is that we must not only give
a broader base to education, but we must
change the accepted psychology with respect
to jobs.
The young man who was trained 15 years
ago to go into the auto workers at Windsor
or Oshawa, who joined the union and made
provision for what he thought was security,
will not be able to do that in the future;
his job may disappear completely. This kind
of situation has implications for the unions,
for management, for government, for the
citizen. We could spend the whole evening
on that particular aspect, but I do not propose that we do.
One of the things that is happening today
that is exciting and yet is demanding, and
one of the results of this electronic age in
which we are living, is the tremendous amount
of new information that is coming out ail the
time. It may be defiating to all of us to accept
the fact that the total volume knowledge
in the world is doubling every 15 years. Think
of the implications of that. In other words,
in 15 years from now there will be twice as
much information available as there is today
-and it may be in less than that time. So,
here is where the electronic age comes to our

SENATE DEBATES

rescue again, because one of the most exciting aspects of it is what it is already doing
in the area of information retrieval.
I intended to bring to you tonight a slide
the ordinary size, two inches by two inches,
one that you could not put in your home
projector, but there are projectors that can
handle it. On it is reproduced the entire
family Bible, no matter what its size, in
other words, both the Old and New Testaments are reduced, through microphotography
40,000 times on to a two-inch by two-inch
slide.
Last fall some of you were at the Strategic
Air Command base at Omaha, Nebraska, and
saw proof of what is happening in this field.
If you wanted to know something about the
Dnieper Dam in the Ukraine, the chap taking
you through pushed a button and you got
a slide one-half inch wide and three inches
long on which was the equivalent of 450 pages
of manuscript. He put it into another machine
and that information came out translated at
a rate of 1,200 words per minute. The same
would be true of any other information you
wanted.
Again, one of the challenges of the electronic age is that the new equipment we have
is making it possible for us to handle this
new information much more effectively than
we were able to do years ago. I went into
the Parliamentary Library one day not long
ago and asked Mr. Spicer-who, by the way,
is doing an excellent job, as I am sure you
all knowSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I said that I wanted a
dictionary of electronic terms, that there are
so many new words coming out in connection
with the electronic industry that a man is
illiterate unless he knows something about it.
Mr. Spicer replied, "We do not have such a
dictionary." As an example of the quality
of service that is provided in the Library,
in about three days they obtained a dictionary of new electronic terms. They obtained part of the volume in Washington and
some in various other places, but this was
compiled, again as a result of the wizardry
of electronics, in a matter of hours. So our
libraries particularly will be much more
meaningful and much more valuable to us
as a result of the installation of electronic
information retrieval; but we are going to
have to pay something to support the increased costs.
I am not going into detail in connection
with the technological revolution. The in-

May 18, 1965

dustrial revolution of 130 years ago or more
was the first evidence of industrial change. It
was followed about 30 years ago by what has
become known as "Detroit automation"-in
other words, the assembly line technique
under which materials are positioned to fine
tolerances using little manpower, and the
labour force is cut down accordingly.
The third stage of the technological revolution is the "closed loop control" or "feed
back" of the current technological equipment.
I just want to refer to that briefly because,
again, what is happening is exciting.
The next step beyond the automatic assembly line technique was the introduction
of the "closed loop control" or "feed back".
This is really a system of communication and
controls which may vary in many respects
but depends on electric, electronic, pneumatic,
or electro-magnetic instrumentation of a
very high order. The common household
thermostat is one of the simplest of these
devices. They all have their greatest use at
present in what are called the continuous
flow industries such as petroleum, plastics
and certain food-processing enterprises.
The use of these electronic devices in computers is only in its infancy, but already
it is revolutionizing bookkeeping and recordkeeping procedures. Its role in almost instantaneous information retrieval, whereby
inventory positions can be determined almost
instantly, not only for one factory but for a
whole widely dispersed chain of factories,
is a revolution in itself. We see its use every
time we go into an airline office to make a
reservation for a trip on a plane.
I am deleting a few of the things that are
happening. We have before us the evidence
that as a result of advanced mechanization
and the use of new products in the last 25
years labour output is increased from 15 to
50 per cent, while decreasing labour consumption by 10 to 30 per cent. From the
present evidence the indications are that
automation-if we may use that term loosely
to cover the whole technological revolutionwill greatly accelerate the process of increasing productivity with fewer and fewer people.
If this trend becomes universal throughout
our entire industrial society, what happens
to hours of work? Will they become reduced
in the next 50 years as much as they have
in the last 30? Thirty and 40 years ago
many people were working 60 to 72 hours a
week. They were gradually reduced to 50, to
48, to 40, to 35, and some to 30 hours. I think
it is only realistic to expect that in the next

May 18, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

15 to 20 years the rate of reduction of hours
of work will be even faster than that which
has taken place in the last 30 years.
If such a change comes about, what will
people do with their leisure time? What would
happen in our society if instead of 500,000
people having no work to do, we had 5 million in that position? One has only to examine
the case histories of some of the thousands of
people who have had the frustration of unemployment, of feeling unneeded and unwanted,
to get some idea of the kind of chaos which
would ensue if such a situation were to arise.
However, I do not think the current
generation need worry itself too much about
that, because if we satisfy the needs and
wants of our men and women in Canada
and the United States, we will have no
trouble absorbing them in our labour force
for some time to come. If we were to be
successful in satisfying the myriad wants of
our own people, there would still be the unsatisfied wants of hundreds of millions of
people in the underdeveloped countries. But
if we are to cope with the huge transfers of
labour which automation is now making and
will continue to make in the future, if we
are to train the necessary scientists and
technicians to make the automated industries
work, if we are to revise our Government's
legislation with respect to hours of work,
transfer of labour, unemployment or compensating benefits, and if we are going to
provide the teachers and the schools to meet
the needs of a new industrial age, then the
time to make the plans is now, not ten years
hence.
Karl Scott, the President of the Ford
Motor Company of Canada, speaking to a
group of engineering students at Waterloo
University last October, said that the education they were receiving today would be
mostly obsolete within ten years, and the
things they would need to know in ten years
had not yet been discovered. This is a dramatic expression of the rate of technological
change and, unfortunately, not enough of
our people are aware of it. This is the challenge that the technological revolution poses
to governments, businessmen, educators and
trade unions. These are the factors I should
like to deal with very briefly in the next
section of my speech.
Educators are the people in society
charged with the responsibility of transmitting the accumulated and distilled wisdom of preceding ages to the young of each
new generation. They have always had one
of society's greatest responsibilities. Society

has not always acted as though it sufficiently
appreciated the importance of that responsibility, if one is to judge from the financial
rewards of bygone days. But, we are living
now in happier times, when the educator is
beginning to come into his own.
Education is the key to survival in the
age of automation, and we neglect it at our
peril. Previously it has been accepted that
formal education was terminal with the
passing of the early twenties, but one of the
essential characteristics of the automated
society is that education must be a continuous process throughout the working life of
the individual. In the event that a man's
working life terminates at 45, 50 or 55 in
years to come, the educator will then have
the responsibility of training the citizen to
use his leisure time.
I need not repeat the characteristics I emphasized earlier as being necessary for the
students coming out of our schools, but I
should like to add one or two things. We
must double and redouble the number of
those who have the aptitudes for technical
and scientific employment.
Finally, educators and educational administrators must establish a much closer liaison
with industry so that there is a constant
and clear understanding between industry and
education as to what their common goals are.
In short, the school-man must get out of the
classroom and spend some time in the factories, so that he knows from first-hand experience what his technical students must
know and do. Conversely, the industrialist
should go into the school room to explain
at first hand what the opportunities and
responsibilities will be. The kind of co-operative arrangement that exists between the
University of Waterloo and the industrial
community should be expanded on a national
basis.
Educators should take the initiative in
establishing joint committees with business
and industry so that there will be the closest
possible understanding of current needs and
future plans and changes. The educators of
today must work out ten years ahead the
plans for tomorrow.
What about the implications in business?
The implications of technological change for
the businessman and industrialist are beginning to extend in an almost mandatory way,
and far beyond the primary responsibility
of making the business or industry a successful economic enterprise.
To a greater extent than ever before the
decision-making of the businessman must be

SENATE DEBATES
conditioned by the social consequences of
his decisions as they affect displacement of
labour through change, or outright unemployment through manpower becoming obsolete
for a particular operation. In the immediate
future the businessman will be more concerned with displacement of labour and the
consequent necessity of its transfer to other
and different jobs, and also the retraining of
employees so that they may upgrade their
skills, or learn new skills in a different line
of work.
Where technological change is likely to
result in a large number of layoffs or, in
some cases, in a complete shutdown of a
plant, management has the responsibility in
giving as much advance notice as possible in
order that the employees, with the co-operation of management and the unions, can find
other jobs, transfer to similar work in another
plant, or be retrained for different work in
another plant or community.
There are various ways of avoiding layoffs,
and some or all of them are often employed.
They may be summarized as follows:
1. Attrition-the non-replacement of employees who leave for any reason.
2. Early retirement schemes.
3. Retraining.
4. Transfer from one plant to another.
5. Relocation allowances.
6. Work-spreading devices.
In connection with the latter, the United
States Department of Labour made a study
in May 1963 of what is happening to people
who are working overtime, and in a particular survey it was discovered that during
one week 3,318,000 people each worked an
average of 9.2 hours of overtime. If this
overtime had been eliminated to create fulltime jobs, 1,250,000 new employees could have
been hired. This sounds impressive as a
statistic, but in practical terms it does not
mean very much because, in the first place,
the necessary people were not in the right
place, and they would not move. There are
other complications such as the available
people not having the right skills, and so on.
It is not simple to meet such a situation.
Schemes are being devised to case the
burden of unemployment such as severance
pay, supplemental insurance benefits, the
vesting of pension rights, and so on. In passing
I might mention a very interesting scheme
applied by an airline. In 1961 an agreement
was reached between the Airline Navigators'
Association and Trans-World Airlines, which
provided that navigators losing their positions would receive from $10,000 to $25,000,

May 18, 1965

depending upon their length of service, plus
$400 a month for three years to enable them
to get re-established. This is just one of
hundreds of schemes that are being tried out
today.
What are the implications for government
in all this? For those elements in our society
who are constantly deploring the increasing
role of government in the business of the
country, there is cold comfort in the age of
technological change. The implications stemming from the increasing application of advanced mechanization and automation to industry are so important to national policy
and public welfare that the Government,
representing all of the people, is the only
agency large enough, and with the necessary
power and authority, to make the sweeping
changes necessary to sustain the economy at
a high level of growth and employment.
If the national goals of nearly full employment, high productivity, stable prices, sustained growth, and expanding public services are to be maintained, the implications
for governments at all levels are clear and
inescapable. The Economic Council has stated
some of them with precision. They are:
1. Increased investment in human resources to improve knowledge and skills. I
think the Canadian Development Corporation
is a step in that direction.
2. Improved mobility of resources so that
they can move easily and smoothly towards
their most efficient employment.
3. Great specialization and organization of
production.
4. Swifter and more effective technological
advances.
5. Enlarged investment in fixed capital.
6. More initiative and enterprise in exploring new and better ways of using economic
resources more productively, under the spur
of competition and the lure of higher economic
returns.
In concluding these remarks I want to use
a phrase that President Johnson coined to
great effect, namely, "The Great Society",
which he said was the national goal of the
American people. We all hope that this becomes a reality rather than a slogan, because
in the vision of the Great Society we have
a program of national goals that is of universal appeal to all mankind. The concept is one
that can be likened to the leading edge of
the wings of a jet liner, because it is forever
reaching, thrusting forward and upward. It
does not mean a Great Society just for the

SENATE DEBATES

May 18, 1965

United States or Canada; it means a Great
Society for the world.
Part of the concept is the war on poverty,
ignorance, unemployment, under-productivity and unfulfilled potential. Taken in that
imaginative and daring context, it means that
we shall marshal our wealth of brain power,
skills and natural resources, and combine and
direct them towards the goal of satisfying
the unmet needs and wants in our society.
If we do that in Canada we shall have no
unemployment of resources or people, because the improved standard of living which
modern technology can make will occupy all
our energies and resources for a long time to
come. In the unlikely event that we as a
nation succeed in filling the presently unmet
needs of our own country, we could then
join with others in filling the unmet needs
of the world's underdeveloped countries.
That is the meaning and the challenge of
the Great Society but we shall never achieve
it without establishing consensus. People must
understand what we are trying to do. They
must see the goals of the Great Society in
terms of intimate and personal goals. For
them to see and understand, we must have
effective communication to every level and
strata of society. Through effective communication we will obtain the consensus which
gives the mandate to go forward to success.
Without consensus-the expression of the
will of the majority in a democratic society
for the goals of the Great Society-we will
have the disintegration and deterioration,
unemployment, under-consumption and stagnation. The choice is ours to make, but we
can only make it on the basis of education
and understanding, which today are the
twin keys to the Great Society.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Rattenbury, debate
adjourned.
PRIVATE

BILL

PRINCIPAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
OF CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. Donald Cameron moved the second
reading of Bill S-9 to incorporate Principal
Life Insurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this is an
unfortunate combination of circumstances tonight, that I should have to make two
speeches, but I promise not to speak long on
this particular bill.
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to
bring this bill before the Senate, because as
a Canadian this suggests to me one more

evidence of the buoyant and burgeoning
economy of Western Canada.
I read in the Financial Post of last Saturday, May 15, a story which stated that there
are too many life insurance companies coming
into being, and that the authorities are
worried about the rash of newcomers and are
eagle-eyeing their finances. The story went
on to say that some seven applications for
charters have been made in the last year
for life insurance and trust companies in
Alberta alone. This again is further evidence
of the fact that this is the banana belt of
Canada, and the place where, in combination
with our neighbours in British Columbia,
things are really happening.
However, it is evidence of something more
than that. If you look at the history of the
development of the United States, you will
find that the western States did not begin
to expand development until their own financial institutions were established west of the
Mississippi. The establishment of the Bank
of America in San Francisco in 1861 was the
beginning-the people providing their own
financial resources, developing their own institutions and their own industrial resources.
This is what is happening in Alberta and
British Columbia today, and this is the reason for the spate of applications for life insurance companies, and the formation of other
companies, and so on.
In spite of the large number of insurance
companies, tremendous organizations, built on
a sound basis, such as Sun Life and Metropolitan Life, which have served Canada well, 25
per cent of Canadians carry no insurance,
and a further large percentage have very
little. Therefore, even if many more insurance companies come into the field there
will be lots of business for all of them. To me,
this formulation of new companies is evidence that the population is expanding its
needs and that the economy is booming.
Governments are tightening their regulations with respect to capitalization and surplus, and are curbing fly-by-night operations
of people who are concerned with selling
stock, rather than selling insurance. For example, the federal Government requirements
for the establishment of an insurance company
today is $500,000 capital and $500,000 surplus.
The Alberta requirement is $500,000 for both,
and by the end of this year that requirement
for capital and surplus will likely be increased to $750,000. In addition, directors
must invest a minimum of $2,500 to qualify

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, that is by way of
introduction of Bill S-9, which is to incorporate the Principal Life Insurance Company of
Canada.
The first-mentioned incorporator of this
company is Donald Mercer Cormie, Q.C., of
Edmonton-and I shall have something to say
about him later. May I say that the incorporators are mainly a group of young Canadians
who have been almost phenomenally successful in business enterprise in the last few
years.
Ralph Perrin Forster, M.C., the secretary
of the company, is a man of very wide experience and training in the business world.
He was born in Medicine Hat and graduated
from the University of Alberta. He then
went to London, England, and graduated
with the degree of Bachelor of Commerce.
Later he was associated with the Canadian
Embassy in Washington, and also with the
World Bank there. His home is now in Edmonton, where he has lived for the past
many years. Dennis Robert Stewart, a wellknown Edmonton businessman, is VicePresident. Jack William Kennedy, solicitor,
is an able Canadian executive. Kenneth
Nelson Marlin, executive, and Lynn Allen
Patrick, a solicitor, are both of the City of
Edmonton.
These are the shareholders of the company which seeks to be incorporated under
the name of Principal Life Insurance Company of Canada. I trust they will receive
your endorsation.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Can the honourable gentleman give the reason for the word "Principal" in the name of the company?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I am sorry, I did not
inquire about that. You will have to ask that
question when the bill comes before a committee.
Clause 3 of the bill provides that:
The capital stock of the Company
shall be one million dollars divided into
shares of one hundred dollars each,
which capital stock may be increased to
four million dollars divided into shares
of one hundred dollars each.
Clause 4 provides that:
The amount to be subscribed before
the general meeting for the election of
directors is called shall be five hundred
thousand dollars.
Contrary to the procedure of most companies, this one is not going to the public to

May 18, 1965

raise funds. It is an enterprise being established by what is known as the Collective
Group, which represents a group of business
firms established in Edmonton.
It is an exciting story. As a matter of
fact, athletes like Senator Sullivan and a
few others in this chamber will appreciate
this, because the idea was conceived while
attending a football game in Edmonton one
October night in 1954. Donald Cormie, Ralph
Forster, and Dennis Stewart went to the
game, to support the Eskimos, of course. As
successful young businessmen they were
concerned with encouraging Canadians to
save and invest money in their own country.
Mark you, this was in 1954, and this is the
story of what has happened.
The Collective Group, which consists of
twelve successful western Canadian Companies, have set aside one million dollars
from their funds to finance the Principal
Life Insurance Company, so they are not
selling stock.
This particular group has the following
advantages:
(1) In the past 11 years it has already sold
$20 million worth of creditor's risk insurance.
(2) They have done this through another
company, known as the Alberta Life Insurance Company.
(3) The group has already had 10 years of
experience in organizing a sales force to
sell savings certificates.
(4) The company will have low overhead,
because existing management, offices and
equipment will be used. The equipment will
include an IBM 1440 computer, the first
one in Western Canada, which was put into
operation at the Group's Edmonton headquarters.
(5) The Group has been investing under
the British and Canadian Insurance Companies Act since 1959.
(6) It has two American subsidiaries, and
these have been approved by the SEC,
which is a pretty tough screening.
Some idea of the extent of the financial
operations of the Collective Group in
Alberta can be gained from the following
summaries of its achievements to 1964. It
is a pretty exciting adventure.
In the spring of 1954, a little over
eleven years ago, the three founders of
the Collective Group organized the
Group's initial member, First Investors
Corporation Ltd. Two years later, by
the end of 1956, nearly 4,700 Albertans

May 18, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

were saving with First Investors, and

the initial assets of less than $100,000

had climbed to better than $888,000.
The year 1956 saw the acquisition of Imperial Real Estate Limited, a leading Edmonton realty organization, in an effort to give
the Collective Group a better integrated
investment arm.
The year 1957, though a poor year for the
Canadian economy as a whole, was a remarkably good one for the Collective Group. The
number of certificate holders with First Investors Corporation nearly tripled, to 11,825,
while the maturity value of outstanding
certificates passed the 48 million mark. Three
more companies incorporated in the Group.
These were: Alberta Mortgage Exchange Ltd.,
Mercer & Williams Agency Ltd. (insurance),
and Western Industrial Planning Associates
Ltd. Collective Securities, the holding company for the Group, now had a fairly complete service Group to look after its investment moneys.
Steady growth continued, and by 1960 the
Group's assets had passed $7 million and the
geographical expansion had taken place into
the United States. At the year end 1960 the
maturity value had hit tb.e figure of $160
million.
The final consolidation of the Collective
Group into the main elements of its present
organization came about in 1963. The first
step was the acquisition of the Associated Investors of Canada Ltd., another savings
certificate company, repurchased from American ownership, and a mutual fund was
brought into being in the same year. The year
was devoted to putting muscles on the bones
of the financial complex. The Group had
really come into its own now with $52 million in assets.
Honourable senators, I note that there are
some executives of insurance companies in
the Senate tonight, so I would like to quote
from a chart which gives some idea of the
rate of growth of this particular organization. This represents savings generated in
the Province of Alberta by the Collective
Group in 1964. They amount to $7,379,000.
That is a pretty tidy amount. I want to show
how this compares with other well-established and reputable companies, based on
comparative figures.
The Sun Life was next with $5,958,400; the
Prudential was next with $3,296,700; the
Manufacturers Life followed with $3,077,200;
the Great-West Life, with $2,487,000; and
the Confederation Life had 1,336,200.

In competition
with well-established,
soundly-based savings organizations, this company, the Collective Group, has done exceedingly well.
The investment contracts generated by this
company increased from 4,700 in 1956 to
63,000 at the end of December last. The assets
on December 31, 1964 were $37 million; the
savings certificate holders at December 31
last were 59,132. and the maturity value of
savings in force was $239 million. The 1964
payments to certificate holders were 4,512,000.
This organization has 38 offices in Canada
and two in the United States. It employs
400 people.
In concluding this representation on behalf
of the Principal Life Insurance Company, I
just want to say that this is one of two
of the most spectacular financial developments in western Canada. The other is the
Laurentide Finance Corporation, based in
Vancouver. This one is equally spectacular in
its own way. It is one of the most important
elements in the development of the western
financial institutions.
Honourable senators, I heartily commend
this company to your favourable consideration. It is my intention, if it receives
second reading this evening, to ask that it
be referred ta the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Cameron, bill referred to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
DIVORCE
REPORT OF COMMTTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the first report of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, presented on May 13.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, this is the committee's first report and it
is a routine matter. It is a resolution which I
have moved on numerous occasions at the
opening of previous sessions of Parliament.
The proposal is that we grant leave to the
committee to sit during adjournments of the
Senate and also during sittings of the Senate; that it be granted authority to appoint
as many subcommittees as it deems necessary
for the purpose of considering such divorce
matters as may be referred to it by the conmittee; and set the quorum thereof, the
subcommittee in each case to report its findings to the committee.

SENATE DEBATES

As I say, this is a routine matter but nevertheless is important in itself. I move the
adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Could the honourable senator possibly answer this question? Was all
the business of the Divorce Committee cleaned
up for the previous sessions? Are we now
dealing with new petitions or were they held
over from the previous session?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They are not holdovers
from the previous session. I cannot say that
every old case has been dealt with. Some
may have been held back for certain reasons.
However, the backlog has been cleaned up
and every case which was ready to be heard
has been proceeded with.
At the present time we are working on
new cases which come before us. Today, if
the case is in order, one can pretty well count
on a divorce being granted by the committee
in about three months' time from the initial
filing of the petition. There is no delay whatsoever. As the cases are ready to be heard,
they are heard, and great progress is being
made in the handling of the cases. I should
like to say something more along that line
in a moment.
Motion agreed to.
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
reports of the Standing Committee on Divorce
Nos. 2 to 49, inclusive, which were presented
on May 13.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw): Honourable senators, is it your
pleasure to adopt these reports?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I comment on the pile of reports lying
on the Clerk's table. They are Nos. 2 to 49,
very nearly 50 reports, which have all been
heard by the Commissioner. Each one is a
separate case. Each case has been heard
and reported to the Standing Committee on
Divorce, and these reports have been read
and considered by the committee. The resolution has been passed in each case, forwarding it to this chamber, and I am now moving
the adoption of all these reports.
Honourable senators, there is a wealth
of labour, of consideration and of decision
in that great pile of reports.
I would like to add that we are most
fortunate in this chamber in having a Commissioner of the industry, the intelligence,
the dignity and the legal knowledge of the
gentlemen who is hearing the evidence in

May 18, 1965

support of these reports. I do not sit and
listen to the proceedings, because that would
embarrass the Commissioner, but I do get
information with respect to him continuously.
I have heard no criticisms, but I have heard
many, many compliments paid to him, for the
judical calm, the dignity and the intelligence
with which he is handling our work.
Honourable senators, I have great pleasure
in moving the adoption of these reports.
Motion agreed to and reports adopted, on
division.

PRIVATE BILL
THE ALGOMA CENTRAL AND HUDSON BAY
RAILWAY COMPANY-REPORT OF
COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
'the report of the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications on Bill S-4,
respecting The Algoma Central and Hudson
Bay Railway Company, which was presented
on Thursday, May 13.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved adoption of
the report.
He said: Honourable senators, I should
perhaps give a brief explanation to the Senate about the two amendments we made to
Bill S-4, an act respecting The Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company,
when the bill was considered by the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The first amendment is quite a minor one
and refers to clause 5 of the bill relating to
the power of the company to issue bonds and
debentures and to mortgage or hypothecate
all or any part of its property as security for
such bonds and debentures. After the description of "real and personal property, undertaking and rights" we inserted the words
"present or future". This was done to ensure
that the company could, if it wished,
hypothecate future property as part of its
security for such bonds or debentures.
This is quite a usual clause in by-laws permitting companies to issue bonds, and it was
welcomed very warmly by the sponsors of
the bill. The committee considered that this
amendment should be made in this bill,
because we have another bill before us, Bill
S-5 respecting Great Northern Railway Company and Great Northern Pacific & Burlington Lines, Inc., and the clause in that bill in
which they ask for borrowing powers contains the words "present or future". The

SENATE DEBATES

which established Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation. As honourable senators
may know, this is a crown corporation which
reports to Parliament through the Minister
of Citizenship and Immigration. It was established in December 1945, and commenced
operations January 1, 1946. To it confided
the responsibility for administering the National Housing Act.
At present the corporation has as its chief
executive officers a president and a vicepresident who, in addition to their regular
duties, are members of the board of directors.
It is now proposed to authorize the appointing
of two additional vice-presidents. The appointments would be made by the board of
directors, but it is important to note that the
corporation would continue to be represented
on the board by the president and one vicepresident to be designated by the Governor
General in Council. In other words, while this
bill enlarges the senior executive establishment, it makes no change in the size and
composition of the board of directors of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
I believe all honourable senators can readily
appreciate the factors which have prompted
the corporation and the Government to establish two new vice-presidents. The corporation
has experienced, in the 19 years of its existence, a truly phenomenal growth in its operations. For example, the corporation lending
operations have grown almost without interruption over the past 19 years, and last year
alone the corporation approved loans for the
construction of some 58,000 units. In addition,
the corporation has responsibilities in respect
of financial assistance for a large program of
university housing and sewage treatment
programs. Other activities include assistance
for urban development and public housing.
Moreover, even further expansion in the
activities of the corporation will be realized
should Parliament approve the changes to the
National Housing Act that the Government
has proposed and are now before the Senate
for consideration.

He said: Honourable senators, the bill have no objection to this bill. However, I
before us seeks an amendment to the statute would like to ask the sponsor of the bill if

committee felt it would be advisable to have
the same wording embodied in each bill.
The second amendment in the bill relating
to The Algoma Central and Hudson Bay
Railway Company was made to clause 8, and
it resulted from a comment which fell from
Senator Grosart on second reading. Clause 8
originally read:
It is hereby declared and enacted that
the Company has and always has had as
ancillary and incidental to the purposes
and objects set forth in the Special Act
creating the Company the powers set
forth in subsection (1) of section 14 of
the Companies Act.
As honourable senators will recall, Senator Grosart questioned that language because
it could mean we were legislating retroactively by saying that the company had always
had certain powers.
We questioned the promoters of the bill on
that and pointed out that the Senate does not
normally like to enact retroactive legislation.
We asked if there was any special reason for
wording it in this way, whether they had
been troubled in the past as a result of doing
something in their corporate capacity which
they had no right to do and for which they
had been attacked in the courts. They said
no, that that had not been the case, and they
readily agreed to the change which we propose in clause 8. Consequently we took out
the words "It is hereby declared and enacted
that the Company has and always has had"
and inserted the words "The Company has"
the right to do such and such. As I say, the
promoters of the bill had no objection whatever to the second amendment, suggested to
us by the very justified comment made by
Senator Grosart.
Report adopted.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved that the
bill be placed on the Orders of the Day for
third reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Baird: I understand this to be the
case.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Under this bill there are
to be two more vice-presidents?
Hon. Mr. Baird: There will be two new
ones.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: What will the extra cost
be?
Hon. Mr. Baird: I am not too sure of that,
but I do not think there will be any extra cost.
The staff will not be enlarged; it will just be
that two members of the staff will be made
vice-presidents.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I was requested to move the adjournment of
the debate because certain persons interested
in this bill were not able to be in Ottawa
this week. I have discussed this matter with
the Leader of the Government, who seems
anxious that at least second reading be given
to the bill tonight. I have no objection, if it is
understood that the bill will be referred
to committee and will not be dealt with in
committee before Wednesday of next week.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I think that is satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I just do not understand
the necessity for two vice-presidents. I take
that to mean that when the president is not
at a meeting, one of the vice-presidents is
to be the chairman. I was wondering why
that is necessary when there are eight directors doing this work.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I understand that the
volume of business has increased to such an
extent in the past 10 years that they need
these additional executives.

Hon. Mr. Baird: Yes, I understand that is
what they intend to do.
Motion agreed to and bill read second

Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
wish to join with Senator Vaillancourt in
extending my congratulations to the Leader
of the Government in this house on his
receiving a degree from St. Thomas University.
In this connection may I say that St.
Thomas University is now on the campus of
the University of New Brunswick. It is in
fact one of the colleges of that university.
All of us in New Brunswick, with the pos-

sible exception of the people of the Town of
Chatham, where St. Thomas was situated, are

happy that it joined with the University of
New Brunswick and others to form one
campus.

May 19,1965

DEBATES

As Senator Vaillancourt bas said, it is a
great honour for our university to add Senator Connoily's narne to a long list of distinguished men whose contributions to society
have been so recognized. We ail know of
Senator Connolly's ability in law, politics
and debate, and the conferring of this degree
upon him is a recognition by our province of
that ability.
Our university, as ail honourable senators
know, associates itself with the names of such
men as the late President Kennedy whose
degree from the University of New Brunswick
was the only Canadian degree he received.
Our campus is also associated with such
names as Lord Beaverbrook, Bonar Law, Lord
Bennett and Lloyd George, whose papers are
deposited there.
1 could name many more who have
honoured the University of New
Brunswick.«
I arn very pleased, as indeed are ail of us in
New Brunswick, that Senator Connolly's name
has been added to that distinguîshed list.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
I rise only for the purpose of closing the
debate.
I thank Senator Vaillancourt and Senator
Brooks for their very kind words. It is really
more than either of them should have said,
and more perhaps than ail honourable senators should be exposed to.
To both honourable senators, 1 say it is a
great honour personal-ly to have been asked
to accept this degree. Perhaps also some distinction is reflected on the Senate when our
members are honoured in this way by our
truly great educational institutions.
I do not know whether it would be any
different if one were given the freedom of
the beautiful City of Fredericton-it is a
beautiful city just now in the springtime-or
if one were adopted by New Brunswick.
Certainly, the warmth of the reception which
the other visitors and I received on that occasion is something we shall always cherish.
From now on, I think I can lay dlaim to being
at least in part a citizen of New Brunswick.

what is being said. I believe that the operators should give more power to the system
when honourable senators are speaking.
I was told that the volume is not increased

The Senate resumed frorn yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor

Hon. Nelson Rattenbury: Honourable senators, before comrnencing my remarks on the
Throne Speech debate, I would like to join
my colleagues who have already spoken in

seconder my heartiest congratulations on the

SENATE DEBATES
masterly manner in which they carried out
their respective assignments.
The name of the mover has been known to
me for years. He is a legendary figure in
Metropolitan Montreal, and now that I have
had the opportunity of listening to his oratory
I can well understand some of the reasons
why.
I am sorry the seconder is not here this
afternoon. However, I am glad to have had
the opportunity to tell him privately how
happy I was that his maiden speech in this
chamber went off so well. His material was
thought provoking and typical of his outstanding and well-known abilities in the legal
and financial fields. I have known Senator
Aird for a number of years and I am sure the
deliberations of this chamber will be enriched by his being a member.
Honourable senators, in taking part in this
debate, I must say at once that to any Canadian the Speech from the Throne should be
most heartening. The Government has come
to grips with some of the most urgent problems of our times. It has recognized the nature of social and economic problems which
have so long been with us, and it has proposed enlightened measures to deal with
them.
It is of special interest to those of us who
represent the Atlantic area; not that the
proposed legislation is directed primarily to
us, but because the national plan offers concrete measures which relate directly to fundamental requirements of oui regional economy.
In particular, I want to mention the promise
of planned regional development measures,
plans for the re-employment and training of
workers, the opportunity for further vital
power developments, the co-operation with
existing provincial development plans, and
the assistance which must accrue to communications. All these are of greatest importance and, with redevelopment of rural
areas and general rural economic development, are among those things which can
specifically allow us to move ahead.
A high rate of economic growth for all
Canada does, of course, give some help to
the Atlantic area but in the past we have
been far behind the national growth rate.
Now, for the first time, we may look forward
to a kind of participation which utilizes what
we have in thebest way, which can, if
properly done, overcome many of the almost
immovable roadblocks we have faced in the
past.

May 19, 1965

You have heard, in this place and in the
other place, on many occasions the social
and economic history of the Atlantic area.
I shall not attempt to go over such ground
again. Indeed, I think we have in the past
been over-concerned with history and historic
excuses and have given too little attention
to current reality.
It is appropriate perhaps only to recali
some actual factors which we now know
have prevented the building of a lasting
framework for efficient and self-sustaining
economic growth. This essential framework
can now be built in the Atlantic provinces
if we understand the foundation requirements
and provide them. The provinces themselves
have been laying some of the groundwork
but of course they cannot do it alone.
The reasons we have not achieved a prosperous, efficient and self-sustaining economy
can be cited in part as these:
1. The economic situation confronting Confederation when our area was at a crucial
point in development.
2. The relatively uneconomic character of
the resources in the region.
3. The loss of once major British markets
and the depletion of certain resources and
the changing character of market demands.
It was necessary for the new federated
Government from 1867 to 1900 to develop
a national policy and to work out within
that policy arrangements which would satisfy
the various political units within the nation.
The aim was to create transcontinental trade,
and to that end the national policy was developed and a railroad built.
Both of these things accelerated western
and northern development and in particular
the growth of manufacturing in the central
provinces. At this time, the economy of the
Atlantic region was based on exports of primary products. This had once made for a
prosperous economy, but with the passing of
British preferences there came a loss of our
markets. As it developed, we could not break
into the central Canadian markets because
of geography-the transportation problem of
generations. Further, the Atlantic area lagged
because much of Canadian growth and manufacturing was established during "resource
booms"-and I refer to periods like the two
great World Wars. All of these occurred in
regions far from us where resources were and
continue to be very rich indeed. They were
resources of a type which provided profits
that could absorb all the costs involved in
development.

May 19, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Atlantic area resources were and are of a
different sort. They are not rich in the sense
of northern Canada's resources, though they
are extremely valuable. They do not offer
profits which can cover all the expenses involved. There has been, as a result, a lack
of dynamic instrumental capital for primary
and secondary manufacturing industries. For
instance, in 1949 this kind of capital amounted
to $660 per capita for the Atlantic region,
against $970 for Canada. This was 68 per cent
of the national average.
To demonstrate the continuing impact of
this factor, I would point out that in 1963 the
Atlantic region had only 61 per cent of the
national average. In short, the region is not
catching up with the rest of the country.
I interject here to say that the activation of
the Atlantic Development Board by the
present Government and the allocation of
part of its $100 million fund for power
development and assistance for trunk roads
and harbours have together brought about
a new beginning for our area. We are now
getting the foundation for the framework,
and proposals now before the country can
be instrumental in pushing it to the needed
eventual level. This is the springboard we
have long needed.
Of course some things have been done
before now. However, I believe the only
effective concession was the Maritime Freight
Rates Assistance Act. This encouraged the
coal and steel industry but it did little if
anything for manufacturing. The freight
assistance, in any case, worked in one direction only and a one-way economic policy could
never be of much value to an area controlled
by its geography.
Today, the resources pattern is not changed
but some of the geographic obstacles are lower
than they once were. Further, a prospering
Europe and a new kind of world demand for
processed minerals and chemicals-to mention
these examples only-have provided new opportunity because we are on the ocean and
have access to world markets. What we
continue to require is the type of assistance
I have been discussing which will allow us
to take advantage of these opportunities.
If there is an honest desire-and I believe
the Government of the day has such a desireto promote development in the Atlantic region,
the national Government must make available
such basic services as communications which
include roads-and notably roads-power and
more power, technical training and more support to higher education, retraining and
technical assistance.

It has been most encouraging, then, to note
that this is the direction which is being
taken.
The $20 million granted by the Atlantic
Development Board to the Mactaquac Power
Project-and similar grants in other provinces
-has allowed the start on exploitation of an
absolutely essential power source in New
Brunswick. However, it must be remembered
that power generated at Mactaquac will all be
taken up by the major mineral and allied
industrial developments in our province within
a very few years.
Tidal power projects at Passamaquoddy,
and in the Shepody-Cumberland potential
tied in with the Chignecto canal, have received
less national attention in Canada than they
have in the United States. These are not new
ideas, but they continue to be valid and I
want to emphasize in particular what Chignecto means to us in the region.
Whatever may have been the arguments
for a canal in the past-and there were
powerful arguments-they grow stronger
now. The joint provision of canal and power
potential is itself a new incentive and one
which would benefit not one province alone,
but the whole area. Further, the possibility
of a new steel industry locating in New
Brunswick makes the canal project more
urgent than it ever has been.
We are currently developing through the
New Brunswick Government's agency a
chemicals industry in which private enterprise is being given full scope for participation and ownership. This industry in the
southeastern quarter of the province, and
with other industries being considered by
the New Brunswick Development Corporation, will offer more important reasons for
the canal and power development.
Furthermore, the developments on the
northeast coast will require supplies and
more power in the future, and again the
Chignecto project will be justified.
I have mentioned communications as being essential to economie growth. The
Romans demonstrated this two thousand
years ago and the proof of their demonstration has been increasing on this continent
and in Europe in recent years. Roads are
civilizing; they allow for human contact,
they provide social activity, they open the
way to resources and they give access to
markets. They make a nation.
In Europe, with its heavy concentrations
of population, concentrated railroad networks have developed and filourish to serve

SENATE DEBATES
all areas. Here in North America and particularly in Canada, highway transportation
today serves the smaller and more isolated
communities where railroads do not reach.
Like bush airlines to northern Canada, roads
to resources give us in the Atlantic region
the access which is vital. They also allow
for speed and flexibility.
There is no logical reason why in our day
national assistance to roads should not be
on the same level as it was to railways in
another era. In this connection, I would
mention the proposed all-weather corridor
road through the United States to connect
New Brunswick-and all the Maritime provinces-with the populous regions of Quebec
and Ontario. This is a short route and one
which would put us directly into the major
markets of Montreal and Toronto. It is a
route which should stir the imagination just
as much today as the Intercolonial Railway
did in its time. The road would be a commercial highway on which goods could flow
to and from Central Canada, without customs
problems, over the most direct and logical
route.
There is another area of development to
which I want to turn, and that is the increasing of human potential. It can be the
best system of improving the economy, that
is, by increasing the earning power of our
people.
The war on poverty is an exciting idea,
but it is more than that. It is a recognition
of a basic economic truth that a nation or
a region will prosper in relation to the desire and ability of its people to make it
prosper. All the natural resources in the
world would be valueless if the people did
not know how to take them out.
We in the Atlantic area have had our
bruises from economic history and geography,
and sometimes in the past we have allowed
these injuries to dishearten us. Many of our
best young people have gone elsewhere to
enrich other regions. This is not altogether
a bad thing because just as they have given
their talents to others, there are those who
can give special talents to us. Our experience
with social mobility may in the future prove
a benefit rather than otherwise. Canada needs
more people, and we in our region need more
people.
In recent years, we Maritimers have taken
stock and remembered the old maxim that
"God helps those who help themselves." We
in all the Maritime provinces-with my own
in the vanguard where a brisk young premier

May 19, 1965

is effectively co-ordinating his government's
efforts with a friendly and responsive Government in Ottawa-have created a whole
new attitude. Our people have adopted a
fresh outlook, they have brought forward a
renewal of their great vigour, and are now
ready to make a new and better life in their
home provinces.
There has been in Canada what the federal
Minister of Labour referred to recently as
"insular poverty." We have been one of the
islands or areas where many residents have
had substandard incomes. This bas left many
of our people unprepared for the kind of
economy which can be made today, and for
the full development of their potential which
has begun.
Thus, even where the new attitude exists,
there must be created opportunities for both
younger and older people to take advantage.
When a better life is shown, those who have
lived marginal lives will in time be encouraged to rise to the improved standards. But
first they must have the tools. Today, those
tools are in job training, technical training,
in higher education as well as in employment
opportunities, tax concessions and other incentives to industries.
Helping workers acquire skills and the
training they need te benefit from industrial
development is an area in which the national
authority can play a role which is impossible
for the smaller provinces to do alone. It is a
matter of great pride that in New Brunswick
we have moved quickly to provide trades
and technical schools made possible by federal
help. We are passing up no opportunities,
but it must be remembered that the smaller
provinces have limited financial resources for
cost-sharing schemes. Technical training is as
expensive as it is essential, and anything done
by the national Government will pay off in
prosperity to the nation.
We in this chamber can do our part with
others in making the modern role of skilled
and technical education understood in its
proper context. In the past, there has too
often been-and it is not yet eradicated-a
foolish notion that those trained and educated for skills and techniques were somehow in a different social class from those
educated for white-collar occupations. The
silliness of this is obvious on every hand,
where incomes and the importance of skills
and techniques have risen often beyond those
of the so-called white-collar classes. Those
who will form a new elite, and who are now
doing so with great speed, are those who

May 19, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

fit into the modern technical scheme. The
same professional recognition should exist
for such technically-educated people as has
been given traditionally to the conventional
learned professions.
Loans to students for this kind of education,
as well as for the traditional kind, are among
the best things done by this or any other
Government. I say that even more must be
done. I have no fear of what some consider
the danger of "spoiling" eager and energetic
young people who wish to pursue higher education. The same arguments used in my
grandparents' day against free elementary
education were used in a later generation
against free high schools. Today there are
those who argue in exactly the same way
about easier college education. Just as the
arguments of those other days have been
demolished by a progressive society, so will
the arguments that exist today.
I have said that we in our region are
looking to a day when we shall come much
closer to the highest economie standards of
the nation. We know how earning power can
be increased, and I hope I have given some
indication of how this power can be generated
by federal measures. In my own city of Saint
John we have seen what initiative and free
enterprise can achieve when there is the
proper co-operation of governments and governmental agencies. I want to pay tribute
to those who have this initiative and enterprise, and I will serve notice that it is only
a demonstration of what our people can
accomplish. New designations which will exist
under proposed federal legislation will open
fresh avenues to us, and we shall take proper
advantage of them.
It was predicted that when increased winter
shipping went to the St. Lawrence route our
year-round general cargo ports would suffer
some losses. They have seen these losses, and
they are most important to us. We have the
facilities and we can handle this traffic as
effectively as any people anywhere, but we do
need the industries and the trade to keep
them busy.
Planned regional development, in which
there is continuous co-ordination among the
provinces of the region and between the
provinces and the national Government, is
an absolute essential to our success. Regional
planning alone can go only so far. Integration with the national development can finally
establish that self-sustaining framework for
the lively economy of which I spoke at the
outset.
By strengthening the economy of our diverse regions, and especially of those regions
22624-8

which have been below the national average,
we are strengthening all of Canada.
Hon. Paul Yuzyk: Honourable senators, I
join with all members of this house who
have spoken before me in congratulating Senator Bourque and Senator Aird who, respectively, moved and seconded the motion for
an address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, with special congratulations to
Senator Aird for his interesting maiden
speech.
May I also extend my heartiest congratulations to Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
the Government Leader in our chamber, for
the high and well-deserved honour accorded
him when he recently received an honorary
doctorate degree from the University of New
Brunswick. This is simultaneously an honour
accorded the Senate.
Honourable senators, I rise before this
august body to speak on the issue of capital
punishment. I was very happy to note the
following statement in the Speech from the
Throne. I quote:
Arrangements will be made for you to
decide the issue of capital punishment.
My Government will appoint a special
committee to study and make recommendations on a comprehensive policy
for the correction and rehabilitation of
prisoners.
I have been studying this problem for
some seven months, and I have applied to
it the research techniques, skills and experience of my profession as a historian. After
much reading, examining of statistics, discussions with authorities, church leaders,
lawyers and many others, and further deep
thought and debate with my conscience, I
have become a convert to the cause of the
abolition of capital punishment. I have joined
and actively support the Canadian Society for
the Abolition of the Death Penalty, whose
president, Mr. Arthur Maloney, Q.C., wholeheartedly fought for this cause when he was
a member of the other house. Consequently,
I fully support the stand on this issue of
the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the New Democratic
Party and many other members of both
chambers. Therefore, allow me, honourable
senators, humbly to present the main facts
and arguments which have led me to my
stand against the death penalty.
Since a free vote will be taken, each
member of both houses will have to consult
his own conscience. What Parliament will
have to resolve is not only whether capital

SENATE DEBATES
punishment is the unique deterrent to murder
that its traditional use seems to sanctify or
imply, but the more fundamental question of
whether, in the final analysis, the retention
of the death penalty causes more harm than
good and is less effective in protecting life.
We are aware that the British House of
Commons last December, by a vote of 355
to 170, overwhelmingly condemned the death
penalty after several years of experimentation
with it. Even many of its former supporters
have reversed their original stand. It is unlikely that the House of Lords will not endorse the decision of the Commons.
This means now that all countries in
Europe on this side of the Iron Curtain, with
the exception only of France and Spain, have
abolished capital punishment, and even these
two countries have rarely resorted to it in
the past decade.
Some 60 jurisdictions throughout the world
have already abolished the death penalty, incluing most of the countries in South America, among them Argentina and Brazil.
Within the Commonwealth of Nations, New
Zealand abolished the supreme penalty for
murder for a second time in its history in
1961. The Australian states of Queensland
and New South Wales employ it no longer,
while the other states are reconsidering their
attitude.
In the United States of America, ten
states have abandoned it by law, and most
of the other states have had no executions
for several decades. The only exception that
most of the abolition countries have made is
for treason during war.
It is very significant that most of the large
religious denominations of North America
have consistently opposed the death penalty.
The Central Conference of American Rabbis
in 1958 urged:
-the abolition of the death penalty where
it is still in effect. We are convinced that
it does not act as an effective deterrent
to crime.
Although the Vatican State retains the death
penalty, it has not carried out any executions
for a long time and, indeed, the Pope frequently appeals for clemency in other parts
of the world. Although many Catholic bishops
on this continent have not taken a direct
stand, many have. Nevertheless, Father J. D.
Conway, in The Catholic Digest of May 1959,
asserted that:
-the church is naturally inclined by
history, doctrine, spirit and example to

May 19, 1965

favour abolition of the death penalty in
our modern society.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable
gentleman allow me a question?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is the honourable senator
of the opinion that the death penalty is in
no way whatsoever a deterrent to crime?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Yes, I am of that opinion,
and I shall deal with that as I go along
in my speech.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I should like the honourable senator to answer also this question: To
whatever extent it is effective as a deterrent,
does he believe that the absence of the death
penalty will provide a certain remedy for
the ills from which we suffer?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Yes, I think that will
be brought out in the course of my speech.
Protestant churches, theologians and spokesmen for the majority have espoused the cause
of the abolition of capital punishment, supported by many Roman Catholic writers.
Some fundamentalist publications have taken
the opposite stand, but these are few. The
Christian emphasis on mercy, compassion and
redemption for any person as a human being
and our brother, under one God and Father
of us all, reminds all faithful of such a clear
New Testament teaching as:
Render

to no man

evil

for evil...

avenge not yourselves...
This I take from Romans, Chapter 12,
verses 17-19.
In the philosophy of Christianity it is not
capital punishment that is the crucial issue,
but rather that "the sacredness of the individual is not man-conferred or state-enacted,
but God-given and inherent."
Typical of the Christian as well as the
Jewish position is the resolution of the American Baptist Convention, 1960:
Because the Christian believes in the
inherent worth of human personality and
in the unceasing availability of God's
mercy, forgiveness,
and redemptive
power, and
Because the Christian wholeheartedly
supports the emphasis in modern penology
upon the process of creative, redemptive
rehabilitation rather than on punitive and
primitive retribution, and
Because the deterrent effects of capital
punishment are not supported by available evidence, and

May 19, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Because the death penalty tends to
brutalize the human spirit and the society
which condones it, and
Because human agencies of legal justice
are fallible, permitting the possibility of
the executing of the innocent,
We, therefore, recommend the abolition
of capital punishment and the re-evaluation of the parole system relative to such
cases.
The largest Protestant churches in Canada
have gone on record condemning capital punishment. The Nineteenth General Council of
the United Church of Canada in 1960 recommended the following alternatives to the
Government of Canada:
1. In place of the death sentence for
a capital offence, that there be substituted
a statutory sentence of life imprisonment
subject to the prevailing conditions of
remission and parole.
2. That no person convicted of a capital offence be released from care in a
correctional institution so long as his
retention therein is essential to the wellbeing of society and to his reformation.
3. That subject to the approval of the
National Parole Board, which should be
given the necessary powers, the length
and the nature of the treatment of persons convicted under such a system be
determined in consultation with treatment
authorities.
The Anglican Church of Canada, after having studied the question over a number of
years, passed a resolution in 1958 petitioning
the federal Government to "initiate proceedings leading to the abolition of capital punishment in Canada."
Criminologists and criminal lawyers, who
specialize in criminal justice, are the most
ardent crusaders against the death penalty.
Donald E. J. MacNamara, Dean of the New
York Institute of Criminology, a former police
officer and a prison warden, a "convert" to
abolition, states:
No criminologist of stature in America
or abroad gives it support.
He is the President of the American League
to Abolish Capital Punishment. Mr. Harry
Walsh, Q.C., of Winnipeg, and Mr. John
Robinette, Q.C., of Toronto, two of Canada's
best criminal lawyers, and many other Canadian criminal lawyers, have made public statements in favour of abolition.
Most of the leading newspapers in our
country have written editorials on the side

If one were to look back into the history
of England he would discover that justice is
a relative concept which changes with the
times. The number of crimes punishable by
death as late as 1819 was estimated at 223.
These included not only murder, killing,
treason, piracy, etcetera, but also thievery,
heresy, adultery, forgery, and a host of what
we would call minor offences. The lax
enforcement after 1800 still resulted in up to
3,000 persons executed annually for many
years.
For a long time the standard practice for
those guilty of petty or high treason consisted
of drawing, hanging, disembowelling, beheading and quartering the body. Robbers had
their bones broken and the still living body
bound to the spokes of a wheel fixed on a
pole of the scaffold. Such executions were
conducted in public, and were usually followed by drunken revels. Today such punishments are no longer tolerated and executions
are performed in the seclusion of a prison.
The number of capital offences has been reduced to a very few, in many places to deliberate murder only, testifying to the fact
that the sense of justice bas greatly changed
in the last 150 years.
With the advancement of civilization, not
only has brutality greatly diminished but so
has the concept of the deterrent value of the
death penalty. When Sir Samuel Romilly

of the community, the efficiency of the police
and of the machinery of justice and that if
the punishment is to be an effective deterrent
the penalty must be imposed "consistently,
immediately and inexorably; that is on all
offenders, promptly after the crime and in
such a way that the general public exactly
expects this."
Western civilization considers that it is
wrong to imprison an innocent man and
shocking to hang an innocent person. Juries
and judges unintentionally have convicted
many innocent persons of crime. Professor
Hugo Adam Bedau, in his book The Death
Penalty in America (1964), abstracted 74
cases of wrongful convictions of criminal
homicide in the United States in the years
1893 to 1962, "proved beyond doubt." Fortunately, the death sentence was applied to
only eight persons. How many of the more
than 7,000 persons executed in the United
States this century might have been proven
innocent if they had received life sentences?
Of course the abolition of the death penalty
does not remedy the injustice of convicting
and punishing an innocent man, but it is
much more just to avoid the execution of the
innocent than to risk the questionable advantage of executing a few guilty ones, if
we remember there were only 20 executions
in the United States in 1963. This does not
mean that our courts should be condemned.
On the contrary, they are to be commended
for their efficiency, but we must never forget
that human judgment and human procedures
are fallible.
It is these considerations of the highest
human values in our society that have motivated the former Conservative Government
and the present Liberal Government to commute death sentences. The Department of
Justice has informed me that there have been
no executions in Canada since 1962, and
that the present Government has commuted
14 cases since coming to power. These commutations have not led to a proportionate
increase in the number of murders.
Surely cabinets have much more important
work to perform than hearing capital cases.
It is obvious that governments are unwilling
to apply the death penalty. Parliament should
abolish it and institute penal reform for
adequate protection of our citizens, our penitentiary employees and our police officers,
as well as a system of education for the
prevention of crime, bearing in mind that
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound
of cure.

Much more time would be needed to present a discussion of other implications of the
abolition of the death penalty. Evidence can
be produced that many persons who commit
crimes are not rational at the time of the
crime, the great majority having been under
the influence of alcohol, in a fit of passion, or
were insane; that alternative penalties, such
as life imprisonment, have a greater protective value to society; that policemen and
prison guards are as safe and safer in nondeath penalty states; that paroled and pardoned murderers are no threat to public safety
and much safer risks than paroled burglars
and robbers; that the costs of extended trials
and retrials, appeals, extra security, support of
the convict's family, etcetera, are much more
costly where criminals are executed; and that
capital punishment bas a brutalizing effect
upon society, encouraging disrespect for our
laws, courts and institutions and is a stumbling block in bringing about the reform of
our prison systems and the treatment of
crime and criminals.
Hon. Mr. Vien: May I ask the honourable
senator if he believes that capital punishment
at present would act in such a way as to
induce more criminality in the country?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: No, I do not think I
made such a statement. I claim that the use
of the death penalty, or the lack of the use
of the death penalty, does not affect the
murder rate in any country.
Hon. Mr. Vien; The question is whether
the abolition of the death penalty would
have a beneficial effect on criminality in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Yes, that is my belief,
my firm belief; and I would like to present
more evidence about it in a committee, as
there is scarcely any time here to bring out
the facts.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I would like to hear the
honourable gentleman say on what that plea
is based.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: On many of the facts that
I have given already. I think that if the
honourable senator followed my argument
and the facts that I have presented, it would
be quite clear to him. I am willing to present
more facts on this issue before a Senate
committee.
Honourable senators, as a symbol of
approach to crime, capital punishment has
been tried in the balance of history and found
wanting. Its brutalizing influence is in complete conflict with the humanizing ideals of

SENATE DEBATES
present-day civilization and culture. Its abolition can only enhance our respect for the
noblest human qualities and achievements.
This approach is perhaps best epitomized by
the greatest statesman of our century, the
late Sir Winston Churchill, who wrote during
the horrors of the Second World War:
The mood and temper of the public
with regard to the treatment of crime and
criminals is one of the most unfailing
tests of the civilization of any country.
A calm dispassionate recognition of the
rights of the accused, and even of the
convicted criminal against the state; a
constant heart-searching by all charged
with the duty of punishment; a desire
and an eagerness to rehabilitate; tireless
efforts toward the discovery of the creative and regenerative processes; unfailing
faith that there is a treasure, if you can
only find it, in the heart of every man.
These

and measure the stored-up strength of

it.
Honourable senators, the Minister of Justice
has promised a background paper, similar to
a white paper, containing all of the relevant
information about developments in Canada
and other countries which could prove useful
in arriving at a decision. It would be advisable for all of us who have this grave responsibility upon our shoulders to peruse this
document when it arrives. In the meantime, it
would be useful to read the excellent book
The Death Penalty in America: An Anthology, which presents a full up-to-date
treatment of all aspects of the problem. This
book has been supplied by the Canadian
Society for the Abolition of the Death
Penalty. The society has also sent to all
members of the Canadian Parliament a documented reply to the submission by the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, dated
February 6, 1965. This reply was prepared
by Professor P. J. Giffen of the Department
of Sociology at the University of Toronto and
warrants careful consideration, for it factually
refutes the police chiefs' allegation that the
policy of the Diefenbaker and Pearson Governments "has contributed greatly to this
deplorable state of affairs."
As a service to the members of both Houses
of Parliament, the Canadian Society for the
Abolition of the Death Penalty has arranged
in the Parliament Buildings, on June 3, a
panel discussion on this issue. Participating
in this panel will be several outstanding experts, namely: Professor Thorsten Sellin of

May 19, 1965

the Department of Sociology of the University
of Pennsylvania, perhaps the greatest authority on this question; Mr. Sidney Silverman,
M.P. from the United Kingdom, who introduced the bill to abolish the death penalty in
the British House of Commons; the Honourable René Levesque, Minister of Natural
Resources for the Province of Quebec; and
Mr. John J. Robinette, Q.C., and Mr. G.
Arthur Martin, Q.C., both distinguished criminal lawyers from Toronto. I hope our senators will take advantage of this opportunity.
It appears to me that mankind is gradually
moving towards a universal constitutional
prohibition against capital punishment. Canada has been lagging behind many countries
which have pioneered and have proven the
ineffectiveness of this brutal penalty. We
now have the opportunity to improve justice
and bring Canada in line with the progressive countries of the world.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I had no intention of taking part in this debate, but the remarks which have just been
made prompt me to give you my own
views on the subject. I was a member of
a joint committee of the Senate and of the
House of Commons which studied this question for a couple of years. Many people and
associations of all kinds, from all parts of
Canada came to Ottawa and gave the committee the results of their studies on the
subject.
We all deplore the increased wave of
crime which has spread over Canada, the
United States, European countries and,
indeed, over the world. How can we correct
that condition? This is the subject of studies
carried out by numerous organizations, including Canadian parliamentary committees.
I had an open mind to receive the views of
those who were called or who requested to
appear before us.
Two questions seemed to be fundamental
in the study of that problem: Is the death
penalty, as now applied in Canada and elsewhere, a deterrent or an incentive to more
crime? Will the abolition of capital punishment be helpful in reducing the crime
wave?
I have studied the evidence adduced in the
committees of Parliament. I have tried, with
an open mind, to consider the conclusions
which we should accept. I confess that I was
not convinced that some criminals, at least,
were not deterred from committing a crime
because of the death penalty; I was not able
to come to the conclusion that if we

May 19, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

abolished the death penalty the wave of
crime would be diminished, in Canada and
in the world. I am still convinced that many
people are deterred from committing a crime
because of the shadow of the gallows, and
that, if the death penalty were abolished,
many more people would be prompted to
commit a crime than otherwise.
That is my summary of the situation. At
this juncture in the world's history, we are
being urged to adopt all kinds of remedies
by what we call in French "l'avant-guarde,"
the forerunner of new ideas, a new method
of living in the world.
From the very beginning of the world
crimes were committed. Cain killed Abel at
the gates of the Garden of Eden. Rousseau
contended that "social conventions" corrupted
the human being. Seventeenth century French
philosophers and encyclopedists urged that
man is moral, but the social contract or conventions perverted him. Is this assertion not
contradicted by the fact that, at the door of
the Garden of Eden, Cain killed Abel? There
was no "social contract" of any kind at that
time.
No. Human nature is corrupt, since the
original sin, and only by spiritual gift can it
be lifted above its state of corruption. Today,
the world is in a state of turmoil because
spiritual forces are no longer the gift of as
many people as in prior times. Far be it from
me to say that the old times were so good!
Students of history know that, through the
ages, the world has had its moral problems.
The question has now been raised. I am in
favour of a procedure which, when adopted,
would help to reduce crime and to establish
a better social order in the world. And this
in Canada first, because we must look after
our own affairs-if we don't, nobody will
look after them.
Be that as it may, two questions suggest
themselves to my judgment at the present
time, namely: Is capital punishment, in some
way, a deterrent to crime, even if not fully,
as is exemplified by the number of crimes
committed in the world, notwithstanding
capital punishment? Is it, to a certain extent,
a deterrent?
Secondly, if we abolish capital punishment,
is the wave of crime likely to diminish?
These are the questions! After the examination of all that has been said by the honourable senator who bas just spoken, and who
has given us a number of opinionsHon. Mr. Yuzyk: I would like to make a
correction. I did quote facts, not just opinions.

If the honourable senator reads my speech
right through, he will see that. I do not know
that he heard me clearly, but I did quote
facts. I think I have answered the questions
he is asking me, and I am prepared to discuss this at a later stage. I have introduced
this problem so that we can think about it,
and so that we may have an opportunity to
bring in the experts who could answer some
of the questions and give us some further
facts.
Hon. Mr. Vien: These authorities quoted
by my honourable friend were merely
opinions, and they cannot convince me that
capital punishment has not been a deterrent,
and that its abolishment would improve the
situation.
That is all I have to offer for your
consideration, honourable senators. I would
be glad to adopt any policy which would be
likely to reduce the wave of crime in the
world, but I am sorry to say that, after
listening with a great deal of attention to
all that the honourable gentleman has just
said, and to all the authorities he has quoted,
and to all the authorities which were quoted
to the committees of the Senate and the
Joint Committee of the Senate and House of
Commons which have sat to investigate this
question, I have heard a number of opinions,
but none on the points that I have just indicated: Is the death penalty a deterrent?
Would the abolition of the death penalty be
a greater deterrent? On that I am still to be
advised.

That the Committee have power to

That the Committee be instructed to

Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
at this late hour I do not intend to speak for
more than a few minutes, and perhaps I may
be permitted to complete my remarks later
in the debate.
First, I want to congratulate the honourable
Senator Thorvaldson for bringing this subject
before the Senate in this form. I understood
from his remarks that his intention was to
have the committee inquire into Commonwealth relationships and the position of Canada within the Commonwealth.
Canada, of course, has always held a very
important position in the Commonwealth, one,
I would say, which is next to that of Great
Britain-and her importance is increasing
as time passes. If anyone asked for a definition of the Commonwealth, I am sure it
would be difficult to provide one. I would
like to quote from the London Times of
April 8, 1964 in which edition this question
was asked and this answer given:
The answer is that with all its embarrassments and imperfections the Commonwealth is the greatest effort at a
multi-racial society of nations the world
has seen. Multi-racialism is mankind's
only way forward to universal peace
and, on a world scale, the only way in
which Britain leads.

always produced definite and immediate decisions, but they have started the ground
work for the final solutions; they have contributed to create a friendly atmosphere which
has eliminated many misunderstandings, and
have paved the way to eventual decisions
beneficial to both sides. They have established
a sound basis for closer partnership in every
respect, and have helped to further international co-operation for the good of all mankind.
Is it not trua that, at times, there has been
a tendency to make a tragedy out of a difference? The communications between Canada
and the United States have always been
friendly and frank in every sphere. But, unfortunately, too often our differences have
been exaggerated and given too much publicity, while the many points on which we
agree were passed over in silence. Harmony
seldom makes headlines.
I am convinced that I express the sentiments of all honourable senators when I extend to all participants in the prescnt meetings my very best wishes for a fruitful and
successful session.
Honourable senators, there is one thing on
which there is unanimous agreement: The
presence of the charming wives of the delegates is an inspiration to all of us; their company will highly contribute to tomper the
discussion of even the most controversial
questions, if any, during the conference.
The Canadian Parliamentarians who had
the privilege of attending the Seventh Session of the Canada-United States Interparliamoentary Group held in Washington in
January 1964, followed by a visit to historic
St. Augustine and to Cape Kennedy, have
not forgotten the generous and warm hospitality extended to our delegation. Our
American friends may rest assured that
every effort will be made in order that their
stay in Ottawa and Montreal will be pleasant, interesting and instructive. When they
return to their great country we would like

May 20, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

them to express to the American people our
good wishes and cordial friendship.
Now that I have exhausted my English
vocabulary, I should like to take a leaf out
of Senator Aiken's book and say a few
words in French.
{Translation]
Honourable senators, in your name I extend to our good friends from the United
States a warm welcome to the Parliament of
Canada. Our meeting of the Canada-United
States Interparliamentary Group was scheduled for February of this year and included
a visit to Quebec City, which was to coincide
with the great annual carnival. But due to
circumstances beyond our control, it became
necessary, at this meeting, to replace the
visit to the old capital by a trip to the
metropolis of Canada. Delegates will therefore have the opportunity to enjoy once
more the legendary hospitality of French
Canada, after getting a warm reception in
other Canadian cities on previous occasions.
In closing, I express the hope that when
our meetings are over, the United States and
Canada, through their representatives, will
know and understand each other better. As
Newton said:
Men build too many walls and too
few bridges.

I am sure that honourable senators would
be pleased if I called out the names of the
members of the delegation of the United
States individually so that each may rise
and be identified.

Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, it is indeed a pleasure and an honour
to the Senate of Canada to welcome to its
chamber the distinguished legislators from
the Congress of the United States who are
with us today.
As Mr. Speaker read their names just now,
I am sure all of us thought we have here
as our guests some of the most distinguished
legislators of the Western World. In their own
country, and of course in their own local
areas, their names are household words. I
should ldke to tell them all, too, that their
names are household words in this country
as well.
They come to us from a great nation, a
nation which is our closest neighbour and our
best friend. They help to mould the policies
which make that nation great. They shoulder
great responsibilities, responsibilities which
affect the destiny of their own people but
in many ways, too, affect the destinies of
mankind. Their countrymen and ours have
common ideals of freedom, of the role of
government, of the rule of law, and of the
dignity of man. These ideals have modified
their relationships in peacetime; they have
forged effective co-operation between our
peoples in war. In many ways these two
countries of ours have built a partnership on
this continent that is in truth a wonder and
an example to a troubled world. This has
been possible because we understand each
other easily.

SENATE DEBATES

[Translation]
Honourable senators, let me tell you how
happy we are to have in the Senate of
Canada, today, representatives of the U.S.
Congress. They are all Canada's good friends
and we extend to them our warmest welcome
to our country.
[Text]
Before coming into the Senate today I was
reading some of the biographical material
on our guests. The publications of the Congress of the United States are very similar
to those of our Canadian Parliament. They
publicize their members, and it is right that
they should do so. As I read this material, i
was struck with the fact that the bloodstreams which feed the nerve centres in
our two national capitals, Washington and
Ottawa, find their foods and develop their
consistencies from almost identical sources.
Members of both Houses of the Congress of
the United States and members of both
Houses of our Parliament spring from almost
identical breeding grounds. They are men
from business, from the professions, from the
trades, from the resource industries, and from
the schools and universities. And in their
various callings they have been eminent. A
desire and a capacity for public service first
put them onto school boards, into municipal
councils, into the legislatures, into the courts,
into the universities and the armed services.
Success in these various callings has pushed
them ultimately onto the national stage,
into the House and into the Senate. Their
hard work and good friends have helped too.
That is the story of the people who populate our two national legislatures, and down
deep it may explain why we can get along
so easily together.

Senator George Aiken of Vermont is an
old friend of Canada and an old friend of
the members of the Canada-United States
Committee. So too, indeed, is the Honourable
Cornelius Gallagher of New Jersey, his cochairman. Their zeal in the promotion of
better relations between Canada and the
United States has been fruitful of results,
and in their times they have seen great
achievements flow from their statesmanship.
Their work bas made them benefactors of
Canada, especially at times when the going
was rough. I venture the opinion that in this
work they have benefited their own country
immeasurably as well.
We welcome them to this new meeting of
the committee and through them all of their
fellow delegates. It will not be thought invidious by any of our guests, I am sure, if

May 20, 1965

I as Leader of the Government in the Senate
of Canada venture a special word of welcome
today to the distinguished Majority Leader of
the United States Senate, the Honourable
Michael J. Mansfield.
This is not only because we share an Irish
background, although that would be good
enough reason, or, indeed, because we have
mutual friends, because both of these reasons
perhaps would be true of many of our other
distinguished guests too; but we welcome
Senator Mansfield for himself and because of
his distinguished career in education and in
the armed services. We have admired his
great and enlightened parliamentary capacity. Canadians remember his most moving
eulogy in the Capitol at the bier of your
tragically assassinated President. Senator
Mansfield has been a friend and confidant of
Presidents. He honours our country by coming here.
Honourable senators, may I conclude by
emphasizing the welcome expressed by Mr.
Speaker, with his customary Gallic délicatesse, to the wives of our distinguished guests
who were to have been present in our south
gallery today but who instead are out enjoying our "southern" sunshine. We who are in
public life know how much our wives do,
how very much we depend upon them, and
how we admire the fortitude with which they
endure the vicissitudes of their husbands'
careers. I am perfectly sure that each guest
here tells his wife this every day. If this is
repetition for the wives, I say it only to
emphasize how glad we are that these ladies
have come to visit us in our springtime. As
Mr. Speaker said earlier, they have come with
the tulips, and they add much to the colour
and the charm of this our season of high
hope.
It was a cynic, of course, who said that
"behind every successful man there stands a
surprised woman." For ladies with husbands
of such distinction, I am sure there is no
element of surprise but only an abiding satisfaction among those ladies at the results of
their handiwork. The women of America
have indeed been makers of great men.
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition,
the honourable Senator Brooks, and myself
have, with difficulty, restrained most of our
colleagues who wish to speak on this occasion. Senator Brooks himself will be addressing the Senate, and then we shall have the
pleasure of hearing from some of our guests.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
distinguished guests, I am delighted to join

May 20, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

with the Leader of the Government in welcoming our distinguished guests, the United
States Interparliamentary group. I also wish
to join him in expressing our regret that their
wives are not present in the south gallery,
but I am sure they are enjoying the Ottawa
sunshine and our beautiful tulips more than
they would looking down on we Canadian
senators.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: In welcoming this group,
may I say that we are simply telling very
close friends and good neighbours that we are
glad to see them again.
The whole of Canada, both geographically
and sentimentally, is very close to the United
States. I come from the eastern part of
Canada, and may I say that we in the Atlantic provinces feel that we are just a little
closer to the United States than perhaps
many other parts of Canada. As a matter of
fact, the New England States were almost
entirely populated by Canadians in those
days gone by.
History tells us that many thousands of
Americans settled in our provinces after the
American Revolution, and they certainly
played a great part in building this Canada
of ours. We were proud to call them United
Empire Loyalists. They were given other
names, I understand, in other places, but
those years are gone and long forgotten, and
the work they commenced for Canada continues.
Our history also tells us that 10,000 came
to the mouth of the Saint John River in New
Brunswick, my native province, and founded
a settlement which afterwards became the
City of Saint John, the first incorporated city
in British North America.
The honourable Leader spoke about the
bloodstreams that are identical in our public
life. This is very true, for in the succeeding
years many thousands of our people have
emigrated to the United States and made
their homes there. In fact, when we visit
your great country we do not go just to
visit American cousins, as we so often hear
said, but we go also to visit our brothers and
sisters, our uncles and aunts, and many
others.
I recall the statement of the leader of
your delegation, Senator Aiken-who has
been spoken of as a great friend of Canada,
and we recognize that fact and are proud
of it-when he visited us a few years ago.
He said:

The undertakings which we have carried out together have been an example
to the whole world.
This is true and, may I say, may it always
remain true, for the best friend Canada and
the Commonwealth have is the United States;
and I think I am safe in saying that the
best friends the United States has are Canada
and the older members of the Commonwealth,
such as Great Britain, Australia and New
Zealand.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: We in the Western World
are fortunate that your country is the leader
of the free world today. We see "Uncle
Sam," as we may affectionately call your
country and as you do in your own country,
as the modern Atlas carrying on his broad
shoulders the burdens of the world and, at
the same time, searching into space for the
great secrets it possesses. We wish him every
success and the best of luck in these and all
other undertakings, and I can assure you
that we will do our best to help.
So, distinguished guests, on behalf of Her
Majesty's loyal Opposition in the Senate, I
wish you a very pleasant and profitable visit
to Ottawa and Canada, and I can assure you
that the more we are together the happier
and merrier we shall be.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
at lunch time the honourable Senator Aiken
told me that he had brought only one speech
with him. Even if that be the case, Senator
Aiken, I am sure you will be able to find
a few words to say to us and I am sure that
honourable senators will be very happy to
listen to you.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. George D. Aiken, Senator from Vermont: Monsieur le Président, honourable
senators, mesdames et messieurs, I regret to
inform you that my French vocabulary has
not expanded much since the last time I
addressed you. However, I want to express
our appreciation for the courtesy you are
showing us here today.
I first experienced that courtesy about
seven or eight years ago when I found myself
unexpectedly in this position. I think the
meetings we have had in the intervening
period have been well worth while, not only
for our two countries but for the rest of the
world as well.

SENATE DEBATES

In these days when a good part of the
world is struggling, sometimes futilely, sometimes frustratingly, to find a formula not only
for self-government but for getting along at
peace with the rest of the world, I believe
we are setting a good example.
In my opinion, perhaps the most important
part of that formula, when they find it, will
be, as the Bible says, "Know your neighbour."
And that is why we are up here today.
We are up here in full strength this time.
That attests to the importance that we attach
to these meetings. The members of our delegation of the House and the Senate represent
all parts of the United States from California
to Maine, from Minnesota to Alabama. That
is as it should be. They represent different
walks of life. They represent different committees of the House and Senate in Congress. They have some things in common:
They are all good vote-getters, otherwise they
would not be here, and they are all friends
of Canada.
I feel sure, Mr. Speaker, that this the eighth
of these interparliamentary meetings that we
are now holding will give benefit to both
Canada and the United States, and that we
shall again, as we have done in the past, set
an example which the rest of the world might
well follow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
we shall now hear from the other cochairman, the Honourable Cornelius E.
Gallagher.
Hon. Cornelius E. Gallagher, Representative
from New Jersey: Mr. Speaker and Honourable Senators, I must apologize for not being
able to speak in French as well as my friend
Senator Aiken. The rules of the game for this
session were that Senator Aiken was to make
a speech in French and I was to speak in
English, but he has crossed me up a bit. I
wish to apologize, and to say a few words in
English.
First of all, I wish to thank your distinguished and able Speaker for his kind words
of welcome, and also the Leader of the Government, Senator Connolly, and the distinguished Leader of the Opposition, Senator
Brooks, for their kind remarks. We are most
grateful.
On behalf of my colleagues in the house,
I want to tell you how happy we are to be
back in Canada. It is a rare privilege that
you have accorded us in inviting us to the
floor of the Senate.
I could not help but think a little about,
and deliberate upon, what Senator Connolly

May 20, 1965

(Ottawa West) said about our wives when
he remarked that behind all great men are
their women. I checked about me, and I
recalled a remark by Napoleon who said that
many great men become great because their
wives drive them out of the house. That does
not apply to any of our wives. They have
all been very inspirational. To tell you the
truth, I would not be saying this if my own
wife were sitting in the gallery.
However, I am happy to be here once
again, able to exchange views with our counterparts in Canada. Senator Aiken bas said
all that needs to be said-he always does.
He is a wonderful leader, and an inspiration
to all of us in the United States. He is certainly one of the great friends of Canada,
and I am delighted to serve as his co-chairman.
As we are about to settle down to our
committee meetings I cannot but reflect also
on the beautiful sign you have here which
says "Way Out". If the history of the human
race is not to come to an abrupt end in the
very near future, in these complex times
in which we live, perhaps the way out for
us can be found in these exchanges we have
between the parliamentarians of Canada and
of the United States. If there is a way out,
it will be found only in the example that
we, as two separate nations, each finding
its own way and pursuing its own destiny,
are showing. The only way to reach peace
is by understanding, co-operation, and mutual
trust.
That is the inheritance that both of our
nations share, and I hope that these meetings will make some contribution to the continuance of that great tradition.
The Hon. the Speaker: Thank you very
much, Representative Gallagher, for your
very appropriate words.
I am sure we should all like to hear from
the Majority Leader of the Senate of the
United States. I now call upon Senator Mike
Mansfield.
Hon. Michael J. Mansfield, Senator from
Montana: Mr. Speaker, honourable Leaders,
my fellow-parliamentarians, may I say that
I wish I could walk into the Senate of the
United States each day and find such a large
attendance as is here today. I am delighted
to be here, and to serve under such distinguished co-chairmen as Senator George Aiken
and Representative Cornelius Gallagher.
I was very interested in a remark made
by Mr. Gallagher in which he noted that
Napoleon had said that behind every successful man-and I assume he means politicians

May 20, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

-there is a woman who wants to drive him
out of the house. I wonder if he had any
political connotation in mind.
It is good to be here. It is good to be here
as an American of Irish and French descent.
It is a pleasure to be in Canada in this
most beautiful of capital cities, to be among
neighbours and friends and to talk over
with you our differences, such as they areand there are some. I remind you that there
are elements which unite us and keep us
together.
My particular interest in Canada lies in
the fact that Montana has the longest common border of any State in the Union, with
Canada. We border on a part of Saskatchewan, a part of British Columbia, and the entire southern boundary of Alberta. We have
a very close relationship out there. I would
disagree most respectfully with the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Brooks) and say
that the Canadians of the west have made
their mark in the Rocky Mountains and
Pacific parts of the United States, and have
done so in a constructive manner. The result has been, I must admit, that too many
of our citizens are going north into Alberta,
British Columbia and Saskatchewan. I hope
that their contributions will be at least half
as much in these provinces as the contribution of the Canadians who have come down
to the western part of the United States.
It is good to be with you and meet fellowparliamentarians on a level of equality, of
mutual understanding and mutual respect.
Before I close I want to refer to the remarks made by my distinguished friend, the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa West) in which he said that
people who are successful in politics get
there by hard work, and loyalty on the part
of friends. I think we ought to add one more
ingredient to that, and say that many of us,
myself included, have got where we are
because we happen to have had a good deal
of luck at the right time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Thank you very
much, Senator Mansfield. It gives me great
pleasure to declare that the motion of welcome is carried unanimously.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SECOND

OF SENATORS

READING-DEBATE

BILL

ADJOURNED

Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
item No. 8 on the Orders of the Day is the
second reading of Bill C-98, an act to make
provision for the retirement of members of
the Senate. I understand that the honourable
leader of the Government proposes to explain the bill this afternoon. As it is an
important measure and of interest to all
senators, I would ask that it be proceeded
with as if it were item No. 1. Al honourable
senators will then have the opportunity of
hearing the explanation this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): I am
in the hands of the Senate. If unanimous
consent is given, I am most agreeable to

May 20, 1965

proceeding with the explanation of the bill
now.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill C-98, to make provision for
the retirement of members of the Senate.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
with which all of you are familiar, because
it has been discussed in the press, and I am
sure has been the subject matter of general
among parliamentarians, and
discussion
senators in particular.
I am happy indeed to agree to the proposal
made by Senator Brooks that I should put
the explanation of the measure upon the
record this afternoon. I shall try to do so
concisely, and I shall restrict myself to the
provisions of the bill, in the hope that it
might be easier for honourable senators to
understand the somewhat intricate draftsmanship that has gone into the measure.
In the first place, the bill provides that
after its passage all future appointments to
the Senate, new senators, shall retire when
they have reached their 75th birthday. They
will do so on a pension, to which they will
contribute. The pension will provide survivor benefits for their widows, if their
wives survive their husbands after retirement. The basis of the pension will be that
provided in the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, which is now in effect
for the other house.
I should point out, in respect of that act,
that a senator can retire at any time and
draw a pension, providing he has served in
three Parliaments-not through three Parliaments, but in three Parliaments. If the
service has been less than in three Parliaments the contributions which such a new
senator has made to the fund will be returnable to his estate, at his death, without
interest.
In respect of present senators, the provisions of this act are found in Part III of
the bill, which provides that present senators may retire from the Senate for two
reasons: (1) disability, (2) age.
To retire on account of disability, a senator would be required to supply and file
evidence of his physical or mental disability,
as the case may be. Upon that evidence
being accepted, his resignation would become effective.
Present senators, too, may retire on account of age, when they reach their 75th
birthday, or thereafter.

May 20, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

The bill provides that after its passage
all present senators shall contribute to the
Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is the
fund into which the moneys are to be paid
for the purpose of pension, at the rate of
6 per cent of their annual indemnity. That
indemnity is now $12,000 a year. The contribution, consequently, will be $720 per year
for each senator, or $60 per month.
Honourable senators, I would point out
very emphatically that under this measure
no present senator is required to retire on
account of age. The original terms of the
life appointment remain, unless an honourable senator desires to alter them by
retiring. There is no interference with the
Patent.
Part III of the bill also provides that if
a senator desires to retire, if he is over 75
at the time the bill is passed, he must
exercise his option within a year from the
time the bill becomes law. For senators who
have not reached their 75th birthday, this
option must be exercised within one year
after such senator attains his 75th birthday.
The consequences of the exercise of the
option, as provided in the bill, are that a
senator, upon retirement, will be entitled
to an annuity of $8,000 per annum, which
is two-thirds of his present indemnity. There
is a survivor benefit for his widow, which
is one-third of the retired senator's annuity,
or $2,666 per annum. There are no survivor
benefits unless a senator retires.
Under Part III of the bill, the maximum
period of time through which a present
senator is forced to contribute would be 262
years. That figure is chosen because it takes
that length of time to build up an annuity of
$8,000 at the rate of payment proposed by
the legislation.
Under this bill an existing senator is entitled to retire at any time on grounds of
disability. If he should do so, the annuity of
$8,000 per year and the survivor benefit for
the widow are both applicable in his case.
That would apply whether he bas exercised
his option within a year or not.
The payments made into this fund by
existing senators do not involve a return of
contributions even if the senator does not in
fact receive his annuity.
There is another option provided under
clause 14. By that clause honourable senators
are entitled to decide not to have Part III
of the bill apply to them. This means that if
a senator says that he at this time agrees to
retire at the age of 75, and if he desires to
be treated under the provisions of the Mem-

bers of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act,
he may do so.
Perhaps I could put it even more simply
by saying that any senator now enjoying a
life appointment may, if he wishes, by exercising this option, convert his status to
that which would be enjoyed by a senator
who is appointed to the Senate after the
passage of this bill. The consequences of the
exercise of this option, provided by clause 14,
are that the payments will be made into the
fund on the same basis as that on which they
are made in the other place by members of
the House of Commons under the Members
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
The annuity which is built up in the fund
accumulates at the rate of $300 per annum.
The pension rights attach, provided that contributions have been made during three Parliaments-not three sessions, but three Parliaments.
Under that Act, applicable to Members of
Parliament now and to new senators hereafter, and to senators who decide to come
within its provisions hereafter, there are
survivor benefits. The widow of a deceased
retired senator who is entitled to an annuity
would be entitled to three-fifths of the dececeased senator's pension entitlement.
If a senator-a new senator, or an existing
senator who chooses to come under the provisions of Part II-fails to survive three
Parliaments, there will be a return of his
contributions to his estate upon his death.
If he should die and leave no widow, the
contributions which have been paid by him
will be returned to his estate, if he has not
drawn an annuity.
The contributions made by honourable
senators under Part II and Part III will be
deductibles from taxable income in the year
in which they are made. The annuity or
pension is taxable in the year in which it is
received.
I should also add that arrangements will
be made, through the Department of the
Secretary of State, for honourable senators
who retire to have the right to continue to
use for life the prefix "honourable" before
their names.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is that in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No. That
would be done by arrangement with the Department of the Secretary of State.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Where does the authority
lie for doing so?

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
authority would lie in the fact that the same
practice is adopted for judges who retire.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: And for ministers of
the Federal Cabinet.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): And for
Privy Councillors. I would add that former
members of the House of Commons shall be
entitled to buy back past service for pension
purposes covering service in the House of
Commons, but there is no provision for senators to buy back any period of service in the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Only future service.

on that point in my mind. That is a provision of the law.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then does he get the
$720 contribution back?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wes±): No,
there is no return of contributions provided
for in Part III of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: If a senator has reached
the age of 75 and dies during the year which
he may make an election, does his widow
receive an annuity?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): No,
there are no survivor benefits until a resignation takes place. If a senator should die
in the circumstances described by Senator
Hollett, that is before resigning, the consequences of his death would be the same as
the consequences of the death of any existing
senator before the passage of this bill.

May 20, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Presently a change of the location of the
head office can only be brought about by an
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members
of the institute as set out in section 5 of the
original charter of 1898. The difficulty is
that it is impossible for practical reasons
ever to obtain a vote of two-thirds of the
members of the institute, since past experience has shown that approximately only 40
per cent of all members eligible to vote return their ballots.
If the present application is granted, the
change of the location of the head office could
be effected by the introduction of a new bylaw. Such by-law, in order to be valid and
legal, would merely require the acceptance of
two-thirds of the votes cast. Therefore, if
two-thirds of those members who return their
ballots are in favour of such by-law, the
change would be effective pursuant to the
procedure set out in present by-laws 75 and
76.
The history of the institute shows that it
has presently a membership of approximately
6,000, most of whom are located in Canada in
various locations from coast to coast, and
some in other parts of the world. The institute
has 42 branches in Canada, and is divided
geographically into six districts and technically into seven divisions.
The affairs and business of the institute
are managed and controlled by an elected
board which is known as the council and
which consists of the president, the presidentelect, certain vice-presidents, councillors and
the chairman of each technical division of the
institute, as well as the three immediately
preceding past-presidents. In addition, there
is an executive director, secretary-treasurer
and the Western Field Secretary who are
officers of the institute. There are also standing committees, such as Finance, Library,
Publications, and Executive Committee.
There are various classes of membership.
The fees vary from $2 for student members
to $20 for members and associate members.
There are also corporate members, and we
understand that most of the mining and
metallurgical companies in Canada are corporate members of the institute, as well as
some of the petroleum companies.
The institute is a nonprofit organization
and its objects of incorporation, as more
specifically set out in the 1898 charter, are to
promote the arts and sciences connected with
the economical production of minerals and
metals, the establishment of a central reference library and headquarters, and to take

action upon matters affecting the mining and
metallurgical industries in Canada, and also
to encourage -and promote these industries.
The institute holds meetings on a local,
regional and national basis. As an illustration,
at the 1964 annual general meeting in Toronto, there was a registration of close to
2,500 people.
Since its inception the institute has been
very active within the field of its objects, and
it can be said that practically every Canadian
connected with the mining and metallurgical
industry, and geology, in Canada is a member.
Although the head office of the institute
has been located in the City of Montreal since
the date of incorporation, it is now felt by
the executive that it would be conducive to
the more effective operation and management
of the institute to move its headquarters to
the City of Toronto, which is now the mining
and metallurgical centre of this country. In
order to have freedom of action to change the
location of the head office from time to time,
and as circumstances may require in the
future, it is felt that the best way to bring
this about would be to enable the institute
to regulate such location by by-law, which, in
any event, would require two-thirds of the
votes cast by the members. As a matter of
fact, in June 1964 ballots were mailed to all
members of the institute to vote on a resolution passed by the council to establish the
necessary procedure to allow the institute to
effect such change by by-law. The following
is a breakdown of the result:
Ballots mailed
4,991
Ballots received
2,305
Disqualified and spoiled ballots
135
Ballot votes
2,170
Affirmative
1,919
Negative
251
2,170
The above indicates that the overwhelming
majority of members who cast their votes
were in favour of the amendment which is
the subject matter of the petition.
Honourable senators, if this bill receives
second re'ading I propose to ask that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

NATIONAL

HOUSING

ACT,

1954

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

Hon. Donald Smith moved the second reading of Bill C-104, to amend the National
Housing Act, 1954.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
move second reading of Bill C-104, an act
to amend the National Housing Act, 1954, I
think it appropriate and perhaps useful to
remind ourselves of the special interest
shown by the Senate in the past in the
operations of the National Housing Act. I
am referring, as honourable senators will
know, to the Finance Committee's study of
the Central Mortgage and Housing operations, which took place during the 1958 session, and the report made in August of that
year. The committee made a number of
important recommendations which were subsequently given consideration by the Government of that day and by the Government
which followed, and I think the results have
been very worth while.
The first recommendation that comes to
mind is that consideration should be given to
the suggestion that loans on university residences by approved lending institutions be
qualified for insurance under the National
Housing Act. The committee also pointed out
in that connection that the provision of hostel
accommodation was both desirable and necessary. A further recommendation of that
committee was that the resources of C.M.H.C.
be directed towards encouraging the provision of low-cost homes and the expansion of
low-rental accommodation.
A third recommendation pointed out the
need for a close study of the problem of increasing the supply of mortgage funds and
of promoting the sale of approved mortgages.
A fourth recommendation referred to urban
redevelopment. The committee reported in
that regard that greater use of the facilities
under the National Housing Act would have
to be made during the following ten years
if the problem was to be dealt with adequately. The committee also stressed the need
for improved information services with respect to assistance for urban redevelopment
available under the National Housing Act.
It is interesting to note that all the
recommendations to which I have referred
have now been incorporated into legislation
and into the policies of the housing administration in Canada.
I would also remind those honourable
senators who were in the chamber at that
time, and inform those who have since come

May 25, 1965

into the chamber, that the chairman of the
Finance Committee who wrote that report
was the late Senator Charles Hawkins from
Nova Scotia. He prepared a statement to be
made on the presentation of the report, and
it was sad that this wise, experienced and,
indeed, beloved colleague passed away suddenly the day before he was to move the
adoption of the report. However, his statement was placed on the record by another
distinguished friend of all of us, the late
Senator Horner, who was vice-chairman of
that committee, because he deemed it appropriate that the statement should be on the
Senate record. It was based on Senator
Hawkin's philosophy of the meaning and
value of home ownership, not only to the
individual but to the community and the
nation. In the debate which followed I remember saying that I hoped his words of
truth and wisdom would be read by many
of our fellow Canadians. I take this opportunity of bringing that statement of our
late colleague to the attention of those who
have become members of this chamber since
then. Their time would be well spent in
reading pages 574-5 of Senate Hansard of
August 15, 1958. His words then were and
still are well worth reading. It is indeed
unfortunate that Senator Hawkins did not
live to see the progress which has been made
in the operations of the National Housing
Act since the recommendations of the Finance
Committee in 1958.
Honourable senators, Bill C-104, the bill
before us now, seeks approval for several
substantial monetary amendments to the
National Housing Act, to ensure the continuing significance of this major piece of federal
legislation as a vigorous instrument in Canada's national development. This request
for additional funds stems largely from the
amendments authorized to the act last summer which introduced broadened forms of
assistance, particularly in the fields of urban
renewal and housing for low-income families
and individuals.
Since the enactment of these new provisions the minister responsible to Parliament
for the operations of the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation has devoted himself
energetically to making the provinces and
municipalities fully aware of the increased
support to civic improvement which the
federal Government is now willing to provide.
Meetings have been held with provincial and
municipal representatives in eight of the ten
provinces, and I have been informed that
similar meetings are planned for Winnipeg

May 25, 1965

May 25 1965SENATE
DEBATES

and Regina during the latter part of this
month, following which representatives from
ail provinces will have had an opportunity
ta have the legisiatian explained to them.
I belleve some indication of the impending
swell of activity to renew and modernize aur
towns and cities is apparent from the fact
that some fifty municipalities have already
sought federal aid in carrying out urban
renewal studies. Ten municipalities, from. St.
John's, Newfoundland, to Vancouver, British
Columbia, have now moved beyond this initial study phase and have received federal
aid, first provided by last year's amendments,
ta prepare definite urban renewal schemes.
Assistance has also been provided since
last June for the actual implementation of
schemes developed for the cities of Hamilton,
Vancouver, Kingston and Ottawa, which alone
involve federal cammitments totalling mare
than $6J million.
My attention was drawn ta a story, emanating from the City of Hamilton, which appeared
in the Ottawa Citizen of Tuesday, May 18
last, indicating the tremendous job the City
of Hamilton is doing in taking advantage of
the assistance that is available ta cities which
are faced with this problem of urban renewal.
I would just like ta quote two short paragraphs from this article. The apening paragraph states:
A dramatic urban renewal shawpiece,
prabably the most ambitiaus in Canada,
has been designed here ta rejuvenate the
city's faltering heart.
Later the article states:
Althaugh no estiinates of the cast has
been given, implementation of the plan
will obviously run into tens of millions
of dollars. However, under amendments
ta the National Housing Act, the city
can collect 75 per cent of the cost of expropriation and clearance from federal
and provincial governiments. Further
grants will be available for the building
of roads and installation of services.
I shauld like also ta draw the attention of
honourable senators ta a publication that was
placed in aur boxes over the weekend. It is
in the form. af a magazine entitled: "lUrban
Renewal and Publie Housing in Canada." On
page Il and following there are tables which
honourable senators may wish ta look at when
they have the apportunity, because they give
a good idea as ta what the movement is now
towards taking advantage af the legislation
that is on the statute books. Cities and towns
22624-9

from. one end of the country ta the atherand I might say not ail of them are large
tawns and cities-are getting underway with
this mast important wark.
As these urban renewal proposais begin
ta came farward in increasing numbers from
the drawing boards of aur municipal planners,
federal funds ta aid in carrying out these
programs will be required ta keep pace. In
anticipation of this. grawing surge of activity,
it is now proposed ta increase the statutary
limitation an federal funds for this purpose
fram $100 million ta $300 million.
In many cases, pragrams of urban renewal
will involve the provision of suitable hausing
for families residing ini these areas-families
which, because of restricted incames, have
been unable ta obtain suitable accommodation an the open market.
Honaurable senators will recail that the
existing provlàions of the Act ta meet the
need af this segment a! aur population were
greatly enhanced by the amendments of last
year. In addition ta adopting some additional
f eatures ta the usuai joint federal-provincial
arrangements for the supply of public housing, an alternative method of producing this
f orm a! accommodation was introduced
through the authorization o! long-termn lans
equal ta 90 per cent of the costs ta provinces
and municipalities wishing ta undertake
developments on this basis.
There has been much favourable reaction
throughaut the country ta this new farm a!
federal assistance. For example, in Ontario
alone the newly-created Ontario Hausing Corporation has set for itself an objective of providing no less than 12,000 loan-assisted public
hausing units within the next three years.
Negotiations are naw underway with munieipalities acrass the province for an initial
pragram involving some 4,500 dwellings.
At the same time there has been renewed
activity in development undertaken through
joint federal-provincial participation, with
agreements signed since last June cavering
eight prajects. These will provide, in the
aggregate, 1,031 units of modern housing for
law-incame families and elderly people. This
work will be carried out with federal funds
amaunting ta $10.5 million.
The present limit an federal participation
in meeting the capital costs and operating
lasses on these projects is established at $50
million, plus any additional amounts authorized by Parliament. The proposai in which
we are asked ta concur wauld increase this
amount ta $150 million, and facilitate the

SENATE DEBATES
planning of federal action in this field over
a two- or three-year period.
The evolution of the National Housing Act
during the years has seen the introduction
of a number of special provisions. Among
these has been the program which was inaugurated in 1960 of assisting financially the
construction of accommodation for resident
students at our universities and colleges. I am
sure that the accomplishments under this
program have brought a real sense of satisfaction to the former minister, Senator
Walker, who, I regret, is not in his seat at
the moment.
Since 1960, loans totalling in excess of $120
million have been authorized for 103 projects,
providing living quarters for 24,000 students.
Recent proposals made to Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation could involve a
further $5 million. These loans leave only
approximately $25 million of the current
limitation of $150 million uncommitted, and
the bill recommends an increase in the fund
allotment to $200 million. The additional
amount, it is estimated, would enable C.M.H.C.
to meet demands for assistance of this type
during the next two or three years.
The remaining two changes proposed in
this bill would increase the over-all amounts
authorized at present for the insurance of
mortgage loans approved under the National
Housing Act, and for direct lending operations
by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Section 13 of the act now limits to $6
billion the amount of mortgage loan insurance
which the corporation may issue. By the
end of 1964 insurance in force for loans made
by the private approved lenders had reached
$4.4 billion. But, to the same date, the
corporation had on its own account authorized
loans amounting to $1.8 billion, which are
similarly insurable should they be sold to
private investors or come to represent a
claim against the mortgage insurance fund.
There is, therefore, the technical possibilityand perhaps it is more than a technical
possibility-that the corporation's authority
to insure additional loans and to sell mortgages from its direct loan portfolio could be
exhausted in the near future.
The amendments to section 13, increasing
the permissible level of mortgage loan insurance to $8.5 billion, would preclude this
eventuality and provide sufficient insurance
coverage to sustain the anticipated high level
of lending operations during the next three
years.
The situation in regard to funds required
by C.M.H.C. for its wide range of direct

May 25, 1965

lending activities is a matter of some urgency.
Loan advances and commitments by the
corporation now stand at approximately $2.3
billion, just $200 million short of the present
statutory limit. The current rate of lending
of this nature, which will be further accelerated as the new provisions of the act find
their full impact, indicates that the funds
now available will be exhausted in a few
short months. In these circunistances, an additional $750 million has been requested to
bolster the financial resources for this vital
program, raising the over-all limitation to
$3.25 billion.
Honourable senators, the amendments now
before us deal solely with the increased
monetary commitments to support existing
facilities afforded through the National
Housing Act. There is no new policy involved.
These amendments have become necessary
because, as I said at the outset, of the high
demand for funds which has stemmed from
the recent amendments to the act.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Have you added them
up to see how much they come to?
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): These
are not the expenditures. These are the
authorizations to insure loans and to lend
money to persons, corporations, organizations,
provincial governments and municipalities,
all of which will be expected to pay back
their loans.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I should
like to refer very briefly indeed to an aspect
of housing that has not, I believe, received
the attention it justly deserves, namely, the
impact of housing on the economy of this
country. Since World War II there have been
over 2,100,000 houses started in Canada. In
the short period of 20 years we have doubled
our housing stock. These dwellings have
provided accommodation for seven million
people or, to put it more graphically, accommodation for more than the combined
populations of Greater Montreal, Greater
Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Hamilton and Halifax. These houses represent
an astonishing total investment of more than
$23 billion.
In recent years housing has represented
close to one-fifth of all our public and private
investment. In the past year there were
166,000 housing starts, and 151,000 completions, which was an increase of 18 per cent
over 1963. At year end there were 108,000
houses under construction. These record figures reflect the effect of a booming national
economy coupled with the incentives of lower

May 25, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

interest rates and lower down payments,
and they will be further enhanced by the
recent increase in the maximum N.H.A. loan
from $15,000 to $18,000. The $500 bonus for
winter house building during the past winter
season stimulated the construction of 35,000
homes, providing thousands of jobs during
a period which in the past was one of high
rate layoff s.
On the basis of the Economic Council's
report, which holds forth the prospect of a
housing program in the vicinity of 190,000
units by 1970, the future for the industry,
for employment and for the economy, augurs
well indeed.
As population grows, as its age structure
changes, as family and non-family formation
increases, as immigration rises, as replacement of our worn out housing stock goes
inexorably on, the demand for accommodation stimulates the whole housing industry.
It means vast urban renewal programs to
rid us of congestion in the built-up centres
of our cities, more low-rental projects for
our low income families, new subdivisions,
new streets and services, new schools,
churches and shopping centres.
It is also important to point out the added
economic effect-a significant effect-of the
rapidly increasing associated demands for
household appliances, furniture, rugs and
drapes, as well as for transportation and
service facilities.
Honourable senators, for the social reasons,
which were so well stated a few years ago
by the late Senator Hawkins, as well as for
the economic effects which I have just outlined, the early passage of this bill is most
desirable. It will ensure that Canada's
booming housing industry and urban renewal
program will not be in danger of being slowed
down because of lack of availability of federal
funds.
If Bill C-104 receives second reading, it is
my intention to move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce for full consideration.
Hon. Malcolm Holleft: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to delay the proceedings
of the house for long on these amendments,
because they have already been so well
explained by the sponsor, the honourable
Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne).
As a matter of fact, if the honourable Senator Brooks were here this evening I think I
would have refrained from saying anything
at all on the proposed amendments, but since
22624-9j

he is not here, perhaps I would be remiss
if I did not say a few words.
I have endeavoured to follow to some extent
the comments made on this legislation by
various members in the other place, and it is
my opinion that practically every member
on both sides of that house is agreed, not
only with the principle but with the various
amendments now being made.
As pointed out by the minister-the
Honourable Mr. Nicholson-this legislation is
simply for replenishment of the exchequer of
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. As honourable senators will note from
the bill, and also from the resolution as it
was proposed in the other place, there are
five changes being made. These have already
been pointed out by the mover of the bill
(Hon. Mr. Smith, Queens-Shelburne) on
second reading.
It will be noted that when the National
Housing Act was passed in 1954, the aggregate
amount of all loans in respect of which
insurance policies could be issued was not to
exceed $2 billion. I think we may safely come
to the conclusion that as Canada grows it
will become necessary for the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation to have more
funds.
In later years the amount of $2 billion was
raised to $6 billion, and the present amendment sets the limit at $8j billion. Honourable
senators will note, therefore, that Canada as
a nation is growing, despite the fact that
there might be disagreement in various parts
of the nation. The growth is evidenced by
these figures.
For the purpose of making direct oans to
borrowers to assist in the erection of houses
and housing projects, the limit set in 1954 was
$250 million. This was later amended to $2j
billion. The present bill will raise the amount
to $31 billion.
Under the original bill of 1954, the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation could
make loans and grants relating to urban
renewal schemes and for urban redevelopment to the amount of $20 million, which was
later raised to $100 million. Under this bill,
the amount will be raised to $300 million.
With regard to public housing projects
which could be developed jointly by Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation and any
one province or agent thereof, the amount
available under the act of 1954 was only $5
million. This was later raised to $50 million.
The bill now before us increases the amount
to $150 million.

SENATE DEBATES
It will be noted that in 1954 the amount
made available to the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation for the purpose of making loans to university housing projects was
only $50 million, which was later raised to
$150 million. Under the present bill, the
amount will be increased to $200 million.
It will be seen, therefore, that the extent
to which the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation has been able to assist in housing generally, and particularly with regard
to university grants or loans and to the
:amounts of loans which may be insured, has
been considerably increased.
When we look back at the wonderful work
which has been performed by this public
corporation, we realize why there bas been
no opposition to any particular section of this
amendment. I am sure we all agree that
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
has done and is doing an excellent job relative not only to general housing throughout
Canada, but to particular areas in large centres and cities which, for reasons best known
to people who live in those areas, have degenerated into what are commonly known
as "slum" areas.
Personally, I wish to compliment the Government on bringing in these amendments to
the National Housing Act. It is not often I
compliment the Government, but in this instance I do. These amendments are absolutely
essential and are a step in the right direction.
I made some inquiries at the office of the
minister under whom Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation is listed, with regard
to the extent to which that corporation bas
assisted in my own Province of Newfoundland. Here I want to pay tribute to Mr. Fitzpatrick, the executive assistant, who very
kindly gave me many details relative to the
work of the corporation in Newfoundland.
With regard to private house construction, I
am advised that housing starts in the urban
centres in Newfoundland have improved
remarkably over last year. Housing starts
number 129 from January to April of 1965,
which is more than 100 per cent higher than
for the same period last year, and that was
more or less for the winter period. National
Housing Act loans have risen 80 per cent
during the same period up to 54 units as compared to 30 units last year.
Furthermore, the federal Government and
our provincial government have announced a
Housing Design Competition for the development of 47 single family residential lots in the
St. John's 1200-lot land assembly project. This
competition is open to bouse builders through-

May 25, 1965

out Canada and, I have been informed, has
been undertaken to encourage the development of new housing designs and for the introduction of new design techniques in low
and medium-cost housing in the area.
Specifically, may I say that in Clarenville,
which is a small town in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland-and we have lots of small settlements in Newfoundland which need assistance
from this corporation-a study is being made
to work out an over-all small town plan and
to introduce concepts and methods of community planning in a manner which it is
hoped will encourage other small communities, not only in Newfoundland but throughout Canada, to consider the plans which will
be formulated as a result of this study. The
costs of this study are being shared equally
with the federal and provincial governments.
I am sure that about 90 per cent of honourable senators here, in looking back at their
younger days, will wonder how in the world
our parents ever managed to build houses,
ever managed to send some of their children
to school, and so on. How our parents managed to build houses, educate their children
and do many other things is hard to understand, but they did it without any government
help at all.
Canada is growing and I hope it is growing
in the right direction. The only fear some of
us have is that governments may be helping
us a little too much. I am wondering what
effect such help will have later on the
make-up of our young people.
The final report of the urban renewal study
for the Town of Grand Falls and Windsor, in
the centre of Newfoundland, has now been
practically completed by the planning consultants. It is hoped to table these plans to
the municipalities within the next few
months. Incidentally, Windsor was recently a
suburb of the Grand Falls area, which was the
centre of paper-making originally in Newfoundland, and the Town of Grand Falls,
which is one of our finest towns in the interior, had its beginning around the turn of
the century. Honourable senators will pardon
me for making a reference to my own province, but I like to do this occasionally.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is
very interesting.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: St. John's, the capital,
was the first capital on this side of the Atlantic, as far as I know. We are the oldest town.
I was not born there but I know a lot about it.

May 25, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

In St. John's, the urban renewal scheme is
being worked out for the Mundy Pond area.
This particular area was built up in the past
with absolutely no plans whatsoever, and
could be called a sprawling area. The whole
idea of this scheme is to improve housing
conditions through a program of municipal
works and services in this 300-acre suburban
area of the capital city. In this case also the
federal and provincial governments shared
the planning costs.
A similar program of neighbourhood improvement was undertaken in what is known
as the Blackhead Road area and in other
suburban areas.
Mr. Fitzpatrick has informed me that the
federal and provincial governments have now
completed an investigation of the need for a
program of 1,000 low rental housing units in
St. John's and, as a result, over 200 of these
housing units, costing more than $3,500,000,
are to be built on 17 acres of the former
Buckmaster's Field Military Base in the heart
of downtown St. John's. I am sure every
senator here bas heard of the famous Buckmaster's Field, where so many of our men
and of our Canadian boys trained for overseas. These units will offer all forms of
housing accommodation for low income
families in the city, with rents which are to
be geared to the incomes of the tenants. The
project costs are being shared-75 per cent
by the federal Government and 25 per cent
by the provincial government. It is to be
noted that this federal-provincial housing
development is the seventh such similar
project to be undertaken in Newfoundland's
capital.
Other land assembly projects are in process
of development at Gander, which is known
as the crossroads of the world, and in the
Town of Harbour Grace, one of the oldest
towns in the country.
I must admit that I am not the best critic
in the world of this form of legislation, and
particularly with regard to housing; but at
the moment I must say that I approve, of
the amendments which have been made, because this will tend to give large areas all
across Canada improved housing and university grants, and make it possible for many
young people to secure reasonable loans to
build for themselves dwellings which will be
in keeping with the general prosperity of
the nation.
Honourable senators, I pat the Government
on the back for the amendments they have
made here. I am quite sure that the result

will redound to the betterment of thousands
and thousands of our young people all across
this wonderful Canada of ours.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, those of us who have been associated in any way with any Canadian university over the past ten years will commend
the Government for bringing in an amendment to the act which will make available
grants for students' residences. In that respect
I can speak for one university in the Province
of New Brunswick. As we were able to obtain money for residences, this resolved a
very acute problem in the high demand for
such residences.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) will support me, I am quite sure, because he visited
the campus of the University of New Brunswick very recently and he no doubt saw those
beautiful residences which have been erected
there. Several have been completed and more
are going up. This is to meet the demand
for such residences, which has increased at
that institution in the past few years. Theseresidences are urgently needed to house thestudent population. We all commend the
Government very much for this specifie
amendment.
The sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Smith,
Queens-Shelburne) referred to grants for
housing elderly people. That reminded me
that the Anglican Church in the Province of
New Brunswick two years ago studied this
problem and approved a scheme to build
some residences for elderly citizens. The
scheme which was put before the Synod
envisaged a loan from the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation. It was approved,
and land was purchased in the Town of
Sussex. Rather than build individual homes,
it was decided to build a court of apartments for elderly couples. I remember there
was a lot of debate and discussion on this
point. The land was arranged for in the
Town of Sussex at a suitable location. After
the work had been started, it was found that
the best proposition which the C.M.H.C.
could put before them was totally inadequate,
both from the point of view of valuation and
of cost. They had to abandon the C.M.H.C.
plan entirely and rely upon friends and
citizens in the province. I am glad to say
that that assistance was forthcoming and the
scheme is going ahead, but it has had to
be done by private investment.
I did not catch what the honourable sponsor said in relation to making available
grants for apartments or housing for elderly

SENATE DEBATES

couples. I would be glad if, when he is replying ta the debate, he would be good
enough to say if there has been any change
in that respect.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
I wish to join with previous speakers in
praising the provisions of this bill, which
will permit loans to universities to build
student residences. However, I am sure those

the rather unusual wording in clause 1. I
refer to section 13 of the act, as we are
asked to amend it, and in particular the
words "have been issued under this Act".
The new section 13 reads:

respect of which insurance policies have
been issued under this Act shall not exceed eight and one-half billion dollars.

May 25, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

When the bill was first introduced, if I
remember correctly, Mr. Mansur was head
of Central Mortgage and Housing and the
project was limited very much to the idea of
supplying housing required in urban centres
and in developing parts of this country in
adjoining areas through the co-operation of
provincial governments. There was a limitation on the amount of capital that would be
invested in the project, and I remember very
clearly the late Senator Wall coming before
this bouse and protesting vigorously that the
committee had not approved the recommendations made to it by certain interests for the
building of residences for university students.
I wonder if Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne) could throw some light upon the
change which has occurred in this trend, and
just why the position taken earlier bas been
altered in favour of wholesale approval of
extension of university residences. The demand for higher education, of course, has
been given considerable momentum, and has
possibly resulted in the provision here for
the increase in the residence facilities at
universities, but that is not the complete
answer. We should be given more information
on that point in committee.
Another question I wish to ask is this: What
percentage of the housing being undertaken
by the Government-sponsored Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation is occupied and
what percentage is unoccupied? Is this a
measure which bas tended to benefit the contracting industry and the people building
houses instead of the sound economic condition of the country? Is it simply a measure to
provide employment for unemployed people?
We should have a clear understanding of the
measure from that point of view, and we
should ascertain whether, rather than satisfying a so-called social need, it is economically
and financially as sound as it should be.
In the past we have also asked in connection with this kind of legislation to what
extent the mortgages on these new bouses
have been foreclosed. If I recall correctly the
evidence given before the last committee
meeting, a very small percentage have
been foreclosed. However, with this rapid
expansion and increase in capital devoted to
this question, I think it is very important we
should also know something about the solvency of the organization and the possibility
of our overdoing the building in proportion
to the ability to finance and pay for it. The
extent to which this huge undertaking has
expanded is certainly one of the definite and
undeniable evidences that the state is one of

the biggest factors in our whole economy in
relation to the policy of building houses. And
this trend is probably reflected in many other
ways, identified with an ideology which many
of us have not accepted as to the be-all and
end-all of the purposes of government.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I had not intended to participate in this
debate, but I want to assure Senator Lambert
on the basis of our experience at the University of Alberta, where we have spent $7 million on the Edmonton campus, and are in the
process of spending $5 million on the Calgary
campus, that the results have been very satisfactory. The percentage of occupancy during
the year is very high in terms of the number of room days per year. Unfortunately, I
do not have the exact figures with me. That
is one very important factor, but a second
important factor is as to whether or not the
buildings are self-liquidating. There is no
question about this on the basis of the fees
charged.
Another important factor is the effect on
the students' morale. I think the university
today is much better than it was in the years
before we had these residences. As a matter
of fact, had it not been for the building of
these residences, the situation as far as the
housing of students in many university cities
was concerned would have resulted in absolute chaos.
As far as I am concerned, this is a fine
piece of legislation, and I am sure no one is
questioning that. I think you need have no
fears concerning the solvency of the project.
It has been an excellent development, and
despite the spectacular growth of university
residences across Canada today, we are still
going to be short of residential rooms to take
care of the new enrolments in the universities.
The Hon. the Speaker: Are there any other
questions? If the honourable Senator Smith
(Queens-Shelburne) speaks now, it will have
the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to take very much of your
time. I am not entirely familiar with the
operations of the act. Perhaps most of the
questions that have been asked could very
weil be asked at the meeting of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, which
I understand may already have been arranged
for tomorrow morning, subject to a motion
which I shall make at a later stage.
I want to thank Senator Cameron for his
participation in the debate to answer one of

SENATE DEBATES
the questions with regard to the university
residence problem.
Senator Lambert's opportunity to have an
adequate review of both the policies and
operations of the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation, and, indeed, of the
National Housing Act, will be wide open at
the meeting of the Banking and Commerce
Committee. I do not think I would care
to discuss, as it were, which comes first,
the chicken or the egg.
There is the intention of providing homes
for people who need assistance in obtaining
homes; there is the very good intention also
of facilitating the borrowing of money for
those who want to provide their own homes;
and the equally good intention of assisting in
clearing out slum areas and redeveloping
them. All this has a terrific economic effect
on Canada as a whole. I suppose we could
justify it on economic grounds alone. I think
we could justify it on grounds that it is something which should be done, whether or not
it is a good thing in so far as the stimulation
of the housing and associated industries is
concerned.
I understand the minister who is responsible for reporting on housing to Parliament
will be present at the meeting tomorrow morning, and that is why I said matters of policy
could be discussed then. Also officials of the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
will be present to answer any questions about
their operations.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Could I ask the honourable senator a question? Why should not this
bill be referred to the Finance Committee?
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): It is
going to be.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I thought you said the
Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): I beg
your pardon. The reason I suggested that it
should go to the Banking and Commerce Committee was that this is the committee bills
of this sort usually go to, and also I understand that the Finance Committee agenda
is completely filled up for the next month.
The agenda has been set for about four weeks
ahead, and I doubt if that committeee would
want to interrupt its agenda.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The reason I rose to mention this question was that I was responsible
in 1958 for moving the motion to refer the
report of the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation to the Finance Comnittee for
complete investigation. I think that is what

May 25, 1965

Senator Lambert had in mind. It would be
a good thing if this whole matter could
again be investigated by the Finance Committee, just as it was in 1958.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Well,
I do not really mind which committee it
goes to. Actually, I would have some preference for it going to the Finance Committee
too, in view of the history my friend has
brought to our attention. However, as I
said, the commitments and agenda of the
Finance Committee are such that, without
the chairman of that committee being present
for an immediate consultation, I doubt
whether at this late stage it would be practical to make any arrangement other than to
refer it to the Banking and Commerce Committee. Of course, we are all in the hands
of the Chamber and it would depend on
what the majority wish to do. I would move
whatever motion would appeal to most honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I suggest to my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that there is a good reason why this
particular bill should go to the Banking and
Commerce Committee. It is because that
committee is sitting tomorrow morning to
consider Bill S-8 which we considered a few
days ago, and it could at the same meeting
consider Bill C-104. It would seem only
logical that these two bills should be considered by the same committee.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Senator Burchill raised the question of assistance for building homes for the elderly. I
am not familiar with the particular project
he mentioned, but I am wondering whether
it was a project which commenced after the
latest amendments to the Act which came
into effect only last June, and whether or
not the techniques which would be employed
under the authority of those amendments of
less than a year ago would have been
developed to a point where they could fit
into the particular project that he has in
mind. But I am sure that all his questions
can be answered at the meeting of the committee, whichever one it might be.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
undertake to discuss the semantics or legal
meanings of certain words in the sections
which were pointed out to me by Senator
Grosart. It is my understanding with regard
to the first section of the bill that only those
words which are underlined are new, the
others being identical with the wording in

COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS
COMMITTEE EMPOWERED TO MAKE INQUIRY

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, May
19, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson:
That the Standing Committee on External Relations be authorized to inquire
into the question of Commonwealth relationships with particular reference to
the position of Canada within the Commonwealth;

That the Committee have power to
send for persons, papers and records, and
to sit during sittings and adjournments of
the Senate; and

That the Committee be instructed to
report to the House from time to time.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, first I should say that we are all, as we
should be, indebted to Senator Thorvaldson,
the Chairman of the External Relations Committee of this house, for having brought this
motion before us.
The motion proposes action which is more
than debate. The House of Lords adopts a
procedure somewhat similar to this when it
moves for papers, and thus brings about a
debate which usually lasts for all of one of

May 25, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

its sittings. Debates generated in this way
deal with specific problems of current national importance. What Senator Thorvaldson
wants is more than simply a debate of that
kind. He is proposing a debate in the Senate,
plus a study in depth by one of our standing
committees; a study that involves the appearance of witnesses, the preparation of
briefs and papers, the posing of questions by
members of the committee and by other
honourable senators who choose to attend
the committee meetings. He hopes in this
way to develop thoughts and suggestions
which can be embodied in a useful report.
In this respect, the work proposed for this
committee is similar to the work undertaken
in another field by the Special Committee
on Aging. Indeed, it resembles the work done
by the Special Committee on Manpower and
Employment a few years ago. The committee
is likely to sit for some time. Of course, at
one of its first meetings Senator Thorvaldson
will be organizing a steering committee whose
function it will be to direct the discussions.
I say this because I know from personal
experience that Senator Thorvaldson, like
all assiduous committee chairmen, has already
done much work. He has had discussions and
correspondence with officials of the Canadian
Institute of International Affairs. There have
been discussions with the minister, with
officials of the Department of External Affairs,
including the head of the Commonwealth Division. He has already been engaged in a
great deal of other preparatory administrative work, but the bulk of the work, which
is still to be faced, will be performed by the
committee working with the material that is
brought before it.
No one, and least of all Senator Thorvaldson, claims the committee is going to solve
all the problems of the Commonwealth. That
would be a task beyond the reach of any
human group today. However, the committee
will be able to bring many of the important
problems into focus. For example, it may be
able to answer such questions as: What is
the position of the Commonwealth in the world
of the West? What is the position of the
Commonwealth in respect to blocs and groups
which are developing, economically and
otherwise, in various parts of the world? What
is the position of Commonwealth members
in respect to each other?
At this time it may be useful to recall some
of the ideas that were suggested about the
Commonwealth when it was established-as
it really was established-at the time of the
passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.
22624-10&

The report of the Inter-Imperial Relations
Committee of 1926 spoke about self-governing
communities composed of Great Britain and
the dominions in these words:
They are autonomous communities
within the British Empire, equal in
status, in no way subordinate one to
another in any aspect of their domestic or
internal affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely
associated as members of the British
Commonwealth.
These phrases are familiar to all of us.
That committee said, too, that the purpose
of establishing the Commonwealth was to
make mutual interference impossible, and
mutual co-operation easy.
Indeed, the preamble to the Statute of
Westminster reads-and I quote only a few
words:
... as the Crown is the symbol of the

free association of the members of the
British Commonwealth of Nations, and
as they are united by a common ailegiance to the Crown ...

Even Chapter 9 of the Statutes of 1952-53,
which is the Canadian Act in respect of the
Royal titles, has this to say:
The assent of the Parliament of Canada is hereby given to the issue by Her
Majesty of Her Royal Proclamation under
the Great Seal of Canada establishing
for Canada the following Royal Style
and Titles, namely,
"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of
God of the United Kingdom, Canada and
Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of
the Faith."
Just last week a member of parliament from
one of the new African countries was visiting
Ottawa, and he said: "We do not recognize
the Queen as the head of our state. The idea
of a common allegiance to the Crown, in
many respects, has been diluted. We recognize the Queen as the Head of the Commonwealth." That is one of the Royal titles, and
perhaps that is the only one that that country
recognizes. These developments have been
going on apace for a little over two decades,
and perhaps it is high time that we had an
opportunity of considering what they can
mean for the Commonwealth and for our own
country.
I know there is deep interest in this subject. Senator Roebuck and Senator Grosart
returned recently from the Commonwealth

SENATE DEBATES

May 25, 1965

At this time I think it worth while to repeat something that Sir Winston Churchill
said to the Council of Europe when it was
being organized in 1950, because these words
are applicable to the Commonwealth of
today:
In setting up the Council of Europe we
are not making a machine, but growing a living plant.
A living plant in the ramifications of its
growth can stretch out in various ways, depending upon where the sun is, depending
upon where the rain comes from, and indeed
upon which way the wind blows. These are
things which I think this committee can do,
and do very well.
Senator O'Leary (Carleton) also said that
the terms of reference were too wide. Let
me say, and I do not say so critically or
harshly, that the terms of reference could
have been considerably wider. At one time
there was a device employed-and Senator
Aseltine will remember it very well-by
which certain segments of the Estimates
were referred to various committees of this
chamber. In this instance, had it been so
decided, we could have referred the Estimates
of the Department of External Affairs to this
committee. That would have given a wide
open opportunity to discuss the Commonwealth and almost anything that might
engage the attention of that department.
I do not think the terms of reference are
as wide as those already given to the Finance
Committee, because that committee has before it the entire Estimates of the Government for the current fiscal year.
In effect, what will happen is that the
chairman of the External Relations Committee, and his steering committee, will sit down
and organize a program for the initial work
of the committee. They will set the areas for
study and for consultation with persons with
whom they can consult within the department, and perhaps the Canadian Institute

the days of Senator Meighen. In this respect,
Parliamentary Association meeting in Jamaica
with some interesting things to tell us about
Commonwealth affairs. Just a few years ago
there was a meeting of the Commonwealth
Bar Association here in Ottawa. The chief
British delegate was the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir. I had a good deal to
do with the organization of that meeting, and
thus had an opportunity to talk to Lord
Kilmuir, who is one of the most experienced
men in British public life. He has been the
Attorney General, the Solicitor General and,
of course, the Lord Chancellor. His concern
about what direction the Commonwealth
would take in the years ahead with the
emergence of these new countries was very
great, but he did not pretend to predict
what might happen. These are matters, I
submit, in respect of which the Senate, by
providing a forum, can perform a national
and perhaps a Commonwealth service.
- Senator O'Leary (Carleton) is concerned
about the committee indulging in an exercise
in futility. His own speech, I think, indicates
the range of the problems which confront us.
For example, as he said we must know what
it is, in respect of the Commonwealth, that
we believe in. We must know what it is we
are supporting. If Senator Thorvaldson
through his committee can provide some answers along that line then he will be performing a service. These new countries are with
us, and we want to know what they are and
what their problems are. What about Ghana?
What about Mr. Nkrumah? Just because we
do not like him, or do not approve of the
methods he employs, is no reason why we
should not be associating with him. We associate in the United Nations with many people
that we do not particularly like, but it is useful for them to be in association with us.
In just the same way it may be helpful to
the people of Ghana that Mr. Nkrumah
should attend the meetings of Commonwealth
Prime Ministers, and that Ghana itself should
be a member of the Commonwealth.

perhaps bis background is unsurpassed in
tbis bouse, and I hope, for the benefit of us
ail, tbat his advice and bis attendance will
be available to this committee.
There is one other matter I should like to
deal with because it affects perhaps the
privileges of ail honourable senators. It is
the reference in Senator O'Leary's speech to
questions asked of me by Senator White on
various supply bis in the last session of
Parliament. I want to relate to tbe Senate
that I followed tbe time-bonoured practice of
getting the answers which were not available at the tîme. Every bonourable senator
will understand tbat it is impossible to bave
answers available on every detail of a financial bull on the evening that the bull is
bel are us. Tbese supply bis have to be
passed, and we just -do not adjourn the debate in order to get answers to questions.
However, wben tbe questions are asked, the
leader custamarily undertakes to provide the
questioner with tbe answers at tbe earliest
opportunity.
Senator Wbite's questions dealt particuiarly
witb tbe peace-keeping operations Canada is
conducting in various parts of tbe world. I
foliowed the practice that bas been generally
observed, aithough I do say tbat Senator
Aseitine, when answers were made available
ta the leader, tabied tbemn an occasion. However, I believe the general practice bas been
to give the written answers ta the senator
who asked the questions. This I did with
Senator Wbite. Subsequently, be followed
up with suppiementary questions, and again
I provided tbe information.
Senator White, if be bad wisbed ta do so,
could have put the answers on Hansard, or
asked me ta table tbemn. However, I want ta
say tbat I aiso spoke ta Senator White, before
Senator O'Leary raised the question, about
whetber or flot tbere shouid be wider communication of the answers ta tbe questions
be asked. I said ta hlm, as I say now ta al
bonourable senators, we have ail the estimates
before tbe Finance Committe. The answers
can be elicited at that cammittee, if it us Sa
desired.
I spoke ta. Senatar Tborvaldson weeks ago,
when we were discussing the subi ect matter
of this very motion, and I suggested that be
might cansider devoting a sitting or two of
bis committee ta consideration of tbe peacekeeping operations about wbich Senator
White was concerned.
Therefore, honourable senators, perhaps
througb the Externai Relations Committee or
thraugh tbe Finance Committee, bath of

wbich are now ready ta go ta work, tbe
answers ta these questions which Senator
Wbite was seeklng could not only be supplied again ta the entire committee, but might
afford an opportunity for further discussion,
if any honourable senators wish ta discuss
any of them.
Honourable senatars, I have detained you
tao long. Ini concluding, 1 want ta cammend
Senator Thorvaldson for the work he proposes ta do in this study. He does flot intend
ta write an encyciopedia on what the Commonwealth means, and what it will do for ail
time, but by setting up the cammittee in the
manner in whicb be proposes ta study this
particular problem, I tbink he is doing a
service to Parliament and ta the country, and
it may very well turn aut to be a service
ta the Commonwealth as well.
Mon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Hanourabie
senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Hanaurable senators, may I remind the bouse that if thé
honourable Senator
Tharvaldson speaks
naw, it will bave the effect of closing the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Tharvaldsan: Honaurable senators, I propose ta make just a few remarks
in regard ta the resolution we are discussinig.
Indeed, it had been my intention ta summarize in some fashion the proposais that
will be presented to this committee upori
which a study is to be made. However, that
is reaily unnecessary now because the honaurable leader af the Government (Hon. Mr.
Cannaliy) bas already done so in bis customary and capable manner.
I tbank the bonourable leader particularly
for the highly constructive and ca-operative
manner in wbicb he bas dealt with tbe work
that is propased ta be done by this cornmittee. I also wish ta thank banourable senators wbo have spoken an theresolution, inciuding Senator Roebuck
and Senator
O'Leary of Canleton. Their contributions
have been very constructive.
In reference ta the cansiderable newspaper comment tbat bas appeared throughout Canada in connection with this resolution, I think I can say that ail af it bas
been cautiousiy friendly ta the study. I shall
quate just one sentence from an editoniai
appearing in the Winnipeg Tribune a few
days aga. The editorial concluded with these
words:
A study of this kind could perform a
very useful functian not oniy in maklng
accurate information available but aiso

May 25, 1965

SENATE DEBATES
in refocusing attention on the values the
Commonwealth embodies.
Generally speaking, the comments of the
press have been in this vein.
As the honourable leader of this house
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) indicated, it is not proposed to do anything revolutionary in this
study. The fact remains, however, that apart
from our peculiarly close association with
the United States as our next-door neighbour and as our biggest trading partner,
Canada's closest international association is
with the nations of the Commonwealth. Con:sequently, it appealed to me as well as to
-others that a study of this kind could be
useful.
It was suggested, by both Senator Roebuck
and Senator O'Leary (Carleton), that perhaps the terms of reference contained in the
resolution were too broad. That may be so,
but they were intentionally made broad in
others that a study of this kind could be
duly restricted.
On the other hand, Senator Roebuck was
most useful in pinpointing some of the
spheres where the committee might begin.
He emphasized, for instance, trade within
the Commonwealth, and financial, medical
and educational aid.
As we all know, Canada is spending large
amounts of money today in aid to Commonwealth countries, as well as to other countries, under the Colombo Plan and other aid
plans.
Senator Roebuck referred to immigration.
I thank him for pointing these items out as
subjects of discussion for the committee.
Senator O'Leary (Carleton), too, agreed
that we should take a "good, fresh look"
at the Commonwealth.
As the honourable Leader of the Government has just said, the basis of the present
Commonwealth is the Statute of Westminster
passed in 1931, resulting from conferences
beld in the years 1921 and 1926. Then, there
was another fresh look at the Commonwealth in 1946 when there was a changed
status in respect of India and Pakistan, resulting in separate Statutes of the Imperial
Parliament in regard to those countries' entry into the Commonwealth, similar to the
Statute of Westminster.
For instance, Senator O'Leary (Carleton)
asked what the Commonwealth is as of today.
That is a pertinent question indeed. At the
moment I find it difficult to answer it, but
I trust that as a result of the work of this
committee we may come closer to an answer

as to what the Commonwealth is and consists of and where it is going.
Senator O'Leary posed another question
when he asked what the qualifications or
tests are for membership. He also asked about
the nature of the secretariat which is being
established.
Honourable senators, this morning on the
C.B.C. commentary after the eight o'clock
news, a speaker commented on the coming
Prime Ministers' Commonwealth Conference
which is to be held in London and which
will, of course, be attended by our own Prime
Minister as one of the main actors at that
conference. The commentator posed this question: What is this Commonwealth secretariat
which it is proposed to establish at the coming
meeting? He mentioned the fact that we have
had a certain type of secretariat for many
years, but that secretariat had in fact been
the British Commonwealth Relations Office in
London. It has done the work of a secretariat,
but it has been entirely under the guidance
of the British Government, and other Commonwealth countries have had very little to
do with the guidance issued from that office.
Senator O'Leary (Carleton) also asked, as
the honourable Leader of the Government
mentioned a few moments ago, what about
countries like Ghana, Rhodesia and Kenya
and what are or should be their relations to
the Commonwealth.
Honourable senators, both Senator Roebuck
and Senator O'Leary (Carleton) have performed a most useful service for the committee by defining some of the items with
which it must come to grips. I hope that all
honourable senators will co-operate in the
work of the committee, in order that the
result of its effort will be of some value
to both Canada and the Commonwealth.
Motion agreed to.

some difficulty hearing what was said in the

given to the amplification system. I inquired
about this matter and I have received a report
from the Assistant Gentleman Usher of the

The volume is presently at the highest
possible pitch. Should the volume be increased, the sound will reverberate on
the side walls and be distorted and cause
feed-back.

Motion agreed to.
RETIREMENT OF SENATORS

BILL

SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
20, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. John J. Connolly for the second reading of Bill C-98, to make provision for the
retirement of members of the Senate.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
in orderThe Hon. the Speaker: Order. I understand that the debate was adjourned by the
honourable Senator Macdonald (Cape Breton).
I assume that the honourable Senator Flynn
has leave to proceed.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, in
order to fully experiment with our system of
amplification and our system of translation,
I am going to speak in French on this bill.
[Translation]
The Government Leader is entitled to our
thanks and our congratulations for the manner in which he recited the clauses of Bill
C-98, an Act to make provision for the
retirement of members of the Senate. His
explanations were short and to the point,
perhaps shorter than usual, but that could
be because he wanted to be quite objective,
which is no easy matter for senators discussing a bill making provision for their own
retirement. I noticed that the Government
Leader refrained from making any comments.
His statement was so dry as to be almost
disarming. It was probably his intention to
disarm members of the Senate faced with
this legislation.
[Text]
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): As long
as you are not imputing motives.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not wrong motives.
[Translation]
The principle of this bill obviously is nothing new; indeed, when the Parliament of
Canada decided to force the judges to retire
at 75, it was unavoidable that the same rule
would be applied sooner or later to the
Senate.
Therefore, Bill C-98 proposes, in the first
place, that a senator summoned to the Senate
after the coming into force of this act will

stay in office until he reaches 75 years of age.
This is the prime rule, the basic principle
of this bill.
Two accessory or secondary principles apply
to senators who were appointed before this
act comes into force, that is, the present
senators appointed under a provision which
states that a senator shall hold his appointment in the Senate for life. It had to be
decided if those senators should retire at age
75, and then under what conditions should a
person appointed for life continue, or cease, to
hold his seat in the Senate? The act hd to
stipulate the system, as it were, and the
specific conditions applying to a senator appointed under the provisions of the new act
and who must retire at the age of 75, or to
those who were appointed before the coming
into force of this act and who were not
compelled, when they were appointed, to
retire at that age.
I do not think the basic principle of retirement at 75 for senators will meet with much
opposition. The main problem raised by this
bill lies in the conditions attached to the
retirement of senators.
As for those who will be appointed after the
coming into force of the act, I do not see any
problem since it bas been mentioned that the
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances
Act will also apply to them. This act provides for an annual contribution of 6 per cent
of the indemnity, or $720 per year, which,
after three parliaments, entitles or will entitle members of parliament and senators to
an annuity equal to 5 times their contribution, or $300 for each year of service. In
principle, since there might be three parliaments in three years' time, it could happen
that a senator or a member of parliament
would get a $900 annuity.
But, in practice, and in the normal order
of things, three parliaments usually last 9 or
10 years.
Therefore, there is nothing to say against
the pension scheme provided for senators
appointed after the coming into force of this
new legislation.
As I say, the problem is in connection with
the terms proposed, or suggested, by this
legislation in regard to the present members
of this Chamber.
Before making any comments on them, I
would like to say that, in my opinion, the
bill bas very little to do with what is called
the reform of the Senate. There is nothing
surprising of course in the fact that the other
place as well as the press and public opinion
in general took this opportunity to start a

SENATE DEBATES
debate on this so-called reform of the Senate
or on certain changes in the part played by
the Senate. However, as far as I am concerned, it seems that this matter has nothing
whatever to do with the bill we are considering today. I think it would be more
advantageous for the Senate, and therefore
for the country, to discuss that matter on
another occasion when we have all the time
in the world to go to the heart of it.
A second preliminary remark I wish to
make on this bill with regard to the principle
of retirement at age 75 is that clause 2 of the
bill involves an amendment to the BNA Act,
that is, an amendment to the Constitution. I
think that the legal advisers of the Government were right to advise it as I presume
they did, to the effect that the 1949 amendment to subsection 1 of section 91 permits that
change in the Constitution without the formal
agreement of the provinces. At any rate, as
the provinces have voiced no objection, I
think that the debate would be very academic
as to whether, in order to pass this amendment to the Constitution, it is necessary to
obtain the consent of the provinces and the
assent of the British Parliament. In view of
all the circumstances, I am sure that the
Parliament of Canada can legislate in that
respect without the authorization of the provincial legislatures or that of the Parliament
of Westminster.
A while ago, I mentioned the conditions
under which senators appointed after the
coming into force of this bill will be allowed
to retire. As far as present senators are concerned, I should like to remind my honourable colleagues that the first draft or the first
bill, if you prefer, the one which was read a
first time in the other place, provided for a
rather simple method, one which was much
simpler than the method outlined in this
legislation.
First of all, unless I am mistaken, present
incumbents would not have been free to
choose whether or not they should take
advantage of the Members of Parliament
Retiring Allowances Act.
Secondly, there was no question of paying
a contribution of 6 per cent of the indemnity
and the reasoning was merely that the senators reaching the age of 75 or the senators
suffering from some disability that would
prevent them from fulfilling their normal
duties will be able to resign. Then, the
Governor in Council will pay them an annuity
equal to two-thirds of their allowance, namely
$8,000. Moreover, upon the death of the

May 26, 1965

senator to whom an allowance was paid, the
widow will be entitled to one-third of this
annuity, namely $2,666 per year. No time limit
was set as regards the decision concerning the
retirement at age 75. The grudge one could
have against this formula or against these
conditions, as written in the first bill, was that
those conditions were exclusively intended
to urge them to retire as soon as possible.
The fundamental error or, if you wish, the
main argument in favour of retirement was
and is, as pointed out by the Leader of the
Government when he introduced his bill, that
there were no survival benefits at that time
and that there is no question of having any
now. But, on the other hand, according to
the original version, senators were not to
contribute. It was rather difficult for a senator to complain that no pension or indemnity
were provided for the wife in case of death,
except after retiring at 75 years or for reasons
of invalidity, as he did not contribute.
We know that amendments were made to
the effect that, first, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act would apply
and, second, that a senator choosing to come
under Part 3 of the act would pay an annual
contribution of $720 or 6 per cent of his
indemnity. Furthermore, the senator would
only have one year after the coming into force
of the act, if he is already 75 years of age, or
one year from the date he reaches his 75th
anniversary, to decide whether or not to
retire with an annual pension of $8,000.
Now, 'considering these terms as amended
in the other place, we realize that the prospects of present senators must be divided
in two, the prospects of senators 65 years
or more and of those who are less than 65
years of age. I would then subdivide in two
the prospects of those who are 65 years or
more: those who have already reached 75
years of age and those who have not yet
reached 75 but who have nevertheless attained
65 years. The reason is that I think the right
to avail ourselves of the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act cannot offer
any advantage to senators aged 65 and over.
As I indicated a while ago, in order to
obtain an annuity under the act now in force
in the other place and which will apply to
the senators appointed after this bill comes
into force, and in order to receive an annuity
under that legislation, one must have contributed during three parliaments. It is clear
that under normal circumstances, the member of this chamber who is 70 cannot anticipate contributing during three parliaments.

May 26, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

The senator who is 65 might do it, but what
will the Members of Parliament Retiring
Allowances Act give him then? That act will
give him a $3,000 annuity, while if he chooses
to remain under Part III and if he lives until
he is 75 or until he becomes handicappedthat is stupid, but that is what is proposed by
the legislation-he will receive $8,000 and
after his death his wife will receive $2,666
annually. Therefore, as far as senators aged 65
and over are concerned, the option to come
under the Members of Parliament Retiring
Allowances Act should not be considered. As
for senators aged 65 or less, they may consider it, but I will say that the choice is
quite impossible and I will show why.
For those aged 65 and over, the problem
as stated is one which can only give them
concern precisely resulting from the fact that
if they die before reaching 75 years of age or
before becoming disabled and offering their
resignation, they will receive nothing in spite
of the fact that they will have contributed
for 10, 15 or 20 years at the rate of $720
per year. How can a senator already appointed decide what is more beneficial to
him or whether he has more chances to become disabled than to die? Such is the problem raised by this bill. Moreover, it is so obvious that I am convinced those amendments
were not thoroughly thought out, that they
were improvised and that when we have the
opportunity to study them, to consider them
in committee, the Government will want to
bring in a remedy. However, remedies are
rather easy to find.
However, I come back to the case of senators aged 75 or over or who will reach that
age soon. If they should die before taking
a decision, there would be nothing for the
widow, nothing at all for the estate, as there
will not be any refund of the contributions
they will make in the meantime. Evidently,
there is there a very strong suggestion: Do
not delay! And if the words are not suggestive enough, I am sure that the wife, in most
cases, will make a definite suggestion. In my
opinion, the present members of the Senate
should not be faced with such a situation.
Now, I take the case of senators who decide to stay. Very well, since you decide
not to retire, says the bill, you will have
to pay $720 a year and you will have
nothing in return-unless you become disabled. In fact, one of the present incumbents who elects to stay will pay, after
reaching 75 years or until he leaves, $720
a year, and he will not be entitled to a re-

fund, to survival benefits for his wife or to
a refund for his estate. Such is the position
of those who are 65 and over. That is a
fact. They would all be in the same situation.
But it is even worse because, normally, they
could remain until they reach the age of 74
years and Il months, contribute $720 a year
during all the time, up to a month before
reaching the age of 75 and, if they were to
die then, there would be no annuity, no survival benefits, no refund. There you have the
conditions offered to present senators of 65
and over, conditions which are absolutely unfair and such as to fill them with anxiety
rather than serenity. And yet, they have no
choice, to all practical purposes; they do not
have the choice that senators of 65 or less
can have and to which I should now like to
refer.
As an introduction, I should like to say that
it is rather unusual to allow senators 65 or
less to take advantage of the Members of
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act but not
to contribute for years of past service in the
House of Commons. I know of a few such
members here, and a detailed ýanalysis of their
cases would show the absurdity of the situation of those senators who have served
nearly thirty years in the other place. I am
not speaking for myself because, as you well
know, my stay in the other place was rather
brief; in fact, I passed like a shooting star
there! Be that as it may, it is unfair to
deny present senators the right to contribute
for years of past service in the lower house.
Senators appointed after this bill comes into
force will be allowed to contribute for years
of service both in the House of Commons and
in the Senate.
What practical choice is offered senators
who are 65 or under? If you contribute for
10 years under the Retiring Allowances Act,
you can count on receiving, as I said, an
annual pension of $3,000, your widow would
receive $1,800, or if, at your death, there is
no one to receive the annual pension, your
contributions will be refunded, without interest. On the other hand, if you take the other
option, which is to remain under part 3 of
the bill, and if you live to 75, a period of
ten years or more, you will then have an
annual pension of $8,000 and if subsequently
you retire, your widow will have a pension
of $2,666, but not before. However, if you die
before that time, all your contributions will
have been made for nothing and your widow
or your estate will not get anything.
Therefore, this comparison shows that it is
more profitable for a senator able to remain

SENATE DEBATES
20 years in the Senate to take advantage of
the Retiring Allowances Act. Yet, he does not
know what might happen to him. If a senator
aged 41, becomes disabled, the following year
he will be entitled to an annual pension of
$8,000, under Part III, whereas if he took advantage of the Retiring Allowances Act, thinking that at 41, he might expect to live another
twenty years, he will not get any pension. His
contributions will be refunded, nothing else.
Of course, these are extreme cases I am
putting forward. But it will be realized that
faced with this option, some senators, for
reasons entirely beyond their control, will not
know whether it would actually be a reasonable or logical decision to take advantage of
this Retiring Allowances Act or to remain under Part III of this bill.
I say once more that the major shortcomings
of this bill lie in the fact that it contains no
provision for a surviving widow's benefits
for present senators as there is for those who
will join us after this bill has come into force.
I am sure that if you submit the pension
conditions put forward here to an actuary for
analysis, you would have the same reaction
as I had to the effect that this is not a plan
that makes sense; the plan does not make any
sense at all. I do not think we can demand
exorbitant conditions.
I am simply asking for logical and reasonable conditions which would put us in a
situation where we could decide advisedly
what to do. In fact, the contribution which
was imposed upon us by way of an amendment becomes simply a tax since the present
senators have not, with regard to that contribution, what is called a "vested interest"
in the fund it will create.
I could read into the record a great number of cases but I will emphasize simply this:
under the third part of the bill, you can contribute for a maximum of 262 years at the
rate of $720 a year, that is $19,000, but
in the event of your death before electing to
go on pension you lose the whole amount,
without any survivor's right to your spouse,
any refund to your estate. I say that this is
completely illogical.
I do not doubt that the Leader of the Government, when this bill is considered in committee, will find a fair solution so the present
senators may retire with dignity and that
no disgraceful pressure will be brought upon
them to compel them to resign under impossible circumstances for most of them.
I do not believe that anyone will object
to the principle of this bill; but if the incidentals are such as to pervert the principle, then

May 26, 1965

it is very difficult for the senatom to pass an
objective opinion on this bill.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Can my honourable colleague make any suggestions in order to orient
the discussion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, I will make some in
committee; I do not wish to waste them!
[Text]
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I have listened with great attention
to the speech of our colleague Senator Flynn,
and I have come to the conclusion that if his
two grandfathers and his father were alive
today they would be proud of him.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: His paternal grandfather
was Premier of the Province of Quebec and
was one of the best professors of Roman law
that we had at the university; and his maternal grandfather was a distinguished lawyer
of St. Hyacinthe. His father was a brilliant
lawyer whom we used to meet quite often.
I knew his family very well.
Believe it or not, it is a strange phenomenon,
but Senator Flynn has said many things that
I wanted to say and which I need not now
repeat. When I read this piece of legislation I
found many difficulties that would arise from
it.
Most journalists do not know the Senate.
Of course there are some laudable exceptions, but in general they speak of the reform of the Senate without knowing what it
really is. It is very easy to be acquainted
with each one of us. One has only to look at
the Canadian Parliamentary Guide and he
will see the biography of each senator. The
Senate is "an exclusive club" if you wish,
but the Senate is not as well known as it
should be; it is not given as much publicity as
the House of Commons. When important matters are discussed in committee the press is
not always represented there.
The Senate can accomplish a lot. There are
two kinds of reform that could be made: one
would be the physical reform of the Senate,
and this bas mostly been done; the other is
the spiritual reform, which is the more important.
What is the physical reform? When I was
appointed to the Senate the air was so thick
and heavy in this chamber that it was impossible to breathe. Then someone suggested
that there should be some ventilation provided. The walls were scraped and cleaned;
the panels were removed to be polished and

May 26, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

the opportunity was taken to install a ventilation system. Now we can breathe in the
Senate.
Secondly, not only were we unable to
breathe, but we could not see in the daytime
as the windows were covered with dark
brown paint. It had to be explained that if
new sheets of glass were put in the windows
the light could come through and we would
have more light in the daytime. At night the
electrie bulbs were very weak. With stronger
bulbs we had more light at night. Therefore,
it was possible to have more light in the daytime and at night.
Then, it was almost impossible to hear what
was said. The acoustics were very bad, as we
were reminded just a few minutes ago. Not
only did we not see the speaker, but we could
not hear what was being said. Therefore, we
had loudspeakers installed and special apparatus was given to us to give us better sound.
Now we can breathe, we can see and we can
hear what is being said in the Senate.
That is not all. The red rug in the Senate
was all worn out; there were holes in it and
it seemed impossible to have it changed. Then
it was mentioned that Her Maiesty the Queen,
who was to come here, could trip on one of
those holes and injure herself. Then it was
decided to buy a new rug, which now adorns
this chamber.
Other suggestions have been made as well.
There have been some complaints about the
paintings, but this is a matter of taste: some
like them; others do not. Let us leave it aside
for a moment.
There was another constructive suggestion
made by Senator Roebuck: it was to have
galleries installed on both sides of the Senate
chamber. There were plans for them but,
unfortunately, it was difficult to have the
plans executed. Later on Senator Roebuck
was ridiculed by the most influential journalist of the time, who said it was nonsense to
have galleries in the Senate. The galleries
would help to give us better sound. They
would have been a great improvement. Not
only do we now have loudspeakers but we also
have simultaneous translation, which has
permitted our English-speaking colleagues to
follow very well the speech made by Senator
Flynn in French.
So, the physical reform of the Senate is
under way and it has made great progress.
The new senators have no Idea what conditions were ten years ago. How was this
accomplished? By good understanding between all parties; the senators have accom-

plished it because we have a common interest
in better living conditions in this chamber.
I have particular thanks to express to
Senator Ross Macdonald, to Senator Dessureault, to Senator Connolly (Ottawa West)
who was then a private senator, to Senator
Horner who changed his mind about certain
things, and especially to my good friend
Senator Aseltine who agreed to those reforms.
Now we have to discuss the bill concerning
the retirement of senators at 75. Senator
Flynn has shown the difficulties that exist in
this bill. I have a very easy solution, not a
complicated one. It is to pay to senators who
have reached the age of 75, and who desire
to resign, a pension equal to their indemnity
less travelling expenses. This would mean
that a senator who bas reached the age of
75 years could retire on a pension of $12,000
a year, and his widow, if he dies, would be
entitled to a pension of one-half that amount,
or $6,000.
All of us have been appointed for life. If
the Government decides to make changes,
how is it that it can change the amount to be
paid to us? We are entitled by law to receive
an indemnity of $12,000 for a lifetime. There
are some honourable senators who are unfortunately ill, and when they do not attend the
sittings of the Senate-mind you, they are
very few and it is known that they are illthey receive the same indemnity as those of
us who do attend. Is this not a precedent to
consider?
I have another point that I wish to bring
to your attention. Who will decide about the
disability? What is the disability referred to
in the bill? How many doctors will have to
decide that a senator is unable to act as such
on account of his incapacity? It is important
to note this.
I appreciate the explanation given by our
leader (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa West) who
has spoken objectively, as he always does.
He deserves the tribute that was paid him
this afternoon. On the other hand, there are
many loopholes in this bill. I shall not begin
enumerating them, but it will not be necessary to use a magnifying glass to find quite a
number. They will be referred to, no doubt,
when the bill is before the committee.
Honourable colleagues, I must protest the
propaganda that has been directed against
the Senate. Some of those who have criticized
the Senate during the last two or three
years do not know of the kind of work or
the difficulty and importance of the work
that is belng done here. While we are speaking of reform, I would point out that the

SENATE DEBATES
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce does not need to be reformed. It is a
very active and excellent committee. It is
non-partisan. Very often important suggestions are made there; that committee performs a useful function.
Let us look at the Standing Committee on
Finance, which had been mostly inactive
since the death of the late Senator Charles
Hawkins, whose name was mentioned so
apropos yesterday. Senator Leonard bas
worked tremendously hard to the end that
the Finance Committee should serve its purpose. It informed the Senate of what is going
on concerning procedure in the Government
when it investigated, for instance, the Glassceo
Commission's report. This session Senator
Leonard will continue his good work.
We did not hear of the Standing Committee
on External Relations for a long time, but
Senator

Thorvaldson

has succeeded

in

re-

suscitating it. I appreciate the fact that that
was probably at the suggestion of the honourable Leader of the Government.
I appreciate also the fact that the sponsoring of legislation is distributed among us.
Who sponsors a bill better than Senator
Smith (Queens-Shelburne) sponsored the bill
to amend the National Housing Act last evening? Senator Baird bas sponsored many bills,
as bas Senator Cook. Senator Fergusson, our
lady colleague and confrere, and many others,
have sponsored many bills, thus relieving the
honourable Leader of the Government of
much of this work.
Honourable senators, when I was appointed to the Senate a friend of mine,
whose name I shall not mention, wrote me a
very nice letter, in which he said: "You will
be a good senator if you want to." I cannot
tell you the same thing. It is not a matter
of reproach; it is because I have the highest
respect for all of you. I know that you can
accomplish much. Although you are much
less numerous than the members of the
House of Commons, you can accomplish
much more than they can, provided that you
want to. At the present time the work of the
Senate is considered very important, and it
is so acknowledged by those who are familiar
with it.

You cannot ask a man on the street, who
does not know what the Senate is, to give
a fair judgment on it. You should be proud
of being a senator. You can show the Senate
Hansard, which will demonstrate that the
speeches of senators are always well prepared and to the point. In this respect, I
think of Senator Hollett who rose im-

May 26, 1965

promptu yesterday to speak on behalf of his
leader. He made an excellent speech, and I
can say the same of all of you. It is because
you have a long preparation and an excellent formation that gives you the ability to
formulate your thoughts in a manner that is
worthy of this chamber.
There are many occasions on which you
give the lead to legislation, and not only to
legislation but to reform. How many people
speak of reform without knowing what the
word means? How many people use that
great word without any intention of accomplishing anything in the way of reform?
I am in a good mood today, and I shall
not dot the "i's" nor cross the "t's", but I
know very well that if the Senate took
action it could be all-powerful in the practising of reform in many departments, and in
seeing to it that the incapable ones went at
once. That is a pretty arduous thing to do
because when we hear that somebody has
done anything wrong the answer we get is
that he is a newcomer, that he is ill, or that
he must be given a chance, and other silly
excuses like that.
At the present time there is a bill before
us for the superannuation of senators. I have
the greatest respect for my seniors, for the
oldest members of the Senate, whose wisdom
is unchallenged.
There are those who are ill but who, when
they were appointed to the Senate, were in
very good health. It is not their fault that
they became ill. They must be given the opportunity to retire and, to use the words of
Senator Flynn, they should be able to retire
with dignity on an adequate pension.
When we see someone who suffers from
an infirmity of any kind, or bas a physical
or mental impediment, if we ask him,
"Where are you from, sir?" and he answers,
"I am a senator of Canada," do you not
think that our fellow citizens will barely
understand that those men who have rendered great service to the state have not the
opportunity to have a decent pension to live
at home?
That being said, we shall not be afraid to
speak of matters that concern us, because
the judgment of the people may be quite
different from what you expect it to be.
I do not see why there should be any
difference between the treatment afforded to
judges and their widows and that afforded
to senators and their widows.
Not so long ago senators were ahead of
the judges in the Order of Precedence. It was

May 26, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

a mistake to change it. In my view, the senators of Canada are at least the equals of
judges. Therefore, I do not see why there
should be a different treatment for the
judges on the one hand, and for the senators
on the other hand. I do not see why there
should be a different treatment for the
widows of judges, on the one hand, and for
the widows of senators on the other hand.
Fairness should be the rule.
I leave it to you, honourable colleagues. We
should practise reform by improving this bill
so that the Senate is worthy and proud of
its task.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, debate
adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MO ON FOR ADDRSS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, May
19, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Aird, for an address
in reply thereto.
[Translation]
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri): Honourable
senators, today will be a day where just as
much French as English wrn be spoken in
this house, since I intend to speak French.
First, and this I have always done ever
since I have been a member of the Senate,
-that is for 21 years-each time I had the
opportunity to speak during the debate on
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, I have paid my respects to our gracious and revered Queen of Canada, and this
afternoon, I do not wish to fail observing this
habit I have acquired, and I wish to pay my
deepest respects immediately, not only because she is our Queen, but also because she
is dignified and, with her great dignity and
courtesy, she can serve as an example for ail
the mothers and wives at home, as well as
in all the British Empire. Last year, in thi
house, I said:
When our Queen comes to Canada, we
.. .shall receive her with..
.dignity.
She came and we received her in Quebec.
Despite the propaganda from a fifth columu
of anarchists, when the people of Quebec could
meet ier they gave her a welcome that was
worthy of a queen.
I take the liberty to pay my respects to our
dtstinguisiled GovernHr General of Canada,

His Excellency Georges Vanier, gallant soldier
and great diplomat who has brought honour
on his country. I want te pay my respects as
well to his distinguished and valiant wife.
I hope to be forgiven for my personal 11king for the Speaker of tis house. Firat of ail,
he cores from my amaîl town, I have always
known him and we live nearly side by side.
He is a man who does us honour. More than
40 years ago, when I was employed by the
Department of Agriculture of Quebec, I used
to take the ferry at 9 o'clock every morning
and there I used to meet our Speaker's
father. Quite often
oewould talk to me
about his son, Maurice, already esourceful,
wIho, no doubt, would do well for himself.
His father was not blinded by
hus son's successes, but he knew the young man would
go f ar in life. This is how, at that early stage,
I started to know young Maurice Bourget.
Hon. Mr Connolly (Ottawa Wet): He ta
stili young.
Han. Mr. Vaillancouri: Yes, he is stili young.
You will not be surprised if I also pay tribute
to my leader. Senator Connoily (Ottawa West)
is n
t
o lea
n th ose, hs reation
fact, he gives lectures here and there net only
on polittcs but also on matters concerning
the nation as a whole. In cultural centres,
for instance, where he gives hi lectures, or
among people eager to get wiae instruction
which wtll serve as a guide for young people
tomorrow, Senator Connolly, a dedicated advocate of ai social problems, is a good adviser for ail.
I regret that an accident befeil the leader
of the other side of tie house. I wish hlm
prompt and compiete recovery. I always appreciate the wisdom with which ie talked
about political problems, without acting in a
blind partisan spirit, but bringtng forward
constructive, sensible arguments. I pay him
trîbute and wish again to Senator Brooks a
long and happy life.
The mover and the seconder of the Addresa
in reply to the Speech from the Throne also
deserve congratulations. Their speeches were
clear, precise and witiout ambiguities of any
kind. It is in tus way indeed that ail the
bis sent to us te be approved are discussed
in the Senate. To discuas in a clear, precise
an
ay, that is how legialatora can
do sometuing reahly worthwhile and construcNew, I shah touch on a somewhat delicate matter. After wiat happened on Monday in Montreal, people have asked me: "Are

SENATE DEBATES
you a separatist?" No, I am not a separatist.
Very few people in my region are separatists.
But there are some madmen who have been
bought by foreigners and by a fifth column
organized in our information media, in our
newspapers, radio and TV. There is a fifth
column that is paid to preach discord. I shall
prove it to you in a moment.
Anarchists can do anything without any
regard for the freedom of honest people. At
the present time, all over the world like in
our own country, attempts are being made to
create that climate in order to destroy every
authority.
If you look through yesterday's newspapers concerning events that took place in
Montreal last Monday, we can see in the
photographs young people of 15, 16 or 18
years of age; in Quebec, it is the same thing.
They were all children. When the Queen arrived in Quebec City, last fall, those who
were shouting and mobbing were also children. They had been given $2 or $3 to shout;
they were directed by leaders, one of whom
was from Toronto, another from the State of
New York and the third, a Montreal boxer.
Let us consider also what took place during
the Queen's visit. If the radio, the television
and the newspapers had not given as much
publicity, for weeks in advance, saying that
there would be acts of terrorism, nothing at
all would have happened. They did everything to try and increase the disorder that
some people would have liked to create. They
tried to frighten people by telling them not
to go out, that it was dangerous for their
lives.
When one analyses the facts, one realizes
that last Monday in Montreal, as last fall,
there was a handful of youths in action.
I saw that fifth column in action last
June in Montreal. On June 24, the St. Jean
Baptiste Society had organized as usual its
great parade of floats.
At a certain spot on Sherbrooke Street, a
special stand had been erected where the
Governor General with his party were to
take their places, as well as his lordship the
Mayor of Montreal and other dignitaries. On
the other side of the street there were about
100 young people, boys and girls, who stood
there shouting and insulting people. Chief
Robert of the Montreal police had placed
his men, and himself, beside that mob. The
CBC's television cameras were also set up
there to cover the arrival of the Governor
General and his party, and also the parade.
Then, the Governor General came to take his
place on the platform, and the mob started

May 26, 1965

to shout and yell. Immediately, the police
came over and said: "Please!" Then, instead
of covering the arrival of the Governor General, TV cameras were turned on that mob.
Chief Robert went over to Mr. Baldwin and
told him: "There, I am giving you names."
Chief Robert himself gave them to me and
Chief Robert told Mr. Baldwin, representing
the CBC: "Cover the arrival of the Governor
General." But Mr. Baldwin replied: "I am
doing this because those are the orders I received from Toronto." Now, if you tell me
that there is no fifth column somewhere, I
wonder where it is?
Now, about separatists. You know there are
rather strange things happening in all countries of the world. There are people who
always have something to say. During the
election campaign in Great Britain last fall
there were 50 separatist candidates divided as
follows: the Welsh Nationalist Party had 23
candidates; the Irish Republican Party, 12
candidates; the Scottish Nationalist Party, 15
candidates. The Welsh party wanted Gaelic
to be recognized as the official language. The
Irish Republican party wanted Northern Ireland to secede from the United Kingdom and
to join the Republic of Ireland. Finally, the
Scotch Nationalist party refused to recognize
the Queen as sovereign of Scotland. None of
these candidates were elected; nevertheless,
they were candidates and we did not hear
anything about them. Furthermore, I got this
information from a good Scotsman from
England.
Quebec is now undergoing a renewal. People start to realize that there are Frenchspeaking Canadians able and willing to take
action. Besides, in the past, English-speaking
Canadians have perhaps been more separatist
than we have, because very few French
Canadians could hold key positions in any
business organization. Three or four years ago,
for instance, in the committee room across
the way, we heard the president of the Canadian National Railways tell us that there
were no French Canadians in key positions
because they were not qualified. That is to
say, it was not a matter of nationality but of
qualifications. Since then, two French-Canadian vice-presidents have been appointed and
they are doing a marvelous job. Mr. Gordon
himself told me that he was not only satisfied
but more than satisfied.
In the past, with regard to power, for
instance, within the Montreal Light Heat and
Power, the Shawinigan, the Gatineau Power,
etc., French-speaking engineers could not expect to rise higher than a certain level. Power

May 26, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

companies have been nationalized for some
time. Today, a French Canadian is president
of Quebec Hydro, as are most of its engineers.
It must be recognized that trernendous work
is being carried out there.
So, people are beginning to realize that they
can accomplish worthy things and a certain
fulfilment is taking place, not against the
others, but with them. We want Quebec to
develop along with the others and all FrenchCanadian people to work in a spirit of
co-operation, and not of destruction. We want
to work with others and thus participate more
actively in our country's economic expansion. I would like this to be well understood.
It is not destruction but co-operation that we
want to achieve.
Moreover, as you know, all my life I
worked to promote that principle of co-operation. Co-operation is not destruction. When
you want to co-operate, you work with, not
against, someone. That is the principle I have
always followed and will keep on advocating.
A few weeks ago, a group of women from
our part of the country went to see the
Prime Minister and asked him to intervene
to prevent those media, especially radio and
television, from harming the morals of our
homes by the presentation of programs
where the audience is taught how to steal,
kill, rape, set up a matrimonial group of
four or five, and what not. Some people will
say that if we are not satisfied with what is
shown on the screen, we just have to shut
off the television set. That is more easily said
than done.
I remember that when I was young, the
mother of one of my school companions had
crossed out in the dictionary a word that
offended her. My companion had looked into
the dictionary of his neighbour to see which
word had been crossed out. As young people
are always impressed by television pictures,
this is unfortunately what happens, and it
creates a problem the solution of which is
far from easy. The thing to do is to educate
people so as to have them act rightly rather
than wrongly.
It seems to me that the authorities could
do something in order to put a stop to this,
otherwise, we are doomed to complete
failure. A moral failure is worse than a
monetary one, for the whole nation suffers
from it. As we heard on television the other
day, even the existence of God is denied.
God does no longer exist. We are told that
life comes from matter, nobody denies that,
but, in reading the Bible, one sees that the
Creator took a little earth and blew on it to

make man. But who created matter, that is
another thing. Nobody will make me believe
that two pebbles side by side can become a
mountain after a century. When pride is
involved, the world is running to its doorn
and downfall. We then behave like wild animals in the jungle devouring each other, the
powerful getting the better of the weak.
This is perhaps my last appeal in this
House, as I am seriously ill. However, one
does not know what God holds in store. I
trust in God. I believe in Him. The Lord's
will be done. If these are to be the last words
I am to utter in this house, I would want thern
to be of comfort, of co-operation and of love
for all men. In closing these remarks, I want
to put in concrete form my thoughts in
respect of my country by saying: Long live
Canada, my country, my love!
On motion of Hon. Mr. Monette, debate
adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
THE TRUSTEE BOARD OF THE PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH IN CANADA-SECOND READING
DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson moved the
second reading of Bill S-10, respecting The
Trustee Board of The Presbyterian Church
in Canada.
She said: Honourable senators, I am sure
you will all understand why I feel it is somewhat difficult to speak immediately after the
last speaker. I have always admired Senator
Vaillancourt greatly. He is really my idea
of a fine Christian gentleman. I am sure all
honourable senators were moved as deeply
as I was by what he said.
Coming now to Bill S-10, I would like to
give you some information as to its purpose.
As you can see from the explanatory notes
facing page 1, the purpose is to modernize
and bring into line with modern practice the
organization and administration of The Trustee Board of The Presbyterian Church in
Canada.
Honourable senators may remember that in
1924-25 an effort was made to bring about
union among the Methodist, Presbyterian and
Congregational Churches in Canada. This
resulted in the formation of the United
Church of Canada by the Church Union Bill
of that year. The passage of that bill appeared
to take from the Presbyterian Church the
right to use the term "Presbyterian Church
in Canada". Nevertheless, very many distinguished persons were determined that in
Canada the Presbyterian Church should not
become a thing of the past, and many ad-

SENATE DEBATES
herents throughout Canada continued to worship as Presbyterians in spite of the Church
Union Act.
Many honourable senators will recall that
the Honourable Cairine Wilson, who contributed so much to the work of the Senate
and to the status of women members in the
Senate, and whose passing is so deeply
regretted by many of us, was among those
referred to as "continuing Presbyterians."
Although I am not a member of the Presbyterian Church myself, my father-in-law
and my husband's family were also numbered
among the continuing Presbyterians. The
existence of this group made for some misunderstandings between the adherents of the
two churches, and finally an agreement was
reached and an act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1939 which permitted
congregations, members and adherents of the
Presbyterian Church in Canada, who did not
in 1925 become part of the United Church of
Canada, and those who joined them later,
to use the name "The Presbyterian Church
in Canada". In the same year, 1939, on petition of The Presbyterian Church in Canada,
The Trustee Board of The Presbyterian
Church in Canada was incorporated to
acquire, take, hold and deal with real and
personal property belonging to the church.
This board was incorporated by chapter 64
of the Statutes of Canada, 1939.
This act provides that the board shall consist of seven members. Since, through gifts
and bequests in wills to the church, the
amount of property over which the trustee
board has control and responsibility for administration bas increased, the work of the
board has correspondingly increased since
1939, and since it is expected that it will
continue to increase in the future, it is
desired to make provision for enlarging the
number of members of the board to a maximum of fifteen, by inserting a new section
2A while retaining the original number of
seven as a minimum.
At the present time it is proposed to increase this number only to eight, but the
higher maximum is proposed so that it will
not be necessary to seek a further amendment
when the expected increase in responsibilities
and the work of the board takes place in the
future.
Although it bas been the practice to appoint
the Chairman of the Administrative Council
and the Treasurer of the church as members
of the Board of Trustees, it is now felt that
mandatory appointment to the board of the
Chairman of the Administrative Council, and

May 26, 196&

of the Treasurer of the church as long as he
is not a paid official, will ensure more efficient
and smoother operation of the board. If the
position of treasurer should become a paid
position or should cease to exist, there is a
proviso in the bill that the Chairman of the
Finance Committee of the Administrative
Council, as long as he too is not a paid
official, shall be appointed to the board in
lieu of the treasurer.
There are two new paragraphs which it is
proposed to incorporate into the act, one of
which will empower the board to combine
and consolidate all money and investments
under its administration that are not specifically directed to be administered separately.
It is expected that a substantial increase in
income may be realized by this combination
and consolidation. The second paragraph empowers the board to retain the services of
investment and other professional advisers,
which is a customary practice when people
are dealing with large amounts of money.
Section 21 of the original act of 1939, which
sets out the power of the General Assembly
of the Presbyterian Church in Canada to
make, amend and repeal by-laws, resolutions,
rules and regulations for the government and
control of the Trustee Board, will be repealed
by the passage of this bill and a new section
consisting of two subsections is proposed, the
purpose of which is to co-ordinate the language of the section with the proposed amendments as to membership and tenure of office
of the board as set out in subsections 1 and 2
of the proposed section 2A which I explained
earlier. The effect will be that while the
General Assembly may make, amend and
repeal by-laws, rules and regulations as is
provided by the present section, the General
Assembly is still bound by the proposed section 2A as to the minimum and maximum
membership of the boards and the mandatory
appointments to the board of the Chairman
of the Administrative Council and the Treasurer. The proposed amendment also refers to
the regulations passed by the General Council
in 1964 as to the government and control of
the board, whereas the present section 21
reads that until the General Assembly passes
such regulations the board shall be subject to
the government and control of the Board of
Administration.
In addition, the proposed subsection 2 of
section 21 empowers the General Assembly
to delegate all or any of its powers and jurisdiction over the board to the Administrative

May 26, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Council or its Executive, and it also empowers
the General Assembly to revoke such delegation.
Since the General Assembly meets only
once a year, such power of delegation is
essential so that the problems relating to the
work of the board arising during the year
may be dealt with effectively. In any case,
under the present section 21 which is in the
original act of 1939, the General Assembly
now has this power of delegation. However,
the provisions of the present act do not provide for revocation of such delegation, which
is just as important as having the power to
make the delegation.
It may be of interest to honourable senators
to know that among the members of the
Trustee Board at the present time are men
such as the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel
Keiller Mackay, former Lieutenant Governor
of Ontario, the Honourable George A. McGillivray, Justice of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario, Dr. Leslie King of Galt, a noted
retired surgeon, and other distinguished
Canadians.
If the Senate gives second reading to this
bill, I propose to move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills. If the bill is referred to
committee the Rev. Dr. E. A. Thomson of
Toronto, Secretary of the Administrative
Council and the highest permanent official
of the church in Canada, will appear to explain the bill and answer any questions that
may arise in committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps my honourable friend can answer a question which
rather interests me, but if she cannot

157

answer it, no doubt it can be answered when
the bill goes to committee. She referred to
the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church in Canada. Can she tell me whether
women are eligible for election to the
General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church in Canada?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I am extremely embarrassed to say that of my own knowledge
I do not know. Senator Inman has just told
me that recently they have been, but I do
not know of my own knowledge. I will be
glad to find this out from Dr. Thomson.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I only ask that question because, as a matter of topical interest,
in our own Anglican Synod of the Diocese
of Montreal last month for the first time we
enacted provisions making women eligible
for election, and I hoped the Presbyterians
were keeping up with us.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Inman, for Hon.
Mr. Kinley, debate adjourned.

THE ESTIMATES
AUTHORITY TO PRINT FINANCE COMMITTEE
PROCEEDINGS

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard, Chairman of the

Standing Committee on Finance, presented
the following report of the committee, to
which was referred the Estimates laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending
31st March, 1966:
Your committee recommend that authority be granted for the printing of
800 copies in English and 300 copies in
French of their proceedings on the said
Estimates.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I move, with leave of
the Senate, that the report be adopted now.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, before the report is adopted I want
to tell you about some things that were said

May 27, 1965

in committee this morning by an important
witness, the Secretary of the Treasury Board.
First, may I congratulate the Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Finance, Senator
Leonard, for the excellent work he has
suggested that the committee should perform.
The witness this morning was Dr. George
Davidson, Secretary of the Treasury Board.
The Treasury Board is considered by most of
us as an abstraction, a spiritual thing of which
we know very little. This morning we learned
much more about it. We were told that the
chairman is the Minister of Finance-this we
knew beforehand. But we learned that the
vice-chairman is the President of the Privy
Council, and that there are four other members of the board. The decisions are made not
by a single member of the board, which is
composed of ministers, but can only be arrived
at by at least three members of the board.
All recommendations sent to the board are
from cabinet ministers. Some recommendations are turned down, but the minister concerned or those who have made the recommendation are not always notified when there
is an adverse decision from the board. That is
my first point.
My second point is that most of the officers
of the Treasury Board are self-taught. Some
of them are university graduates with up to
a B.A. degree, but there are very few professional men on the board. This is in conflict
with the requirements of the Civil Service
Commission, as to academic degrees for all
candidates who compete in examinations. I
find it illogical that when every candidate is
required to have a long list of academic letters
after his name, the officers of the Treasury
Board who perform such an important function are just men who have been there for
many years. They may be very honourable
gentlemen, but are without any university
training or have only elementary university
training.
The work that is performed at the present
time by the Finance Committee is the most
important work that is being done by any
committee of the Senate, because we are
learning something about the business of
government, thanks to the chairman and to
my colleagues.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable
senators, I think I should add a few words to
what Senator Pouliot has said.
First of all, as to the matter of recommendations from Cabinet ministers that were turned
down and the notification to such ministers of
adverse decisions, I think the explanation Dr.

May 27. 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Davidson gave was that in all major matters
the minister would be notified of the decision
turning down a request, but it might happen
that in minor matters no actual notification
would be given.
On the question of the qualifications of the
members of the staff of the Treasury Board,
I do not think that Dr. Davidson would agree
with the interpretation that has been given
by Senator Pouliot. In so far as the requirements for the Treasury Board purposes are
concerned, I think Dr. Davidson's point was
that all members of his staff are extremely
well qualified. The expression "self-taught"
would not be an appropriate designation for
them.
It is true that the Treasury Board may be
dealing with matters of construction or engineering, and the officials of the board do not
themselves possess degrees from universities
in engineering or architecture, but in his description of them Dr. Davidson said they were
men who did have university training, and
for the purposes for which the board
requires them they are well qualified.
The proceedings are being printed, and if
I have been inaccurate in my interpretation
of the evidence given by Dr. Davidson, I can
correct it.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: In a spirit of conciliation,
I will substitute the words "self-made men"
for "self-taught men".
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I still do not think Dr.
Davidson would agree with that description.
Motion agreed to.

INQUIRY BY EXTERNAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE-AUTHORITY TO PRINT COMMITTEE
PROCEEDINGS

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson, Chairman of
the Standing Committee on External Relations, to which was referred the question of
Commonwealth relationships with particular
reference to the position of Canada within
the Commonwealth, presented the following
report:
Your committee recommend that authority be granted for the printing of
800 copies in English and 300 copies in
French of its day to day proceedings.

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I move, with leave
of the Senate that the report be adopted
now.
Report adopted.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I move, with leave of the Senate, that
when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Monday next, May 31, at
8 o'clock in the evening.
I should explain that Monday is the last
day of the month of May, and there is likely
to be an interim supply bill before Parliament at that time. It is desirable that the
Senate be sitting so that that bill can be
dealt with, should the occasion arise.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Is next Monday the last
day for the passing of this bill?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Supply
runs out on May 31.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It should not be sent to
us at the last hour.
Motion agreed to.

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the

members of the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senaHon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson:
tors, when shall this report be taken into senators, my purpose in speaking Honourable
to this bill
consideration?
is to support the point of view of my col-

SENATE DEBATES
league Senator Flynn, as presented in his
splendid contribution to the debate on this
bill yesterday afternoon.
This bill is of very great importance to
members of the Senate. It also makes a
fundamental amendment to the provisions of
the British North America Act respecting the
Senate, at least with respect to future appointments to the Senate.
As regards present members of the Senate,
the proposed constitutional amendment does
not in any way alter their constitutional status
as lifetime senators.
In the few remarks that I will make on the
bill, I propose to deal only with Part III,
namely, the provisions applicable to persons
summoned to the Senate before the coming
into force of this act. Section 14 of the bill,
being the second section in Part III, provides
that such a senator may resign when he bas
attained the age of 75 years.
I am in agreement with the principle of
such an amendment, and as far as I am
aware all my colleagues on this side of the
house are in agreement with it. I personally
am not in agreement with any view to the
effect that this constitutes a reform of the
Senate. Rather than a reform measure, it is
an amendment which appears to be in accord with the mood of the times in which we
live.
One aspect of this is that it bas become a
customary line of thought in this day and
age that people should have more leisure
time after they reach their seventies. It has
also become customary to believe that one's
physical and mental powers begin to deteriorate at or near this age, and that consequently people in officiai positions should
be relieved of some of their burdens and
responsibilities at this period of life. Whether
this point of view is accurate or not, I shall
not comment. Nevertheless, this point of view
bas been accepted for many years in regard
to judges in this country, who formerly were
appointed to hold office for life. However, all
that bas since been changed, and judges are
required to retire from office at the age of
75 years.
Consequently, as I said before, my colleagues on this side and I are in agreement
with the principle of the constitutional amendment providing for the retirement at age 75
of future appointees to the Senate. We are
also in agreement with the principle of a
legislative provision giving to present senators an opportunity to retire upon achieving
the age of 75.

May 27, 1965

There is, however, a further provisionthe wisdom of which I personally questionthat requires a senator who has attained the
age of 75 years of age at the time of the
passage of this act, to elect within one year
whether the act should apply to him or not.
My question is: why should there be any
restriction whatsoever of this kind, namely,
fixing a time limit within which this election
has to be made? If the purpose is to act as
sort of bait to present senators to retire almost
forthwith because of some motives in regard
to aspects of pension provisions, then I believe
that such provision is entirely unworthy of
acceptance by this body.
In any event, as far as I know there has
been no explanation whatsoever as to the
reason why a senator may not make his election at any time he desires after having
reached the prescribed age.
This provision was not, as I understand it,
Government policy when the original bill
was presented in the other place. I have
this original bill before me now and I would
like to read clause 14 of it.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Which
bill is that, may I ask?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The first reading.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: This is the bill
which was presented for first reading and is
dated April 27, 1965. Clause 14 of that bill
reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may grant to
a Senator
(a) who bas attained the age of seventyfive years, or
(b) who has become afflicted with some
permanent infirmity disabling him from
the due performance of his duties in the
Senate,
if he resigns his place in the Senate, an
annuity equal to two-thirds of his sessional indemnity, to commence at the time his
resignation takes effect and to continue
during his natural life.
That was section 14 as it read in the
original bill. There was nothing in that bill
in regard to election or limitation of time
regarding an election, within which time a
senator must resign or he would not be able
to do so at all. Consequently, I want to
emphasize that the bill we have before us was
not Government policy at the time of the
introduction of the bill in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Is not clause 14 as he
read it still in the bill?

SENATE DEBATES
Consequently, I trust that these matters
will receive thorough study and consideration
both here and in whatever committee this
bill is eventually referred to.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw): May I remind honourable senators
that if the sponsor of the bill speaks now,
it will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, in the first place I should like
to thank Senator Flynn and Senator Thorvaldson for their contributions to this debate.
As I said, or intended to say, in my opening
remarks, no one pretends that this bill is
perfect in every respect.
If I may paraphrase what Senator Flynn
bas said, he believes my opening speech was
in a relatively low key. I can say to him
and to the Senate that this was not unintentional. The purpose of my speech then was
primarily to get the bare bones of the explanation on the record before the weekend, so
that senators would have an opportunity to
examine the proposed legislation, without
having to examine the legislation antecedent
to this particular bill.
Honourable senators, if second reading of
this bill is approved today, I will move that
it be sent to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, where officials will
be prepared to answer questions by honourable senators.
There are two or three matters that bear
repetition and perhaps some comment. I am
sure honourable senators will realize that I
am not taking a partisan stand any more than
they did when they spoke. Honourable Senator Thorvaldson, speaking today, was a little
concerned about the impropriety of having a
one-year limitation placed on the exercise of
the option by senators who have now attained
the age of 75 years or by those now in the
bouse when they reach that age. In this
regard I would inform honourable senators
that this proposal was placed in the legislation
as a result of sincere suggestions made by
honourable members of this chamber who
were not seeking any special advantage, but
who felt that this was a proposal that should
be in the bill.
Senator Thorvaldson speaks about the pressure put on senators over 75 who without
monetary benefit will have to contribute $720

May 27, 1965

a year. In this case also the idea of a contribution by honourable senators was raised
originally by members of this house, not by
members of the other place, who felt-and
I say this in tribute to them-that a pension
to which they had made no contribution whatever was not a good thing.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: May I ask the bonourable senator not to misrepresent my stand
in the matter. I tried to make it clear that
I was not opposed to a contribution by senators, but that I felt there should be some
basic principle governing such contributions.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oftawa West): I am
sorry if it was not clear; there was some
noise in the chamber and perhaps I was not
clearly understood. I agree that honourable
Senator Thorvaldson did not suggest there
should be no contributions, and I accept the
explanation he gives of what he said. But
some members of this honourable chamber
felt that it would be helpful to the Senate as a
whole if contributions were made by senators,
even those who are appointed for life. I think
that position would be generally applauded in
the country at large.
I do not say there is any actuarial basis
for this kind of payment. It is not suggested
in the legislation that there should be, but
it is felt that a contribution to this fund by
senators who may eventually take a benefit
therefrom was the least that they could do. I
would remind honourable senators that in
1963 there was an increase in the indemnity to
honourable senators and, I would add, none too
soon. At that time the indemnity to honourable senators was increased from $8,000 to
$12,000 per year, and the allowance to meet
the expenses of senators in the course of their
duties was increased from $2,000 to $3,000 a
year. More important still, that $3,000 was
put on the basis of a tax-free allowance, as it
should be. In addition, certain new travelling
benefits were established. I should add that
the contribution of $720 will be deductible for
income tax purposes, so that generally speaking the net contribution will not be anywhere
near that sum.
I say these things because I feel they
should be said, and I think the position of
the Senate in the eyes of the public is enhanced by doing so.
Senator Thorvaldson complains about the
impropriety of the election and the necessity to make it within one year. What I am
about to say is not meant unkindly, but the
bill proposed on two occasions by the party

May 27, 1985

SENATE DEBATES

which he supported gave no election whatever. It provided that senators would be
retired at 75 regardless of the effect of such
retirement.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Such a bill would
never have passed this Senate.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The bill
was proposed, and who knows but honourable senators opposite might have had to support it. But I say in respect of this present
bill that the patent is honoured. The commitment is recognized, and no honourable senator will be in any worse position by virtue
of the passing of this bill.
I have had representations made to me by
a number of senators about the desirability of
providing survivor benefits for widows of
senators. This may be done in either of two
ways under the bill. I do not deny that some
senators may have a difficult decision to make.
But at least they will have a choice, and, I
would add, these benefits for widows have not
been available heretofore.
The clause enabling an honourable senator
to retire on account of disability is also very
important for every member of this house,
not only now but hereafter. In answer to my
honourable friend, Senator Pouliot, let me say
that the kind of medical certificate required
will be the type normally required i circumstances of this kind, and if an honourable
senator is found to be unable to discharge his
duties because of disability, then medical evidence to that effect will be accepted for the
purpose of his resignation.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Would the honourable
leader permit a question? Two alternative
methods for the provision of widows' allowances have been mentioned. Would he outline
them to the house?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes. If
a senator desires to stay under Part III of the
bill and retire at 75, and should he die
following retirement, leaving a widow, there
is a pension payable to that surviving widow
which has a present value of $2,666 a year.
But if instead a senator desires to come under
Part II of the bill, and to come under the
provisions of the Members of Parliament
Retirement Allowances Act, the contributions
made will build up an entitlement to a pension for the retiring senator, when he does
retire, at the rate of $300 a year. I take
Senator Flynn's example. In 10 years the
accumulated contributions would provide a
senator with a pension of $3,000 a year. If he
should die, there would be an entitlement to
22624-11

his widow of $1,800 a year. These are the
alternatives. I had it impressed upon me many
times before this bill came here that it would
be very desirable that the bill provide survival benefits for widows of senators. For that
reason I am glad that such a provision is now
included.
My only hope is that the decision that
honourable senators may have to take will not
be too hard a decision for any one of them.
Maybe there will be the element of gamble.
I suppose you do this in connection with life
insurance-as you get on in years you surrender policies because the risk or the requirement for protection is not as great in later
years as it is in earlier years.
I do think that it is a beneficial bill, and
that as a result of the suggestions made by
honourable senators it is the kind of bill that
does credit to this chamber.
In view of the difficulties that some older
senators have found arising out of ill health
and the impossibility of attendance, and considering the dependence of such persons upon
their indemnity, it is really a wonderful thing
that a life-term senator should have an opportunity to retire in dignity and with an adequate pension. If the bill achieved nothing
more than that, it would be a providential and
beneficial bill for the Senate and for Parliament.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I do not intend to take up the
time of the bouse at any greater length. I
believe a committee hearing will clear up
difficulties of interpretation and perhaps even
afford explanations of individual cases which
would be harder to give here than in committee. It will provide an opportunity for
senators who have special problems to get
detailed answers from the expert witnesses
who will be available.
I commend the bill to the chamber.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3, 1965
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-110, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service for the financial
year ending the 31st March, 1966.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly, with leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the
bill.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-110 is
a bill of interim supply. Copies have been
placed on the files of honourable senators,
and in addition, as has become the custom in
explaining supply bills, I have provided a
memorandum which summarizes the financial
aspects of the bill. This memorandum is being
distributed now, and I hope that all members
will have a copy.
This is a bill to provide one month's supply.
It provides, in the first instance, one-twelfth
of the items to be voted in the main Estimates, as the memorandum indicates and as
appears in section 2(a) of the bill, in the
amount of $365,219,237. In addition to that
amount, there are percentages of certain
items in the Estimates of certain departments, all of which are set out in the
schedules to the bill. The memorandum, as
I have indicated, is a summary only of the
provisions of the bill.
The total amount to be voted by this bill
is $380,770,370.34. The money to be voted
will meet all the necessary requirements of
the public service up to June 30, 1965. In
no instance is any one of the items in the
general Estimates being released.
The bill is in the usual form of bills of
interim supply, with which honourable
senators are very familiar. I give the usual
undertaking that the passage of the bill will
not in any way prejudice the rights and
privileges of honourable senators to criticize
or deal with any item of the Estimates when

it comes up for consideration in other supply
bills. These rights and privileges will be
completely respected.
If I may, I shall deal now with the
schedules. Schedule A provides an additional
$400,000 to be voted, which is eight-twelfths
of Item 70 in the Estimates of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys. This
item covers subventions in respect of eastern
coal under agreements entered into pursuant
to the Atlantic Provinces Power Development
Act. These payments are designed to enable
maritime thermal power plants to obtain coal
at the same B.T.U. cost as is paid by thermal
plants in central Canada. The additional
amount is required because there are certain
outstanding accounts that have been received
from power commissions for coal shipped
during the period December 1, 1964 to March
31, 1965.
Schedule B asks for an additional $2,221,666.67, which is four-twelfths of item 5 in the
Estimates of the Department of Northern
A ffairs and National Resources. This has to
do with the Roads to Resources program,
with which
all honourable senators are
familiar. It provides for payments to provinces under agreements for the construction
of these roads. The additional money required
in this instance is to meet accounts from the
provinces for work done under the program
in 1964-65.
I direct attention to Schedule C of the bill
which requests an additional $12,929,466.67,
being one-twelfth of several items under
various departments, particulars of which are
given in the schedule.
Perhaps I can help honourable senators by
describing the items briefly and indicating
the reason why the additional amount is
required.
Under the Department of Finance, item 15
of the general Estimates deals with contingencies: paylist accounts, miscellaneous,
minor or unforeseen expenses, and awards
under the Public Service Inventions Act. The
general amount provided here is $6 million.
The amount required to be voted tonight
under this item would be approximately
$500,000. This item in the Estimates operates
in many respects as a revolving fund, and
items financed from this are later included
in supplementary and in final Estimates. The
funds which are financed out of this item
now will then be reimbursed. At this early
stage in the year no reimbursement is possible because supplementaries have not yet
been tabled. Therefore, the total payments
against this vote are heavier than they will
be later in the year.

SENATE DEBATES
Under the Department of Fisheries, item 5,
there is a requirement for an additional onetwelfth, which is a little under $1 million.
This vote provides for the bulk of the field
program of the department for industrial
development, conservation, fisheries inspection, Newfoundland bait service, administration of the Fisheries Price Supports Act and
Canada's share of the expenses of seven international commissions.
The additional money is required because
much of the actual expenditure is incurred
at this time of the year.
Under the Department of Fisheries, item 20
-Fisheries Research Board of Canada-an
additional one-twelfth of $6,906,000 is required. This vote provides for the headquarters and field costs of biological, technological and oceanographic research carried
out by the board in coastal and inland waters.
Again, at this time of the year the additional
amount is requested to finance the heightened
field research activity which takes place on
the mainland.
Under the Department of Forestry, onetwelfth of item 15 is required for the work
that is done in research in connection with
the use of forest products. Again, the activity
during the summer months is very high.
Under the Department of Labour, item 15,
the Estimates call for the payment to the
provinces for capital assistance and technical
and vocational training. The total amount
provided in this year's Estimates is $116,988,000. An additional one-twelfth of that
amount is now requested for the reason that
some additional billings have been received
from the provinces in respect of these programs, and this amount should be provided
to meet these claims.
Under the Department of Northern Affairs
and National Resources, item 1, the administration and general section, the amount required for the year will be $1,817,000. Onetwelfth of that vote is requested to provide for
headquarters and administration for the expense of northern co-ordination work. The
payments in June of the grants of northern
scientific research expeditions will be coming
forward.
Honourable senators, I turn now to the bill
itself, Bill C-110, which is known as Appropriation Act No. 3. Section 2 sets out the
particulars of the financial requirements
which are contained in the memorandum
which has been distributed.
Section 3 provides, as is customary in bills
of this kind, that the amount authorized by
this act to be paid in any item shall be paid

May 31, 1965

or applied only for the purposes specified in
the item and subject to the terms and conditions of the item.
Section 4 provides that where an authority
to enter into a commitment is authorized, the
commitment may be entered into only under
the terms provided in the item, and the
Comptroller of the Treasury must certify that
this has been done before the money is
released.
Section 5 provides for the accounting of the
expenditure of the money.
If honourable senators have questions to
ask on any of the details, I shall be glad to
provide any further information I can.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I am sure we are all grateful to the
Leader of the Senate for the clear explanaiton he has given us. I do not propose to
speak at length or hold up interim supply
on this occasion. Indeed, I was for some time
doubtful whether I should add my voice to
those of many distinguished senators-perhaps I should single out Senators Crerar, Pouliot, Ross Macdonald and Grattan O'Learywho have in the past criticized this type of
sudden procedure whereby senators are required to proceed with undue haste to consider interim supply. I have decided to add
my voice, not because it is so strong but
because the constitutional rights of the Senate are affected.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): And the
company is good.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Or, what is perhaps
worse, they appear to be affected. On such
occasions as this, the operation of the Senate
does indeed look like an undignified job of
rubber stamping decisions already made elsewhere.
We cannot in conscience, nor should we,
hold up interim supply unduly, since under
positive guarantee it has been undertaken that
we will have an opportunity to discuss the
main Estimates in full at a later date. I do
not want to comment at great length on this
understatement, but we know that, although
we are given the promise and the undertaking
that we will be able to ask questions and discuss in detail the Estimates when they come
to us, they probably will come to us at as
late a date as this interim supply is coming to
us-we know that. The same fault is committed under any party, under any government. I will let honourable senators judge
the practical value of such undertakings, but
at least they have been made.

May 31. 1965

SENATE DEBATES

In this instance, the Senate has met at an
early opportunity. I cannot find fault with
that, nor do I believe that I can really change
the ancient custom in this regard. Long established customs, whatever their intrinsie merit,
or lack thereof, have a strange tenacity and
a tendency to perpetuate themselves. At the
present moment, I am not quite sure how imminent is the necessity for interim supply,
but it has always been "imminent" in the
past.
At this stage I will content myself with
this mild protest.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I am sure all honourable senators share
my concern at the disappearance in Canada
of the elm tree as a result of the Dutch elm
disease. In my view they are the most beautiful and picturesque trees we have. In the
past the only way of protecting them against
this disease was to spray them, an operation
which later became quite impossible because
of their size. However, I have recently read
in the newspapers of the invention of a drug
which is hypodermically injected into the sap
of the tree and thus protects it from the
ravages of this disease. I am sure the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Connolly, Ottawa West) has very little, if
any, information on this subject, but I would
like a report if it could be had from our
Department of Agriculture and Department
of Forestry on the value of the remedy, and
what the departments are doing to assist in
its success.
I have another point to make. I have not
joined in the protests constantly voiced over
the many years that I have been here about
the late hour at which the interim supply
bills and the general supply bill reach the
Senate. It does seem to me that we are
masters of our own procedure. No one can
hurry us. If any member thinks that we can
gain anything in public interest by delaying
these bills and inquiring into the matters
involved, there is nothing to stop us adjourning the debate, and there is nothing to prevent
the Senate from taking all the time necessary to inquire into all details. We do not
do so, not because of any pressure put upon
us by the Government, no matter which party
is in power or which administration sends
the Estimates to us, but simply because it
would be an exercise in futility. The Estimates are in the same form and are dealt with
in the same manner year after year.
I do not see where we have any ground
for protest. We are masters of our house, and,
as I have said, if there is any member here
who thinks that delaying the vote will help
in any way, then he is in a position to do so.
I have never joined in these protests, and I
am not doing so now.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must inform the Senate that if the
honourable Senator Connolly speaks now it
will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, referring first to the point

May 31, 1965

made by honourable Senator Roebuck with
regard to the elm trees, I am sure this is a
matter of concern to all honourable senators.
The elm is indeed a most beautiful tree.
There were three beautiful elms in front of
my own house here in Ottawa; they must
have been at least 75 years old. Five years
after I moved into the house they had to be
removed, and, honourable senators, I felt it
was like taking a rib from my side. Unfortunately, the loss of elms has happened
in many parts of the national capital. I thank
Senator Roebuck for his suggestion. I am
sure we will be able to get some information
from the National Capital Commission, from
the Department of Agriculture and from the
Department of Forestry. I shall seek information from all possible sources.
Honourable senators, it is now 20 minutes
to nine and this house has been engaged in
discussing interim supply-which is really
only authority for releasing one month's supply of money-since this sitting commenced.
I understand that in the other place these
matters were dealt with in 10 or 15 minutes.
Obviously the Senate bas spent more time
on these items than did the other place. I
feel that is worthy of comment.
I want to say to Senator Choquette-and
I am sure he will concur in this-that the
undertaking given in respect of this and all
supply bills is a serious one, which I think
has serious consequences for honourable
senators who may want to investigate in
detail items in the Estimates.
I would also remind the Senate that we
have in this session, as in past sessions, referred the Estimates to the Standing Committee on Finance. The third meeting of that
committee is scheduled for Thursday of this
week. I shall endeavour to get written answers to the questions that have been asked
here, and in addition I shall have copies of
these answers prepared and placed in the
hands of the Chairman of the Committee on
Finance so that any honourable senator who
wishes further information can seek it from
the witnesses who can be called before that
committee.
I think the situation in the other place will
be different in the future after their rule
changes are approved, if they are approved.
We can provide ourselves with very useful
information about the Estimates, perhaps, in
a more methodical way than can be done in
the other place. I think it would be appropriate, for example, for senators to take advantage of the sittings of the Finance Com-

May 31, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

mittee to obtain answers to these and other
questions relating to the general items of the
financial Estimates.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I cannot see why these
answers cannot be made in this chamber
where the questions are asked. It should be
borne in mind that since the Estimates are
dealt with monthly, it will be a comparatively
few days before the Government again asks
for supply; so the answers given and the
questions that arise therefrom can be considered again in one month's time. In
the meantime, if any honourable senators
question any item, they will have one full
month for inquiry and investigation. So, why
can we not have the answers to these questions tabled in the house?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I will
undertake to do that.
Hon. Muriel Fergusson: Honourable senators, I may be out of order, but I do not
know when I may have another opportunity
to make the comment I wish to make. May
I have your permission to take this opportunity?
The Hon. the Speaker: Is unanimous consent given?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I would merely like
to remind the honourable Leader (Honourable
Mr. Connolly, Ottawa West) that the problem
of the Dutch elm disease is not limited to the
national capital.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I do not
suggest that it is.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: You did say you
would investigate it and, as I understood
your comments, your reference was only to
the national capital.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No. This
is a national problem.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: My city is known as
the "City of Elms," and the disease is a
serious problem with us. I hope the information which we receive will cover ail of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It will.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: May I ask permission
also to make one remark apropos of this
discussion?
The Hon. the Speaker: I am afraid I may
have to give general permissien to everyone.
Is it agreed?
22624-12

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I wish simply to say
that the experiment to which Senator Roebuck referred is going on in Toronto at the

NORTHUMBERLAND STRAIT
TRANSPORTATION SERVICES-INQUIRY
ANSWERED
Hon. Orville H. Phillips inquired of the

Government, pursuant to notice:
1. Has the Government given consideration to operating a Hovercraft service
for passenger and automobile traffic
across the Northumberland Strait, and
maintaining the C.N.R. car ferries for
rail traffic?
2. What is the number of Hovercraft
required, the initial cost, and the annual
maintenance cost of the Hovercraft for
the above service?
3. What is the cost of the Northumberland Strait Causeway with rail facilities, and annual maintenance cost?
Hon. John J. Connolly: The answer to the
honourable senator's inquiry is as follows:
1. Developments in Hovercraft are being followed but have not reached a
stage where this type of transport could
be considered a feasible alternative to
either the present ferry system or a
causeway.
2. Work on a Hovercraft type of a size
that might be suitable has not gone beyond the planning stage, and data on
such factors as capital and operating
costs, operating performance and service
life are insufficient to draw firm conclusions.
3. Cost figures will not be available
until the present studies have been completed.
INTERPARLIAMENTARY UNION
FIFTY-THIRD ANNUAL

CONFERENCE AT

COPENHAGEN-DEBATE

ADJOURNED

Hon. J.-M. Dessureault rose pursuant to
notice:
That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Fifty-third Annual Conference of the Interparliamentary Union held
at Copenhagen, Denmark, in August 1964,
to the Spring meetings of the Union held
in Dublin, Ireland, in April 1965, and to
the progress made to date on arrangements for the Fifty-fourth Annual Conference of the Interparliamentary Union
to be held in Ottawa, from 8th to 17th
September 1965.
He said: Honourable senators, I would like
to take this opportunity to report not only
on the Interparliamentary Conference which
took place last August in Copenhagen, Den-

mark, and the recent spring meetings in Dublin, but also to summarize the progress made
to date on arrangements for the fifty-fourth
Interparliamentary Conference which will
take place in Ottawa next fall from September 8 to 17.
It may seem late to make this report, but
the delay is understandable in view of the
many unexpected and unforeseen adjournments in the previous session.
The Fifty-third Annual Interparliamentary
Conference took place in Copenhagen from
August 20 to 28, 1964. This meeting was a
milestone in the history of the Interparliamentary Union. For the first time since its founding in 1889, the number of participants in the
conference exceeded 1,000, including more
than 500 parliamentarians representing 66 nations of the world. To be exact, there were
537 delegates, 195 advisers and secretaries,
and 315 members of families. A number of
important international organizations were
represented at the Copenhagen sessions, such
as UNESCO, which was represented by its
Director-General, Mr. Rene Maheu, the World
Health Organization, Food and Agriculture
Organization, General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, Council of Europe, European
Parliament and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.
The following groups sent delegations: AIbania, United States of America, Argentina,
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria,
Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic,
Ceylon, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Great Britain,
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia,
Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luxembourg, Monaco, Mongolia,
Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria,
Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines,
Poland, Rumania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,
Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Republic, Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics, Venezuela, Yugoslavia.
Honourable senators, I am pleased to report that our own Canadian delegation was
particularly well selected, being one of the
best with which I have been associated. I am
happy to say that the members of our own
delegation never once lost sight of the fact
that they were all Canadians, and together
they were able to form a strong Canadian
team.
Thanks to the Prime Minister and to my
distinguished leader, I had the honour of

being chosen to lead this outstanding delegation, which included honourable Senators
Arthur L. Beaubien and Jacques Flynn, and
also the following members of the House of
Commons: Mr. Russell C. Honey, Mr. Bryce
Mackasey, Mr. Raymond Rock, Mr. Eric
Winkler, Mr. Eldon Woolliams, Mr. Colin
Cameron, Mr. G. Chapdelaine and Mr. Gilles
Grégoire, Mr. Alcide Paquette served as Secretary to the delegation, and Mr. Ian Imrie,
Co-ordinating Secretary for Parliamentary
Associations, accompanied the delegation as
an observer.
Honourable senators, I would like to say at
this time how very much I, as leader of the
delegation and as President of the Canadian
Interparliamentary Group, valued the services of Mr. Alcide Paquette, who has been
associated with the Canadian Interparliamentary Group since Canada joined the Interparliamientary Union in 1960. He has contributed greatly of his time, energy and
experience to the affairs of the Canadian
Interparliamentary Group as its Executive
Secretary-Treasurer until last March; and,
as Secretary to the delegation, he served with
characteristic competence, judgment and willingness.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Dessureault: The Canadian delegation left Ottawa on the afternoon of August
17 on the R.C.A.F. Transport Command service ffight to Trenton, Ontario, and Marville,
France. At both these well-run stations we
were welcomed with warmth and hospitality
by the commanding officers and their staff,
and during the intervals in the fiight we were
thus able to spend time usefully and enjoyably in conversations with our fine service
personnel.
The delegation was taken from Marville to
Copenhagen by R.C.A.F., arriving there on
the evening of August 18. We were met at
Copenhagen Airport by the Chargé d'Affaires
of our Canadian Embassy there, Mr. Konrad
Nyenhuis, and by a Danish member of Parliament, Mr. Viggo Hauch who, I was sorry
to hear, lost his parliamentary mandate in
the election held in Denmark last September,
followmng the conference. Through the assistance of these gentlemen, we were quickly
cleared through customs and sped on our way
to a most comnfortable, modern hotel in the
beautiful, thriving City of Copenhagen.
I would be remiss if I did not; say a very
special word of praise for the warmn hospitality of our hosts, the Danish Interparliamentary Group, and of the Danish people

generally. This beautiful northern country
must certainly be a pleasant place to live, as
evidenced by the unfailing good nature of
the Danes and their willingness to be of assistance to strangers.
The Danish group spared no effort to make
our stay a pleasant one. In addition to the
reception given on the opening day of the
conference by the City of Copenhagen, the
Danish group organized on the free Sunday
afternoon and evening a most interestîng
excursion for ail participants in the conference through the beautiful countryside of
North Zealand to the baroque castie of Fredericksborg and to the famous Kronborg
Castie at Elsinore, traditionally associated
with Shakespeare's Hamiet. Experienced
guides were provided for the tour and a
superbly arranged dinner was served for
more than 1,000 people at the excellent
Marienlyst Restaurant at Elsinore. In spite
of the large number of guests, a printed
seating arrangement had been prepared in
advance which had the advantage of mingling
the members of the varlous delegations and
providmng several members of the host group
at each table.
I mention this to underline the high degree
of participation by Danish parliamentarians
in the various hospitality arrangements. This
was a characteristic of the Copenhagen Conference that I think we should bear closely in
mind in planning for the coming September
conference, at which Canada will be the host
group. Success or failure to project ourselves
as a hospitable nation will, I believe, depend
to a very large extent on how fully our own
parliamentarians are prepared to participate
in the reception and hospitality arrangements set up for the visiting delegations.
Following the special state dinner at Elsinore, a midnight cruise was arranged to take
the delegates back to Copenhagen. The hour
was late but the night was perfect, and the
cruise provided a fitting climax to a most enjoyable excursion, on another day the heads
of delegations and their wives were invited
to the summer palace of the Royal Family
where they were presented to Their Mai esties
and the three Royal Princesses. The youngest,
the beautiful Princess Anne-Marie, was soon
to leave for her wedding with the young
King of Greece.
In addition, a gala performance was provided by the Royal Danish Ballet for the
delegates to the conference. The Royal Opera
House was reopened specially for this brilliant
event which was honoured by the presence of

SENATE DEBATES
Their Majesties and members of the Danish
Royal Family. Or another evening, the international committee of the Students Club of the
University of Copenhagen-one of the largest
students clubs in the world-invited all participants in the conference to attend a panel
discussion on current events. This was an
intellectually stimulating evening, and the
dance that followed the discussions proved
most entertaining.
Any description of the hospitality arrangements at the Copenhagen conference would
not be complete in any sense without special
mention of the fine program arranged for the
ladies attending the conference. Copenhagen
is one of the fashion capitals of the world and
activities highlighted this fact, with special
emphasis on Denmark's famous fur industry.
Danish porcelains, furniture and rugs were
also placed on display for the ladies; in addition, there were visits to museums, art galleries, hospitals, and educational and welfare
institutions. The Danish group offered its program to the largest number of wives that
have attended an Interparliamentary Conference-more than 300-but the arrangements
were exemplary for their efficiency and sustained interest.
On the evening before the opening of the
conference, the Canadian delegation gave a
reception jointly with the Canadian Chargé
d'Affaires at the residence of the ambassador,
at which we received members of the international executive of the Interparliamentary
Union and its international secretariat, as
well as the members of the Danish Executive
Committee, the Danish delegation to the conference, the heads of the national delegations
and the diplomatic corps in Copenhagen.
The inaugural ceremony took place on the
morning of August 20 at the City Hall of
Copenhagen, where the delegates were welcomed by His Majesty King Frederick, Prime
Minister Jens Otto Krag, the chairman of the
Danish Interparliamentary Group, Mr. Poul
Hansen, the chairman of the City Council,
Mr. Henry Stjernqvist, and the president of
the Interparliamentary Union, Mr. Ranieri
Mazzilli of Brazil. It was a stirring ceremony,
at which His Majesty and the other speakers
took advantage of the occasion to underline
that this was the 75th anniversary of the
founding of the Interparliamentary Union. In
1889, the Union was founded through the
initiative of nine nations: Great Britain,
France, United States, Belgium, Hungary,
Italy, Liberia, Spain and Denmark.
Delegation heads from these nine founding
countries most appropriately took the oppor-

June 1, 1965

tunity to address a special message of rededication to all national groups of the union
represented at the conference. This message,
which I will not undertake to read, is, I
think, one that will be of interest also to
honourable senators. I ask leave to include it
in the record.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it agreed?
Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
(The message follows):
A Message on the Occasion
Of the 75th Anniversary
Of the Interparliamentary Union
The elected representatives of the
nine countries which, in 1889, came together to form the Inter-parliamentary
Union,
Are happy to be able to celebrate
together the 75th Anniversary of this
event in the capital of Denmark, whose
Parliament was represented in Paris
at the first Interparliamentary Conference together with those of the
United States of America, Belgium,
France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy,
Liberia and Spain,
Have unanimously decided to address
the following message to the national
groups of the union:
For three-quarters of a century, the
Interparliamentary Union, which by reason of the upheavals caused by two world
wars bas passed through some difficult
periods, has nevertheless pursued its endeavours for peace and understanding
among peoples with unswerving fidelity
to the ideals of its founders as well as
with an exemplary continuity of principle and direction.
On the occasion of this anniversary,
grateful homage must be paid to those
two statesmen, Sir William Randal
Cremer of Great Britain and Mr. Fredéric
Passy of France, who first conceived the
union, as well as to those presidents and
secretaries general whose devotion has
ensured its continuous advancement.
The nine founding countries have grown
to seventy-five, and it is significant that
one of the first concerns of peoples who
achieve independence is to demonstrate
their attachment to democracy and to
representative institutions by seeking admission to the union which offers them
and all its members a forum from which,

June 1. 1865

DEBATES
June 1 1965SENATE

speaking in an atmosphere of freedom,
reciprocal tolerance and friendship, their
voice can be heard throughout the world.
In the course of years, the ideals of
the union have influenced the policy of
governments: in a practical manner, and
some of the initial objectives of the
organization have been achieved, partieularly with regard to the setting up of a
universal organization of states, flrst the
League of Nations and today the United
Nations.
Similarly, the ideal of settling international disputes by ail peaceful meansincluding arbitration. which, from its
early days, the Union has constantly advocated-is today accepted by ail countries.
It has to be recognized, however, that
in spite of ail efforts peace is not yet
established on a finm basis and that use
of force has not been eliminated in international relations. Further, ini face of the
increasing power exercised by governments and their administrative services,
many parliaments have difficulty in maintaining their full prerogatives.
For these reasons, the present representatives o! the founding members of the
Union address an urgent appeal to national groups inviting them to:
-fight in their own countries for
maintaining the authority of Parlianment so that it can fuily discharge its
duties on behaîf of the people;
-use their influence so that their
governments follow a policy of peace
and disarmament, abstain from recours e to force in their relations with
other states and settle around the conference table, and not on the fleld of
battle, any differences which may occur.
This 75th anniversary offers parliamentarians of today the opportunity of
solemnly renewing their f aith in those
principles which remain the foundations
of the Interparliamentary Union.

Conference.

Han. Mr. Dessureault: The conference
opened on the afternoon of August 20 in the
Danish Folketing, or Parliament, in the
Palace of Christiansborg. During the conference the five standing commîttees of the
Interparliamentary Union met to consider
amendments to draft resolutions under their
study, worked out their 1965 programs and
adopted recommendations for presentation to
the executive committee. In plenary session,
five days of the conference were spent in
general debate on the report o! the secretarygeneral and on the following particular subjects:
The flght against disparities in world
economy.
Adaptation of the United Nations Charter
to the requirements of an enlarged international society.
The problem of education and the flght
against illiteracy.
The role o! members of Parliament as
intermediaries between the citizens and their
government. Eight resolutions were adopted
on the foilowing subi ects:
Possible steps toward general disarmament.
International protection of human rights.
The implementation of the United Nations
declaration on colonialism.
Two resolutions on the flght against
disparities in world economy.
The problem of education and the flght
agamnst illiteracy.
A three-part resolution on the adaption o!
the United Nations Charter to the needs of an
enlarged international society.
Finaily, a resolution expressing the grief
of the conference at the death of the late
Prime Minister Nehru of India.
During the conference the executive conimittee adopted two resolutions, one admitting
the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to meinbership, the other postponing consideration of

People's Democratic Republio o! Korea

SENATE DEBATES

(North Korea) until its relations with the
United Nations have become regularized.
In meetings of the Interparliamentary
Council on August 19 and 26, the following
matters of interest were dealt with on the
agenda:
The filling of four vacant seats on the
executive council by Mr. Senanayeke of
Ceylon, Mr. Vilfan of Yugoslavia, Mr. Mbu of
Nigeria and Mr. Hacohen of Israel.
The fixing of Interparliamentary Council
sessions at Dublin in 1965.
The choice of Moscow as the site for the
55th Annual Conference in 1966. This, however, was changed to Teheran at the recent
spring meetings in Dublin.
And, finally, the organizing of the 54th
conference in Ottawa next September 8 to
17.
The annual spring meetings of the Interparliamentary Council were held this year in
Dublin, Ireland, from April 19 to 25, 1965.
As a member of the Interparliamentary
Council and chairman of the Canadian group,
I had the privilege of leading another exceptionally fine delegation of eleven parliamentarians. From the Senate, in addition
to myself, there were honourable Senator
Brooks and honourable Senator Leonard. Our
delegation also included eight members of
Parliament: Messrs. Herman M. Batten,
Bernard Pilon and J. J. Greene from the
Liberal Party; Messrs. Winkler and Robert
C. Coates from the Progressive Conservative
Party; and, in addition, Messrs. Colin Cameron, Maurice Côté and Antoine Bélanger.
They were all assigned to the five different
committees of the council meetings, and all
distinguished themselves in the discussions as
well as in the important task of making
friends for Canada.
Mr. Alcide Paquette, a member of the
Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments, and Mr. Ian Imrie, Executive Secretary
Treasurer of the Canadian group, also accompanied the delegation.
Our delegation received the best attention
possible from the Department of National
Defence in travelling to the Dublin meetings.
We were taken from Uplands Airport in
Ottawa direct to Shannon Airport in Ireland aboard one of the fine 60-passenger
Yukons.
Our delegation arrived at Shannon Airport
early on Saturday morning, April 17, and
journeyed to Dublin by bus in order to see
as much as possible of Ireland's beautiful
countryside. In Dublin we were treated to

June 1, 1965

the warm hospitality of our Ambassador Mr.
Evan W. T. Gill, his charming wife and the
fine members of his staff. The attention we
received from all members of our embassy
staff was exemplary, and with that in mind
perhaps I should not attempt to single out
any one individual for commendation for
services rendered to our delegation. However, if I did, I would want to mention the
unfailing co-operation and assistance of Mr.
John Sharpe, our First Secretary in Dublin,
who devoted so much of his time to our welfare.
The spring meetings were largely taken
up with sessions of the five Standing Study
Committees of the Interparliamentary Union.
As a result of their work, a number of draft
resolutions were presented to the Interparliamentary Council.
The Political Committee, although not
adopting any precise draft resolution, proposed to council that the following subject
be debated by the 54th conference in Ottawa
next September, namely: United Nations,
Instrument of International Co-operation for
Peace and Disarmament.
The Parliamentary and Juridical Committee also did not adopt any specific draft
resolution, but recommended that a subject
on the strengthening of all parliamentary institutions be included on the conference
agenda, and four rapporteurs were nominated.
The Economic and Social Committee
adopted two draft resolutions; the first on
the population problem, and the second on
new prospects for economic relations.
The Fourth Committee, concerned with
cultural matters, approved a draft text on
relations between UNESCO and the Interparliamentary Union, and also two draft resolutions on the use of television for educaand its
tional purposes, and science
application in the service of economic
development.
Finally, the Committee on Non-Self-Governing Territories an Ethnie Questions
adopted an appeal to the United Nations
Committee on Apartheid and a draft resolution on the same subject.
The Interparliamentary Council met on
Saturday, April 24, to consider the above
resolutions. In addition to approving the appeal to the United Nations on apartheid,
the council adopted the following subjects
for the agenda of the Ottawa conference:
1. The topie provisionally proposed by the
Political Committee on the United Nations,

June 1, 1965

June 1 1965SENATE
DEBATES

with the understanding that ail matters pertainmng to UN activity would be discussed.
2. The question adopted by the Parliamentary Committee on means of strengthening
the effectiveness of Parliament.
3. The Economic Committee item on New
Prospects for Economnie Relations.
The council also decided that certain of
the draft resolutions adopted by the committees would be referred to the conference
for adoption wîthout debate. They were resolutions on the population problem, relations
between UNESCO and the Interparliamentary
Union, and use of television in the education
of children and aduits, and the text on the
problem of apartheid.
I think I can truly say that the Dublin meetings have been the liveliest in recent years.
There was an exceptionally large attendance
from member nations, and the standard of debate was very high indeed. Ail of this augurs
well for our September conference.
Ail parliamentarians attendin-g the union's
session in Dublin were unanimous i their
appreciation for the efforts made by the Irish
Parliamentary Association in arrangîng the
excellent facilities which led to such successfui debates.
Honourable senators, if I may be permitted
now to turn from this account of the 53rd
Interpariiamentary Conference, I should like
to say a few words about the 54th conference which Canada will have the honour of
arranging next September. This will not be
only the first conference of this esteemed
and venerable international parliamentary
body to be held in Canada but, also, it wiil
be the largest parliamentary conferenoe that
we have ever undertaken. I arn sure ail honourable senators wrnl support me when I say
that, with the eyes of 75 nations upon us, we
must ensure that this event shail be a memorable one for ail participants. Canada is
known in the worid as a friendly country,
actively interested in world affairs, and with a
will to improve communication and understanding among nations. This is our image and
we must make every effort to live Up ta it.
As a parliamentary affair, the responsibility for organizing this important conference naturally fails on the shoulders of
Canadian parliamentarians-both honourable
senators and honourabie members of the
other place-rather than on the Government
itself. Much work in arranging the conference
must be done by members of our fine parliamentary staff .
Honourable senators wiil be interested ta
know that special arrangements have been

set up to ensure the effective organizing of
the conference. First of ail, a joint parliamentary executive committee has been set
up under the joint chairmanship of our
Speaker, the honourable Senator Bourget, and
the Speaker of the other place, the Honourable Mr. Macnaughton. I arn acting as vicechairman of the executive committee. The
Honourable Senator Thorvaidson, whose 'long
experience in the activities of the Interparliamentary Union is well known, is a member
of this committee. Other members of thîs
committee are the following members of the
House of Commons. Mr. Herman M. Batten,
Mr. Alexis Caron, Mr. Rosaire Gendron, Mr.
R. C. Honey, Mr. Gerald Regan, the Honourable Léon Balcer, Mr. George Chatterton,
Mrs. Jean Wadds, Mr. Eric Winkler, Mr.
Colin Canieron, Mr. Maurice Côté and Mr.
Gilles Grégoire. Also on this executive conimittee in an ex officlo capacity are the Secretary of State for Externai Aff airs, the Minister of Trade and Commerce, the President
of the Privy Council, the Minister of Public
Works, and the Associate Minister of National Defence.
There is also an advisory committee on
arrangements that has been set up under the
expert chairmanship of Mr. H. M. Batten,
M.P., to take on the highly important task
of planning ail aspects of the conference. Honourable Senator Thorvaldsion is lending his
experience to this committee also as its deputy
chairman. The members of this committee
are officiais of Parliarnent and carefufly
selected speciallsts from various Governmnent
departments in certain aspects of the conference arrangements.
A speciai conference secretariat has beer.
set up under the executive committee, headed
by Mr. Ian unre who is co-ordinating secretary for parliamentary associations. The secretariat wiil be directly responsible for impiementing the planning carried out by the
arrangements committee. Over the next few
months the secretariat will be drawing in
a team of bilinguae specialists to work fuiltime on the conference arrangements in such
areas as press and public relations, protocol,
transportation, etc., the two officiai languages
of the interparliamentary union being English
and French.
[Translation]
To conclude, honourable senators, I may
say that organizations such as the Interparliamentary Union enable us to hope that
international understanding will improve
constantly. It seems to me that the obvious
thing to do is to quote Mr. André de Blonay,

June 1, 1965

SENATE DEBATES
secretary general of the Interparliamentary
Union. Here is what he said concerning the
53rd Interparliamentary Conference:
The Interparliamentary Union is in
no way a world government, but these
conferences bring together politicians
from all over the world. We do not boast
of being able to solve problems as those
of Cyprus, South Vietnam or the Congo,
but we seek to create a peaceful atmosphere likely to facilitate the settlement of these problems. We hope to contribute to the establishment of a climate
of confidence... by means of personal
contacts and mutual understanding.
Honourable senators, I am convinced that,
to reach this objective, Canada will do its
utmost to welcome the 54th Interparliamentary Conference in September.
[Text]
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, before the debate is adjourned, I
should like to say that we are very indebted
to Senator Dessureault for the comprehensive explanation he has given us of the work
of the last meeting of the Interparliamentary
Union in the City of Copenhagen. The city
itself must have been a fascinating place to
visit, quite apart from the interesting people
one meets, and the topics that were discussed at that meeting. We are very fortunate in having a person of Senator
Dessureault's capacities so wholeheartedly devoted to this work. I know that the Senate
feels he does it an honour in what he is
doing for this organization.
Senator Dessureault is following in the
footsteps of another distinguished member
of this body, namely, Senator Thorvaldson,
who was chairman of the Canadian group
for some time and who performed with
equal competence.

I can understand that Copenhagen is an
interesting place but, speaking for myself, I
thought it unnecessary to say that it was also
very interesting for the executive committee
to meet in Dublin. That must have been a
most satisfactory experience for all members. I am sorry that Senator Brooks is not
in his seat today, because he spoke to me
about that meeting, telling me how much he
enjoyed it and how interested he was in the
work of the executive committee there in
preparation for the very large meeting that
is to be held in Ottawa next September.
We should remind ourselves that this is
by no means a fly-by-night organization. It
has been in existence for over 50 years. Its
54th annual meeting will be held here next

September when some 75 nations, as I understood Senator Dessureault, will be taking
part. That is an honour for Canada, as it is
an honour for this group. It will provide an
opportunity for Canadian parliamentarians
to meet representatives from parliaments of
other countries, and to understand their
points of view and to do something about
clarifying the Canadian position on many
important international matters.
Before concluding I should like to make
one observation which might be a little off
the subject matter of this conference.
Just a week or so ago we were highly
honoured in this chamber in having a distinguished delegation of senators and of
members of the House of Representatives
from the United States. I think we paid due
tribute to them when they were with us.
Today I wish to say a particular word of
appreciation, in which I am sure all honourable senators share, to the members of this
chamber who were members of that delegation, under the joint chairmanship of our
Speaker, the Honourable Maurice Bourget. I
have heard and I know that the work of that
group of honourable senators was a very distinguished contribution indeed. I personally
was proud of what they did.
Honourable senators, let me add that while
I think the delegation from the Congress
of the United States was a highly distinguished group, I also think that the delegation from the Senate of Canada was most
distinguished indeed.
In conclusion, may I say that I hope that
as many honourable senators as can will
take part in the organization and in the
actual work that is to be done at the meeting in September. I think it is a matter that
deserves the attention of members of the
Senate. Moreover, they will do the Senate
honour and Parliament a service if they cooperate as completely as possible with the
various committees which have been set up
to conduct the proceedings in September.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I understand that Senator Brooks would
like to speak on this subject. On his behalf,
I would adjourn the debate until June 14.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette (for Hon.
Mr. Brooks), debate adjourned until June 14

acter completely changed inl sa far as it deals
with the rights and privileges of present
members of this house.
As I say, I do flot know why the change
was made. I could have supported the other
bill. I would not have spoken, had it flot
been changed. If it be a matter of Government policy to retire new senators at age 75
-notwithstanding
the fact that, looking
around this chamber, 1 see many senators
who have passed the age of 75 and wha are
making a great contribution to this chamber
and ta their cauntry-I was prepared ta
accept it.
While 1 was prepared ta accept Part III of
the bill as first intraduced, I arn nat prepared
ta accept it as it now stands. My honourable
friends, Senatars Flynn, Tharvaldsan and
Pouliot, traversed this ground already, and
ail I want ta do is ta say very shartly that
Part III as ariginaily introduced provided
that honourable senators who were, at the
date of caming into effect af the bill, entitled
ta retire at their aption, would receive a
pension, and that upan their death their
wîdaws would receive a portion af that
pension.
Now, honaurable senators, I da nat wish ta
use strong language. I have no idea who influenced the Gavernment in this changesornetimes we think the Government is influenced by people who sit on the opposite
side of the charnber in the other place, but I
say that merely because of what I read in
the newspapers; 1 would have fia idea otherwise-but we now have bef are us what I
would eaUl a blackmailing bill, whîch says, in
effect: You do this or your widow loses her
pension; you take your chances. I do not like
that.
Then we corne ta a further point, as contained in section 15 of the bill. If this section
is passed-if the Senate is supine enough ta
pass it-then it means that next year the
Government can cause a bill ta be passed
providing that hanourable senators shaîl be
paid $1 per session. I say this because section
17, while it is camouflaged as a contribution
ta a pension, bears fia relationship whatever
ta a pension. It is a contribution ta the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The resulting situation is that we give with one hand and we
take away with the ather. Does an honourable
senatar's pension depend upon how many
years he has paid into that fund? Does the
pension his widow receives depend on how
many years he bas paid into that fund? In the
event of bis untimely death, is there a re-

fund of contributions? The answer ta ail these
questions is "No." If section 17 of this bill
is passed, then it is open ta the Government
next year ta bring in a bull ta say that we
shail contribute $1,500, and the following
year $3,000, and a year or two later $1,000
or $12,000. This is a situation where it seems
ta me that there are some matters of principle
involved.
I accepted an appaintment ta this chamber,
and I was very proud ta do so because I feit
that while there must be partisanship in
anything we do in this world, that partisanship was nat the rnost important factor in the
dec!sions made here.
I have been very proud of what I have
seen done in our committees. I resent, and I
expressed resentrnent an a public platform,
the suggestions that the Senate is a useless,
anachronistic body. In fact, I had a charming
young woman corne up ta me in Cobourg on
Monday night, who said that she had sorne
second-hand relationship ta Senator Roebuck.
I would have been palite ta ber anyway,
but this made it more important. She
asked me what I tbought of this question,
and I told ber, though not quite as forcefully as I arn saying it now. She asked,
"Senator McCutchean, does this refarrn the
Senate?" I replied, "Did the retirernent age
of 75 refarm the Bench? In an age when
medical science is rnaking us ail live longer,
did the rules which I took exception ta when
I was in industry, that people must retire
at 65, reform business? This is a bill for
the retirernent of senators, and it has
nothing ta do with Senate refarm at ail."
Then she asked, "What do yau say about
Senate refarrn?" Well, as it was late and I
had ta get into a motar car and came down
here, I had time only ta reply, "That is toa
long a chapter."l
That is nat what we are discussing this
afternoan, because this is nat a bull for
Senate reform. If anybody dlaims it is, then
that is just another façade, of which we
have had quite a few from the present Gavernment.
Hanourable senators, I arn not going ta
take any more of your time. As I say, I
underline and adopt what Senator Flynn
said, what Senator Thorvaldson said, and
what Senator Pouliot said.
I now move in amendrnent, seconded by
Senatar Flynn, that this bill be not now
read the third time, but that it be amended
as follows:
Pages 4 and 5: Strike out Part III and
substitute therefor the failowing:

SENATE DEBATES
PART III
PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PERSONS
SUMMONED TO SENATE BEFORE

COMMENCEMENT OF ACT.

13. In this Part, "Senator" means a
person who was summoned to the Senate before the coming into force of this
Act.
14. The Governor in Council may
grant to a Senator
(a) who has attained the age of
seventy-five years, or
(b) who has become afflicted with
some permanent infirmity disabling him
from the due performance of his duties
in the Senate, if he resigns his place in
the Senate, an annuity equal to twothirds of his sessional indemnity, to
commence at the time his resignation
takes effect and to continue during his
natural life.
15. (1) Where a person who was
granted an annuity under section 14 dies,
the Governor in Council may grant to
his widow an annuity equal to one-third
of the annuity granted to him, to commence immediately after his death and
to continue during her natural life.
(2) An annuity granted to a widow
under this section shall cease on her
remarriage.
(3) No annuity shall be granted under
this section to the widow of a person who
was granted an annuity under section
14 if the widow married such person
after he resigned his place in the Senate.
I might interject here that I am not in
complete accord with these restrictions on
the rights of women to marry from time to
time, but for the purposes of this debate I
accept them.
16. All annuities payable under this
Part shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by
honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
seconded by honourable Senator Hugessen,
that this bill be now read the third time.
In amendment, it is moved by honourable
Senator McCutcheon, seconded by honourable
Senator Flynn, that this bill be not now read
the third time, but that it be amended as
followsHon. Mr. McCu±cheon: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it your pleasure to adopt-

June 2, 1965

Hon. Mr. Croll: No. This strikes me as
being entirely out of order. I should like to
hear it again.
The Hon. the Speaker: In amendment, it is
moved by honourable Senator McCutcheon,
seconded by honourable Senator Flynn, that
this bill be not now read the third time but
that it be amended as follows:
Pages 4 and 5: Strike out Part III and
substitute therefor the following:
PART III.
PROVISIONS

APPLICABLE

TO PERSONS-

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, may I interrupt His Honour
the Speaker for just a moment?
Perhaps it might be desirable to dispense
with a full reading of the motion. If honourable senators wish to hear the full terms of
the amendment, then I have no objection to it
being read. But, as I understand it, the provisions of the amendment are identical to
those that were in Part III of the bill as it
was originally introduced in the other place.
I think we all agree on that one point.
It may well be that to move an amendment
to various sections en bloc, as is proposed
here, would be considered out of order. However, I do not rise on that point at the moment.
It might be as satisfactory to the Senate to
deal with the matter on its merits in that way,
and in that sense it might be appropriate for
me to say a few words in connection with
the speech Senator McCutcheon has made in
support of his amendment. Then perhaps we
should vote on the amendment as moved. Is
that satisfactory to honourable senators?
The Hon.

the Speaker: Is it agreed?

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: What about those who
wish to speak on the motion for third reading?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): They can
speak later.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: After the vote?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes. We
shall revert to the motion for third reading,
and if there are other amendments then we
shall be free to speak to them as well.
I shall not take up much of the time of
honourable senators. Senator McCutcheon used
the word "blackmail" in connection with
certain aspects of this bill. As I understand
the implication it is that there are certain
options given to senators in respect of retire-

June 2, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

ment, some of which involve the taking of
hard decisions or hard choices.
I point out again-and I think this is the
third time I have done so-that in this bill
there is no compulsory retirement. The Patent
that was granted still runs, and honourable
senators are free to remain in the Senate,
regardless of age, on the same conditions on
which they are now in the Senate, and have
been since their appointments. That applies
so far as tenure of office is concerned. There
are choices, but the essential respect for the
Commission as granted is one of the fundamental principles of the bill.
In the second place, Senator McCutcheon
said it would be supine for the Senate to
agree to the provisions of clause 17 of the
bill, which calls for the payment of contributions into a fund.
Hon. Mr. McCuicheon: Into the Consolidated
Revenue Fund.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Into the
Consolidated Revenue Fund, yes. We had a
debate about this earlier. We have talked
about it both here and in the committee. I
hope I have made it clear that this contribution is not intended to be, nor is it in fact,
based upon any actuarial calculation. What
I have said, and what I now repeat, is that
so far as I can ascertain, the majority of the
members of this chamber, in approaching the
matter of retirement for senators and the
payment of annuities or pensions, feel they
should make contributions at the same rate
as in the other place.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yesterday in committee I filed a letter from the
Minister of National Revenue to the effect
that these contributions, generally speaking,
are deductible from income in the year in
which they are made. That will be of some
help to some and perhaps to all honourable
senators.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: With respect to other
contributions, because these are contributions
to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: And they are not
the same contributions as are made under
Part IL.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I quite
appreciate the point that was made by
both Senator Thorvaldson and Senator McCutcheon. I do not justify these payments on
the ground that they are paid into a fund
with a view to building up a sufficient corpus
in it to provide for the payment of the

annuity or pension. But, I say that the
majority of honourable senators desire to
make a contribution at the same rate as is
made in the other place. For that reason I
ask the Senate to vote against this amendment.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
I should like to reply to some of the arguments of the honourable Leader of the Senate. He has said that there is no compulsion
in this bill on present members of this house
to retire.
It is evident to all, I think, that there are
penalties for those who do not retire within
a year if they are already 75, or within a
year after they reach that age. Those penalties are, on the one hand, in the fact that
if they do not retire they risk losing an
annuity for their widows, and, on the other
hand, as long as they remain members of
this chamber they will have to pay a tax of
$720 to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which
amount will not in any manner be refunded
to them if they die in office. If a senator has
not exercised the option of retiring at 75, or
within a year of reaching that age, then it
is only possible for him to receive an annuity
under clause 15(b), that is, by claiming
disability. There may be no direct compulsion,
but there are penalties, and if the word
"blackmail" alone is too strong, I will say
that there is at least "subtle blackmail" in
this bill.
My second point is that the honourable
Leader of the Senate has insinuated that in
opposing Part III as it stands, and in supporting the amendment that Senator McCutcheon has moved, we are in some way
refusing to pay the contribution of 6 per
cent provided by clause 17 of the bill. I hope
that the honourable leader is not insinuating
that this is the real motive for this amendment. It is not that at all, and I want to
put clearly on the record that I do not know
of anybody on this side of the house who
objects to that contribution. We are not
opposing the contribution, but we do want it
to be on a logical basis.
As I have said before, it is not a contribution to a pension fund at all, and this has
been admitted by the honourable Leader of
the Government himself. He has said that
Part III does not provide a real pension
scheme. Therefore, when this contribution is
made, it is made to no avail. It is not a contribution to a pension fund. This is a matter
of principle, as has been indicated by Senator McCutcheon.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I do not
wish to interrupt the honourable gentleman's
trend of thought, but one thing that must
be taken into consideration is the fact that
there must be consideration passing. When
a man gives up a life appointment for the
purpose of retiring, I think that is a factor.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Now the honourable
Leader of the Government is changing his
tune entirely.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Not a
bit. I am adding to it.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On that basis we are in
full agreement. If this equity is compensation for a member of this chamber who has
been appointed for life and who retires at
75, very well.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Or who retires at 80.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Or at 80, yes. But that is
a different basis. The honourable Leader of
the Government knows quite well that this
contribution has no actuarial basis, and that
in many cases it does not represent a contribution to a pension. It is a mere tax. It
would be a tax for those senators who are
already 75, and who do not within a year
decide to resign from their place in the
Senate. It is not a contribution to a pension.
There is no objection in the amendment to
the idea of the contribution, but there is objection to the principle involved in Part III
as it is now proposed, because it is wrong.
That is the only point that is sought to
be made by this amendment at this stage
of the debate.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I think in a way that this bill is a very
personal matter. It is difficult for a senator
of a certain age to look at a senator of
another age and determine how the bill would
affect him. From my own point of view, I
cannot help thinking that the day the bill
becomes law my position will be greatly
enhanced. I shall have the option in a dozen
years or so, if I do not feel well, of retiring
from the Senate on a very good pension. I
have not that option now, but if I became
incapacitated, or were run over by a motor
car, and therefore unable to attend here, I
would get a pension. Having obtained that
pension, if I die my wife gets a pension.
How much I should pay for those privileges,
I do not know; but I cannot think that I
should sit here and accept something and
not be expected to pay something for the
privileges which I do not have now. Therefore, for a person who is capable of working,

June 2, 1965

$60 a month is not too much. For a person
in my position, at least, I find it difficult to
argue that I should take this for nothing.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
may I just enlighten the honourable member
to say that for that amount of $720-and I
shall not go into the background-there are
two advantages. First, there is the advantage
to the widow, which she does not now possess.
Secondly, there is the disability pension
advantage, which not one member of the
Senate who is over 60 years of age can buy
for any price from any insurance company.
Has that not got some value? There may be
some who are under 60 years of age who
are able to buy a disability pension at an
almost prohibitive price on a yearly basis.
The pension benefit at a cost of $720 a year
is the best bargain since the Americans
bought Manhattan Island from the Indians.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We did not ask for that
bargain.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Bedford): The honourable member is missing the point entirely.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
honourable Senator Connolly, (Ottawa West),
seconded by the honourable Senator Hugessen
thatHon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure,
honourable senators, to adopt the motion in
amendment?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those in favour of
the motion in amendment will please say
"Content."
Some Hon. Senators: Content.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those against the
motion in amendment will please say "Noncontent."
Some Hon. Senators: Non-content.
The Hon. the Speaker: In my opinion, the
non-contents have it.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Call in the senators.

The Hon. the Speaker: I declare the
amendrnent lost.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I did not; vote. I was paired with Senator
Bouffard.
Hon. Arthur L. Beaubien: 'Honourable senators, I was paîred with the Leader of the
Opposition, Senator Brooks. If I had voted,
I would have voted against the arnendment.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question now is on the motion for
third reading. It is moved by the honourable
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West), seconded
by the honourable Senator Hugessen, that
this bill be read the third trne. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?

Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Honourable senators, I ask the indulgence of the house to
speak briefly on this particular bill. It was
my intention to speak last week, but I was
unavoidably absent.
I would first take this opportunity to
thank Senator Choquette for his kind remarks this afternoon pertaining to myseif.
On reviewing Hansard, I find that my
esteemed colleague, patient and friend, Senator Thorvaldson, made this remark on May
27, 1965:
It has also become customary to believe that one's physical and mental
powers begin to deteriorate at or near
this age, and that consequently people
in officiai positions should be relieved
of some of their burdens and responsibilities at this period of if e.
I intend to speak in an entirely different
vein.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Read the balance
of what I said.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: After you have heard
me you will realize that, with the great
advance in medical science, some of the
pronouncements in the press in regard to
the aging brain do not hold weight-it certainly holds more than water.
"Youth will be served," we are told.
Young blood makes a fine leaven in politics.
But how old is youth? More than one young
political genius has gone up like a rocket
and corne down like a burned-out stick by
40. Like good wines, some of the best
politicians and statesmen mature late and
stili sparkle with youthful vivacity when
well past their threescore and ten. One of the
most eminent neurophysiologists in the
history of the world, the late Sir Charles
Sherrington, made this statement, a byword
in physiology:
The brain is ... an enchanged loom
where millions of fiashing shutties
weave a dissolving pattern, always a
meaningful pattern though neyer an
abiding one.
'Through the ages the human brain's unique
ability to examine itself wove a changing
Pattern that mirrored the very cultures
it created. Early man regarded his brain as
a mysterious cave of demons; Greek
philosophers viewed it as a vaulted temple
of reason; medieval theologians theorized
that its ventricles cloistered the soul.
In warring 16th century France, Jean Fernel named it the fortress of the sentient soul;

SENATE DEBATES
at the start of the scientific age, Swedenborg
called it an illustrious chemical laboratory.
It was dubbed a garden of trees by Roman
Y Cajal in agricultural Spain; a great ravelled knot, by Sherrington in textileminded Britain. In the electronics era when
brains compare themselves to giant computers, these robots attempt to do the brain's
work. What an exercise in complete futility!
Throughout the whole of recorded history,
old age and senescence have been recognized
as the fate of man, and the Psalmist pointed
out that there is nothing but grief and sorrow
for those who exceed the allotted threescore
years and ten. Meanwhile much thought and
effort have been expended upon an attempt
to rejuvenate or at least to stop the progress
of senescence. Yet in spite of this, we have
remarkably little knowledge of the pathogenesis of old age. There are two quite distinct
possibilities. On the one hand, aging can be
considered as a fundamental biological phenomenon that is characteristie of all living
organisms; that is inevitable and should be
considered physiological. The other proposition is that aging is in itself a disease or
perhaps the response to a disease process.
If this is so, and if all disease could be
prevented, then theoretically an individual
could live indefinitely.
There is considerable evidence to support
each of these theories, and at the present
time there is no means of establishing which
is correct. In the present state of our knowledge it would seem reasonable to take a
middle course, that is, to accept the view
that there is a self-limiting senescence factor
in every organism, but that disease processes
hasten the degeneration.
In any series of autopsies of elderly patients,
in 8 per cent to 10 per cent the pathologist is
unable to determine the cause of death; and,
like the one hoss shay described by Oliver
Wendell Holmes, that showed
A general flavour of mild decay,
But nothing local, as one may say,
which
Went to pieces all at once,
All at once and nothing first,
Just as bubbles do when they burst,
most individuals retain their full mental
capacity well beyond the normal period of
senescence.
It is generally believed that an individual
is born with his full complement of nerve
cells, and that none of his ten thousand million nerve cells is capable of reproducing
itself. During the first two decades of life
the neurones mature and reach their peak

June 2, 1965

efficiency. At this time the individual bas
reached his maximum intelligence and mental
activity, but Dr. John Scott, Professor of
Physiology at the University of Toronto, has
pointed out that after the age of 20 about
50,000 neurones are destroyed daily. I do not
think you need be too upset by this because,
if you calculate it, it will take approximately
400 years to abolish all the neurones.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In one
body?
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: The reason for this
degeneration is not known; trauma certainly
plays a part. The upright posture is at best
unstable, and with the modern tendency to
leave an automobile through the windshield,
trauma undoubtedly contributes.
For years, intelligence is maintained in spite
of the decreasing number of neurones. Authentic research studies show that the genius
retains his advantage in spite of this atrophy.
In spite of this vast array of pathological
material, there is very little known of the
physiology of the senile brain. It seems not
unreasonable to assume that with cortical
atrophy there will be reduced cerebral function. The amazing thing is the degree of
cortical atrophy that can be associated with
relatively normal vigorous mental behaviour.
The late Sir Winston Churchill is no exception.
Sir William Osler once said:
A very large proportion of the evils
(of the world) may be traced to the
sexagenarians-nearly all of the great
mistakes politically and socially, all the
worst poems, most of the bad pictures, a
majority of the bad novels, not a few of
the bad sermons and speeches.
The internationally renowned world authority, Dr. Wilder Penfield, for all his admiration
for Sir William, expressed in so many ways,
disagrees with this idea. Indeed, he bas written
an essay explaining his disagreement with the
whole thesis of the uselessness of sexagenarians as expressed by Osler in "The Fixed
Period". And well may he disagree-for he
epitomizes the sexagenarians, octogenarians
and even nonagenarians who continue to
contribute to the world in spite of, or in
ignorance of, Osler's dictum.
Penfield's personal solution to this question
is contained in the title essay of his recently
published book, The Second Career. This
book, incidentally, is dedicated to Osler.
... this, it

seems to me, is

certain:

every year from birth to death has its
purpose and should have its use... The

June 2, 1965

June 2 1965SENATE
DEBATES

Urne of retirement should be reorganized
and renamed. It is the Urne for embarking
on a new career, perhaps the last career,
but not necessarily a less enjoyable one;
flot, perhaps, a less useful one ta society
*... A second career
can quite well begin
at the age of sixty. It should start by
then at the latest, even if formai retirement takes place at sixty-five or later.
His preparation for a second career should
be undertaken long before ......
The inevitable question is:, What wîll be
Dr. Penfield's next contribution? There can
be no regrets at flnding Osier wrong on this
subject. We awe much to our sexagenarians,
and it is weli to keep this fact i mind.
This Senate, this essential branch of our
bicameral, canstitutional, manarchial system
bas been unnecessarily and wantonly insulted.
For my part, this Senate certainly needs no
defence from such guttersnipe tactics. 1 consider the source fromn which it carne. You
knaw what these self-styled inteilectuals are.
They are those who are chiefly characterized
by the wrinkled brow and the ponderous voice
and who grind out the meanderings of their
minds and newspaper writings in an agonized
tone. They are those whose mental agitation
inevitably resuits in the trend of the timemotion without progress and with intellectual
lnn sequitur, but they seldom praduce intelligent applications. Indulgence in a type of
mental acrobatics bas alsa became identified
as inteilectualisrn. In addition to being able
to stand reason on its head and leave it in
the corner, many pseudo-intellectuals corne
to the point where they refine the reasoning
process to a point where it becames utterly
useless-a refinernent without any constructive contribution. Too many of these so-cailed
inteilectuais have simply been educated
beyond their intelligence.
Some Han. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: We must ail live private
lives, layrnen and scientists alike. We must
run aur course before an answer can corne
frorn science, and every thinking man must
adopt for himself a faith to ive by. He rnay
take the best from man's ancient faiths. He
must make the assurnptions he considers
reasonabie as to the creation of the warid
and of mankind.
In the summer of 1960 in London, at the
300th anniversary of the founding of the
Royal Saciety, the oldest scientific body in
the world, President Sir Cyril Hinshelwood
made this staternent:
The men af science themselves, as far
as can be judged, have nurnbered about

the sarne proportion of religious believers
as the generality of people. Nor have
they been conspicuausly iess weil endowed with kindness or marality.
Finally, there is within us, each of us, the
greatest wonder of ail, the human brain. It
holds a mirrar up to the mind of man, sa
rnan rnay see the stars and look inta the
future. With its help he rnay turn, as here
and naw, ta exarnine the civilizatian he bas
birnself created. And finaily, using the brain
ta study the brain, man may succeed in the
discovery of the nature of his own mi, and
perhaps the purposes of God. Sa states
Penfield.
So, honourable senators, that brain in the
camparatively healthy individual, supported
by bis competent medical adviser, functians
just as well at 75 as it does at 25, anly with
greater experience, greater wisdam, more
saund judgment, and reliable, steadfast purpose.
I support this legisiatian lin the main, but
with same reservatians as it applies ta al
rny coileagues af the age under discussion in
the bill.
Han. Jean-François Pouliot: Hanaurable
senatars, I feit rather depressed this afternaan until I beard aur rnast honoured calleague, that learned medical man, Senatar
Sullivan, tell us that accarding ta bis goad
judgrnent, and the autharity that he has
quated, we have all retained aur mental
capacity. It was a relief for me ta hear such
a learned autharity say that.
I did not vate on the arnendment far a
very goad reasan. It is that when I spoke in
the first place on this bill I suggested that
the arnount of the pension shouid be the same
as that ai the indemnity, $1,000 a month, and
that tbe widaws shauld receive hall af it, ar
$500 a rnonth. Afterwards I heard samebody
say that it was undignified for us senators ta
ask for persanal advantages from any piece af
legisiation. I cannot accept that idea. It is nat
a question af asking far mare than we have.
It is a questian af holding aur own, af keeping
what we already have instead af having a
change made ta it by anyane. It seems ta me
very definite.
I have two objections. I find it rnost unfair
ta compare the Senate ta the House of Cammons with regard ta the indemnity, because
we are appointed for Jife and the members
af the House af Commans are elected for a
definite tenure, which is the term af a Parliament. It is nat at ahi the same.

SENATE DEBATES

Another matter which I mentioned earlier,
and which has not been referred to lately, is
the comparison between judges and senators.
Formerly, the judges were appointed for life,
and now they are appointed until they reach
the age of 75 years. It is a parallel situation
in that regard. The difference is that their
salary is higher than our indemnity, and their
widows receive a pension which is much
higher than that proposed in the bill for
widows of senators.
You will remember, honourable colleagues,
that for a time the senators were above the
judges in the Table of Precedence, and then
some years ago the order was changed and
senators were relegated to a position below
the judges. I do not know why the Government of the day made that change, but from
Confederation until the fifties-1953 or 1954
-on the Table of Precedence the senators
were ahead of at least judges of the Superior
Court in the Province of Quebec. Now the
order has been changed. How far such
changes will go, I do not know.
Unfortunately, I was unavoidably absent
yesterday and could not attend the sitting of
the committee. However, in conclusion, I
would like to ask a question of the Leader
of the Government. It is this: What will be
the procedure in order to obtain a pension
for senators who are incapacitated? Will it
be necessary to undergo a medical test before a board of some kind, or will a medical
certificate from the family doctor be sufficient evidence?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In
answering the honourable senator, I do not
think I can give a firm commitment as to
what the regulations will provide. As I said
earlier, I would think a properly authenticated certificate from a recognized medical
authority, coupled with the resignation,
would be the reasonable requirement.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I hope you will pardon me if I make
a few remarks on the third reading of this
bill. I have been prompted to do so by the
speech made by the honourable Senator Sullivan. However, my remarks will not be of a
valedictory nature.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As you know, I have
been a member of the Senate for many years.
In fact, I have been a member longer than
any of the senators I see present today.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You are
the dean.

June 2, 1965

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It bas always been my
opinion that the Senate has performed a
very valuable function, and I want to see
it become even stronger, more vital and nonpartisan than it has been up to the present
time.
I am 75 years of age, honourable senators,
but I feel about 60 years of age or less. On
that account, if this bill becomes law I have
absolutely no intention of resigning.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I voted for the amendment with mental reservations, because I
am not concerned, and I do not think any one
of us is, with regard to the payment of the
$720 a year from our indemnities. But there
does arise here the possibility of a principle
being involved. That is what the mover and
seconder of the amendment had in mind and
wished to emphasize. I am not concerned at
all about the financial provisions of this bill,
but I am vitally concerned about the future
composition of the Senate membership.
When I was appointed to this chamber the
Right Honourable Arthur Meighen was
Leader of the Government, and he had a
fairly substantial majority, but there was
also a substantial opposition membership. As
time went on that majority dwindled, until
in 1957 there were only five senators forming the Opposition in this Chamber. They
were: Senator John T. Haig, Senator Horner,
Senator Quinn, Senator Marcotte and myself.
And that, in my opinion, was not a healthy
situation.
As our members were passing away and
as our forces were dwindling, I remember
that we had a long debate here on the functions and usefulness of the Senate, and related matters. I remember some of the
speeches which were made at that time,
because, as I say, the members of the Opposition were becoming fewer all the time.
The consensus of several senators was that in
order to make and keep the Senate effective
the Opposition should always be kept at a
level of at least one-third of the total membership. That is about the way it stands
right now. Therefore, if a Conservative
member of the Senate, upon reaching the
age of 75 years of age, resigns, he should be
replaced by another Conservative.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Put that to a vote!
Hon. Mr. Aselline:
What I fear is that if
signations takes place
dicated by the press,

That is my opinion.
a large number of reat this time, as is init is the intention of

June 2, 1965

DEBATES

the Government to fill any vacancies that
ccur through such resignations: and if they
are ail replaced by the Liberal Government,
the Senate will for 10, 15 or 20 years be a
Liberal stronghold. That would be a bad
thing for the Senate and the public of Canada.
1 would flot like to have that happen. I think
ail honourable senators agree with me when
I make that statement. However, there is a
possibility of that happening, and if it did
happen it might resuit in the abolition of
the Senate.
My objeet i speaking is to ask the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Connolly, Otawa West) if he can give us
a statement on titis aspect, as to what is
likely to happen if a great number of senators on either one or other side of the house
resign.
That is ail I wish ta say at the present
moment.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I was not present for the debate
on the motion for second reading of this
bill. As I was unavoidabiy detained elsewhere, for what I think was a good reason,
perhaps I may be aiiowed to make my position clear on third reading.
In the first place, let me say that in my
opinion this is a good bill. There are many
details that might be discussed, and some to
which caustic criticism might be applied, but
on balance iAis, in my judgment, a good bill.
It was flot conceived in anger or jealousy.
It was not introduced in the other place for
the purpose of taking it out on the Senate,
or anything of that kind. It is very obviously
a measure produced by friendly thought by
those who have given consideration to the
subject.
Having made those general observations,
aliow me ta go on ta state my position as a
matter of principle with respect ta the retirement of senators compuisarily at 75 years of
age.
My honourable friend, Senatar Hugessen, a
few minutes aga recailed that we had a bill
before us at one time changing the retirement
age of civil servants. That was back in the
late fifties. At that time the retirement age
of civil servants was reduced fram 70 ta 65.
I opposed that measure with ail the strength
I possessed. I moved the house into committee of the whoie, and I took the lead an
one side, whiie Senator Hugessen took it on
the other, and we debated this question fuily
for a haîf day.
1 was opposed to a reduction of the age for
retirement for the simple reason that I

thaught that civil servants at 65 or 70 years
of age were at the very maximum of their
abilities and at the greatest point of efficiency
in their lives. It might be a different matter
if they were digging ditches, but nat when
they were using their minds, experience and
integrity in the public interest. Yet, we passed
that measure, and I think the application of
it has been brutal, as I said it would be.
It was the young men at that time wha
were pushing out the old boys in order to get
their jobs. That was the situation at that
time. I remember quoting Shakespeare's
words, having in mind that it would not be
long before the young men wouid be the aid
men:
.. this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of aur poison'd
chalice
To aur awn lips.
I warned them the time wauld very soon
come-and mare quickly than they antîcipated
-when they themselves would be pushed out
of office by that measure, and forced ta change
their ways of 11f e in their deciining years.
I arn oppased in a general way ta compulsary
retirement; at fixed ages.
Sa far as this bill is concerned, let me be
a littie mare specific. I like this bill for twa
particular reasans. In the first place it permits
a senatar ta retire valuntarily when he is no
langer able ta carry an his duties as a senator.
That, I think, is a very humane and necessary
pravision. I shail nat; go into detail; you al
have it in yaur minds.
The secand thing I like about the bill is
that it recognizes the right of the senator
appointed for if e ta remaîn a senator for ife
if lie so desires. I would neyer have accepted
the office of senatar if it had been offered ta
me on a himited basis for a certain number
of years oniy, or until I attained a certain
age. 1 wauld neyer have came here under
those circumstances. I would have taken my
chance in my constituency, and remained lin
the House af Commons. I like that pravision.
Ta continue what I was saying about retirement, I point out that I have expressed the
opinion over and over again that the retirement of senatars at 75, or at any other fixed
age, wiil not improve the positian of the
Senate. It will nat imprave its efficiency,
and abave ail it wiil nat; imprave its independence of thauglit.
The chief characteristic of senators, lindividually and as a body, is their independence of thought. In the past when we were
here for if e we had nothing ta hope for and
nothing to fear, and so could disregard aurselves, aur own future, and think only of the

SENATE DEBATES
public interest. But just as soon as retirement
is introduced, then a senator must think of
what he will do after retirement. It may be
that he has plenty of money on which to
live, but money is not everything. Man does
not live by bread alone. One of the things
that keeps people healthy is activity. The
mind deteriorates, said Senator Sullivan, if
it is not used. Is not that right? The way to
remain young is to keep active, and never
cease being active.
As soon as a senator realizes that the time
is approaching when he must give up his
career as a senator he must consider what he
will do when the time arrives, and this destroys the situation in which he has nothing
to hope for and nothing to fear. He must hope
for something-something to do, something
to occupy him, some method by which he can
produce and make his contribution continuous-and sa he is approachable. He may be
offered something after he retires, and governments, as you know, have a lot of nice
things to offer people who support them, but
not to the others. There are all sorts of nice
things for the good boys, but very few for
the others.
The chief characteristic of this chamber,
and of the individuals who comprise it, will
not be beneficially affected by retirement at
75 years of age. I want a record of my statement that what we are about to do will
not improve the Senate. It will not make it
more independent; it will make it less independent. For that reason, I am sorry to see
this bill become law.
I know that I am in the minority in that
view, and that this provision ta retire senators at a certain age is in the cards, and
that my expression of opinion is, of course,
futile. It will not alter the clause in question
but, nevertheless, I should like it recorded
that at this time I express the opinion that
this retirement of others-not of myself but
of others-in the days ta come will not improve the Senate.
I have always thought, and I have said so
publicly and in print, that the way ta improve
the Senate is not ta change the rules but,
rather ta improve the senators. My friend
Senator Aseltine has been talking along the
sarne line. He spoke of the leaders of the
past. Well, we have sorne pretty capable leaders of the present, but the way ta improve
the Senate is ta diversify the appointments,
and ta choose men of high calibre. This can
only be done by intelligent selection. I think
our present method is probably the best that
can be devised, although the appointments

June 2, 1965

are made by humans with all their frailties
and mistakes.
Having placed these views on the record,
let me say that I am not opposed ta this $720
contribution. The money feature of the senators' position has never interested me
greatly. If it had, I would not be here, for
I could have been far better off by remaining
in my own practice. That applies ta a good
many others around me. If it were money that
we were thinking about, most of us would not
be here at all. Sa I am perfectly satisfied tomake a contribution of $720. I can afford that
because, ta begin with, it is not $720, since
the payment is deductible for income tax purposes.
Senator McCutcheon argued that if we can
be charged $720 this year, we can be charged
$1,500 next year, $3,000 the year after, and
so on. I believe be went up ta $10,000. Of
course, the answer is that if a measure of that
kind came before us we would simply say
no. We are saying yes today because we are
being given a quid pro quo at least equal to
the amount of our contribution. That is one
reason why I am satisfied with the contribution.
The fact that in the Commons they make
such a contribution does not impress me
greatly. What does impress me is that I am
getting the protection of an insurance against
the results of possible future infirmity, should
it came ta pass-and it may come, I hope a
long time from now. That is worth at least
$720 a year, and possibly very much more.
It is an assurance, it gives me confidence as
I look forward into the future, and I am
ready ta accept the payment.
There is one more feature of the bill about
which I would like ta express an opinion.
Section 15 says, "The Governor in Council
may grant ta a senator. . ." We have been
assured by the officials of the Finance Department and the Justice Department that "may"
is equivalent ta "shall". One of the officials
said it was unthinkable that any government
would deal with that section except on the
basis of "shall". I think that is sa with regard
ta any government we have had in Ottawa
within my memary, which goes back a long
way. But who can give us any guarantee as
ta the governments of the future, or what
motives may actuate governments who send
us measures which we may or may not
approve? Who can tell what they will do in
the future, when you give them the power
ta say "yes" ta those people they like, and
"no" ta those they do not like? That power
is there, and we should not take chances in
regard ta it.

June 2. 1965

June 2 1965SENATE
DEBATES

I amrn ot at ail afraid of what the decisions
may be so far as I arn personally concernied,
but I can see that once again it affects the
independence of thought of the senators. I can
fancy that those who read this phrase may
figure that it would be wise on their part to
stand in with the powers that be, lest it
affect their future. The person may be entirely
mistaken, but the wording is wide open to that
interpretation by ourselves and those who
Winl follow us.
I do flot like that word "rnay"l. It is explained that the word is used in the civil service legisiation and appears in the Judges Act.
That may be so, but 1 think the comparison
does flot stand. Judges and civil servants are
not in our position. We must make decisions
of great import with regard to governiment
measures. Our independence of thought is
our chief virtue; without it we are no good
at ail. We do not function effectively unless
we think independently and honestly, and
disregard our own interests.
Honourable senators, I would like to see
that word "rnay" changed, but were I to
move an amendment it would not carry. However, I wish rny thought to be piaced on the
record that I do not like It.
Thank you, honourable senators, for listening to me, in view of the fact that I was
not here on second reading. I think we shal
be happy with this bill as the years go by.
It rnay be that sorne changes Winl be rnade
in it. I hope that the tirne Winl corne when
senators Winl be allowed to retire irrespective
of the year of decision. I think it is unfair
that one who does flot care about the service
hie rnay render, and so retires frorn the Senate, takes his pension and that of his widow
as a matter of course while others, like rnyself, and Senator Aseltine, suffer a disadvantage because we feel our time for contribution has flot yet ended, and accordingly do
not wish to retire. We have rnade our
contribution in the past, and we feel that we
have a contribution to make in the future.
Consequently, in the public interest, as weil as
for our own peace of mind, we will not retire.
Irrespective of the chances we take in that
regard, we shall continue with our service. It
is rather hard, I think, that under those
circumstances we are treated less advantageously than one who, taking his duties
lightly, retires in his own interests within
the year.
However, honourable senators, on the
whole, on balance, it is a pretty good bill.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh: Honourable
senators, I was surprised and pleased to hear

so many excellent speeches on third reading.
1 have a special reason for speaking today,
because I think this is a good bull, and especially so with regard to those who may retire
because of illness.
In my own case, I have already passed the
age of 75 by a couple of years, and I expect
this may be the last time 1 shall rise to speak
in the Senate. I expect to retire very shortly,
and this is my valedictory and au revoir.
Hon. M. Gratian O'Leary: Honourable senators, may I detain the house for a few
moments longer. I did intend to off er some
observations touching upon the age of 75,
an age about which I arn a bit sensitive.
However, I want to refer to the thought
expressed by Senator Aseltine, when hie asked
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Connolly, Ottawa West) what sort of senator
would replace him, and in fact me, in the
event of our retirernent.
I want to say at once that when I leave the
Senate, whether by resignation or by something more drastic, I sincerely hope that
'Whoever the Prime Minister is, whether
Liberal or Conservative, he will not replace
me by some sculptor, but will replace me by
a good, hard-fighting politician, a man who
knows what politics and governrnent are ail
about.
Sors. Han. Senatars: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): I have been
long enough in the newspaper world not to
pay too much attention to what is said by
certain newspapers ini a politicai way; but I
have here before me a quotation from a paper
for which I have a great deal of respect. The
editor and publisher of the Toronto Star, Mr.
Beland H. Honderich, is a personal friend, a
journallst of high distinction, and a man heid
in esteem by journalists everywhere. Further,
I think the Toronto Star is one o! the three
or four great newspapers in Canada. Let me
now quote what was said by the Toronto
Star on May 22:
The day Prime Minister Pearson begins
naniing to the Senate distinguished Canadians who have neyer done a lick of work
for the Liberal party is the day Senate
reforrn will begin.
It went on to say:
0f the nine new senators named since
the Liberals took office, exactiy nine are
Liberal organizers and fund raisers.

SENATE DEBATES
Further:
Pensioning off the doddering ancients
will not reform the Senate as long as
another Liberal bagman struts in for
every senator who shuffles out.
And further:
The sole advantage of the Retirement
Bill, passed by the Commons this week
is that $8,000 a year pension may inspire
some senators to doze at home rather
than in the Red Chamber, and thus open
up some new seats.
It then went on to say that:
Mr. Pearson should name to the Senate
worthy Canadians, not necessarily Liberal, from the arts, the professions, from
academic life.
Honourable senators, I have been reading,
during the past two weeks, the convocation
addresses of eminent persons before our
various universities, and almost invariably
these men stressed the need to get young
Canadians interested in public life. They
pleaded with students to go out and get into
the dusty arena of practical politics and thus
to help serve their country. But, honourable
senators, according to the Toronto Star's
editorial, which has been repeated again and
again in the Press of Canada during the past
three or four weeks. when it comes to appointing persons to this house, politicians are
to be regarded as lepers and the house is to
be filled with musicians, sculptors, painters,
and so on. Honourable senators, that is nonsense!
Does anybody in this house believe that
Confederation would have ever come in this
country if we had to wait until the
musicians, the sculptors and the painters got
together to bring it about?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or the professors.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Politicians
built the British Commonwealth, politicians
brought about Confederation-professional
politicans-the sort of people who, according
to the Toronto Star, should be barred from
the Senate. The way to make this Senate
efficient, the way to make it distinguished
and honourable, is to decry the politicians,
keep out, at all costs, the men who have been
working at politics and in public life all their
lives, and bring in academics!
Honourable senators, this house is not a
hall of fame, this bouse is not a theatre, this
bouse is not a substitute for an order of
merit. If we wish to honour our distin-

June 2, 1965

guished painters, writers, sculptors and so on,
let us have an order of merit. But let us not
get this notion that we should fill this chamber with such people. This is nonsense.
What is wrong with professional politicians? Burke, of whom they said that he
gave up to party what was meant for mankind, was a politician. Pitt was a professional
politician; Fox was a professional politician;
and Canning, Disraeli, and Gladstone were
consummate professional politicians. So was
the immortal Churchill, and so was Lloyd
George.
If you go to American history, who are
the men most honoured? Clay and Calhoun,
and Daniel Webster, and Randolph of
Roanoke; and last, but not least, a politician
to the very core, Abraham Lincoln.
And who were the men, after all, who
brought about Confederation in this country?
They were the professional politicians of
their day: John A. Macdonald, George
Etienne Cartier, Thomas D'Arcy McGee, and
so down the line.

In truth, practically every achievement in
this country that bas been made for the good
of Canada has come about by the toil and
the work and the sacrifice of professional
politicians.
The Toronto Star referred to the appointments made by Mr. Pearson as "bagmen."
Honourable senators, what is wrong, what
is unethical about a so-called bagman, about
a man who tries to make the two-party system work? We extol the two-party system,
we say it is vital to our way of life, to our
way of Government. I have before me a
quotation from Sir Winston Churchill:
Politics is not a game. It is an earnest
business.
Party government is an outstanding
feature of our political systems of all
branches of the English-speaking race all
over the world. I know of no equal force
which assumes the stability of democratic institutions.
What, then, is wrong with a man if, realizing that the two-party system cannot be
operated without financial support, that man
goes out to get money for his party?
Ever since 1911, 55 years ago, I have contributed my mite to my party. I have again
and again given of my time and energy,
often free of charge, to parties-and I am
proud of it.
They tell you that the men who give to
parties give with a lively expectation of
favours to come. I should like to give just

June 2, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

one incident from my own personal experience. There was a man in this city some
years ago-he is dead now-P. D. Ross, honoured and esteemed in this country from
coast to coast. I remember that in the election of 1948, P. D. Ross lay near death's door.
One day I had a call from his nurse, asking
me if I would go down to see him. When I
arrived at his bedside, he said to me, "O'Leary
how is the election going?" I had to give
him the most optimistic report I could, but
I did not feel too confident. Then he said,
"I suppose we need money." I replied, "Mr.
Ross, political parties always need money
during an election." He said to his nurse,
"Bring me my cheque book," and she did
Éo. He could barely sign his name, but he
wrote a cheque for $10,000 and he gave it to
me, saying, "Give this to the appropriate
people." I protested, because I knew he did
not have that kind of money then, but he
said to me with indignation, "Whose money
is this?" He died four days later and did
not see the results of the election. This was
not a case of a man contributing to a political party with hope of reward.
As Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) will
appreciate, P. D. Ross served in every capacity-in civic government he served as an
alderman, as a school trustee, as a controller,
and fimally he offered himself for the mayoralty. The day after he made his offer, he
received a letter containing a cheque for
$1,000. It was from the most militant Liberal
in Ottawa, a man whose Irish shillelagh seldom slept in his hand, the Honourable Charles
Murphy. But did the Honourable Charles
Murphy ever expect a reward from P. D.
Ross, the outstanding Conservative? Too
many people do not seem to understand
these things.
I can give you another example. In 1958
we were organizing in this city the National
Conservative Convention. We were told it
would cost about $20,000 and that Ottawa
had to raise the money. I was chairman of a
committee raising the money and one day
I met a man, perhaps the second most distinguished Liberal in Ottawa. He asked me
how we were getting on. I told him about the
convention, that it would cost about $20,000.
He said, "O'Leary, I believe in the two-party
system; I believe in the continuance of the
Conservative Party. Will you give me the
privilege of financing one-quarter?" And he
sat down and wrote a cheque then and there.
He did not expect any reward from the Conservative Party.
22624-13

Honourable senators, this is a thing which
is eating at the very vitals of our party
system, making it harder and harder to get
young men to come into politics, to get down
into the dusty arena of politics, to do its
menial chores--and the reason is the vilification of public men.
I repeat that, when I quit this Senate, whoever may be Prime Minister I hope he replaces me by a good staunch party man who
has worked at party politics, and not by a
man who, as I said, is good at music or sculpturing.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I do not wish to prolong this debate,
but the remarks by Senator O'Leary prompt
me to say that I am glad he said what he did.
I like this bill because it does not force anything on anybody, and those who are here at
the present time can carry on as if this bill
were not passed.
It does mean an option for those who wish
to take advantage of it. That is al I am going
to say on this aspect of the bill.
There is a good deal of concern and apprehension in the country, if this bill passes, as
to what the Government is going to do. I
hope, along with Senator O'Leary (Carleton),
that when the time comes for replacing senators who retire, Prime Minister Pearson will
appoint some outstanding individual who may
have been an active Conservative politician
or an active member of the N.D.P.
I mention as a rather sad coincidence that
a short time ago I happened to meet a man
who was beloved of us all for many years,
the late George Nowlan. I joked with him
about when he was coming to the Senate. He
would have been a distinct acquisition to this
chamber, and he would have loved it.
I think also of another man who is leaving
the other place which, in my view, will not be
the same when he leaves. I refer to Bert
Herridge, the Laird of the Kootenays. I am
sure that his appointment would lend distinction to the Senate. It has been suggested that
the Senate should not be to too great an
extent a partisan place, but at the same time
we must be realistic and recognize that there
is a place here for people who, as Senator
O'Leary (Carleton) has said, have played an
active role in promoting the political principles in which they believe. I have said in
times past that if I was reforming the Senate
I would have to recognize this reality because
I think you must have political people in the
Senate. However, we might think of making
a division in the membership. For example,
we have 102 members, and if I were dictator

SENATE DEBATES
for a day I would say that we should allocate
20 to 22 places to people in business, the professions and the arts, who have distinguished
themselves in their various fields, and for the
rest I would appoint the most vital and
dynamic politicians to be found. Then the
Senate would be a lively place.
My final word is to emphasize that this is
not a Senate reform bill but a Senate retirement bill. I am glad Senator O'Leary
(Carleton) spoke as he did, and I hope the
powers that be, whoever they may be, will
in the future rise entirely above party political considerations in making appointments to
this body.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, if no one else wishes to speak at the
moment I would like to reply to some of the
remarks that have been made. Since this is
third reading, what I have to say does not
close the debate-but I hope it will!
May I first thank Dr. Sullivan for the contribution he has made today.
Some honourable senators have referred
to personal experiences. I hope it will not be
considered inappropriate if I refer to the
time I came into this chamber, 12 years ago
this month. I was rather young among the
senators, some of whom were old enough to
be my father, and indeed some were old
enough to have been my grandfather. But
every one of the older and more experienced
senators to whom I applied for assistance and
advice gave it, not only gladly but so generously that I was overwhelmed. No doubt
this has been the experience of all honourable
senators when they first entered the chamber.
This has long been a tradition of this chamber. The older senators have taken the
younger appointees under their wing and
advised them on how they could best contribute to the work of this chamber and of
Parliament. Many of those senators are still
in this chamber today, and for that reason
I shall not mention any names. I therefore
appreciate the force of what Senator Sullivan
has said, and of what Senator Roebuck has
said.
Honourable senators, I find very deep personal satisfaction in the fact that under this
bill no senator is put out of the Senate. And
even though Senator Flynn charges, if I may
use that word, that the persuasion is powerful, the fact remains that a senator who desires to continue to hold the appointment as
originally bestowed upon him can do so.
Referring to the point made by Senator
Aseltine, I do not see how anybody could

June 2, 1965

stand in this chamber and give an assurance
about future appointments. These appointments, as we all know, are made by order in
council, and they are in effect, practically, a
personal prorogative of the Prime Minister.
I would be less than realistic if I did not
say that by and large the appointments made
to this chamber in the past have generally
followed the party line. There have been
exceptions. In recent years Mr. St. Laurent
appointed a very distinguished and beloved
member of this chamber, Senator John
Hackett. Mr. St. Laurent also appointed a
gentleman who is with us in the chamber
today, who described himself as an Independent and has followed that role, namely,
Senator Molson. These were exceptional appointments, and they have been applauded
throughout the country. I hope that similar
appointments may be possible on many more
occasions in the future. I hope it will not be
so exceptional that we shall be able to count
only two such appointments among our
numbers.
I hope I am not doing a disservice to some
honourable senators in making the following
comment, but I do believe, as Senator McCutcheon bas said-and in saying this I desire to pay tribute to all honourable senators
-that by and large the party line is not as
obvious here as it is in the other place. I
think the Senate and Parliament generally is
a better place for this.
Referring to the point made by Senator
Cameron, I cannot see how anybody could
lay down a rule such as he has suggested for
the making of appointments. The manner
which he has suggested is followed in other
Senates, but we have not yet come to that in
this country. I know to what extent Senator
Aseltine speaks from experience when he
refers to the "small guard of Opposition senators" up to 1957. But speaking as Leader of
the Government and also personally, I say
that I hope that this situation will not be
repeated here. I do not know how far along
the line one can go, but I would hope that in
the years to come, good judgment and wise
statesmanship, while the present method of
appointment continues, will result in a fair
distribution of seats between the two parties
in this chamber.
Honourable senators, I have made a resolution this afternoon that is not going to be
voted on. About a month ago, for the first
time in my life, I wrote a letter to a newspaper, the Globe and Mail.

June 2, 1965

June 2 1965SENATE
DEBATES

I wrote it because I was concerned at the
attitude taken by th-at newspaper ta the type
of persan appointed to the Senate. The Gavernment and the Prime Minister were criticized because some of the appointees were,
let me say in a general way, political persons.
I wish I had waited until after today to do so,
because I do flot think a letter ta the press
caunts tao much. Hawever, I hope those partions of Senator O'Leary's speech which bear
upan the paint will be noted in every newspaper across this cauntry.
Hlon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Senator
O'Leary referred ta a man wham he described
as being as partisan a Liberal as ever lived,
and we bath knew him well. He was a
respected member af this chamber, Senatar
Charles Murphy.
When I was a very yaung man and had
been out of this cauntry and was returning
ta study law, hie talked ta me about my
future. He said, "I think you are very foolish.
You have a career in the universities. You
will be taking a chance coming inta a profession in Canada." I replied, "'Really, the
reason that I wauld like ta return is ta participate in the public li!e of this country."
He pointed out the risks. And risks there
are-ta family and ta fortune. But I do agree
with what Senator O'Leary has saiýd, as I arn
sure ail of us do. If the level of activity in
the public life of this country is ta see the
improvement required, if the public life of
this country is ta keep up with the industrial,
commercial, financial, intellectual and artistic life of this country, then the best yaung
people must be induced ta enter public ife
and ta participate in the work o! the political
parties which make public life aperate.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Hanourable -senators, I cammend the third reading
af this bill ta the Senate.
The Han. the Speaker: It is moved by the
honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),

C03MPANY-SECOND READING
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading o! Bill S-14, respecting The
Pacific Coast Fire Insurance Campany.
He said: Hanourable senators, after the
splendid speeches we have heard this afternoon on Bill C-98, I arn sure you ail realize
that it is a mundane matter naw ta proceed
ta the second reading of a bull which has
as its only purpose the changing of the name
of a company. However, that is the purpose
of Bill S-14, namely, ta change the naine af
The Pacific Caast Fire Insurance Company
ta The Century Insurance Company o! Canada, in English. The bull also provides for a
French version of the company's name, La
Compagnie d'Assurance Century du Canada.
It further pravides for an increase in the
capitalization af the company from $1 million ta $2 million.
Honourable senatars, many years ago,
this company was originally incarporated as
a provincial company in the Province of
British Columbia. Later it applied ta Parliament and received a federal charter, and
since that time has operated as a federal
company. Its head office is in the city of
Vancouver, British Columbia, and it carnies
on business throughout Canada.
I hope that this bull will now receive
second reading.

COMWiTTEE
PROCEEDINGS

the Senate will be adjourned, subject to recail, until June 22.
At the present time in the other place they
are discussing rules which are peculiar to the
conduct of their proceedings. This is not a
matter which will result in any legislation to,
be deait with by us.
The Bank Act is, I understand, the next
item of legislation to be considered in the
other place. The bill to extend or renew the
charters of the banks 15, of course, one which
will go to a committee of that house and wull
probably be there for some time. So we canflot expect any immediate legislation from
that source. Following that, I believe they are
to consider the resolutions with respect to the
budget legislation.
It may be that some of those pieces of legislation will be available before June 22, and if
they are urgent 1 will be in communication
with His Honour the Speaker with a view to
having the Senate recalled. If there is any
other piece of urgent legislation sent to us
from the other place in the meantime, both
Mr. Speaker and I wîll be available and we
will, of course, keep the Senate informed.
This afternoon the Standing Committee on
External Relations will meet immediately
after the Senate rises, and I would ask as
many honourable senators as possible to
attend that meeting.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. A. K<. Hugessen, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, presented the following report
of the committee on Bill S-3, to incorporate
the Ottawa Terminal Railway Company:
Your Committee recommends that authority be granted for the printing of 800

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, May
26, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Aird, for an address
in reply thereto.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators, I am perhaps somewhat to blame for
causing a modification in the order of presentation of bills during the recent part of
the session. I want to excuse myself for
that. I would like to excuse myself also for
being unable to speak entirely in English
with respect to a bill of great importance,
particularly since it was framed in the English
language in the original and is so important
in the English language as well as in the
French language.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, may I apologize for
having often missed the sittings of this honourable house. On my doctor's advice, I had
to take a rest due to a nervous condition.
However, notwithstanding the emotional stress
I may experience, I thought it was my duty
to off er you very humbly the views and conclusions I have reached with respect to this

June 3, 1965

very serious matter which is now being discussed throughout the country from various
angles, namely, the Constitution of Canada
and the various reforms proposed thereto,
including the repatriation of the Constitution.
I would like to express myself as clearly as
I can, while being respectful to those who
would not share my views and being careful
to say what I think, sincerely and without
bitterness.
I very especially want to bring to the attention of honourable senators the remarkable,
clear and final rulings made by the judicial
committee of the Privy Council in England
on those extremely important matters. I say
final, because those rulings are the law. They
were made by the highest court in the British
empire, and they are definitely binding, especially on the Dominion of Canada. They
are final. No court whatsoever can change or
amend them.
First, I would like to discuss the most important ruling. In order to sum up the situation and from the standpoint of accuracy, I
will quote the unanimous ruling of the judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in the case of
[Text]
Attorney General for Canada, Appellant,
vs. Attorney General for Ontario and others,
Respondents, reported in Olmstead, Canadian Constitutional Decisions of the Judicial
Committee, volume 3, pages 180 to 206, respecting The Weekly Rest and the number of
laws that were declared in order, finally, by
the Privy Council. There were present at the
decision and during the pleadings Lord Atkin,
Lord Tankerton, Lord Macmillan, Lord Wright
M.R., Sir Sidney Rowlatt.
[Translation]
The Olmsted report lists on page 182 the
names of the lawyers representing Canada.
In these cases, the pleadings took place in
November 1936.
It will be noted that during the pleadings,
which were long and complete, Lord Atkin
who, at the end, rendered the judgment in
the name of all, had followed very carefully
the pleadings of the different lawyers, and
made from time to time definite and very
important remarks, which should be read
taking into account the proposals raised by
the lawyers:
Thus, Lord Atkin takes note, on page
194, of the fact that:
[Text]
It was admitted at the bar that each
statute affects property and civil rights

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

within each province; and that it was
for the dominion to establish that nevertheless the statute was validly enacted
under the legislative powers given to the
dominion Parliament by the British
North America Act, 1867.
[Translation]
On page 183, following the federal
counsel's assertion that:
[Text]
By the transference of the treatymaking power to the dominion executive, and correlative power to legislate
to carry out the obligations, nothing is
taken from the provinces.
[Translation]
Lord Atkin observed:
[Text]
The dominion bas not got unlimited
powers of legislation.
[Translation]
Further on, at the bottom of the same
page, the lawyers having stated that:
[Text]
... once the matter has assumed the as-

pect of an international bargain it is
no longer to be treated as belonging to
any one of the enumerated classes.
[Translation]
Lord Atkin interjected at once, on page
184:
[Text]
That is a very far-reaching doctrine:
it means that Canada could make an
agreement with any State which would
seriously affect Provincial rights.
[Translation]
At the bottom of the same page, the pleading counsel asserted that this was an obligation of the executive government of Canada,
because it resulted from the treaty. Lord
Atkin objected again by a very decisive
question that can be found on page 185:
[Text]
Lord Atkin: How did the consent
without legislation of the Senate and
the House of Commons become a matter
which
made them
the competent
authority?
[Translation]
Then, in the judgment itself, at the bottom
of page 203, there are the following state-

ments made by Lord Atkin, on behalf of
the judicial committee:
[Text]
For the purposes of ss. 91 and 92,
i.e., the distribution of legislative powers
between the Dominion and the Provinces, there is no such thing as treaty
legislation as such. The distribution is
based on classes of subjects; and as a
treaty deals with a particular class of
subjects so will the legislative power of
performing it be ascertained. No one
can doubt that this distribution is one
of the most essential conditions, probably the most essential condition, in the
interprovincial compact to which the
British North America Act gives effect.
If the position of Lower Canada, now
Quebec, alone were considered, the existence of her separate jurisprudence as
to both property and civil rights might
be said to depend upon loyal adherence
to her constitutional right to the exclusive competence of her own Legislature in these matters. Nor is it of
less importance for the other provinces,
though their law may be based on
English jurisprudence, to preserve their
own right to legislate for themselves in
respect of local conditions which may
vary by as great a distance as separate
the Atlantic from the Pacific. It would
be remarkable that while the Dominion
could not initiate legislation, however
desirable, which affected civil rights in
the provinces, yet its government not
responsible to the provinces nor controlled by provincial parliaments need
only agree with a foreign country to
enact such legislation, and its parliament would be forthwith clothed with
authority to affect provincial rights to
the full extent of such agreement. Such
a result would appear to undermine the
constitutional safeguards of provincial
constitutional autonomy.
It follows from what has been said
that no further legislative competence is
obtained by the Dominion from its accession to international status, and the
consequent increase in the scope of its
executive functions. It is true, as pointed
out in the judgment of the Chief Justice,
that as the executive is now clothed with
the powers of making treaties so the
Parliament of Canada, to which the
executive is responsible, has imposed
upon it responsibilities in connection with
such treaties, for if it were to disapprove

SENATE DEBATES
of them they would either not be made
or the ministers would meet their constitutional fate. But this is true of all
executive functions in their relation to
Parliament. There is no existing constitutional ground for stretching the competence of the Dominion Parliament so that
it becomes enlarged to keep pace with
enlarged functions of the Dominion executive. If the new functions affect the
classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92
legislation to support the new functions
is in the competence of the provincial
legislatures only. If they do not, the
competence of the Dominion Legislature
is declared by s. 91 and existed ab
origine. In other words, the Dominion
cannot, merely by making promises to
foreign countries, clothe itself with legislative authority inconsistent with the
constitution which gave it birth.
But the validity of the legislation under
the general words of s. 91 was sought
to be established not in relation to the
treaty-making power alone, but also as
being concerned with matters of such
general importance as to have attained
"such dimensions as to affect the body
politic," and to have "ceased to be merely
local or provincial," and to have "become
matter of national concern." It is interesting to notice how often the words used
by Lord Watson in Attorney-General for
Ontario v. Attorney-General for the
Dominion (1) have unsuccessfully been
used in attempts to support encroachments on the provincial legislative powers
given by s. 92. They laid down no principle
of constitutional law, and were cautious
words intended to safeguard possible
eventualities which no one at the time
had any interest or desire to define. The
law of Canada on this branch of constitutional law has been stated with such
force and clarity by the Chief Justice
in his judgment in the reference concerning the Natural Products Marketing Act
(2) dealing with the six acts there referred to, that their Lordships abstain
from stating it afresh. The Chief Justice,
naturally from his point of view, excepted
legislation to fulfil treaties. On this their
Lordships have expressed their opinion.
But subject to this, they agree with and
adopt what was there said. They consider
that the law is finally settled by the
current of cases cited by the Chief Justice
on the principles declared by him. It is
only necessary to call attention to the
phrases in the various cases, "abnormal

June 3, 1965

circumstances," "exceptional conditions,"
"standard of necessity" (Board of Commerce case (3)), "some extraordinary peril
to the national life of Canada," "highly
exceptional," "epidemic of pestilence"
(Snider's case (4)), to show how far the
present case is from the conditions which
may override the normal distribution of
powers in ss. 91 and 92. The few pages of
the Chief Justice's judgment will, it is
to be hoped, form the locus classicus of
the law on this point, and preclude
further disputes.
It must not be thought that the result
of this decision is that Canada is incompetent to legislate in performance of
treaty obligations. In totality of legislative powers, Dominion and Provincial together, she is fully equipped. But the
legislative powers remain distributed,
and if in the exercise of her new functions derived from her new international
status Canada incurs obligations they
must, so far as legislation be concerned,
when they deal with provincial classes of
subjects, be dealt with by the totality
of powers, in other words by co-operation between the dominion and the
provinces. While the ship of state now
sails on larger ventures and into foreign
waters she still retains the water-tight
compartments which are an essential
part of her original structure. The Supreme Court was equally divided and
therefore the formal judgment could only
state the opinions of the three judges on
either side. Their Lordships are of opinion that the answer to the three questions
should be that the act in each case is
ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada,
and they will humbly advise His Majesty
accordingly.
[Translation]
As it has just been seen, Lord Atkin, for
the whole judicial committee, approved in
the following terms the principle established
by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
in 1936 in the case of Natural Products Marketing Act:
[Text]
The few pages of the Chief Justice's
judgment will, it is to be hoped, form the

Court, 1936, pp. 416 to 426 inclusive. This
judgment is the final authority on the matter.
1 would like now to make a few remarks
on the confederation "compact".
As lias just been seen, the Privy Council, in
its ruling, made an extremely important and
very clear point on the "Distribution of legislative powers between the federal government and the provinces".
[TextJ
The distribution is based on classes of
subjects; and as a treaty deals with a
particular class of subjects so will the
legisiative power of performing it be
ascertained. No one can doubt that this
distribution is one of the most essential
conditions, probably the most essential
condition, in the inter-provincial compact to which the British North America
Act gives effect.
[Translation]
It should be noted that the judgment states
thiat the British North America Act dividing
the legisiative powers between the dominion
and the provinces is a treaty applying to a
particular category of subiects; and just as
a treaty applies to a particular category of
subi ects so the legisiative power needed to do
that must be determined. No one can question
the fact that this apportionment is one of the
essential conditions. probably the most essential, in the interprovincial pact which the
British North America Act puts into force.
Let us see now the meaning of "compact"
in the second edition of the Shorter Oxford
dictionary.
[Text]
A covenant or contract between two
or more.
[Translation]
According to The Standard Imperial Dictionary o! the English language by Ceci
Weatherly:
[Text]
Compact: v.t., to unite or connect
flrmly, as in a system.
Compact (as a noun): An agreement
between parties; covenant; contract.
[Translation]
1According to the new English-French and
French-English dictionary by Cli! ton and
Grimaux (J. McLaughlin):
22624-14

Compact (as a noun) means: covenant;
agreement; contract between parties, between individuals, between nations or
states.
This is indeed the case of the Canadian
Con! ederation.
[Translation]
Compact (verb): closely united; to compose, to do. The world is so compacted.
I will now quote another comment on this
part of the judgment of the Privy Council:
[Text]
.. n the interprovincial compact to
i
which the British North America Act
gives effect.
[Translation]
Therefore, the British North America Act
gives legal and constîtutional effect to a pact,
a treaty.
This effect is its very existence, the constitutional character o! its existence, its irrefragable validity, which no one can destroy
without the consent o! ail parties to the
Constitution, not even the British Parliament
which gave legal existence and effect to the
treaty which was negotiated between the
parties which signed it and which consequently have recognized the rights of al
provinces sanctioned in London as being a
contract having the effect o! binding the
parties. The federal authority itself did not
then exist. I am quoting Honourable Ernest
Lapointe. This authority is flot the father nor
the fatherland o! the Confederation pact. It
is its child, it lias lived by the sole authority
con! erred to it by the pact to which the
Imperial Parliament gave final effect.
The so-called repatriation of the Constitution, in view o! handing it over to the authority o! the federal Parliament, is an empty
word. Neither the federal Parliament nor
even the provinces have given birth or are
the birthplace o! Confederation. It is the
Imperial Parliament that gave birth to it. It
was and still is its birthplace. The rights and
privileges bestowed upon the provinces can
neither be denied nor amended without the
clear and explicit consent of each one o! the
provinces affected by the proposed amendments.
Because the Imperial Parliament which
created the great confederated dominion at the
request and with the consent of the provinces or dominions having already as such and
to, that effect, their constitutional statute, be-

SENATE DEBATES
came ipso facto bound by such consent of
the dominions assembled in Quebec City in
1865 and adopted then and there the
draft of an address submitted by Sir John
A. Macdonald, western attorney general of
the legislature of Canada, during the parliamentary debates on the matter of Confederation of the provinces of British North
America, which address finally served as
basis for the British North America Act of
1867.
The preamble of this Act, which we call
and which is our constitution in Confederation,
reads as follows:
[Text]
The British North America Act, 1867
30 Victoria, c.3. An Act for the Union of
Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick,
and the Government thereof; and for
purposes connected therewith. (29th
March, 1867.)
Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova
Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united
into one dominion under the Crown of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland, with a Constitution similar in
principle to that of the United Kingdom:
And whereas such a Union would conduce to the welfare of the provinces and
promote the interests of the British
Empire:
And whereas on the establishment of
the Union by authority of Parliament it
is expedient, not only that the Constitution of the legislative authority in the
dominion be provided for, but also that
the nature of the executive government
therein be declared:
And whereas it is expedient that provision be made for the eventual admission into the Union of other parts of
British North America:
Be it therefore enacted and declared
by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty,
by and with the advice and consent of
the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the
same, as follows:
I. Preliminary
1. This act may be cited as the British
North America Act, 1867.
2. The Provisions of this Act referring
to Her Majesty the Queen extend also
to the Heirs and Successors of Her
Majesty, Kings and Queens of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

June 3, 1965

II. Union
3. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by
and with the Advice of Her Majesty's
Most Honourable Privy Council, to declare by Proclamation that, on and after
a day therein appointed, not being more
than six months after the passing of this
Act, the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia,
and New Brunswick shall form and be
one Dominion under the name of Canada;
and on and after that day those three
Provinces shall form and be one Dominion
under that name accordingly.
[Translation]
Now, let us reconsider the analysis of this
pact which lead to the establishment of our
federal Dominion of Canada, and let us see
how clear and final-and unanimous-is this
decision made by the judicial committee of the
Privy Council, thus rendered in 1937 by Lord
Atkin and four other eminent members of
the judicial committee of the Privy Council,
namely: Lord Atkin, above-mentioned, Lord
Thankerton, Lord McMillan, Lord Wright,
M.R., Sir Sidney Rowlatt. It is in accordance
with other prior decisions of constitutional
importance made by the Privy Council, as
may be found in the attached excerpts.

Then, what was a dominion?
We shall refer to the Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary, second edition, vol. I:
[Text]
Dominion:-1. The power or right of
governing and controlling; sovereign authority; sovereignty; rule; control. 2. The
domains of a feudal lord, b. The territory
subject to a king or a ruler, or under a

(l July; anniversary called D. day) and
to New Zealand in 1907 (28 Sept.). In the
Statute of Westminster (1931) the term,
includes the Dominion of Canada, the
Commonwealth o! Australia, the Dominion o! New Zealand, the Union o!
S. Africa, the Irish Free State, and
New-foundland.
Halsbury's Statutes of England, 2nd Edition,
Volume 6, page 180:
Meaning of Dominion:-In the Report
of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee
of the Imperial Conference of 1926, it was
declared that "they" (Great Britain and
the Dominions) "are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal
in status, in no way subordinate to one
another in any aspect of their domestic
or internal aif airs, though united by a
common allegiance to the Crown, and
freely associated as members of the
British Commonwealth o! Nations."
The Statute of Westminster, 1931 (c. 4),
p. 193, post, reflects in its preamble the
above conception and applies to the
Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth
of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish
Free State (Eire) and Newfoundland. The
Act granted what may be termed legislative independence to the Dominions.
Preliminary Note
For further explanation of this, see the
notes to the Statute of Westminster, 1931
(c. 4), p. 193, post.
"Part I. Dominions (Halsbury's, Cont'd.

The Statute of Westminster, 1931 (c. 4),

certain resolutions of the Imperial Con22624-14&

ferences held in 1926 and 1930, the reports
of which Conferences are published as
Cmd. 2768 and Cmd. 3717.
The Statute gives legisiative independence to the territories (referred to in the
Statute as "Dominions") which are specified in s. I, namely the Dominion of
Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia,
the Dominion of New Zealand, the Union
of South Africa, the Irish Free State (now
Eire) and Newfoundland, and gives expression in its preamble to the constitutional convention which requires the
assent of the Parliaments of the Dominions, as well as that of the United
Kingdom Parliament, to, any law altering
the Succession to, the Throne or the Royal
Style and Titles. The powers conferred,
by the Statute on the Parliaments of
Canada, Australia and New Zealand did
not, however, include any increased power
of altering the Constitution Acts of those
Dominions (see ss. 7 (3), 8 of the Statute,
pp. 197, 198, post) nor did the Statute
empower the Parliaments of Canada or
Australia to invade the legislative sphere
of the Provinces and States, respectively,
of those Dominions or empower the Legislatures of the Canadian Provinces, who
,also enjoy the increased legisiative powers
granted by s. 2, to invade the legisiative
sphere of the Dominion Parliament (see
ss. 7 (3) and 9, pp. 197, 198, post). Complete power to alter the Constitution Act
of New Zealand has now been conferred
on the Parliament of New Zealand by the
New Zealand Constitution (Amendment)

Lord Duneden, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline,
and Lord Scott Dickson. The unanimous decision was given by Viscount Haldane, and I
extract the following from. page 941, also
referred to by Olmstead in Canadian Constitutional Decisions of the Judicial Committee,
Vol. 2, page 108.

SENATE DEBATES
The framework of the Constitution of
Canada was enacted in 1867 by the Imperial Parliament in order to give effect
to the desire expressed in the Resolutions
adopted by the Conference of Canadian
and other delegates held at Quebec in
October, 1864. The object was to form
in the first instance out of the old Province of Canada, along with Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick, a Dominion with a
constitution similar in principle to that
of the United Kingdom. Provision was
made for the extension of this Constitution to other colonies, such as Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, should
they desire to come in, and also to
Ruperts Land and the North-Western
Territory. It is out of these last that the
Province of Manitoba was formed, the
provisions of the Act of 1867 that
are applicable having been meantime
strengthened by subsequent Imperial and
Dominion legislation. The Executive Government of Canada was declared by the
Act of 1867 to remain vested in the
Queen, and by s.12, all powers, authorities
and functions vested in or exercisable by
the Governors or Lieutenant-Governors
of the Provinces brought into confederation were, so far as the same continued in
existence and were capable of being
exercised after the Union in relation to
the Government of Canada, to be vested
in and exercisable by the GovernorGeneral. A Parliament was then set up
for Canada. Part V of the Act established
analogous Constitutions for the Provinces.
For each of these there was to be a
Lieutenant-Governor. Although he is
under s.58 appointed by the GovernorGeneral, it has been settled by decisions
of the Judicial Committee, such as that
in Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of
Canada v. Receiver-General of New
Brunswick (1), that, as the appointment
of a Provincial Governor is made under
the Great Seal of Canada, and therefore
really by the Executive Government of
the Dominion which is in the Sovereign
the Lieutenant-Governor is as much the
representative of His Majesty for all purposes of Provincial Government as is the
Governor-General for all purposes of
Dominion Government. Sect. 65 and the
other sections dealing with the subject
define the powers of the LieutenantGovernor as being such of those powers
having been exercisable by the Governors

June 3. 1965

or Lieutenant Governors of the Provinces
brought into Confederation, as are exercisable in relation to the Government of
a Province. The scheme of the Act passed
in 1867 was thus, not to weld the provinces into one, nor to subordinate Provincial Governments to a central authority,
but to establish a central government in
which these provinces should be represented, entrusted with exclusive authority
only in affairs in which they had a
common interest. Subject to this each
Province was to retain its independence
and autonomy and to be directly under
the Crown as its head. Within these limits
of area and subjects, its local Legislature,
so long as the Imperial Parliament did
not repeal its own Act conferring this
status, was to be supreme, and had such
powers as the Imperial Parliament possessed in the plenitude, of its own freedom before it handed them over to the
Dominion and the Provinces, in accordance with the scheme of distribution
which it enacted in 1867.
The importance of bearing this in mind
when construing the subsequent provisions of the British North America Act
will presently appear. After thus defining
the executive power the statute goes on
to provide for a Legislature for each
Province, and concludes Part V, by declaring in s.90 that what has been laid
down as to the Dominion Parliament in
regard to Appropriation and Money bills,
the recommendation of money votes, the
assent to Bills, the disallowance of Acts,
and the signification of pleasure on Bills
reserved, is to extend and apply to the
Legislatures of the several Provinces as
if these provisions were re-enacted and
made applicable in terms to the respective Provinces and their Legislatures,
with the substitution of the LieutenantGovernor of the Province for the Governor-General, of the Governor-General for
the Sovereign and for a Secretary of
State and of one year for two years, and
of the Province of Canada.
My next reference is to the unanimous
decision of the Privy Council, In re Attorney
General for Ontario and Attorney General for
the Dominion and AL., May 9th, 1896, reported in 1896 Appeal cases, p. 348. There
were present: Lord Halsbury, L.C., Lord
Herschell, Lord Watson, Lord Davey and
Sir Richard Couch.

The unanimous decision was given by
Lord Watson, and I extract the folaowing
from. pages 359 and following. The decision
is also reported by Olmsted in Canadian
Constitutional flecisions of the Judicial Committee, Vol 1, page 343. 1 quote from pages
354 and 355:
It was apparently contemplated by the
framers of the Imperial Act af 1867 that
the due exercise of the enumerated
pa-wers canferred upon the Parliament
of Canada by s.91 might, occasionaily
and incidentally, involve legisiation upon
matters which are prima facie committed exclusively to the provincial legisiatures by s.92. In order to provide against
that contingency, the concluding part of
s.91 enacts that "any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shaîl flot be deemed
to corne within the class of matters of a
local or private nature comprised in the
enumeration of the classes of subi ects by
this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces." It was observed by this board in Citizens' Insurance Ca. of Canada v. Parsons (1) that
the paragraph just quoted "applies in its
grammatical construction only ta No. 16
of s.92." The observation was nat material to the question arising in that case,
and it does not appear to their Lordships
to be strictly accurate. It appears to them.
that the language af the exception in s.91
was meant ta include and carrectly describes all the matters enumerated in the
sixteen heads af s.92, as being, from a
provincial point of vue, of a local or
private nature. It also appears ta their
Lardships that the exception was not
meant ta derogate from the legislative
authority given ta provincial legisiatures
by those sixteen subsections, save ta the
extent af enabling the Parliament af
Canada ta deal with matters local or
private in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidentai ta the exercise af the powers conferred upon it by
the enumerative heads of clause 91. That
view was stated and iilustrated by Sir
Montague Smith in Citizens' Insurance
Ca. af Canada v. Parsons (1) and in
Cushing v. Dupuy (2); and it has been
recagnized by this Board in Tennant v.
Union Bank of Canada (3) and in Attarney-General of Ont ario v. AttorneyGeneral for the Dominion (4).

The general autharity given ta, the
Canadian Parliament by the introductory
enactments ai s.91 is "ta make laws for the
peace, order, and gaod government of
Canada, in relation ta ahl matters flot coming within the classes of subi ects by this
act assigned exclusively ta the legislatures
af the provinces"; and it is declared, but
flot so as ta restrict the generality of these
words, that the exclusive authority af
the Canadian Parliament extends ta ail
matters caming within the classes of subjects which are enumerated in the clause.
There may, therefore, be matters not included in the enumeration, upon wbich
the Parliament of Canada has power ta
legislate, because they cancern the peace,
order, and gaad gaverniment of the
dominion. But ta those matters which are
not specified among the enumerated subjects of legislatîan, the exception from.
s.92, which is enacted by the cancluding
wards of s.91, has na application; and,
in legislating with regard ta such matters,
the dominion Parliament has no autharity
ta encroach upon any class ai subi ects
which is exclusively assigned ta provincial
legisiatures by s.92. These enactments appear ta their Lardships ta indicate that
the exercise of legislative power by the
Parliament of Canada, in regard ta al
matters not enumerated in s.91, aught ta
be strictly canfined ta such matters as
are unquestionably ai Canadian interest
and importance, and ought nat ta, trench
upan provincial legislatian with respect ta
any af the classes ai subjects enumerated
i s.92. To attach any other construction
ta the general power which, in supplement
of its enumerated powers, is conferred
upon the Parliament of Canada by s.91,
wauld, ini their Lardships' opinion, nat
only be cantrary ta the intendment ai the
Act, but wauld practically destroy the
autanamy ai the provinces. If it were
once canceded that the Parliament ai Canada lias authority ta make laws applicable
ta the whole Dominion, in relation ta matters which in each province are substantiaIly ai local or private interest, upan the
assumption that these matters also concern the peace, arder, and good gavernment ai the Dominion, there is hardly a
subject enumerated in s.92 upon which it
miglit not legislate, ta the exclusion ai the
provincial legislatures.
In construing the intraductory enactments ai s.91, with respect ta matters
other than those enumerated, which con-

SENATE DEBATES

cern the peace, order, and good government of Canada, it must be kept in view
that s.94, which empowers the Parliament
of Canada to make provision for the uniformity of the laws relative to property
and civil rights in Ontario, Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick does not extend to
the province of Quebec; and also that the
Dominion legislation thereby authorized
is expressly declared to be of no effect
unless and until it has been adopted and
enacted by the provincial legislature.
These enactments would be idle and abortive, if it were held that the Parliament
of Canada derives jurisdiction from the
introductory provisions of s.91, to deal
with any matter which is in substance
local or provincial, and does not truly
affect the interest of the Dominion as a
whole. Their Lordships do not doubt that
some matters, in their origin local and
provincial, might attain such dimensions
as to affect the body politic of the Dominion, and to justify the Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their regulation
or abolition in the interest of the
Dominion. But great caution must be
observed in distinguishing between that
which is local and provincial, and therefore within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures and that which has
ceased to be merely local or provincial,
and has become matter of national concern, in such sense as to bring it within
the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. An act restricting the right to carry
weapons of offence, or their sale to young
persons, within the province would be
within the authority of the provincial legislature. But traffic in arms, or the possession of them under such circumstances
as to raise a suspicion that they were to
be used for seditious purposes, or against
a foreign state, are matters which, their
Lordships conceive, might be competently
dealt with by the Parliament of the
dominion.
Perhaps I am taking too long a time.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: No, but if my friend
would like to adjourn to the next sitting to
continue we could do it in two instalments.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Then I have some other
decisions which, with leave of the Senate,
may be taken as being part of my arguments
here, and I wil deposit that.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

June 3, 1965

Hon. Mr. Monette: And I will give a copy
to the newspapers.
Then I pass over a great number of decisions
of the Privy Council.
Then I come, honourable senators, to the
abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. It
is in 1947 that there was given a decision
by Lord Jowett in the case of the Attorney
General for Ontario and others 'and the
Attorney General for Canada and others, the
Attorney General for Quebec, interverner, concerning the abolition of appeals to the Privy
Council in civil and criminal matters.
[Translation]
The ruling of the Privy Council, handed
down by Lord Atkin, admits that it is impossible to amend the constitutional status of
the provinces, that is of the provincial dominions, without the consent of the province concerned. That is an implicit, but clear and definite admission.
Therefore, we can better understand why
there is a tendency to -drop appeals to Her
Majesty's Privy Council.
This request for the abolition of appeals
was made under the provisions of Bill No. 9,
which was submitted to the Supreme Court of
Canada, through reference, by the governor
in council, that is, by the Federal Government itself. Apparently, that would appear
to be against my point of view on this matter.
Bill No. 9, drafted for this purpose, included among others the following provisions:
54 (1), (2) and (3), which read as follows:
[Text]
54. (1) The Supreme Court shall have,
hold and exercise exclusive ultimate
appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction
within and for Canada; and the judgment of the Court shall, in all cases, be
final and conclusive.
(2) Notwithstanding any royal prerogative or anything contained in any Act of
the Parliament of the United Kingdom
or any Act of the Parliament of Canada
or any Act of the legislature of any province of Canada or any other statute or
law, no appeal shall lie or be brought from
any court now or hereafter established
within Canada to any Court of appeal,
tribunal or authority by which, in the
United Kingdom, appeals or petitions to
His Majesty in Council may be ordered
to be heard.

[Translation]
As can be seen, the Supreme Court thus
became the court of final resort in Canada and
for Canada in ail matters of civil or criminal
jurisdictian. No appeal or petition would be
,ailowed or could be made from any court,
present or future, ini Canada, to any court of
appeal, tribunal or autharity in the United
Kingdom.
In fact, the relerence to that Bill No. 9 was
made to the Supreme Court of Canada by the
following question:
[Text]
Is said Bill 9, entitled "An Act to amend
the Supreme Court Act", or any of the
provisions thereof, and in what particular or particulars, or to what extent,
intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?
[Translation]
A summary of the judgment rendered by
the Supreme Court, is given in extenso by
Lord Jowett, L.C. with the text of his judgment on behaif af the Privy Council, in 1947:
[Text]
The following question was accordingly
referred to the Supreme Court of Canada
for hearing and consideration: Is said
Bull 9, entitled "An Act to amend the
Supreme Court Act", or any of the provisions thereof, and in what particular
or particulars, or ta what extent, intra
-vires of the Parliament of Canada?
The contents of the Bil, a short, but
pregnant, one, must be stated in fuil.
(His Lordship read the provisions of the
Bill, and continued:) On January 19, 1940,
the Supreme Court certified that the opinions in respect of the question referred
ta it were as foilows: By the Court:
The Parliament af Canada is competent
ta enact the Bill referred in its entirety.
By Crocket J.: The Bill referred is wholly
ultra vires af the Parliament of Canada.
By Davis J: the Bill referred if enacted
wauld be within the authority af the
Dominion Parliament if amended ta provide that nothing therein respect ai any
action or other civil proceedings commenced in any af the provincial courts

and solely concerned with some subjectmatter, legisiation in relation ta which
is withîn the exclusive legislative campetence ai the legislature of such province.
(See Ohnstead, Canadian Constitutional
Decisions of the Judicial Cominittee, Vol. 3,
pages 523 and follawing).
[Translation]
The Privy Cauncil rejected the appeal
lodged against the Supreme Court decision
In the following terms: (see Olmstead, Vol.
3, lac. cit. pages 535 and 537).
[Text]
Their Lordships are ai opinion that
this appeal fails, and that it ought ta be
declared that Bull 9 of the Fourth Session oi the Eighteenth Parliament ai
Canada, entitled "An Act ta anxend the
Supreme Court Act", Is whaily intra
vires ai the Parliament ai Canada, and
they will humbly advise His Majesty accardingly.
[Translation]
And then, is it still possible ta appeal ta
the Judicial Committee ai the Privy Cauncil
or any other appeal court in England against
judgments rendered ini Canada?
At first glance that last decisian ai the
Privy Council ta which reference was just
mnade might lead us ta conclude that there
is no appeal passible in any kind ai canfict,
against the decisions mnade by the Supreme
Court ai Canada, either ta the Privy Council
or ta the Court ai Appeal, or ta any other
caurt or authority in the United Klngdam.
Hawever, I arn still convinced that a door
was left open, in other words, that there is at
least one jurisdictian ai appeal ta the Privy
Council that was not abolished and it is the
jurisdictian ai appeal on canstitutional matters.
The British North America Act, aur Constitution, had properly divided between the
iederal and the provincial jurisdictions the
variaus matters that were ta came under the
legislative autharity ai one or the other ai
thase jurisdictians, particularly the power
ta legislate an criminal matters, which was
canstitutionally bestowed an the federal ParMaiaent. On the other hand, the jurisdiction
ai legislation on a great many subjects provided foar under section 92 ai the Constitution, and mare particularly as regards property and civil rights in the provinces, and
generally ail local or private matters in a
province, was bestowed upon the legislative
authority ai the provinces. Such legislative

SENATE DEBATES
authority comes under the constitutional law
and is part of the Pact of the Confederation.
The Supreme Court of Canada did not
have, nor has it now, the power to abolish
appeals to the Privy Council so far as the
constitutional authority of provinces to legislate in civil matters or in appeal matters
on questions coming under provincial jurisdiction is concerned. Of course, when provincial courts are dealing with a civil
matter, the case under consideration comes
under the laws of the province in question.
Similarly, when the courts are dealing with
an offence concerning essentially the criminal
law, the criminal law is involved, and if there
has been a mistake and if the ordinary man
complains that a wrong decision was rendered
under the criminal law involved, an appeal
can be lodged before the competent Canadian
courts and, in addition, if necessary, before
Her Majesty's Privy Council. This whole matter evolves around the interpretation of the
criminal law or the civil law. But it does
not relate to the constitutional law, that is
the authority of the federal Parliament to
legislate in criminal matters nor the authority of provincial parliaments to legislate in
civil matters.
This legislative authority has been determined under the British North America Act
and comes under the constitutional law.
Of course, the Supreme Court of Canada,
in passing judgment on a criminal matter,
renders a final decision which, under Bill
No. 9, cannot be appealed. Similarly, when
the Supreme Court passes judgment on a
civil matter coming under the provinces it
shuts out any appeal to the Privy Council or
to any other courts in the United Kingdom.
But the constitutional authority, which
has already apportioned by the British
North America Act legislative jurisdiction
between the federal and the provincial governments, retains control of this constitutional right; and this control, this authority
is not taken away from it by this Bill No. 9.
The British Parliament is the parent, the
model of the Canadian Constitution, and, as
such, bas apportioned between the federal government and the provinces the various legislative powers. The appeals to the Privy
Council against disputable decisions made
by our Canadian courts are no longer subject
to appeals to the United Kingdom.
But the British Parliament has not ceased
being and still remains the constitutional
authority defining, limiting, and ruling the
legislating rights of the various dominions,
federal or provincial, and their constitutional

June 3, 1965

relations between them, rights and relationship which could not be amended without
a piece of legislation passed by the United
Kingdom and without the total consent of the
legislatures of all dominions concerned.
Even though the British Parliament still
had the power to amend the apportionment
of legislative rights it has already granted
either the federal Government or the provinces, which we do not recognize, it is
certain that it could not change this apportionment of legislating rights such as, for instance, that of amending the British North
America Act by taking away from the
federal Government and giving the provinces
the right to legislate in criminal matters;
likewise, it could not take away from the
provinces in order to confer it upon the
federal Government the right to legislate in
civil matters and other rights already assigned specifically to the provinces.
Besides, the federal Parliament could not
by itself make laws to alter the rights allotted
to the provinces, such as civil law, civil property, etc.
Moreover, Bill No. 9 is not designed to
change the allotment of legislative powers
between the dominion and the provinces. The
idea is to withdraw from the federal Government and the provincial governments the
right of appeal before the judicial committee
of the Privy Council. But the rights of appeal
enunciated, whether in matters coming under
federal legislation or under provincial legislation, are consequential upon the rights to
make laws granted to the federal legislature
and the provincial legislatures. And even if
such legislative rights were not consequential
upon the rights allotted to these legislatures,
it was then necessary to fully determine all
the rights of appeal intended to be revoked
in civil or criminal matters. For instance, it
does not mention matters coming under corporative law, municipal law, electoral law,
and even less constitutional law. In mentioning abolition of appeals only in cases pertaining to criminal law or civil law, we have
therefore purposely omitted-or intended to
omit-abolition of the right of appeal in other
matters.
We have already mentioned that Bill No. 9
was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada
through a submission by the governor in
council, that is by the federal Government
itself. I do not know the name or the function of the official or representative of the
federal Government or of the Supreme Court

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

of Canada who could draft such Bill No. 9,
but it seems certain that faced with the constitutional fears and doubts that people might
have about the scope of the terms of the bill,
the author of the project was conscious of the
difficulties and wilfully decided to restrict
under this Bill No. 9 the abolition of appeals
only in civil and criminal mattters. If he had
contemplated that some phrases in civil and
criminal matters were to apply to all kinds of
legislative matters, he did not have to give
the list. So he anticipated the contention that
the abolition of appeals which it was intended
to abandon could precisely go too far and
beyond the act; he had the necessary vision
and courage, in the prepared text, to restrict
the abandonment of appeals only to cases of
civil and criminal matters.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: May I ask my friend
a question? Would it be your contention, for
instance, that in the case where the Province of Quebec would want to sign a treaty
on educational matters with France, and the
Supreme Court of Canada would decide that
cannot be done, you would have the right
to appeal from the Province of Quebec direct
to the Privy Council?
Hon. Mr. Monette: Only in civil and provincial law.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: On a constitutional
matter?
Hon. Mr. Monette: That is educational, and
that is constitutional law. That is the point.
There are many laws, and this bill is based
only on matters civil and criminal.
I have also a number of authorities which
I will not quote here. They were made by
various persons in regard to the nature of
Confederation. One of them was made by
the Honourable Etienne Pascal Taché. He was
presiding at a meeting of the delegates of all
the Provinces, in Ottawa, when the whole bill
was discussed. There were remarks as to the
decision of Sir John A. Macdonald referring
to the Confederation as a treaty, saying that
nobody could propose amendments of an important nature-and it was not done.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
the honourable senator agree to put those
references on the record? If he wishes to do
so, I am sure it will be agreed to.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Yes, the references are
given. At a meeting in London, the delegates
of all the provinces were convened. The Minister of the Colonies was present to explain
these matters. Declarations were made in re-

gard to this projected Constitution. The Honourable Etienne Pascal Taché presided over
the legislative council of Quebec, which was
then sitting. They were acting under the bill
of 1841, the union of the two Canadas.
In opening the legislative council, he was
proposing an address to Her Majesty, on the
resolution of Quebec, on the lines of the
resolution discussed at Charlottetown. That
decision had been taken at Charlettetown and
had been consented to in Quebec, and then
brought to London to have an Imperial Act
give effect to it. But those decisions were
reached in Quebec independently of any authority, by the desire to form the union, as is
mentioned in the British North America Act
itself. Speaking there, he said:
That Lower Canada had constantly refused the demand of Upper Canada for
representation according to population,
and for the good reason that, as the Union
between them would have been legislative, a preponderance of one of the sections would have placed the others at
its mercy. It would not be so in a Federal
Union, for all questions of a general
nature would be reserved for the General
Government, and those of a local character to the local Governments which
would have the power to manage their
domestic affairs as they deemed best. If
a Federal Union were obtained it would
be tantamount to a separation of the
provinces, and Lower Canada would
thereby preserve its autonomy, together
with all the institutions it held so dear,
and over which they could exercise the
watchfulness and surveillance necessary
to preserve them unimpaired.
Just a word as to what was said by Sir
John A. Macdonald at that Conference on
3rd February 1865. He said:
[Text]
The Government desires to say that
they presented the scheme as a whole and
would exert all the influence they could
bring to bear in the way of argument to
induce the House to adopt the scheme
without alteration and for the simple
reason that the scheme was not one
framed by the Government of Nova
Scotia, but was in the nature of a treaty
settled between the different colonies each
clause of which has been agreed to by
a system of mutual compromise.
He repeated this later on the 6th of February, when he said:

SENATE DEBATES
As I stated in the preliminary discussion, we must consider this scheme
in the light of a treatyThere was a man there named D'Arcy
McGee, of whom you have all heard, and
who was strong in his talk. On February 9,
1865, he said:
[Translation]
And to avoid any misunderstanding about
our position with regard to that documentThat was the petition for the Confederationwe say to you: You can examine it,
reject it or accept it, but you cannot
amend it because that exceeds your power
and ours. Not a single sentence or Une,
not even a word of that document can
be changed without its being rejected in
full. On that matter, I concur entirely
with all my honourable friends who spoke
on that matter-to amend the treaty is
to destroy it, make it null and void and
nothing else.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in turn, said in the
House, on January 28, 1907:
Confederation is a covenant, first between four provinces, but accepted later
by the nine provinces which entered the
union, and I submit to the honourable
members of this house that this covenant
must not be altered rashly. It should not
be altered except in cases of real necessity and after the provinces have the
opportunity to express their views on the
matter. My hon. friend from York, N.B.
(Mr. Crockett) said that it was announced
in the speech from the throne that we
were going to ask parliament to change
the financial conditions of confederation.
This is quite true but my hon. friend
should know that this decision was
arrived at as a result of a conference
with the provinces and after all the provincial governments had agreed to request
the same thing.
In addition, I should like to quote the
words of the right Hon. Ernest Lapointe who
also stated in the bouse in 1924:
The B.N.A.A. and the restrictions it
places on our powers, if any, have been
freely accepted by us. There is no inferiority in this. This situation is the result
of a contract, as pointed out by my bon.
friend from Lotbinière (Mr. Vien).

June 3, 1965

Incidentally, I commend him for saying
that the covenant of Confederation could not
be touchedThe various colonies between themselves had entered into an agreement
establishing the powers of the central
parliament and, by the same token, the
powers of the various provinces which
were to replace the colonies of the time,
and this agreement was ratified by the
then Imperial parliament. Everything
that we have or do not have is due to the
fact that we willed it so. Many authorities
in constitutional law maintain that this
treaty cannot be amended and it seems
to me that, in all fairness, no amendment
should be made thereto without the prior
consent of all the signatories. This agreement is just as sacred as any other treaty;
it is not a mere scrap of paper.
In concluding, this is what the Honourable
Maurice Duplessis said:
The terms and conditions of this new
Federation are contained in a historic
document entitled "The Quebec Resolutions". Then the provinces refused to
accept the legislative union and preferred
the federative system because everyone
wanted to retain his history and his
traditions and protect his particular economic and geographical interests. The
"Quebec Resolutions" really derive from
an agreement between the four provinces
which created Confederation.

I do not have anything further to say except
to thank honourable senators for the great
patience and the attention you have displayed
in listening to me. I appreciate the effort you
have made to understand me. I do not consider
that this is a personal victory for me; I think
it was mainly due to the importance of the
subject with which I have dealt. I thank
you for the time you have spent here in

Hon. Mr. Monette: There may be cases, yes.
Hon. Mr. Holleii: Is it not a fact that there
was no appeal to anybody, that they were

*, Hon. Mr. Monette: The Privy Coundil, yes.
1 thank you for having brought it to my attention. They were the authors, the Fathers of
Confederation. They conceived it after consultation and demand from the provinces, and,

constitutionally. There was neyer any question
to allow anyone to go further and bring
matters to a higher court anywhere else. Their
decision is supreme.

bearing arms in defence of their country; and
in revenue it possesses some £3,000,000.
The Bill opens by reciting the desire of
the several Provinces to be federally united.
It proceeds to invest the Crown with all
Executive powers, by land and sea, for
civil administration, and military defence. It
proceeds to provide for the appointment of
a Governor General-an officer charged with
the duty of protecting Imperial interests,
named by and responsible to the Crown.
He will constitute the chief, if not the only,
direct link by which the united Provinces
will be connected with this country. His position will be one of dignity and station, equal
in all ways to its Imperial importance, and
a salary of £10,000 is by a clause in this
Bill made a permanent third charge upon
the general revenues. It is the desire of the
Provinces to retain their separate and
individual organization, and they will therefore be severally administered by Lieutenant
Governors. At present these officers are
appointed by the Crown; but henceforward
they will receive their offices at the hands
of the Governor General, acting under the
advice of his Ministers. They will hold office
during pleasure, though they will be subject
to removal only on cause being shown, and
under ordinary circumstances the term of
their administration will be limited to five
years.
I come now to the Legislature which it
is proposed to create under this Bill. It is
two-fold-a Central Parliament and Local
Legislatures in each Province. I will deal with
the Central Parliament first. It will be composed of two Chambers-an Upper Chamber,
to be styled the Senate, and a Lower Chamber,
to be termed, in affectionate remembrance
of some of the best and noblest traditions
of English history, the House of Commons. Of
all problems to be solved in the creation of
a Colonial Constitution, none is more difficult
than the composition of an Upper House. This
House is generally assumed to be the modelit would probably be hard to find a worthier
or higher model-and men labour to reproduce the English House of Lords amongst
English colonists, animated, it is true, by English instincts and feelings, but placed under
social conditions which are wholly different.
The materials for such a House are absolutely
wanting in the colonies. The hereditary title
to legislate, the great wealth, the large territorial property, the immemorial prescription,
and the respect which has been for generations freely accorded to this ancient institu-

tion, have no place in the ideas of a young
community. To attempt, therefore, a close
and minute imitation of the English House
of Lords is, I think, to court failure. There
are, in my opinion, two broad principles to
be kept in view in the creation of a Colonial
Chamber: first, that it should be strong
enough to maintain its own opinion, and to
resist the sudden gusts of popular feeling;
secondly, that it should not be so strong that
it should be impenetrable to public sentiment,
and therefore out of harmony with the other
branch of the Legislature. These are conditions difficult under the most favourable circumstances to secure; but they are complicated
in this instance by a third, which has been
made a fundamental principle of the measure
by the several contracting parties, and the
object of which is to provide for a permanent
representation and protection of sectional
interests. I will briefly explain how far these
three considerations appear to me to have
been met in this Bill. The Senate will consist
of seventy-two Members, the four Provinces
being for this purpose divided into three
sections, of which Upper Canada will be
one, Lower Canada one, and the Maritime
Provinces one. From each of these three sections an equal number of twenty-four Members will be returned. They will be nominated
by the Governor General in Council for
life. But as it is obvious that the principle
of life nomination, combined with a fixed
number of Members, might render a difference
of opinion between the two Houses a question
almost insoluble under many years, and
might bring about what is popularly known
as a Legislative dead-lock, a power is conferred upon the Crown-a power, I need not
say, that would only be exercised under
exceptional and very grave circumstancesto add six Members to the Senate, subject
to a restriction that those six Members shall
be taken equally from the three sections, so
as in no way to disturb their relative strength,
and that the next vacancies shall not be
filled up until the Senate is reduced to its
normal number.' It may, perhaps, be said
that the addition to six Members will be
insufficient to obviate the Legislative discord
against which we desire to provide. I am
free to confess that I could have wished that
the margin had been broader. At the same
time, the average vacancies which have of
recent years occurred in the nominated portion of the present Legislative Council of
Canada, go far to show that, even in the
ordinary course of events, the succession of

SENATE DEBATES

Members will be rapid. I have received on
this subject a Return which will be interesting. In 1856, forty-two Members answered to the call of the House, in 1858
there were but thirty-five, and in 1862 only
twenty-five. Thus in six years no less than
seventeen vacancies had occurred, showing
an average of nearly three every year. When,
therefore, a power on the part of the Crown
to create six additional Members is supplemented by so large and so regular a change
in the constitution of the Senate, it may be
hoped that enough is done to maintain the
Legislative harmony of the two Houses.
Your Lordships will observe that by the
25th clause security is given that the first
list of Senators shall not be nominated
under partisan influences. Their names will
be a matter of careful agreement, to be submitted to and confirmed by the Crown, and
to form part of the Proclamation of Union.
The qualifications which are annexed to the
office of Senator are not numerous, but they
are important. He is to be of thirty years of
age-and probably the average age will considerably exceed this-he must be a subject
of Her Majesty-he must have a continuous
real property qualification of 4,000 dollars
over and above all debts and liabilities, and a
continuous residence in the Province which
he represents. On the other hand, he will
become subject to disqualification if be fails
in his attendance for two consecutive Sessions,
if he takes an oath of allegiance to any foreign
Power, if he is insolvent or convicted of
crime, or if he ceases to be qualified in respect
either of his property or his residence in his
Province. There are some further details of
procedure which are provided for, but which
only need a general mention. The Speaker
will be nominated by the Governor General
on the part of the Crown, a quorum of fifteen
will be required, and whenever the Members
present are equally divided, the presumption
-in imitation of the rule of this House-will
be for the negative.
I now come to the constitution of the House
of Commons. The principle upon which the
Senate is constructed is, as I have explained,
the representation and the protection of sectional interests. The principle upon which
the House of Commons is founded is that of a
representation in accordance with population.
It will not be, indeed, a representation of mere
numbers distributed equally in electoral districts; but whilst population is made the basis
of representation, each Province will have its
own number of representatives in proportion
to their own population, and in proportion
also to the population and representatives

June 3, 1965

conjoined of their neighbours. Unlike other
popular Assemblies, the Canadian House of
Commons will be a variable number; but it
will vary by reference to a particular standard. That standard will be given by Lower
Canada, which is to retain its present quota
of sixty-five Members, and will in fact be the
proportion which those sixty-five Members
bear to the population of the Province. If
Lower Canada, with a population of 1,100,000,
has sixty-five Members, Upper Canada, with
a population of nearly 1,500,000, will have
eighty-two Members. It may, indeed, happen
that an increase of the total numbers of the
House may become necessary. Power is reserved for this contingency; but in such case
the increase will be regulated in all the other
Provinces by reference to the number of Members representing Lower Canada, and by the
proportion between those Members and the
population in that Province. But as the representation of population will be based upon
the census, there will be a decennial re-adjustment of it. And this leads me to observe that
the Parliaments of British North America will
be quinquennial. That decision was not, I
believe, adopted without some debate. On the
one side there was the precedent of the
English Constitution; on the other, there was
the example of the recent New Zealand Constitution, and the fact that the average duration of British Parliaments can hardly in
recent times be said to exceed five years.
Of the twenty-one Parliaments from the accession of George I, to that of William IV., comprising a period of 115 years, the average
duration was under five years and a half; and
of the ten Parliaments from the accession of
William IV. to 1865, comprising a period of
thirty-five years, the average duration bas
been three years and a half. Whilst in the last
century no less than seven Parliaments attained the term of six years, in the present
only two Parliaments have had so protracted
an existence.
The Local Legislatures to be established
in each Province stand next in order; and
my task here is easy; for whilst the provisions
regulating the constitution of the central Parliament are in the nature of permanent enactments, those which govern the Local Legislatures will be subject to amendment by those
bodies. This portion, therefore, of the Bill is
intended to provide the temporary machinery
by which each Province will be enabled to
enter upon its new life and political duties.
I ought, however, to observe that in Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick no material change
will take place. The existing Parliaments in
those provinces become the Provincial Legis-

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

latures, with their constitutions, their constituencies, and their local machinery unaltered. In Canada, the division of the Province
has necessitated the creation of two Legislatures; but the clauses that provide for them
are little more than a transcript of a vote
agreed to by the Canadian Parliament in their
last Session, in anticipation of this adjustment.
In Lower Canada there will be a Legislative
Council, of which the Members will be nominated for life, and an Assembly: in Upper
Canada there wil be but one Chamber for
the management of local business.
My Lords, I now pass to that which is,
perhaps, the most delicate and the most
important part of this measure-the distribution of powers between the Central
Parliament and the local authorities. In
this is, I think, comprised the main theory
and constitution of Federal Government;
on this depends the practical working of the
new system. And here we navigate a sea
of difficulties. There are rocks on the right
hand and on the left. If on the one hand, the
Central Government be too strong, then there
is risk that it may absorb the local action and
that wholesome self-government by the provincial bodies, which it is a matter both of
good faith, and political expediency to maintain: if, on the other hand, the Central Government is not strong enough, then arises a
conflict of State rights and pretensions, cohesion is destroyed, and the effective vigour of
the central authority is encroached upon. The
real object which we have in view is to give
to the Central Government those high functions and almost sovereign powers by which
general principles and uniformity of legislation may be secured in those questions
that are of common import to all the Provinces; and, at the same time, to retain for
each Province so ample a measure of municipal liberty and self-government as will allow
and indeed compel them to exercise those
local powers which they can exercise with
great advantage to the community. In Australia there is at present a tendency towards
the disintegration of the vast territories which
are called colonies, because those who live at
great distances on their extreme borders complain that they cannot obtain from the Central Parliaments the attention which they require. In New Zealand, on the other hand, an
attempt-and not without success-has been
made to combine considerable local powers
with a general Government at the centre.
In this Bill the division of powers has
been mainly effected by a distinct classification. That classification is fourfold. lst,

those subjects of legislation which are attributed to the Central Parliament exclusively;
2nd, those which belong to the Provincial
Legislatures exclusively; 3rd, those which
are subjects of concurrent legislation; and
4th, a particular question which is dealt with
exceptionally. To the Central Parliament belong all questions of the public debt or
property, all regulations with regard to trade
or commerce, customs and excise, loans, the
raising of revenue by any mode or system of
taxation, all provisions as to currency, coinage, banking, postal arrangements, the regulation of the census, and the issue and collection of statistics. To the Central Parliament
will also be assigned the enactment of criminal law. The administration of it indeed is
vested in the local authorities; but the power
of general legislation is very properly reserved for the Central Parliament. And in
this I cannot but note a wise departure from
the system pursued in the United States,
where each State is competent to deal as
it may please with its criminal code, and
where an offence may be visited with one
penalty in the State of New York, and with
another in the State of Virginia. The system
here proposed is, I believe, a better and
safer one; and I trust that before very long
the criminal law of the four Provinces may
be assimilated-and assimilated, I will add,
upon the basis of English procedure. Lastly,
the fisheries, the navigation and shipping, the
quarantine regulations, the lighting of the
coast, and the general question of naval and
military defence, will be placed under the
exclusive control of the Central Government.
The principal subjects reserved to the
Local Legislatures are the sale and management of the public lands, the control of their
hospitals, asylums, charitable and municipal
institutions, and the raising of money by
means of direct taxation. The several Provinces, which are now free to raise a revenue
as they may think fit, surrender to the Central Parliament all powers under this head
except that of direct taxation. Lastly, and
in conformity with all recent colonial legislation, the Provincial Legislatures are empowered to amend their own constitutions.
But there is, as I have said, a concurrent
power of legislation to be exercised by the
Central and the Local Parliaments. It extends over three separate subjects-immigration, agriculture, public works. Of these the
two first will in most cases probably be
treated by the Provincial authorities. They
are subjects which in their ordinary character
are local; but it is possible that they may

SENATE DEBATES
have, under the changing circumstances of a
young country, a more general bearing, and
therefore a discretionary power of interference is wisely reserved to the Central Parliament. Public works fall into two classes:
First, those which are purely local, such as
roads and bridges, and municipal buildingsand these belong not only as a matter of
right, but also as a matter of duty, to the
local authorities. Secondly, there are public
works which, though possibly situated in a
single Province, such as telegraphs, and
canals, and railways, are yet of common import and value to the entire Confederation,
and over these it is clearly right that the
Central Government should exercise a controlling authority.
Lastly, in the 93rd clause, which contains the exceptional provisions to which I
referred, your Lordships will observe some
rather complicated arrangements in reference to education. I need hardly say that
that great question gives rise to nearly as
much earnestness and division of opinion on
that as on this side of the Atlantic. This
clause has been framed after long and anxious controversy, in which all parties have
been represented, and on conditions to which
all have given their consent. It is an understanding which, as it only concerns the local
interests affected, is not one that Parliament
would be willing to disturb, even if in the
opinion of Parliament it were susceptible of
amendment; but I am bound to add, as the
expression of my own opinion, that the terms
of the agreement appear to me to be equitable
and judicious. For the object of the clause is
to secure to the religious minority of one
Province the same rights, privileges, and protection, which the religious minority of another Province may enjoy. The Roman Catholic minority of Upper Canada, the Protestant
minority of Lower Canada, and the Roman
Catholic minority of the Maritime Provinces,
will thus stand on a footing of entire equality.
But in the event of any wrong at the hand
of the local majority, the minority have a
right of appeal to the Governor General in
Council, and may claim the application of
any remedial laws that may be necessary
from the Central Parliament of the Confederation.
In closing my observations upon the distribution of powers, I ought to point out that
just as the authority of the Central Parliament will prevail whenever it may come into
confiict with the Local Legislatures, so the
residue of legislation, if any, unprovided for
in the specific classification which I have ex-

June 3, 1965

plained, will belong to the central body. It
will be seen, under the 91st clause, that the
classification is not intended "to restrict the
generality" of the powers previously given to
the Central Parliament, and that those powers
extend to all laws made "for the peace, order,
and good government" of the Confederation
which, according to all precedent,
-terms
will, I understand, carry with them an ample
measure of legislative authority. I will add,
that whilst all general Acts will follow the
usual conditions of colonial legislation, and
will be confirmed, disallowed, or reserved for
Her Majesty's pleasure by the Governor
General, the Acts passed by the Local Legislature will be transmitted only to the Governor General, and be subject to disallowance
by him within the space of one twelvemonth.
Clauses 102-126 regulate the conditions,
pecuniary, and commercial, upon which the
Provinces enter into union. They are so entirely matter of local detail and agreement,
that I need not weary the House with any
minute statement of them. It is enough to
say that under them a consolidated fund is
created, and that whilst lands and minerals
are reserved to the several Provinces, the
assets, property, debts, and liabilities of each
will be transferred to the central body. By
this agreement the public creditor who exchanges the security of each separate Province
for the joint security of the four Provinces
confederated, will find his position improved
rather than deteriorated. As between the
Provinces, it is proposed that the Local Legislatures should surrender to the Central
Parliament all powers of raising revenue except by direct taxation. In return for this
concession the Central Government will remit
to the Local Legislatures certain fixed sums
and a proportionate capitation payment, in
order to enable them more conveniently to
defray the costs of local administration. The
debt of each Province has been fixed at a
certain sum calculated; but if in the interval
between the present time and the proclamation of Union that debt should be increased,
the Province so exceeding will pay interest on
the excess, and that interest will be deducted
from the quota which they would otherwise
receive from the central authority. In the
same category must be placed the 145th
clause, which makes it the duty of the Central
Parliament and Government to provide for
the commencement of the Intercolonial Railway within six months of the union. Such an
undertaking was part of the compact between
the several Provinces, and it was an indispensable condition on the part of New Bruns-

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

wick. Successive Governments at home have
entertained the scheme and have pledged
themselves to the promise of more or less
assistance. Meanwhile I will not now enter
upon its details, because very shortly a
further measure involving the consideration
of pecuniary support must come before
Parliament.
There is, indeed, a question of great importance and intimately connected with the
future fortunes of the Confederated Provinces, and I may perhaps be asked why it
finds no place in this measure. My Lords, I
am fully alive to the urgent importance of
coming to some settlement of the Hudson
Bay Company's claims. The progress of
American colonization on the West, the Confederation of the Provinces on the East, render an early decision necessary. But till this
union is completed it would be a waste of
time to discuss the relations of the Hudson
Bay Company's territories to the Provinces.
When once this Bill becomes law, it will be
the duty of Her Majesty's Government not to
lose one day unnecessarily in dealing with
this great subject.
Having thus stated the main provisions of
this measure, I have only ta add the designation of this new State to which we are
about to give a distinct life and organization.
It may seem a trifling question; but it has,
in truth, been one neither unimportant nor
free from difficulties. To the representatives
of the Maritime Provinces belongs the credit
of waiving local rights and pretensions; and
they have felt the advantage of accepting a
name not less familiar to the English labourer
and artizan than it is distinguished by honourable traditions. Her Majesty has been
pleased to express her approval of the name,
and henceforth the United Provinces will be
known as the "Dominion of Canada"-a designation which is a graceful tribute on the
part of colonists to the monarchical principle
under which they have lived and prospered,
and which they trust to transmit unimpaired
to their children's children. Whilst the individual Provinces of Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick retain their present designation,
Upper Canada will become the Province of
Ontario, and Lower Canada the Province of
Quebec.
I have now stated the general principles
upon which this measure is founded. But to
so large a scheme, as might naturally be
expected, objections have been made; and
these objections, or some of them, it is my
duty to indicate. And first, it has been urged
that this Union should have been a legisla-

tive rather than a federal one. I admit, to a
certain extent, the validity of the objection.
When Upper and Lower Canada where connected in a legislative Union, Lord Durham
distinctly contemplated a similar incorporation of the Maritime Provinces. Nor are there
wanting to this opinion many of the ablest
of Canadian statesmen. But the answer is
simply this-that a legislative Union is,
under existing circumstances, impracticable.
The Maritime Provinces are ill-disposed to
surrender their separate life, and to merge
their individuality in the political organization of the general body. It is in their case
impossible, even if it were desirable, by a
stroke of the pen to bring about a complete
assimilation of their institutions to those of
their neighbours. Lower Canada, too, is
jealous, as she is deservedly proud, of her
ancestral customs and traditions; she is
wedded to her peculiar institutions, and will
enter this Union only upon the distinct
understanding that she retains them. The
42nd Article of the Treaty of Capitulation in
1760, when Canada was ceded by the Marquis
de Vaudreuil to General Amhurst, runs
thus"Les François et Canadiens continueront d'être gouvernés suivant la Coutume de Paris et les loix et usages établis
pour ce pays."
The Coutume de Paris is still the accepted
basis of their Civil Code, and their national
institutions have been alike respected by
their fellow-subjects and cherished by themselves. And it is with these feelings and on
these terms that Lower Canada now consents
to enter this Confederation.
But it has been objected that this union
of Provinces will be a kingdom, not a Confederation, and that being an embodiment of
the monarchical principle, it will Constitute
a challenge, to our powerful republican
neighbour across the border. Now I am at a
loss to understand how these Provinces,
when united, can be one whit more or whit
less of a kingdom than when separate. There
will be, with some few modifications, the
same institutions, the same forms of government, and even the same men to give life
and movement to them. It is but a development of the existing system. But whilst it
is attacked by one critic as too monarchical
in its character, it is assailed by another as
too Republican, and we are warned that it
must ere long on American soil become a
Republic, and lead to the dismemberment of
the Empire. Now I do not see special cause

SENATE DEBATES
for apprebension from republican any more
than from monarchical dangers; but I must
submit that, at all events, the two allegations
are fatally inconsistent with each other.
Again, it has been said that this great
scheme owes its origin to the lust of territorial dominion on the part of one State,
and that it is solely referable to the overweening ambition of Canada to exercise a
supremacy over her sister Provinces. For
this allegation I cannot see the smallest
groundwork of argument; and, looking to
the past history and the ordinary probabilities of these colonies, I can conceive
nothing more unlikely than a combination
of Upper and Lower Canada as against
the Maritime Provinces. If, indeed, any one
of these Provinces bas a reasonable ground
for apprehension, it is Lower Canada, with
its distinct race and language and institutions, rather than Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, which are in all essentials so
akin to the great and populous Province of
Upper Canada. But what this large scheme
of union bas been attributed to the desire of
political supremacy on the part of Canada,
it is in the same breath referred to the
irreconciable differences which are supposed
to have divided Upper and Lower Canada.
I believe, for my own part, that those differences have been greatly exaggerated; but
any how it is clear that the two objections
cannot both be correct. They destroy each
other. And this, indeed, I may observe, is
the case with several other objections that
have been urged; as when, in England, we
are told that the object of this scheme is the
imposition of fresh burdens upon the mother
country, and, in America, that its object will
be the imposition of pecuniary charges upon
the Maritime Provinces.
My Lords, I must not pass over another
and a plausible objection to the policy of
this measure. It is said that, whilst the commercial policy of Canada bas been of a Protectionist, that of the Maritime Provinces
has been of a more Liberal character; and
it is further argued that, when once the union
of these Provinces shall be accomplished,
the restrictive system of Canada will become
uniform, and that we shall find ourselves
excluded from the comparatively free markets which we have hitherto enjoyed. A
Canadian would probably reply to this that
the high tariff of Canada has been due to
the necessities of the revenue rather than to
a desire to foster her own industry. Of this
we can be no judge; we can only accept the
facts as we find them; but on those facts

June 3, 1965

there is, as I think, an answer worthy of the
attention of this House. Whatever may have
formerly been the case, it is now unfair to
draw a strong distinction between the commercial policies of Canada and of the Lower
Provinces. Canada is by no means unanimous
in her desire for Protectionist measures. On
the contrary, the Canadian tariff bas recently
been brought into far greater harmony with
that of this country. I understand that the
duties on all manufactured articles-such as
cottons, woollens, and leather-have been
reduced in some cases from 25, but in all
from 20 to 15 per cent. Partially-manufactured articles-such as bar-iron, tin, etc.,
which were formerly charged with a 10 per
cent duty-now come in free; and lastly, all
raw materials are exempt from duty. On the
other hand, the reductions in the revenue due
to these changes have been made good by
stamps, by an increase of the Excise and by
duties on tea, sugar, and wines. Of these
I may mention that the duty on tea is
4fd. per lb., and therefore very close upon
that which exists here; that as regards
sugar, they have adopted the same duties
and the same system; whilst in the case of
wines they have followed the same system,
with this difference, that their duties are 60
percent lower than our own. Such, indeed,
bas been the reduction effected, that the
Canadian tariff, whilst still considerably in
excess of the Nova Scotian, is less than that
of New Brunswick. And, therefore, we have
some right to hope that a Free Trade rather
than a Protectionist policy will be the result
of the union of Canada with the Lower
Provinces. But if even it were otherwise, I
could never ask this House to bargain with
Canada, and to withhold its consent to a
measure on which the hearts of our colonists
and fellow-subjects are set, until they had
adjusted their tariff to our liking. We must
rather trust to time and the prevailing
strength of our own commercial principles
to induce the Provinces to adopt that view
which is most consistent with our policy, and,
as I believe, with their interests. I do not
doubt what their choice will be; for, apart
from other considerations, so long as the
United States think it desirable to hem
themselves in with the bounties and restrictions of a jealously protective system, so long
it will be the obvious interest of British North
America to open her ports ta the free entrance of commerce.
I have now corne to the last, but also
the gravest, objection which has been raised.
It is an objection which I cannot indeed

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

admit, but to which I will endeavour to do
justice. It is represented that this measure,
which purports to rest upon the free consent
of the various contracting parties, is distasteful to a large portion, if not a majority, of the
inhabitants of Nova Scotia. My Lords, it bas
been the duty of Her Majesty's Government to weigh seriously the value of this
objection. I am told that a petition will
be presented in the House of Commons;
but none has been laid, or, as far as I
know, will be laid, on the table of this
House. There are, however, petitions against
this union, which will be found in the recent
papers that have been presented to Parliament. They are often drawn up with considerable ability; but they bear the mark, I
think, of a single hand, and, though they
profess to emanate from public meetings in
the different counties of Nova Scotia, they
are-I believe, with one exception-signed
by the Chairman alone, and give no evidence
of the number or the class of the petitioners.
As against this, we have to consider, first,
that both Upper and Lower Canada have
-I may almost say unanimously-expressed
their concurrence in the proposed Confederation; and that New Brunswick has given in
her formal adhesion. And what as to Nova
Scotia? Why, in 1861, the Assembly of that
Province agreed to a resolution in favour of
Confederation in general terms, and that
resolution was transmitted to the Home
Government. In 1863 the Nova Scotia Legislature was dissolved, and the Parliament
then returned is still in existence. That Parliament, last summer, agreed to a vote in favour
of Confederation in most definite and yet
comprehensive terms, empowering the delegates now in this country to negotiate with
Her Majesty's Government the conditions of
Union. My Lords, I do not see how it is
possible to look behind that vote, and what
better guarantee we can have of the real
feelings of the people of Nova Scotia. I
cannot, after this, consent to enter upon a
discussion of the motives or policy of this
or that Colonial Minister. We have not the
materials for forming a judgment; we can
only accept the deliberate and formal opinion of the Legislature as the expression of
the public feeling. Nor are the delegates, who
are now in England, men selected from any
one party in the Province. They represent
both the Colonial Government and the Colonial Opposition. But, then, I may be told
that the opposition is not so much to the
measure itself as to the time at which it is
being passed; and that the opponents desire

that its ratification should be deferred until
a new Parliament in Nova Scotia shall have
expressed its opinion upon the question. But
my answer to this must be, that the present
Nova Scotian Parliament is fully competent
to deal with the subject. Its members are
representatives, not delegates, of the constituencies. When, last year, the Legislature
of Jamaica voted away the former constitution of the island, Parliament did not hesitate
to accept that surrender, and to place the
colony under the direct control of the Crown.
Neither the people nor the Legislature of
Nova Scotia have been taken by surprise. Ever
since 1858 the question of a more intimate
consolidation of Provincial interests has been
before the public mind. The plea for delay
is in reality a plea for indefinite postponement, and to this I do not believe that Parliament will lend its ear. This measure has
been purchased at the cost of great personal
and local interests, and if we now remit itI care not on what pretence-to the further
consideration of the Province, we deliberately
invite opposition; and we may be sure that
many years will pass over before another
such proposal for Confederation is submitted
to Parliament.
My Lords, these objections come too late,
for it is not the question of one, but of four
great Provinces. If, indeed, we were to wait
till every individual in those Provinces were
agreed, we might wait for ever. To such a
scheme as this there must, in the nature of
things, be opposition. If ever the union of
two countries was of public benefit, it was the
union of Scotland and England; and yet when
every circumstance of the time called imperatively for that union there were many
who hesitated. The calmest and most philosophic of modern historians has said thatThe measure was so hazardous an experiment that every lover of his country
must have consented to it in trembling, or
revolted from it in disgust.
That union was, nevertheless, accomplished,
and so fraught with blessings has it been,
that we now wonder that the two nations
could so long have remained separate.
I have thus stated some of the principal
objections which have been urged to this
measure, and have briefly indicated the
answers to them. Let me now review some
of the advantages which may be reasonably
anticipated. And first, I hope that this measure
may well and effectually compose some of
those complaints which from time to time
must arise out of such an union as that which

SENATE DEBATES
at present subsists between Upper and Lower
Canada. It has, for instance, been said, that
whilst Upper Canada possesses the largest
population, she has only an equal voice in the
representation of their common interests in
the joint Legislature. But this inequality will
be redressed by the principle of representation
according to population, upon which the
House of Commons is to be constituted. Nor
Avill Upper Canada gain unduly by this arrangement; for whilst her interests will be
protected by a representation in accordance
with population in the Lower House, the
interests of Lower Canada will be guarded by
an equality of the sectional votes in the Upper
House. Again, it has been said that whilst
Upper Canada contributes the larger share of
taxation, Lower Canada enjoys more than her
just portion of the public expenditure. That
allegation, whether well or ill-founded, also
finds its answer in this Bill. Henceforward,
apart from the revenue raised for the common
purposes of the Confederation, local taxation
and expenditure will depend upon the local
authorities. Thus, all those complaints which
must arise under the circumstances of such
an union as that which now exists-complaints
of partiality, of neglect, of mismanagement of
roads, bridges, and those public works which
are the very life of a young community, must
cease. All local works will devolve upon local
authorities, who in turn will be responsible to
the taxpayers. This is, indeed, the principle
which we recognise in the management of our
own country and borough affairs; and if it
should be said that Parliament undertakes a
wider control in England than is contemplated
by this Bill in the confederated Provinces, I
reply first, that there is a difference in the
management of local affairs by a central body
between a country which contains 100,000
square miles, and one which now contains
400,000, and may one day contain 3,400,000
square miles; and, secondly, that the lesson,
which the English Parliament affords us in
this matter, is a lesson rather of warning than
of encouragement. These are perhaps negative
merits. For the positive advantages, let anyone look at the map and observe how bountifully nature has lavished her gifts upon that
country. But nature, true to her constant rule,
does not there shower those gifts upon one
part to the exclusion of another. In the Eastern districts there are not only coasts indented with harbours and fisheries, which,
unless man greatly misuse them, may be
called inexhaustible, but minerals, gold andthat which is more precious than gold-rich
beds of coal. As the traveller goes westward,

June 3, 1965

he finds a country rich in timber, in grain, in
iron, lead, and copper, a country well fitted
for manufacturing prosperity, and already
known for its breed of sheep, and cattle, and
horses; and when he passes the westernmost
frontier of Canada, he sees before him fertile
plains as yet unsettled, stretching along the
valley of the Saskatchewan, up to the roots
of the rocky mountains. Now these districts,
which it may almost be said that nature
designed as one, men have divided into
many by artificial lines of separation. The
Maritime Provinces need the agricultural
products and the manufacturing skill of Canada, and Canada needs harbours on the coast
and a connection with the sea. That connection, indeed, she has, during the summer, by
one of the noblest highways that a nation could
desire, the broad stream of the St. Lawrence;
but in winter henceforth she will have it by
the intercolonial railway. At present there is
but a scanty interchange of the manufacturing, mining, and agricultural resources of
these several Provinces. They stand to each
other almost in the relation of foreign States.
Hostile Custom Houses guard the frontiers,
and adverse tariffs choke up the channels of
intercolonial trade. There is no uniformity of
banking, no common system of weights and
measures, no identity of postal arrangements.
The very currencies differ. In Canada the
pound or the dollar are legal tender. In Nova
Scotia the Peruvian, Mexican, Columbian
dollars are all legal; in New Brunswick, British and American coins are recognised by
law, though I believe that the shilling is taken
at twenty-four cents, which is less than its
value; in Newfoundland Peruvian, Mexican,
Columbian, old Spanish dollars, are all equally
legal; whilst in Prince Edward's Island the
complexity of currencies and of their relative
value is even greater. Such then being the
case, I can hardly understand that any one
should seriously dispute the advantage of
consolidating these different resources, and
interests, and incidents of government under
one common and manageable system.
But there is yet another advantage to be
gained from that union, to which I must
call the attention of the House. The question
of military defence is a somewhat delicate
one on which to touch. Military defence supposes war, and war in that part of the world
could only be with that great Republic which
lies south of our border. Such a war between
men of a common race and language, and in
many respects of common institutions, would
be an unnatural and detestable conflict, which
would entail upon each incalculable injuries,

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

and perhaps throw back for years the course
of civilization and human prosperity. It is,
however, our duty in dealing with this
great question to deal with it fully, and
not to evade a consideration so important
as that of military defence. We are constantly reminded of the difficulties of defending the long frontier of Canada with a
distant base of operations. Every reasonable man will admit those difficulties; nor
-do I see any object in underrating them.
At the same time, we have high and competent military authority to warrant us in
believing that, with proper precautions and
with the spirit of courage and loyalty which
bas anim'ated the Canadian people the defence
of Canada is no insoluble problem. Again,
we are told that the proportions of military
expenditure are not fairly adjusted between
the mother country and Canada. Well, I think
that the time has probably come for a re-con.sideration of those charges; and to that opinion
there are many in Canada who will subscribe.
I am confident that Canada desires only that
which is reasonable, that which she may in
honour ask, and in honour accept of this
country. There has been a good deal of misunderstanding on this subject, and Canada has
been supposed to be backward in defraying
the expenses of her own defence. But out
of the 425,000 militia who are on paper,
90,000 have six days' drill in the year; and
that besides these, there are from 30,000 to
25,000 Volunteers, who have undergone considerable training, and have attained much
efficiency. There are drill associations in the
various towns; there have been camps of instruction, and more than 3,000 cadets have
within the last two years passed an examination by the military authorities, and have received certificates either of the first or second
class. I will only add, that whilst the military
expenditure in Canada was in 1864 about
300,000 dollars, it was in 1865 nearly 900,000
dollars, and in 1866 more than 2,000,000 dollars. By the Census of 1861, it was computed
that the men between the ages of twenty and
sixty, supposed to be capable of bearing arms,
wereIn Upper Canada ...... 308,000
In Lower Canada ...... 225,000
In Nova Scotia ....... .67,000
In New Brunswick ....

51,000

651,000
These are now fixed to their respective Provinces, and engaged, as a matter both of duty
and sentiment, to the exclusive defence of
that Province. But when Confederation is ac-

complished these scattered forces will become
one army under the command and, in the
event of emergency, at the disposal of one
single general.
But if the advantages of union are great
in a military, a commercial, a material point
of view, they are not, I think, less in the
moral and political aspect of the question.
When once existing restrictions are removed,
and the schools, the law courts, the professions, the industries of these great Provinces
are thrown open from one end to another, depend upon it a stimulus greater than any that
has ever been known before in British North
America will be applied to every form of
mental or moral energy. Nor will it be the
main body of the people that will alone feel
this. The tone of Parliament, the standard of
the Government will necessarily rise. Colonial institutions are framed upon the model
of England. But English institutions, as we
all know, need to be of a certain size. Public
opinion is the basis of Parliamentary life;
and the first condition of public opinion is
that it should move in no contracted circle. It
would not be difficult to show that almost in
proportion to its narrowness Colonial Governments have been subject to disturbing influences. But now, independently of the fact
in these confederated Provinces there will
henceforth be a larger material whence an
adequate supply of colonial administrations
and colonial oppositions can be drawn, it is
not, I think, unreasonable to hope that, just
as the sphere of action is enlarged, the vestry
element will be discarded, large questions will
be discussed with the gravity which belongs
to them, men will rise to a full sense of their
position as Members of a great Parliament,
and will transmit their own sense of increased
responsibility and self-respect through Parliament and the Government to the main body
of the people.
My Lords, I have now touched upon the
main features of this measure. I have only
in conclusion to say a few words as to the
principle upon which it is founded. I know
that objections are sometimes made to the
principle of a federative Government. It is
true that no federation can be as compact
as a single homogeneous State, though the
compactness will vary with the strength or
weakness of the Central Government. It is
true that federation may be comparatively
a loose bond, but the alternative is no bond
at all. It is not every nation, or every stage
of the national existence, that admits of a
federative Government. Federation is only
possible under certain conditions, when the

SENATE DEBATES
States to be federated are so far akin that
they can be united, and yet so far dissimilar
that they cannot be fused into one single body
politic. And this I believe to be the present
condition of the Provinces of British North
America. Again, it is said that federation is
a compromise, and, like all compromises, contains the germ of future disunion. It is true
that it is a compromise, so far as it is founded
upon the consent of the Provinces; it is true
that it has been rendered possible by the surrender of certain powers, rights, and pretensions by the several Provinces into the
hands of the central authority; but it is also
to be remembered that-unlike every other
federation that has existed-it derives its
political existence from an external authority,
from that which is the recognised source of
power and right-the British Crown. And I
cannot but recognise in this some security
against those conflicts of State rights and central authority which in other federations have
sometimes proved so disastrous.
There have been but few examples of federative Governments. Republics and kingdoms
there have been many that have played great
parts; but the federative Governments in the
world's history may be easily counted. There
have been but four which can be fairly called
famous. Two are no more-two exist. Of
the smallest
these, one-Switzerland-is
amongst the families of modern Europe; the
other-the United States-is one of the greatest of the Great Powers of the world. In geographical area this Confederation of the
British North American Provinces is even
now large-it may become one day second
only in extent to the vast territories of
Russia-and in population, in revenue, in
trade, in shipping, it is superior to the thirteen
colonies when, not a century ago, in the
Declaration of Independence, they became
the United States of America. We are laying
the foundation of a great State-perhaps one
which at a future day may even overshadow
this country. But, come what may, we shall
rejoice that we have shown neither indifference to their wishes nor jealousy of their
aspirations, but that we honestly and sincerely,
to the utmost of our power and knowledge,
fostered their growth, recognising in the conditions of our own greatness. We are in this
measure setting the crown to the free institutions which more than a quarter of a century ago we gave them, and therein we remove, as I firmly believe, all possibilities of
future jealousy or misunderstanding-

"Magna sub ingenti Matris se subjicit umbrâ."
Moved, "That the Bill be now read 2a."
-(The Earl of Carnarvon.)
The Marquess of NORMANBY said, the
noble Earl the Secretary for the Colonies
had so exhausted the subject that it was
unnecessary to add but a few remarks to
what had been said already. He should,
therefore, confine his observations to the
military advantages which he believed this
union was calculated to confer on the North
American Provinces, and answer some of
the objections that had been made to the
scheme in Nova Scotia. Some people in this
country were of opinion that England derived
no benefit from these colonies; that they were
rather a source of burden and expense, and
that there was consequently no need for
maintaining the close connection at present
existing between them and the mother country. That was not the feeling with which he
intended to address himself to this subject;
nor was it the feeling of the vast majority of
the people in this country, nor of their Lordships, nor the colonists themselves. Were the
British North American colonies in a position to stand alone-were they anxious or
willing for separation from this country,
were their feelings or inclinations such as to
lead them to seek amalgamation with the
United States-he did not think that it would
be wise for us to use coercive measures to
prevent them. But so long as they were loyal
-so long as they looked upon their connection with the mother country and the institutions which they at present enjoyed under
her rule as among the greatest blessings they
possessed, he believed it was their duty to
encourage the feeling and protect their rights
and interests to the best of their power. It was
perfectly true that in a pecuniary point of
view this country derived no profit from her
colonies. While in a generous spirit granting
them free institutions, and confiding to their
own hands the distribution of their revenues
and the management of their local affairs,
we had up to the present time taken upon
ourselves entirely the burden of providing
for their defence. It was, however, to be
borne in mind that this country had no
longer the power, even if she had the will,
to provide for such defence. The change in
locomotion had so altered North America
that it would be impossible to act in this
matter now as we had formerly done. He had
heard it asserted that Canada could not be
defended, but he did not believe it. The
colonists were perfectly ready to cooperate
with us, and so long as this country main-

June 3, 1965

June 3 1965SENATE
DEBATES

tained ber naval supremacy, no fear need be
entertained with regard to the maintenance
of the coast defences of that colony. The
principal enemy Canada would have to fear
would be the United States; but he hoped no
quarrel would arise to, bring the two countries into collision. Every man must cordially
hope that war might not arise between the
States and this country. Such a war would
produce unmitigated evîls, and would, in
fact, be nothing less than suicidal. But, at
the same trne, they could not disguise from
themselves that the condition of the United
States had greatly altered within the last
few years. Not long ago her army consisted
only of some 10,000 men, but she had now an
enormous and well-disciplined force. It therefore well became us to consider how we
could best provide for the defences of our
British North American Provinces; and he
thought it was clear that in no way could
these be better provided for than by their
union. It might be fairly argued that what
had been done in one Province could be
done in another. Some account, therefore, of
what had been done and what was capable of
being done in one at least of our North
American Provinces might flot be uninteresting. When he first assumed the government
of Nova Scotia, in 1858, the entire local force
of that country consisted of some fifty or
sîxty Volunteer artîllerymen. Subsequently
an opportunity presented itself of raising
Volunteer Corps, and at a later period circumstances enabled him. to obtain a revision
of the militia laws. In 1863, when he left that
Province, there were no Iess than 34,800 men
regularly enrolled for drill for five days
every year, and since that time matters had
greatly improved. Last year there were, he
believed, 59,000 men regularly out for dril.
Hie admitted the insufficiency of the drill of
these men, but their organization was perfect,
their enrolment was good, and their officers
effectively trained, being required in every
case to pass an examination before receiving
their commissions. If Nova Scotia, with a
population of 300,000, could produce 50,000
milîtiamen, he could see no reason why
British North America, with a population of
4,000,000, should not produce an enrolled
militia of 400,000 or 500,000. 0f these a quota
could be called out every year for permanent
training, so as to keep up the organization of
the entire body. With such a force to draw
upon in case of need, backed by the support
which would be given by this country, there
was no reason why Canada should not be
able to defend herseif effectually. It must be
borne in mind that in Canada any campaign

must, owing to the necessities of the climate,
be limited to six months; moreover, as war
with Canada meant war with England,
America would be obliged to keep a large
force at home for the protection of her own
shores. In speaking thus of America he
alluded, of course, only to possibilities. No one
was more sensible than himself of the serious
Clisadvantages of a war with America; no
one could deplore more than he did the
miseries which such a war was calculated to
entail; and nobody could look with greater
interest on the institutions of that country,
or entertain a higher sense of ber greatness
and resources. Turning now to the political
part of the question, he would notice some
objections that had been urged against the
scheme. As regarded Canada and New Brunswick, the importance of the measure now
advocated could not be over-estimated. In
both these Provinces the proposal for union
had been so universally accepted that it was
unnecessary to, dilate upon it as regarded
them. The case of Nova Scotia was, however,
he was sorry to say, different. Petitions had
been drawn up against the scheme, and
delegates had been sent over to this country
to oppose it. This was the more unreasonable
when it was considered that the Maritime
Provinces, of which Nova Scotia was one,
would derive more benefit from the Confederation than the Canadas themselves. He
was one of those who thought originally,
and stili thought, that it might have been
better in the first instance to have formed a
separate federation of the Maritime Provinces, by which means time would have been
allowed for the softening down of local
jealousies, and the way prepared for the
eventual formation of a large and compact
body. But the question was not now whether
there should be a more limited or more
extended union, but whether we should have
the union at present proposed, or allow the
North American Provinces to remain disunited. They were told that nine-tenths of
the population of Nova Scotia were against
this measure, and that 30,000 signatures had
been appended to petitions praying that it
should not be carried out. Pamphlets had
been publlshed by the opponents to the
scheme that it would, if carried out, cause
great misery, and ultimately the ruin of
Nova Scotia. Their Lordships should bear
in mind, however, that it was not an unusual
thing across the Atlantic to hear political
questions argued in a tone and temper that
sounded strangely to the ear, and to see
people rather carried away by the force of
language than by the arguments conveyed

SENATE DEBATES

in their language. He had had some experience of the way in which the petitions
were got up in Nova Scotia against this
measure. When the movement in favour of
Confederation gained strength, a gentleman,
whom he respected on account of his talents,
put himself at the head of a party of opposition and went through the country holding
meetings for the purpose of declaiming
against the scheme. Nothing is easier than to
persuade people they are about to be
wronged, that they are to be deprived of
their liberties and have their commercial
prosperity retarded; so the people responded
to the agitation and petitioned against this
scheme in vast numbers; but he thought the
petitions represented the opinion of the
agitators rather than the real feeling of the
inhabitants of the country. The arguments of
the party of opposition were not directed
particularly against this measure, but against
all union of our North American Provinces;
and the head of the party, it should be stated,
was once as much in favour of Confederation
as he had latterly been against it; so that
his arguments could not be counted of much
worth. If it were true that Nova Scotia was
likely to be sacrificed for the benefit of Canada
he would not lend his support to the Bill;
but it was clear that, as the interests of Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick were identical,
and as those two States possessed a third of
the votes of the Senate and a fifth of the
House of Commons, they would surely be
able, by joining with the ordinary opposition,
to obtain a hearing and compel the House to
do them justice. If the question were one
merely affecting the interests of Nova Scotia
the case might be different; but it also affected
the interests of the two Canadas, New Brunswick, and this country. Their Lordships were
therefore bound to consider the matter not
in a local but an Imperial point of view. He
believed that the Bill would promote the
general good of the British North American
Provinces, and he would therefore give it his
support.
Earl RUSSELL said, he could not altogether
remain silent when a subject of such interest as this engaged their Lordships' attention. It appeared to him that the measure
was undoubtedly a wise one. In the first
place, the Confederation would facilitate commercial relations with the United States,
because it would be far easier for our North
American Provinces, when united together, to
form agreements which might afterwards be
put into treaties than if they were to remain
separate. In the second place, it was far
better to have a single united authority which

June 3. 1965

could provide for any exigencies that might
arise, such as war, than to have the defence
left to the separate colonies. In supporting
the Bill he must say that the creation of these
provinces, so populous and wealthy, redounded greatly to the credit of this country.
In 1760, when we obtained Canada by capitulation from the French, there were only 70,000 inhabitants in the colony. At the present
day the descendants of the French in Lower
Canada alone amounted to nearly 1,000,000,
and in Upper Canada the population was
1,500,000. The total population of the Provinces which it was proposed to unite was no
less than 4,000,000. He believed that there was
no other instance in the history of the world
of such a noble colony springing from so
small a source. The noble Earl (the Earl of
Carnarvon) had said rightly that the measure
of Confederation had been long thought of.
Lord Durham, in his Report, suggested a
similar project; and he remembered speaking
about it to Sir James Kemp, at the time Governor of Nova Scotia, who told him that whatever might be its advantages, the difficulty of
communication between Upper and Lower
Canada was such that it was impossible at
that time to entertain the proposal. The difficulty of communication between Canada and
New Brunswick which had hitherto existed
would be removed by the intercolonial railway which the Provinces had undertaken to
construct, and which was to be guaranteed
by this country. He believed that that question was to be brought forward in the other
House, for the consent of Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick to the federation was dependent upon it, and without it the union
could not be carried out. He had to express
his regret that this was not a legislative instead of a confederate union. He feared that
separate local Legislatures would be attended
with great inconvenience, and that the work
of the Confederation could only be done by a
single Legislature. He hoped that in time the
leading men of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick would see that it was better to rule
over 4,000,000 of people than to be restricted
to the Government of their own Province, and
that they would themselves propose the legislative union which the noble Earl now confessed himself unable to effect. He sincerely
hoped that those united Provinces might continue to improve, and that if, in the course
of time, they desired to separate from the
mother country, and to become a separate
State-a circumstance which he did not think
at all likely to occur-they would find, as we
had always been ready to defend the Cana-

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

dians as the subjects of Her Majesty, so we
should be ready to listen to their wishes
should they desire to separate and to form
an independent nation.
Lord MONCK said, he hoped their Lordships would permit him to say a few words
upon the Bill, considering the share which he
had had in its origination. He would at the
outset refer to one thing, which appeared to
him of great importance in a constitutional
point of view. It had been, he thought, most
unwarrantably assumed that the Province of
Nova Scotia was opposed to the union. Now,
he believed that the expression of opinion
which had come from Nova Scotia to this
country had been entirely got up by a few
energetic individuals; but the Legislature of
Nova Scotia had, like the Legislatures of the
other Provinces, adopted by large majorities
the Resolutions proposed to them, and had
sent their delegates to this country to take
part in the framing of the measure which
had been laid on the table. The demands of
those gentlemen in Nova Scotia, if they
amounted to anything, meant that the question should be subjected to the decision of
the people, instead of its being determined
by the people's representatives. Such a demand, to his mind, betrayed a great ignorance,
not only of the principles of the British Constitution, but of the principles upon which all
representative institutions were founded. It
was, perhaps, unnecessary to remind their
Lordships that in the earliest period of selfgovernment every man was accustomed to
give his opinion on matters on which a decision had to be arrived. But with the increase
of communities such a thing became practically impossible. By-and-by, when the expedient of popular elections was adopted, the
general body of the people had nothing to do
with the management of their affairs beyond
selecting men in whose intelligence, integrity,
and judgment they could place reliance to do
their business for them. But they were not
dealing with representative government in
the abstract; they were acting under the
British Constitution, which provided no
machinery for testing the opinions of the
country upon a measure. Responsible Ministers would scarcely recommend the Crown,
for instance, to dissolve the House of Commons when the three Estates of the realm
were in harmony. They would have, he believed, no right to look to any further expression of opinion. Therefore, he did not think
that those gentlemen had any right to dispute the decision of the constitutionally appointed Legislature, but that, as the Legisia22624-15

ture had decided in favour of the union, they
were bound to accept their decision as final.
But that was not the first time that such a
point had been raised. It was raised in reference to the union with Ireland, and Mr.
Pitt denounced in the strongest terms any
attempt of the kind as a dangerous constitutional precedent. It was also suggested
in 1846 that Sir Robert Peel should dissolve
the House of Cemmons in order to ascertain
the opinion of the people on the proposed repeal of the Corn Laws, and the proposition
was treated by him in a similar manner.
Such a proposition was, in reality, little short
of revolutionary. He would not trouble their
Lordships with any arguments derived from
the benefits which were likely to accrue to
the colonies themselves from the proposed
change, as the subject had been so ably dwelt
upon by the noble Earl who had introduced
the measure now under consideration. He did,
however, wish to refer to one point about
which he could bear personal testimony, and
that was the embarrassment which would
every now and then attend the conduct of our
foreign relations if the colonies remained in
their present disunited state. These colonies
had so much increased in trade, in wealth,
and in commerce that, taking into consideration also their peculiar geographical position,
they had interests connected with questions
of foreign policy, he would not say antagonistic, but, at all events, distinct from those of
the mother country. We had, and he thought
very wisely, conceded to these Provinces the
management of their own affairs, and it would
not be politically wise or just ta dispose of
every matter connected with the foreign relations of these Provinces without consulting
the people interested. He confessed, however,
to feeling some dismay at the prospect of
consulting five distinct Governments, looking at the questions possibly from different
and often circumscribed points of view. He
did not believe that we should entirely get
over the difficulty by the union of the Provinces; but by having one colony to consult,
instead of five, the disadvantage would certainly be reduced to a minimum. A noble
Earl had alluded to the present scheme as a
confederation, and had stated that he would
rather have had a legislative union. The
weakness of a confederate union was generally supposed to reside in the absence of
sufficient authority in the central power. But
not one of the sources of weakness of Federal union was to be found in this Confederation. The union was not created by the act of
the States themselves-the supreme authority

SENATE DEBATES

and the executive authority were both to be
possessed by the central power, and for all
purposes of union the central Government
acted directly through its own officers upon
the people of the united Provinces. The
central power also reserved to itself the complete control over the legislative, the executive, and the judicial authorities. As there
was no opposition to the measure, there was
but little further for him to say, except that
he believed that this union would conduce
to the good government of these Provinces;
would render the relations between the
mother country and the colonies more satisfactory; and would place the colonies on such
a footing that, in the event of their ever being
desirous of severing that connection, they
would be enabled to choose their future position in the world regardless of any external
disturbing influences, and to make their own
arrangements in harmony with their own
wishes and feelings.
LORD LYVEDEN regarded the Confederation as being most advantageous both for
this country and for the American Government. He wished to ask the noble Earl (the
Earl of Carnarvon) whether, by the terms
of the arrangements that had been come to,
Parliament was precluded from making any
alteration in the terms of this Bill; and
whether, in the event of it being possible to
make any alteration in those terms, it would
not be advisable that the salary of the Governor General should be paid by the mother
country instead of by money to be voted by
the Colonial Legislature?
THE EARL OF CARNARVON said, by the
105th clause of the Bill, the salary of the Governor General was to be paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the united Provinces. It was,
of course, within the competence of Parliament
to alter the provisions of the Bill; but he
should be glad for the House to understand
that the Bill partook somewhat of the nature
of a treaty of union, every single clause in
which had been debated over and over again,
and had been submitted to the closest scrutiny,
and, in fact, each of them represented a compromise between the different interests involved. Nothing could be more fatal to the
Bill than that any of those clauses, which were
the result of a compromise, should be subject to much alteration. Of course, there might
be alterations where they were not material,
and did not go to the essence of the measure,
and he should be quite ready to consider any
Amendments that might be proposed by the
noble Lord in Committee. But it would be his
duty to resist the alteration of anything which

June 3, 1965

was in the nature of a compromise, and which,
if carried, would be fatal to the measure.
Motion agreed to: Bill read 21 accordingly, and committed to a Committee of the
Whole House on Friday next.

Ten o'clock.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA BILL-(No. 9)
(The Earl of Carnarvon.)
COMMITTEE.
Order of the Day for the House to be put
into a Committee read.
The Earl of SHAFTESBURY presented
petitions from the Governors, Principal, and
Fellows of the M'Gill College, Montreal, from
the Provincial Association of Protestant
Teachers of Lower Canada, and others, directing attention to several provisions of the Bill
and especially to the 93rd clause, which in
their operation they feared would have the
effect of subjecting them to the will of those
possessing the majority of the representation,
and they desired the introduction of a clause
into the Bill now before Parliament for their
security. The petitioners disclaimed all feelings of distrust or hostility to their Roman
Catholic brethren, but they foresaw difficulties
likely to arise in the future history of the
colony which they wished to obviate by
timely legislation. The petitioners felt strongly
on the point, as their petitions showed. At
the same time, so sensible were they of the
importance of passing this measure, that if
the modifications which they had suggested
could not be accepted without endangering
the measure itself they would not insist on
their demand.
The Earl of CARNARVON said, that through
the courtesy of the noble Earl who presented
these petitions he had enjoyed a previous opportunity of learning their contents; in fact,
they had been referred to him at the Colonial
Office, and copies of them would be found
in the official correspondence. The petitioners
he knew to be men of position and great
respectability in the Lower Province, and it
was accordingly his duty to entertain with
due care and consideration the points which
they urged. Having done so, he was bound to
say that it was wholly impossible to amend
the Bill in accordance with the wishes of the
petitioners without compromising the success
of the measure. The real point which they
desired was to secure for ever, both in the
general and in the local Legislatures, the

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

same relative representation for the Lower
Province which it now possessed. Independently of the fact that many of the proposals
were of a municipal character and might be
settled by the local Legislature, to introduce
the clauses asked for would violate one of
the principles upon which the Bill was based
-namely, that the local Legislatures should
have the power of amending their own constitutions. He could not but think that the
views of the petitioners must lead to a multiplication of those sectional interests of which
already there were, perhaps, too many in the
Provinces. Those petitioners, it seemed to him,
were needlessly afraid of the consequences of
the scheme. The 80th clause provided that no
change should be made in certain districts
of Lower Canada-the very districts, in fact,
which returned the Protestant minority-without the consent of the Members returned by
those districts. Hence the House would perceive that it was almost impossible for any
injury to be done to the Protestant minority.
The real question at issue between the Protestant and Roman Catholic communities was the
question of education, and the 93rd clause,
after long controversy, in which the views
of all parties had been represented, had been
framed. The object of that clause was to guard
against the possibility of the members of the
minority suffering from undue pressure by
the majority. It had been to place all these
minorities, of whatever religion, on precisely
the same footing, and that, whether the minorities were in esse or in posse. Thus the Roman
Catholic minority in Upper Canada, the
Protestant minority in Lower Canada, and the
Roman Catholic minority again in the Maritime Provinces would all be placed on a
footing of precise equality. He could only say
further that if he were to accept an Amendment based on the petitions presented by his
noble Friend, it would be difficult to resist
other Amendments of an analogous character
put forward by opposing interests. In fact,
only a few minutes before he entered the
House that day he had received a paper
setting forth the views of a strong and very
respected Roman Catholic minority, who
feared that the 93rd clause would not extend
to them the protection which they conceived
to be their due. His answer to them, as to
his noble Friend, must be that to comply with
their wishes would be to depart from a compact entered into by the representatives of
all shades of religious and political opinions.
If the compromise were departed from in
favour of one party, it must inevitably be de22624-15j

parted from in favour of another. Therefore,
he could not accept from his noble Friend
the Amendment which he knew had been prepared, but with much consideration had not
been pressed.
Lord LYVEDEN asked for some information as to the powers of the delegates by whom
this compromise was entered into, and the
quarters from which they derived their
authority. A large and influentially-signed
petition would soon, he believed, be presented,
expressing a hope that this Confederation
scheme would not be passed into law before
May next, when the results of the elections
in Nova Scotia would exhibit in a clearer
light to the people of this country what was
thought of the Bill in that Province.
The Earl of CARNARVON said, that so far
as regarded Prince Edward's Island and Newfoundland, inasmuch as they refused to be
included in the Confederation, it was not
necessary for them to send any delegates.
With regard to the delegates who came to this
country to negotiate the Confederation, they
derived their power from the several Provinces which they represented, and were armed
with the fullest authority from the Legislative
bodies. In the case of Nova Scotia, in which
Province only was there a semblance of a
difference of opinion, the matter was fully
debated as to whether the Governor should
be authorized to appoint delegates to proceed
to this country for the purpose of arranging
the terms of union of the Province, and after
a very full discussion it was carried in the
affirmative by 13 to 5 in the Legislative Council, and by 31 to 19 in the Legislative Assembly. With respect to Upper and Lower Canada, nothing could be more complete and comprehensive than the power granted to the
delegates.
Motion agreed to: House in Committee
accordingly; Amendments made: The Report
thereof to be received on Monday next.

had no desire to press the measure on the

not the slightest objection to act on the suggestion of his noble and learned Friend, and
would accordingly, after the second reading,
consent to the postponement of the Committee.

.. brought about only at the sacrifice of great
personal and local interests; and when I re,
flect how great that sacrifice has been, I feel
quite astonished at the result which has been

SENATE DEBATES
attained. A great responsibility would rest on
Parliament in this country if they deliberately
invited opposition to the measure by remitting
the subject again to the colony, and stirring
up every dissentient person to come forward
and agitate the question. I do not say that
this measure is a perfect one, for it is impossible that it could be. There are defects in
it, no doubt; but, at the same time, the enormous advantages of the measure so completely
outweigh its imperfections that I have no
hesitation whatever in pressing it upon Parliament, and in urging that it may be speedily
passed into a law. For these reasons I do not
feel it my duty to accede in any way to the
request of the noble Lord opposite. The Bill
passed through the second reading in this
House without any substantial objection being
made to it, and I trust it will also be allowed
to pass through the other House of Parliament.
LORD CAMPBELL said, in explanation,
that he had never advocated a further reference to the Assemblies of Canada or of New
Brunswick. He did not even think it would
be essential to refer to that of Nova Scotia,
which would soon be called into existence.
The language and the indications of the General Election might alone suffice to point out
whether Nova Scotia should be incorporated
in the scheme, or left in the position of Prince
Edward's Island and Newfoundland.

READING.

Feb. 28
Order for Second Reading read.
MR. ADDERLEY: Sir, I rise to move the
second reading of a Bill for the union in one
Dominion, of the Canadas, New Brunswick,
and Nova Scotia. What I have to ask the
House to do is to give their consent to the
proposal of the representatives of these three
Provinces. Eminent public men representing
all shades of political opinions in these Provinces are in this country at the present moment, having been delegated by the Governors, on Addresses of the Legislatures, to
ask Her Majesty to submit to the Imperial
Parliament a scheme of union which embodies almost literally and without modifi-

June 3, 1965

cation the Resolutions adopted at a representative Conference at Quebec in the Year
1864. I need not go far back to show the
origin of this desire of the Provinces to be
united in one Dominion. It has gone on increasing from year to year, and if it was well
founded years ago it is infinitely more justified by the circumstances in which the
Provinces are now placed. The first official
document in which the many obvious reasons for this union are stated with great
ability, is the Report of Lord Durham's
Commission, published nearly thirty years
ago. Since that Report was made the union
has formed a prominent subject of discussion
both in public and in private. It became the
leading topic at public meetings and in
Parliamentary debates, and the frequent subject of men's conversation throughout the
Provinces. In the year 1849 an association
called the North American League was
formed, and held its meetings in Toronto,
for the purpose of promoting this object.
Its name will recommend itself to many Members of this House as expressive of popular
feeling, and legitimate agitation. In the year
1854, the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia
came to a Resolution in favour of a general
union, the Resolution being promoted by the
most prominent men of all political parties.
Mr. Johnston on one side, and Mr. Howe on
the other, share together the credit of the
first legislative action on the subject. In the
year 1858, the Coalition Ministry of Canada,
Sir Edmund Head being the Governor General, first made this scheme a Ministerial
measure, and a despatch was addressed to
the Home Government on the subject. This
was the first correspondence with the Home
Government relative to the union. In the
year 1861, Nova Scotia again took the lead
in the matter, and proposed a conference of
delegates from each of the Provinces to consider the subject. The result of their deliberations was communicated to the Colonial
Secretary of that period, the late Duke of
Newcastle; and in reply to their communication he stated, that if it was clearly the desire of the Provinces to be united the proposal
would be carefully considered in this country.
I refer particularly to this fact, because it
has recently been asserted that the measure
was pressed on reluctant colonies by the
Home Government, while in reality a more
calm and colourless answer than that of
the Duke of Newcastle was never sent from
any public Office. In consequence of that
answer, at the end of 1863, the people of
Nova Scotia and of their fellow Maritime

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Provinces proposed to hold a conference,
and Canada then, for the first time, asked
to be a party to the proceeding. These are
all important points in the history of this
proposition, because it has been stated that
Canada urged the measure on the smaller
Provinces, and thus used its superior influence for local purposes; while that is so far
from being the case, that it was after the
Maritime Provinces had determined on holding a conference for the promotion of that object that Canada requested to be allowed to
join in their deliberations. It has also been
said that it was the constitutional difficulties
of Canada that led to the formation of this
project. Now, it is true that Canada had at
that time constitutional difficulties to encounter; but those difficulties were no more the
cause of the proposal for the union of the
Provinces than the divorce of Henry VIII.
was the cause of the Reformation. It was
but an accident which precipitated that
which was in itself desirable, and which
every one wished to see effected. Those
delegates from all the Provinces met at
Quebec in the month of October, 1864,
and they adopted a series of Resolutions
for the project of an union which are embodied in the Bill now before the House.
The proposals which they adopted were
communicated to the late Minister of the
Colonial Department, the right hon. Gentleman opposite (Mr. Cardwell), than whom I
will now venture to express my opinion, as
I have already frequently expressed it in
opposition, this country never had a more
statesmanlike Colonial Minister. He having received and carefully considered these
Resolutions, replied in a despatch addressed
to Lord Monck, the Governor General-to
whom also I will pay this tribute, that I
believe it was fortunate for those Provinces
that they had so able, so judiclous, and so
successful a Governor at so critical a juncture. The right hon. Gentleman opposite
in his despatch expressed his belief that it
was high time that the inhabitants of those
Provinces should take upon themselves those
duties of citizenship which we took upon
ourselves at home; that it was absolutely
necessary they should make greater military
preparations and undertake some works of
defence. It is by no means true that there is
anything in that despatch which can be fairly
represented as urgently forcing on the union
-the fact is that at that time a correspondence was going on relative to the insecure
condition of those colonies, and the right hon.
Gentleman was justified in telling their in-

habitants that they should take on themselves the duty of citizens, and that it was
necessary that they should make greater provision for the defence of their country. To
that appeal the colonies made a noble response. In the following year the Colonial
Legislatures met, and in the three Provinces
to which this Bill applies addresses were
passed which led to the Governor General
sending to this country those delegates who
are now among us for the purpose of asking
the Imperial Parliament to sanction in the
form of a bill the Resolutions to which they
agreed at Quebec.
I need not, I believe, now weary the House
by entering into any minute explanations with
respect to the details of the measure; for
though the Bill was presented to Parliament
only about fourteen days ago, yet the substance of its provisions have for a long time
been discussed in the public press before it
became the subject, a few nights ago, of an
able and elaborate statement made by the
noble Earl the Secretary for the Colonies. I
therefore may reckon on the House being
pretty well acquainted with the details of t11
Bill, and it will be sufficient if I give only
a general outline of its provisions. The Bill
provides that the Canadas, New Brunswick,
and Nova Scotia should form one dominion,
under the common name of Canada; and that
the colonies so united should comprise four
Provinces--Ontariot Quebec, Nova Scotia, and
New Brunswick. It was proposed that the
four Provinces should have a common Parliament at Ottawa, consisting of a Senate and
a House of Commons. By Her Majesty's
Proclamation, Ontario, which is now called
Upper Canada; Quebec, which is now
known under the name of Lower Canada; New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia,
will become one Government. The Senate
will be composed of seventy-two Senators, nominated by the Governor General,
in the name of Her Majesty, for lifetwenty-four of them for Ontario, twentyfour for Quebec, and twenty-four for the
Maritime Provinces. But as the strict limitation of these numbers might lead to a deadlock between the Upper and the Lower Chambers, it is provided that the Governor General
shall, with the Queen's approval, have the
power of adding two triplets of Senators to
these seventy-two, so that he might enlarge
the Senate to seventy-eight members; but
that number they can never exceed. If on
any occasion such additions are made the
number will be allowed to die down again to
seventy-two. The House of Commons is to

SENATE DEBATES
consist of, at first 181 Members-eighty-two
for Ontario, sixty-five for Quebec, nineteen
for Nova Scotia, and fifteen for New Brunswick. The existing election laws will continue;
but these numbers are to be adjusted to
population from time to time, according to
a decennial census, in the manner adopted in
the American House of Representatives. The
Provinces are to have Local Legislatures for
local purposes; and each of them is also to
have a Lieutenant Governor, named by the
Governor General. Ontario will have a single
Chamber, to be styled the Legislative Assembly; Quebec will retain the present form of
the Legislature of the United Canadas; New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia will retain their
present Legislatures. The power of the
Provincial Legislatures, in reference to
legislation, will be confined to a certain number of specified subjects. The Governor
General will have a veto on all legislation;
and the Central Legislature will be invested
with a general power of providing for the
good government and peace of the country;
but without derogating from the general
power, certain specified powers are enumerated for the Central Legislature. It will be
seen that by these provisions arrangements
are made as far as possible for ensuring the
unity and strength of the Central Government. I think I need hardly trouble the House
with the other provisions of the Bill. There
is, I believe, only one other clause to which
I need now allude, and that is a clause by
which these Provinces bind themselves immediately to proceed to the construction of a
great international railway, which they regard
as the backbone of the general scheme of
union. There is nothing in this Bill which
implicates this House or this country in that
undertaking; but it is only right I should
add that the adoption of that provision will
render it necessary for me to ask the House
to guarantee the interest of a loan by means
of which the railway is to be constructed.
I think I have now sufficiently described the
Bill. The House will see that its most striking
feature is a scrupulous adherence, as far as
the circumstances of the case would permit,
to the constitutional forms of this country. I
leave every Gentleman to judge for himself,
and appreciate, as I hope they will, the
causes which have led to this sensitiveness
of filial piety-this almost morbid dread of
departure from the institutions of the mother
country, and of any approximation to institutions nearer to themselves; but certainly that
is one main feature of the Bill as presented

June 3, 1965

o the House. The adoption of the principle
of federation, as compared with what might
be preferable if practicable, a solid legislative
union, is simply the consequence of the
absolute necessity of the adjustment of inveterate local interests, and the ultimatum
of mutual compromise between the Provinces.
The House may ask what occasion there can
be for our interfering in a question of this
description. It will, however, I think, be
manifest, upon reflection, that, as the arrangement is a matter of mutual concession on the
part of the Provinces, there must be some
external authority to give a sanction to the
compact into which they have entered. It is
very true we have often given to colonies,
secondary in importance to these, the task of
framing their own Constitution. A general
Act was passed two years ago which gives to
all colonies with representative institutions
the power, at any time, of altering their
Constitution within certain limits; but it is
clear the process of federation is impracticable
to the constituent Legislatures. If, again, federation has in this case specially been a matter
of most delicate treaty and compact between
the Provinces-if it has been a matter of
mutual concession and compromise, it is
clearly necessary that there should be a third
party ab extra to give sanction to the treaty
made between them. Such seems to me the
office we have to perform in regard to this
Bill. We have, in fact, to accept or reject
the proposal which the Provinces have made
to us. We certainly ought to guard most carefully against anything being effected by the
Act injurious to Imperial interests, as distinguished from colonial interests; but I ask
the House whether any Imperial interests are
involved in this Bill which can in any way
be distinguished from colonial interests?
I say our interests are identical. Whatever
develops the resources and contributes to the
prosperity of the colonies contributes to the
prosperity of the Empire; whatever strengthens them strengthens us; and no one can for
a moment harbour the thought of doing anything to impede or obstruct the progress of
the colonies by way of retaining them in a
condition of dependent weakness. But if no
Imperial interest is sacrificed by this Bill,
let us see whether we can hope to improve
it in the interest of the Colonies. I think the
time has gone by for either the Parliament
or the Government of England to attempt to
teach colonies like these their interests better than they can judge of them themselves.
It is now nearly 100 years since the Parliament of this country was engaged in pre-

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

cisely the same task for the New England
States which it is now undertaking for our
present North American Colonies, with the
object of enabling colonies that never
thought of coming here for any assistance,
either in money or arms, better to defend
themselves against the attacks of neighbouring Indian tribes, and even against the
invasion of European armies. It is to no purpose to say that the union which afterwards
took place was in antagonism to ourselvesthat was simply our own fault and folly; but
it is significant that the union proved its
effectiveness. We have since attempted both
to maintain and govern colonies from this
country, but the attempt has utterly failed;
and to our largest colonies within the last
few years we have, without exception, given
the powers of self-government. What the
North American colonists ask us to do by
this Bill is to extend to them the natural
corollary of self-government, and to enable
them by union to take upon themselves all
the duties of British citizenship. But I am
aware that criticisms of this scheme are not
wanting; and I find that some persons object
to the existence of a nominated Senate. Those
critics allege that a nominated Chamber of
Legislature never succeeds in our colonies,
and that as regards this particular case the
Canadians themselves had a nominated
Chamber, and afterwards thought it advisable to substitute an elective Chamber.
Strange that those who are quite willing
they should have made this change cannot
allow that they may have satisfactory reasons, on further experience, for returning to
the system of nomination. I say nothing of
what may have made the old nominated
compact distasteful and the new elections
intolerable; but who is the best judge? If
they wish for nomination in the new plan,
why should we forbid it? Another critic, who
demands that the central power shall be
strengthened by every possible means, says
the Lieutenant Governor should be elected.
I think the difficulty lies in making the central power sufficiently strong. The nomination of the Provincial Governor by the
Central Power is in the interest of united
government. Lastly, there are some who say
that, whatever the merits of the measure, it
ought not to receive the sanction of the
Imperial Parliament until it has been referred again to the voice of the people. Can
anything be more absurd or inexplicable,
except by an utter ignorance of the subject?
For instance, is Canada to be thrown back
upon a General Election in order to repeat

an expression of her opinion upon this subject, which she has been discussing and urging for the last twenty years? There was a
General Election in 1863, and both in 1863
and 1864 the question was fully debated in
the Colonial Legislature. Since that period,
there have been no less than twenty-four
vacancies in the Legislative Council, and
every one of these has been filled up by
unionists. Can any other proof be required
of the sustained conviction of Canada that
her interests require that the proposed union
shall be carried out without unnecessary
delay? Canada, indeed, has not been precipitate in this matter. She was the last to
come to the conference at Quebec, and the last
to come now to England. She kept the delegates of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
waiting six months before she came to this
country. Therefore, the very last assertion
which could be made by the Maritime Provinces against Canada would be that of precipitancy of action in urging on them this
scheme of union. But no more do the other
Provinces
require re-consultation.
New
Brunswick has had an election on the subject itself, and deliberately pronounced in
its favour. Nova Scotia initiated the proposition, and has had repeated elections since. I
must point out that the advocates of delay
are of the most remarkable kind, both personally and with respect to the nature of
their arguments. The person who is most
anxious for delay was the first and ablest in
promoting the proposition; and what does he
say? He says-"I allow something must be
done. It is impossible to leave things as they
are. But there is another alternative, and
that is, the whole British Empire might be
organized into one-Canada, Nova Scotia,
and New Brunswick might meet here in
Westminster, instead of having their Provincial Parliament in Ottawa." This, Sir, is a
subject that has been discussed over and
over again, more as a exercitation than as
a practical or rational proposition. It does
not require more than a moment's consideration to show that it is futile and visionary.
The objections to union, then, being futile,
and the only alternative proposed being visionary, I will ask the House to consider what
are the palpable reasons and advantages
which fully account for and justify the
deliberate decisions to which these colonies
have come to ask this House to sanction the
terms of union to which they have agreed
among themselves. The commercial advantages are, perhaps, the most prominent, and
the least open to question or dispute. The

SENATE DEBATES
idea is absurd of retaining a system of different commercial tariffs amongst these contiguous Provinces which are ruining and
keeping down their trade. Why, the effect of
the reciprocity treaty betwen the United
States and Canada was to develop the commerce between these countries in one year
from 2,000,000 to 20,000,000 dollars. That
treaty has now ceased; but surely that is a
reason why, at least amongst themselves,
there should be the most perfect reciprocity.
Well, then, as to their mutual interests, who
can doubt that these three Provinces-the
wheat-growing West, the manufactures Centre, and the fisheries and outlet on the coasts,
are necessary to each other to make one
great country jointly developing diverse
interests. Was there ever, let me ask, a country so composed by nature to form a great
and united community? By their mutual
resources-by the assistance of their different interests, they would make together a
powerful and prosperous nation. As long as
they remain separate they are a prey to the
commercial policy of other nations, and mutual jealousies among themselves. Disunion
saps their liberty as well as their power, and
paralyses their self-reliance. On the other
hand, one united Government would be able
to keep the peace, and would remove every
temptation to aggression. One national Government composed of the best men out of
all the Provinces, would draw out and develop the resources of the country for the
common interest; and, at the same time, a
combined revenue would give larger credit,
and enable greater economy. I wish to read
a short extract from a letter of Queen Anne
to the Scotch Parliament in 1706, on the
union of these two countries. It bears upon
the case before us in two ways; because it
not only shows the reasons for union in
striking language, but is a precedent for
existing Legislatures being considered able
to deal with a question of this sort without
any further appeal to the people. In the
letter, Queen Anne saidAn entire union will be the solid foundation of a lasting peace between you.
It will remove animosities, jealousies, and
differences amongst yourselves; it must
increase your strength, your riches, and
your trade. By this union the whole
country, being joined in affection as well
as resources, and free from all apprehensions of different interests, will be able to
resist all its enemies. We earnestly recommend unanimity in this weighty affair,
that the union may be brought to a happy

June 3, 1965

conclusion. It will be the only effectual
way to secure our present and future
happiness, to disappoint the designs of
your enemies, who will certainly use all
their efforts to prevent or delay your
union.
This extract is taken from the Federalist,
where it is quoted by the eminent statesman
who wrote that work as expressing their own
views respecting the necessity of a closer
union between the American States.
In conclusion, I will say that I believe
and think that it is a great and grave undertaking that we are engaged in this evening.
It is no less than liberating to its natural
destinies of self-reliance and innate growth
and expansion a large portion of the largest
pastured quarter of this earth. When we remember with what rapid strides, and in how
short a time, America has taken a great
place among the Powers of the world, and that
its vast extent and gigantic features are not
yet animated by not one-hundredth part of
the life which will soon replenish them, it is
a serious occupation to be engaged in even
having a share in the disposal of its future
destinies. A large portion of this Continent
is already in full vigour, and might have been
so in connection with ourselves but for our
own folly. I believe, however, that at heart
the American people are still attached to us
as brothers, though they are disposed to
quarrel, as brothers often are. The rest of this
large Continent, still British, is now asking
us to assist them to develop their own strength
and resources in retained connection and in
partnership of allegiance to one common
Sovereign; and confident that this House will
willingly contribute its sanction to the measure
now introduced in order to carry out so great
a purpose, I move the second reading of this
Bill, which presents for our acceptance their
own proposition.

greatest benefit to tbose whose interesta are

and metropolitan country. The right hion.
Gentleman bas so weil stated both the provisions of the measure and the arguments by
which they are ta be supported, and I believe the House bas so unmistakably signified
its concurrence in the remarks hie bas made,
that it would anly be an unpardonable waste
of time were I ta meet by anticipation arguments wbicb I do not; believe will be raised.
1 only wish, tberefore, ta make a f ew remarks
in illustration and support of tbe arguments
of my right hion. Friend. It requires, indeed, no
argument ta justify the intended union of these
colonies. Look at tbe map wbicb displays their
geograpbical position-look ta the great inland
seas of Canada, and tbe fertile plains wbicb
border tbem;-look also upon tbe fertile plains
of tbe United States of America that are so
close ta tbem, and ta thýat noble river whicb,
by the aid of meebanical science, affords oppartunities ta carry tbe produce of the Western Provinces ta tbe sea. This alone is sufficient ta show wbat great advantages must
necessarily be derived from an union between
the iniand and the Maritime Provinces. Look
at the sbipping and tîmber trade of New
Brunswick, tbe minerai wealtb and commercial enterprise of Nova Scotia, and the noble
barbour o! Halifax, and let me ask you, Is it
possible ta believe tbat it was tbe intention
of nature and Providence that ail tbese great
sources of wealtb and power should be separate? And as they are pbysically conterminous, s0 tbey are morally united in tbe
firmest and deepest attacbment ta the Crown
o! Engiand and bier institutions.
This remark applies flot only ta those wbo
bave sprung from aur ovwn loins, and wbo
speak aur language, but also ta that otber
people resident in Lower Canada, which
is ta be cailed in future the Province of
Quebec. Tbey yield ta no other British subjects
in tbeir loyalty and attachment ta tbe tbrone
and ta tbe institutions under whicb they
live. Well, then, if you have the unanimous
request o! tbese Provinces, if you bave their
earnest wish and desire that these bounteous
intentions of Providence should be realized,
wbat abjection can there be against it? I

Provinces embraced in the measure-of
the Bull. Wben I tbink of Newfoundland and
Prince Edward's Island, and their abjection
to join in this arrangement, I amn reminded
of some of those towns wbicb, wben railways
were first introduced, petitioned that tbey

laid upon the table that the expression o!
feeling in this country and tbe arguments emplayed will, prabably, nat be witbaut result.
If, then, I speak o! tbese five Provinces, wbat

whicb desire ta continue no longer in their

nature o! the duties wbicb these Provincial

SENATE DEBATES

statesmen are called upon to discharge. During the time I had the honour of holding the
seals of the Colonial Office duties of no
merely Provincial or ordinary character were
necessarily discharged by Canada. At the time
when the St. Albans raid attracted so much
attention and alarm in this country, what
were the duties discharged by the Government of Canada and the Governor General
-to whom my right hon. Friend has paid
so just a tribute? The highest Executive
duty was discharged by the Government of
Canada when it called forth its own army
to guard its own frontier. The highest judicial
duties were discharged when, under your
statute, they were constituted interpreters of
the treaty for the extradition of offenders
subsisting between you and the United States
of America. The highest legislative duties were
discharged when, in compliance with the suggestion of the British Crown, they passed
an Act to render such raids impossible for the
future. I ask you, then, if you have the statesmen of these countries necessarily discharging the highest Executive, legislative, and
judicial functions, is it desirable that men
exercising these duties should be the representatives of 4,000,000 of people, and should
be animated by the public spirit of these
4,000,000, or that they should exercise them
as the representatives of small communities
such as Prince Edward's Island will continue
to be, if it remains excluded from the provisions of this Bill? Again, let us consider the
bearing of this measure upon the diplomatic
relations of this country. Look at the disadvantages which were incurred when we
were endeavouring at Washington to negotiate the renewal of the Reciprocity Treaty.
The fiscal portions of the treaty, if we had
succeeded, must have been submitted to five
Parliaments before it could have received the
Royal Assent. Is it desirable, that when the
populations of these Provinces, through the
representative of the Queen, negotiate treaties
with foreign Powers, the adoption of these
treaties should be ratified by the Parliament
of one great community, or should be subject
to the criticisms, and, perhaps, the local interests of five Parliaments of five different
communities? Then, again, with regard to the
complicated question which arose in the spring
of last year between this country and the
United States of America on the subject of
the fisheries. These fisheries were regulated
by the municipal laws of different colonies.
When we had to deal with this, was it
desirable in the negotiations between this
country and the United States of America
upon a matter of that vital importance-was

June 3, 1965

it desirable that we should be required to go
to several Parliaments in order to get these
laws altered? Sir, no practical difficulty, I am
happy to say, arose in the case; but I think
all those things I have referred to are proofs
of the great advantages that will accrue, both
to the colonies and to the mother country, by
such a scheme of consolidation as that which
is proposed in the present Bill. Look, again,
to the important matter of defence. My right
hon. Friend has referred to the despatches
which I addressed to the colonies, pointing
out, that while the mother country makes the
defence of the colonies a matter of Imperial
concern, she still calls upon them to discharge the first duties of citizenship, to be
the main agents of their own defence, and to
protect their own shores. But if the colonists
are thus to be the principal agents in their
own defence, is it not obvious that they will
be best able to discharge this duty when they
are united under one government? Why is
one policy to be established for Italy and
Germany, and another for the Provinces of
British North America? Is union to be the
general law, and yet not be the law for British
North America? Is it not the law over the
whole world that union is strength? Is it,
therefore, not perfectly obvious that the country, which by this Bill you are to create,
will be as powerful for defensive purposes
as if you reject it the colonists will be powerless? Time was when it was the policy of this
country to exercise a strong Imperial control
over her colonies. If that policy continued,
it would be unwise to pass this Bill; divide
et impera would be the maxim of a country
which wished to rule its colonies from home;
but that policy has now passed away, and
the sole object of our Colonial Government
now is to have the satisfaction, pride, and
pleasure of witnessing the growth, under the
Crown of England-under the flag of England
-of great and powerful communities attached
to the mother country by no other ties than
those of love and affection and a reciprocal
regard, which will prove a source of strength
in the hour of danger. For all these reasons I
cordially support the proposal of my righl
hon. Friend. I admit that there is a provision
not in the Bill which I should have been glad
to have seen there-namely, the overriding
and controlling power on the part of the
Central Legislature which was given in the
New Zealand Act. But I think the noble Earl
at the head of the Colonial Office and my right
hon. Friend are perfectly right in not pressing
the question more at the present moment. It
is, as he justly said, not our arrangement, but
theirs. It has been made by men of great

June 3, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

ability, patience, and temper, and they have
done it with a perfect knowledge of the circumstances with which they had to deal. Even
we, who do not know and cannot appreciate
all these difficulties, can yet see many reasons why, on the first creation of this Confederation, it might have been impossible to
have given that power. In the first place, the
intercolonial railway is not completed; and
though in a few years these Provinces will
be physically united, still a little time must
elapse before the union proposed by the Bill
can be entirely accomplished and consolidated.
Another reason is that it is necessary that
for municipal and local purposes there should
be large powers of legislation in the Provinces
there. They will, I hope, gradually approach
more nearly to the character of municipal
institutions than the Bill at present contemplates. But even then they must continue to
be more than mere municipal councils. They
must discharge for the several Provinces much
of that private business which is here discharged by Parliament at so much cost to the
suitors and so much inconvenience to ourselves. Therefore it is well that these wise
men have left it to a future time, when
experience will enable them to determine how
far these legislative bodies may continue to
retain their inherent powers, and how far
they can be reduced to the level of municipal
institutions. As the matter now stands, the
Bill gives to the Governor General an actual
veto over every measure passed by the local
Legislatures, and it allows the local Legislatures only to deal with those questions which
are supposed to be matters of local concern.
There is also provision in the Bill that a certain sum of money shall be allowed from
the central Government to each of the Provinces for the maintenance of its institutions.
If the sum be exceeded the Provinces must
provide the difference by direct taxation upon
its inhabitants; and if it does not equal the
amount it may carry the balance to its own
account for local purposes. That will be a
strong inducement to the Provinces to reduce
their local institutions to a moderate level.
I do hope that for the reasons I have stated
the House will give the Bill its cordial assent.
I cannot be surprised if, in a great undertaking like this, we make a tentative arrangement which hereafter may be susceptible of
such improvements as experience may suggest. The subject is one in which I take so
deep an interest, and its details are so
familiar to me, that I might trespass on the
attention of the House, but I will not now
further enlarge on the subject. My right hon.
Friend has stated the particulars of the
22624-16J

measure. I congratulate him on being the
instrument of proposing a measure like this
to the British Parliament; I cheerfully join
him in supporting it, as I have, while in office,
cordially assisted in promoting it; but the
main honour is due to those who have
laboured, with great patience, temper, and,
sagacity to bring about a plan which they
believed calculated to strengthen the colonies
in time of war and increase their prosperity
in time of peace, and who have adopted that
course, not as a preliminary to a future
separation from this country, but under the
influence of a loyalty to the British Crown
and an attachment to British institutions
which cannot be surpassed even in the assembly that is about to ratify their acts ... which
has been brought in and attempted to be
hurried through Parliament in the manner in
which this Bill is being dealt with. But thé
importance of it is much greater to the
inhabitants of those Provinces than it is to
us: but it is not on that account that we
should be expected to examine it less closely,
and see that we commit no errors in passing
it. The right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Adderley)
bas not offered us, on one point, an explanation which I think he will be bound to make.
The Bill does not include the whole of the
British North American Provinces; I presume
the two left out have been left out because
it is quite clear they do not wish to come in.
MR. ADDERLEY: I am glad I can inform
the hon. Gentleman that they are, one of
them at least, on the point of coming in.
MR. BRIGHT: Yes; the reason of their being
left out is because they were not willing to
come in. They may hereafter become willing,
and if so the Bill will admit them by a provision which appears reasonable. But the
Province of Nova Scotia is also unwilling to
come in, and it is assumed that because some
time ago the Legislature of that Province
voted a Resolution partly in favour of some
such course, therefore the population is in
favour of it. For my part, I do not believe
in the propriety or wisdom of the Legislature
voting on a great question of this nature with
reference to the Legislature of Nova Scotia,
if the people of Nova Sceotia never have had
the question directly put to them. I have heard
there is at present in London a petition complaining of the hasty proceeding of Parliament
and asking for delay, signed by 31,000 adult
males of the Province of Nova Scotia, and
that that petition is in reality signed by at
least half of all the male inhabitants of that
Province. So far as I know, the petition does
not protest absolutely against union, but

SENATE DEBATES
against the manner in which it is being carried
out by this scheme and Bill, and by the
hasty measures of the Colonial Office. Now,
whether the scheme be a good or a bad one,
scarcely anything can be more foolish, looking to the future, than that any of the Provinces should be dragged into it, either perforce, by the pressure of the Colonial Office,
or by any hasty action on the part of Parliament, in the hope of producing a result which
Probably the populations of those Provinces
may not wish to see brought about. I understand that the General Election for the
Legislature of Nova Scotia, according to the
Constitution of that colony, is inevitable in
the month of May or June next; that this
question has never been fairly placed before
the people of that Province at an election, and
that it has never been discussed and decided
by the public; and seeing that only three
months or not so much will elapse before
there will be an opportunity of ascertaining
the opinions of the population of Nova Scotia,
I think it is at least a hazardous proceeding
to pass this Bill through Parliament, binding
Nova Scotia, until the clear opinion of that
Province has been ascertained. If, at a time
like this, when you are proposing a union
which we all hope is to last for ever, you
create a little sore it will in all probability
become a great sore in a short time, and it
may be that the intentions of Parliament may
be almost entirely frustrated by the haste
with which this measure is being pushed
forward. The right hon. Gentleman the Chan-

June 3, 1965

cellor of the Exchequer, I think, in the early
part of the evening, in answer to a question
from this side, spoke of this matter as one
of extreme urgency. Well, I cannot discover
any urgency in the matter at all. What is
urgent is this-that when done it ought to
be done wisely, and with the full and free
consent of all those populations who are to
be bound by this Act and interested in its
results. Unless the good-will of those populations is secured, in all probability the Act
itself will be a misfortune rather than a
blessing to the Provinces to which it refers.
The right hon. Gentleman amused me in one
part of his speech. He spoke of "the filial
piety"-rather a curious term-of these Provinces, and their great anxiety to make everything suit the ideas of this country; and this
was said particularly with reference to the
proposition for a Senate selected, not elected,
for life by the Governor General of Canada.
He said they were extremely anxious to
follow, as far as possible, the institutions of
the mother country. Well, I have not the
smallest objection to any people on the face
of the earth following our institutions if they
like them. Institutions which suit one country,
as we all know, are not very likely to suit
every other country. With regard to this particular case, the right hon. Gentleman said
it is to be observed that Canada had had a
nominated Council, and had changed it for
an elected one, and surely they had a right,
if they pleased to ...

SENATE DEBATES
In the result, the measure has been reintroduced, and it will be recalled that on May 6,
1965, the Government moved the resolution
stage of the legislation, and after debate the
necessary bills were introduced. Second reading was given the Bank Act and the Quebec
Savings Banks Act on June 14 last. These
measures were then referred to the Standing
Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic
Affairs, where they will receive further detailed consideration. It is not expected that
this consideration and examination can be
completed by July 1, 1965. The Bank Act,
under section 6, now provides for authority
to carry on business until July 1965, if Parliament sits for 20 days in the month of
June. By June 28 this will have been the
case, and it is therefore necessary to provide
for a further extension.
The bill now before us provides that the
.authority to carry on business will be extended to December 31, 1965. It is felt that
this date will permit Parliament to complete
a thorough revision of this very vital legislation.
I might say to honourable senators that
there are many precedents for extending the
application of the Bank Act beyond ten years.
In 1911 the application of the Act was extended for one year, and it was subsequently
extended in 1912 for one further year. In 1933
the application of the Bank Act was extended
for a period of one year, and in 1944 it was
extended for a period of three months. Again,
in 1964 it was extended for one year, and now
In 1965 a further extension of six months is
being proposed.
Motion agreed to and bill read second

Bill read first time.

SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly, with leave of the
Senate, moved second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-122
contains the first of the supplementary estimates for the current fiscal year. Copies of
the bill have been distributed and placed on
the files of honourable senators. Unless an
honourable senator wishes me to discuss
them, I do not propose to deal with the five
clauses of the bill. They are in the form that
is usual in appropriation bills, and I am sure
all honourable senators are thoroughly
familiar with their terms.
I should like to deal exclusively with the
schedule, which is the substantive part of
the bill. The only item to be considered is
Vote 8a in the estimates of the Department
of Labour. The amount to be voted is $2
million. The purpose of the bill, to put it
concisely, is to authorize payments to be
made under the winter house-building incentive program for a period of two weeks.
The program originally was to expire on
March 31, 1965. For various reasons, the
Government decided to extend the program
for two weeks. During the two-week extension certain building programs had been
undertaken which qualified for the receipt
of the incentive bonus of $500 per house.
The amount required to meet the obligations
of the Government in respect of that extension is approximately $2 million.
Perhaps I should draw to the attention of
the Senate the fact that in the 1964-65 fiscal
year there were 33,459 units approved for
inclusion in this program. The value of the
approved applications was approximately $481
million. I can supply a breakdown by provinces of this $481 million worth of construction which has been carried out under the
program.
The cost to the federal treasury for this
program in the present fiscal year is estimated to be about $17 million. For the previous fiscal year of 1963-64 the cost to the
treasury was about $14 million.
I am informed that the contribution made
to the solution of the problem of seasonal
unemployment, according to the estimates
provided by the Department of Labour, can
be stated in this way: As a result of this
program, 90,000 jobs were provided on site
during the winter season, and 115,000 other
jobs were provided off the site of construction for which the program was designed.
Honourable senators, this a short and comprehensive statement of the item with which
we are concerned.

June 22, 1965

DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Farris: I did flot want ta interrupt my learned friend while he was speaking, but I do flot; seem ta have received
copies of bis which are supposed ta have
been distributed ta the members of this
house, and I should like ta know how ta
obtain them.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): They
should be on the desks of honaurable senators.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, the explanation given by the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly) is appreciated. It covers every aspect
of the supplementary estimate.
In dealing with this bill, I think it is appropriate that we should consider for a
moment the success of the winter works program, which began as a municipal works
pragramn several years ago. The program has
been most successful, and indeed has changed
the outlook of Canadians regarding winter
employment. In the province in which I live
it used ta be that tradesmen estimated they
would probably have three ta four months
of winter unemployment. Today many of
these tradesmen have year-round employment, and the most skilled tradesmen can
expect a period of unemployment of approximately one month a year.
This program bas been highly successful,
and in ail its aspects is worthy of our support.
Perhaps I misunderstood the Leader of the
Government when hie said that the $2 million
required under this bill is for the two weeks'
extension. I believe that it provides for
accounts which have not been received by
the Government, as well as those which will
corne in as a result af the two weeks' extension. It covers more than the two weeks'
extension.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes,
you are quite right.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I amn sure that ail
members will be happy to support this bill
and see that it gets ready passage through
the Senate.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
I understood the honýourable leader tai say
that $481 million was the amaunt expended.
That is not the amaunt expended for the
$500 winter program, is it? It seems a very
large sum. I notice that the $2 million is
supposed ta caver quite a period of time.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is the praperty
value. the sale prices of the houses.

Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes, that is what I taok
it ta be, the total sale value of the houses
and not the $500 which was put on for the
encouragement of winter work. As a matter
of fact, the $2 million that is mentîoned here,
at $500 a house, would mean only 4,000
houses.
Also, the honaurable leader states that
90,000 jobs were provided. I amn sure hie is
not intimating that the $500 winter programn
xvas responsible for 90,000 jobs. That was
for the total development under the housing
scheme.
He also mentioned 115,000 jobs during the
winter manths for the manufacture of necessary building materials. I amn mentionîng these
things s0 that we may have these points
cleared up. The impression was given that
the $481 million spent was due ta the $500
increase, and also that it had been responsible for something like 90,000 or 115,000
jobs. That would be -a grave exaggeration.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senatars,
if the honourable senator speaks now, it will
have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I thank bath honourable senators opposite who have spoken in respect of
this bill. Perhaps I was flot clear in my
opening remarks. The cost ta the treasury of
the bonus at the rate af $500 per unit for the
fiscal year 1964-65 is estimated ta be about
$17 million. This $17 million is the bonus
which is paid on appraximately 33,500 units
which were canstructed during the period of
the program, which is now being extended ta
April 15.
The value of the approved construction,
that is ta say, the value of the buildings put
up pursuant ta the ternis of this pragram
throughout the country, is estimated ta be
about $481 million. That is the value of the
work done under the Winter House-Building
Incentive Pragram during the winter just
past.
I have some further figures of interest.
This is an approximate breakdown of the
amounts expended by provinces. These figures
will not add up ta $481 million, as that waF
an estimate. The figures will give a general
idea of the money which has been expended
on this pragramn in ahl provinces. The amounts
I amn giving do not represent the cast ta the
federal treasury; they represent the value of
buildings constructed under the pragram.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: The sale price.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Many of them would have
been constructed anyway, of course.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I ask the honourable
leader a question? He bas given us a figure,
$481 million, as the value of the construction,
which may or may not have been inspired
by this particular program. Has hie any comparable figure for a normal year-say, three
years before this program-so as to indicate
how much of this construction was actually
inspired by this bll and what proportion of
it was merely taking advantage of a Government handout of $500 per house?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I do not
have that figure, but I would be happy to
try to locate it, and perhaps get the figures
for some years back so that honourable
senators may look at them.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Would the honourable
senator say that as far as hie knows no such
comparison has been made?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No, I
would not say anything of the kind. I have
not got the information for which the honourable senator asks. Ail I have with me is

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Apparently some senators have copies on their

He said: Honourable senators, in endeavouring to discuss the fisheries industry with
which. this bill is concernied, 1 do so with
considerable trepidation because 1 arn aware
that there are others in this chamber much
more competent than I to discuss fishing. I
think, for example, of the modest senator
for West Coast (Hon. Mr. Basha) who spent
much of his if e closely allied with the fishing industry in his native province and made
a considerable contribution to the economy
of the West Coast in connection with that
industry.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask a question? I
would like to know if my honourable friend

June 22, 1965

June22. 965SENATE
DEBATES

Han. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): I assure my honourable frîend that I am not
codding.
I think also of the venerable and active
member for Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley), who from the days of bis boybood
bas bad intimate associations witb that industry and who, like tbe honourable senator
for West Coast, made an invaluable contribution to the industry. If I have any right
at ail to discuss this industry today it is
because of my much briefer association with
fisbing when, as a member of the Government of Nova Scotia in the portfolio of Industry, I had the privilege of setting up the
first division of fisheries in the bistory of
that province.
Everybody is aware, I am sure, that fishing is probably Canada's oldest industry.
Long before a tree was felled in the then new
land, the early explorers and their crews
fisbed for and ate and bartered the cod and
haddock they caught on the east coast of
wbat was to become Canada. What amazes
me, as it must amaze many people, is that
this industry bas neyer lived up to its
potential. That it bas not done so is due to
a variety of factors. If you will bear with
me I sbould like to discuss briefly tbe history
of the industry before getting down to the
immediate facts involved in the legislation
now before us.
Jurisdiction over fisheries was vested in
the federal Government by the Britisb North
America Act, and there bas almost always
been a Minister of Fisheries. But for some
peculiar reason there was flot for mýany years
a recognition by the federal Government of
the value of the fishing industry and what it
was worth as a livelihood to the people ivolved in it. Provincial governments of provinces wbere fisbing operations have been
carried on from the beginning of their existence always took the rather cowardly attitude that because jurisdiction was vested
in the federal Government they ought not
to risk their political necks by dabbling too
much in the fisbing industry. "Let Ottawa
look after it," was always the theme song of
those governments, and that, in the main, is
why fishing bas not progressed as mucb as
it sbould bave despite the considerable progress it bas made.
I remember not too many years ago-I
refer to, this because this bull is concerned
solely with what we on the east coast cail
inshore fIshing-and it will be remembered by
others bere, particularly my colleagues from.
the Atlantic Provinces, wben the average

income of the insbore fishermen, most of
whom had large families, was less than $300
a year. And I can remember wben successive royal commissions-I have always taken
a very dim view of royal commissions since
then-reported to the Governmnent of this
country and to the people of Canada that the
reason for the distress of the fishermen in
those areas was due to the depredations of
the draggers and trawlers fishing off our
fishing banks.
Now it is difficuit toi conceive that intelligent men-and they were ail intelligent
men--could have arrived at such a conclusion.
1 further recaîl that in those days the
greatest number of trawlers fisbing out of
Nova Scotia was three, and that number
was gradually cut to one; and yet the newspapers and publie men in the various political parties bewailed the depredations of
these monsters looting the ocean in that
part of the world of its fisb, thus impoverishing the inshore fishermen.
Public opinion considered that the royal
commissions were right; they could not possibly be wrong, composed as they were of
illustrious men from ail parts of Canada.
Yet the simple fact is that the poor inshore
fishermen was in the plight he was because he had poor littie boats with whicb
be could operate only five months of the
year and hope to live for 12 months on the
catch secured in those five montbs. It was
an absolute impossibility. And ail the while
federal governments-and 'I see the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Brooks) smiling; I know he too has an acute recollection
of these misdemeanours-all the wbile we
were being cut down to one trawler in Nova
Scotia while 300 trawlers, Dutcb, Portuguese, American and British, were operating
off our shores.
About that time there was a representative
in the federal Parliament from Halifax, a
man for whom I had and have the greatest
respect, wbo was one of the small minority
in that province who said, "This is obviously
wrong. If we cannot supply our markets
how can we possibly hold tbem, and bow
can we supply our markets if we do not
have the modern equipment to catch the flsh
that the markets require?" He said as much
speaking in bis place in the House of Commons, and he repeated bis message in several public meetings in Halifax city and
county; finally he took a full-page advertisement in the Halifax newspapers to set out
bis views about markets, and the things

SENATE DEBATES

which were necessary to attract and to hold
those markets. He was an astute politician
and knew he was running contrary to public
opinion, no matter how wrong that public
opinion might be. He knew he was risking
his political neck at the polls because all of
these events occurred less than 12 months
before an election was to take place in which
he was again to be a candidate. But with
that perspicacity that was always characteristic of him and with that absolute honesty that figured so highly in all his political
transactions, he took his political life in his
hands, firm in the belief that if the people
were told the simple facts they would eventually absorb them, and they did. I am happy
to be able to tell you that that member from
Halifax sits with his head bowed in the
Senate tonight, the senior senator for Halifax, the Honourable Gordon B. Isnor.
I was encouraged by that as well as by
my own belief to the point where in the
face of vigorous resistance from certain
vested fishing interests in Nova Scotia we
were able to set up a Fisheries Loan Board,
taking a moribund condition and making it
active and creative. The federal Government
co-operated with subsidies on trawlers. I was
convinced at that time-and that was in 1940
-that if we could only catch the fish, we
could sell every pound of it at the highest
prices ever paid to Nova Scotia producers,
because the war was on.
That, honourable Senators, is what happened, with the result that the fishing industry in Nova Scotia was never before in
its history as prosperous as it is today, and
the inshore fishermen of Nova Scotia have
long since lost their bugaboo about draggers
and trawlers.
Some of them now operate their own
draggers and trawlers with financial assistance from the federal and provincial governments, and only within the past three
months the present Government of Nova
Scotia, recognizing the value of the fishing
industry, recognizing its obligations to the
people in the fishing industry, has set up a
full-time Department of Fisheries, not, mind
you, to run parallel with the Department of
Fisheries at Ottawa but based, I am sure,
on the thought that with more than one-fifth
of our people depending on the fisheries for
a living, the government of the day in that
province should lend every possible assistance to ensure the improvement and development of the industry.
Today the industry is in a great
and prosperous condition. That does not

June 22, 1965

apply though to one of the four Atlantic
provinces, one which has a great history
and tradition in the fishing industry. I refer
to the Province of Newfoundland, where
since the inception of this scheme in 1950
there have been, I believe, only 15 loans
made. The main reason for that is not the
legislation, because the money is available.
Rather it is that inshore fishermen of Newfoundland-and I say this in all deference
to my honourable friend across the chamber
who bas a great interest in this industryare scattered up and down many miles of
remote coast-remote, yes, even from the
ordinary civilizing influences of large towns
and cities such as we know. There are no
commercial banking facilities anywhere near,
and many of them have not been told about
the opportunities there are to borrow this
money and to enhance their economy and
that of their families.
In Nova Scotia it has been different, as it
bas too in Prince Edward Island and New
Brunswick. With the joint co-operative effort
now being undertaken by the Province of
Newfoundland and the federal Department
of Fisheries, under which people will be
moved from their outlying isolated spots into
fishing communities where they can have
greater intercourse of communication and
greater access to the commercial facilities
they so badly need, I am hopeful-because
of what has happened in Nova Scotia and
perhaps to a lesser extent in Prince Edward
Island and New Brunswick-that the Newfoundland fisherman, who surely deserves the
best that can be done for him, will emerge
into the light of a new day. I am hopeful
that he will join with his counterparts in
the other three Atlantic provinces, so that
in a few years time there will be in the
Newfoundland fisheries an era of prosperity
that for some years has been noticeably
absent.
When I said to you earlier that the fishing
industry is perhaps the oldest industry in
Canada, that is not of much importance, but
when I tell you in terms of dollars and cents
and in terms of exports, which of course
means new money being brought into this
country, what the fishing industry really is
doing, then perhaps there will be a better
concept of its value.
I have some figures here, and I would ask
your permission to deal with them briefly.
For example, the value of the primary production in 1963 was estimated at approximately $129 million. The Atlantic area produced 59 per cent of this total, the Pacifi<

June 22, 19-65

SENATE DEBATES

area 32 per cent, and the inland fishing the
remaining 9 per cent. The value of production at the secondary level-that is, the
marketing level-was estimated at $255 million, and it is worth while noting that 68
per cent of this amount, or $172 million,
represents the total value of exports by this
industry in 1963. I cannot give you the figures
subsequent to that, but my information is
that the progression in this industry has
continued and that the results of the 1964-65
fiscal year will surpass by far the figures I
have just read to you for 1963.
Let me give you just one comparison to
emphasize this fact-and I mean no criticism
when I say that the federal Department of
Fisheries has not functioned as it ought to
have. I forgive all the past derelictions in
view of the progress that has been made in
the last 10 years. For example, in 1954 or
1955 the Department of Fisheries had a total
expenditure of approximately $11 million.
Ten years later, in 1964 or 1965, the total
expenditure by the department was $25.5
million. And it will continue to rise, for the
reason that there is in the portfolio of Fisheries-and I say this not because he happens
to be a member of the party whose fortunes
I have always followed; I would give praise
to whomever the occupant of the office happened to be-a man more closely identified
with the industry and its needs and with the
human factor in the industry than anyone
who has preceded him. There was one other
such person, back in the days of the late R. B.
Bennett, who would have been an outstanding
Minister of Fisheries. I refer to the late
W. G. Ernst, because he too was at the very
heart of the fishing industry; he knew people
and recognized, as does the present occupant
of that office, that the great science of life
is not stratospheric activity but, as is well
known but seldom recognized, the knowledge
of human beings. Enough of philosophy.
I come now to the immediate factors in
this bill. It is a very simple piece of legislation. It is designed entirely to assist the inshore fishermen. In brief, this is what it
does. It raises from $4,000 to $10,000 the
amount of money that can be borrowed
under this bill when it becomes law. The
present legislation will go out of existence
on June 30 next. This measure increases the
borrowing power of the little man, the backbone of the fishing industry, from $4,000 to
$10,000, and it extends the credit terms from
8 to 10 years. It is excellent legislation, I
submit.
If there is one little criticism, one little
fault that can be found in it, it might be that

the term is not sufficiently long. I would be
pleased to see it extended to 15 years instead
of 10, but it is such a tremendous advance
over anything we have done in the past that it
ought to win credits from most of us.
The original act was enacted in 1955. It
has been amended several times since by
successive governments, each recognizing the
value of this legislation, each improving on
it, until now we have reached what is before
us in the bill of the moment.
I think it is worthy of note that in all the
years of the operation of this statute there
have been only 3 defaults. I think that
nothing could pay greater tribute to the innate native honesty of the fishermen than
the fact that they pay their bills.
This is what the bill proposes to do, aside
from what I have just told you. There is a
total fund of $20 million, above which the
Government will not for the moment go. This
will help the fishermen to purchase and construct fishing vessels and secure equipment.
It will assist them to repair their fishing vessels or one of the major components. It can
be used for the purchase and construction of
shore installations, and for the purchase, construction, repair, alteration or extension of
buildings used or to be used in a primary
fishing enterprise, and certain prescribed developments such as the construction, repair or
alteration of a water supply system.
In that connection I remember the little
semi-impoverished village of Petit de Grat
Bridge in Nova Scotia that was rapidly becoming a ghost town. In spite of severe opposition we were able to bring in a water
supply from high hills three miles away and
to pave a road into the village. This proved
to be the salvation of a small fishing cooperative which was in the process of being
wound up with debts of hundreds of dollars.
That was a village in which only the
pastor and the general store owner had cars,
and one other man had a truck. I visited the
village recently and counted 62 automobiles
on the wharf of the fishing plant that is operated by an American company that was
brought into Nova Scotia to provide competition for the existing companies. That little
village of Petit de Grat Bridge has now taken
on an air of prosperity, and is enjoying conditions that its most optimistic citizen never
visualized.
I am sure that every member of the Senate will agree with me that the independent
people who prefer to work out their own
destinies and to work endlessly in order to
provide the necessities of life for their prog-

OTTAWA TERMINAL RAILWAY BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE ADOPTED
Hon. A. K. Hugessen, Chaîrman of the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, reported that the committee had
considered Bill S-3, to incorporate the Ottawa Terminal Railway Company and had
directed that the bill be reported with the
following amendment:
Page 3: Strike eut lines 33 to 35 inclusive and substitute therefor the following:
"(g) furnish for hire in and about the
cities of Ottawa and Hull such ndequate and suitable service as is customary or usual for the pick-up, delîvery
and transfer of goods by means of trucks
or".
The Hon. the Speaker: Henourable senators, when shall this report be taken into

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move that this
-report be adopted now.
This bill to incorporate the Ottawa Terminal Railway Company was considered by
your committee on two occasions, the first of
which was June 3, and the second this
morning.
Perhaps 1 could deal first with the amendment which has just been read and which
was proposed by the committee. It is an
amendment in connection with the trucking
services which the company wihl be authorized to carry on in and about the cities of
Ottawa and Hull. The trucking industry oh-

June 23, 1965

jected te the rather too general wording of
the original clause 10(g), but the clause just
read by the Assistant Clerk has been agreed
to by ail parties in interest, including the
raihway companies. That is the onhy amendment which we propose to the bill at this
time.
Honourable senators will recali that a bill
very similar te Bill S-3 came before the
Senate last session, was referred te the Comnmittee on Transport and Communications and
received quite prolonged consideratien by
that committee at several meetings. We suggested several amendments. The bill, with
those amendments, received third reading in
this house, but unfortunately the end of the
session came before the bill could be considered by the other place. So that at this
session we have before us substantially the
saine bill as we had te consider last year
with the amendments which we had proposed
last year, and one or two other miner amendments, the position thus being that we had
in substance considered the whole matter very
extensively hast year and do net need te go
inte the question in such great detail this
year.
However, a new element came inte the matter. As honourable senaters will recaîl, in the
debate on second reading Senator Roebuck
raised the point that the railway unions desired te be heard this year on the bill, ahthough they had made no move to be heard
last year. As I promised hlm at the time
of the debate on second reading, we immediately got in touch with the railway unions
and a number of their representatives, both
operating and non-operating unions, were
present at the meeting which we held on
June 3.
The interest which the unions had in the
matter was this. Here was a new company
organized te take over the railway operations
in and about the City of Ottawa, to which
several hundred employees of both the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National
Railways would be moved when the new
company was set up. The unions asked: What
guarantee have we th-at the rights thýat these
men now have under our union contracts with
the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National Railways will be honoured? What guarantee have we that their rights of seniority,
and their rights te pensiens and te, passes, and
alh these other rights which formed the subject in years past of prolonged negotiations
with the two railway companies, will carry
ever into the new company? Therefore, they

June 23, 1965

DEBATES
June23. 965SENATE

proposed an arnendment to the bill to caver
substantially those rights.
The representatives of the railway cornpanies were present and took a very reasonable attitude. They said that the hast thing
they wanted to do was to deprive the unions,
or members of the unions whose positions
were going to be changed as a resuit of their
being re-ernployed by the Ottawa Terminal
Railway Cornpany, frorn being in any way
affected by the change. So after a good deal
of discussion we suggested ta the representatives of the unions and ta the representatives
of the raihway companies that they sit down
together and see whether they could not reach
some agreement on the whole matter. I think
Senator Croli was the flrst persan ta suggest
that. We said to them, "'Ail right, you sit
down together and see what yau can do, and
corne back ta us in a fortnight's time and tel
us whether you have been able ta reach an
agreernent."
1 arn happy ta be able ta tell the house
that this morning we had a second meeting
of the cornmittee and at that time the representatives of the unions and the representatives of the railways informed us that they
haýd reached camplete agreement as ta the
position of those men who were ta be transferred. Letters which were exchanged between the raihway companies and the unions
were read into the record and will form
part of the officiai praceedings af aur cammittee.
The unions' representatives said they were
perfeetly satisfied that their abjections had
been met and that they did flot naw need
any amendrnents ta the bill, that they were
happy with things as they were.
Honourable senators, I should say that a
great deal of credit is due ta the attitude
whieh the unions' representatives and the
railway representatives taok in the rnatter.
I should add, ini a word, that I think sornething is due ta yaur Committee on Transport
and Communications for bringing about this
happy resuit.

SENATE DEBATES

is information on the total value of residential
construction for the winter months, that is,
October to March.
I am informed that the figures are as follows:
For the year 1962-63, the total value of
residential construction for the winter months
was approximately $733 million; for the year
1963-64, $979 million; and for the year 196465, $1,068 million.
I am also informed that while there are
no figures available on the number of housing units constructed in the winter months
prior to the commencement of the program,
the Department of Labour estimates the figure was in the order of 15,000 to 18,000 units
per winter season. In 1963-64, there were
35,000 housing units constructed, of which
the department has a record, and in 1964-65,
39,000. That is the best information I have
been able to get to date.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: That does not sound
altogether reasonable. In 1962, with $733
million expended, there were only 15,000
houses constructed, and in 1963-64, with $979
million expended, there were 35,000.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No.
Perhaps I did not make it clear.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Perhaps I did not understand you.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In 196263 the total value of residential construction
was $733 million. That includes single units
and apartment buildings as well; it is all
residential construction.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: In 1962?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In 196263.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: And there were 15,000 to
18,000 buildings constructed?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Not
exactly. The figure of 15,000 to 18,000 units
constructed prior to the opening of the program is for single unit residences and it does
not include apartments.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Then if you are making a
comparison, the true picture would include
apartments as well?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No.
The program does not apply to apartment
buildings; it applies only to single family
dwellings. That is why I say the figures are
not entirely satisfactory, because it appears,
in a sense, as if one is comparing apples
and oranges; but I did give the figures for

the total value of residential construction
for the years in question. The figures given
last night dealt with the program with which
we were immediately concerned, and for the
winter just past.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
may I make a further comment on that? My
question last evening was not intended to
be critical of the program; it was intended
to elicit some information which I think the
honourable Leader of the Government would
regard as important.
I am interested in finding out to what
extent the $500 incentive has been effective.
I am not saying it has not been effective; I
hope it has been. I appreciate the difficulty
that confronts the honourable leader in obtaining these figures. However, I am surprised
that the department has not made them available, that it bas not itself analysed its own
program so that it could say to us today:
We are reasonably certain that such and
such a percentage of this-on the face of it a
very substantial increase-is due to this
program.
I say this' because another program more
or less in the same field was a failure. Again,
I am not blaming anyone; it was a good try.
But according to the figures the honourable
leader has given us, in this area of residential
construction there has been a jump from the
year prior to this $500 incentive program
from $733 million in 1962-63 to $979 million
in 1963-64, and to $1.68 billion this year, if
I took the figures down correctly.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is
$1.068 billion.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Yes, thank you. I wonder if I could now ask the honourable leader
if he would make further inquiries, and, if
the department bas not already done this
essential job, ask them to do it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I will
certainly make further inquiries, but perhaps
I could emphasize again that before the program was started, as I understand it, they
did not keep separate figures for residential
construction in the winter months for single
family units as against multiple fanily units.
But they have made an estimate of the single
family units constructed in the year prior to
the inauguration of the program, and that
estimate is from 15,000 to 18,000 individual
family units in that year. The following year
their figures show that 35,000 individual
family units were built, which is almost
double the number built the year before. In
the winter construction period just concluded

SENATE DEBATES
the number was 39,000. So there is consideraable information available from an examination of those figures.
Hon. Mr. Grosar: The particular question
I should like to have answered is: What percentage of this construction is due to this
incentive program? We all know there has
been a general rise in building construction
in this period. We can assume that not all
the houses involved in this increase were
constructed because of the $500 incentive. I
repeat my suggestion that the department
should come up with the figures and say what
is the attributable percentage increase. It can
be done, because it is being done by the
construction industry itself, and that industry
is publishing the material from time to time.
I would not like the impression to be left
that the Department of Labour is not able
to do this very simple job.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I will
see what I can do.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time

today an importer who wishes to withdraw
goods imported by him from customs has,
before he can do so, to pay the duty imposed
upon those goods. Over the last eight years
or so a system has grown up that has been
of great use to the department itself and to
the importers, under which the department
has allowed importers to withdraw goods
against a bond for payment of the customs
duty in the future. It is a system which apparently works extremely well. It makes it
much easier for the customs houses to operate,
and it has the advantage of allowing an importer who is desperately anxious to get his
goods out of customs in order to sell them
or dispose of them, to do so without having
to wait for some elaborate calculation of the
duty to be made. After he has withdrawn his
goods he receives a bill for the duty and
pays it.
This has been a good system, but the
trouble was that it has no legal sanction whatever. This clause of the bill proposes to give
legal sanction to this exceedingly useful system which, as I say, has grown up over the
last eight years.

]Roebuck and I would agree, any suggested
reduction i any tariff is a good thing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The circumstances
under which. sucb a reduction may be brought
about under section 3 7A are such as to require
mie to keep very closely to my notes in order
to be able to explain just what they mean.
The purpose of the section is to remove
certain inequities that resuit from the trade
levels and quantity rules found in section 36
of the Customs Act. Section 36 specifies that
the value for duty of imported goods shall
be the fair market value of like goods when
sold for consumption in the country of export
under the conditions that are laid down in
that section. Under subsection 3, if an exporter is selling to a wholesaler in Canada
while in the home market he seils only to
retailers, his value for duty is based on the
price to such retailers. The British dlaim that
in certain cases the operation of this provision discriminates against United Kingdom
exporters in favour of exporters in other
countries, because the geographic size of the
Canadian market and the limes of distribution in Canada are often longer than those
in compact countries such as Great Britain.
In Canada, for example, goods must pass
in turn from the manufacturer to a wbolesaler, to a retailer, and finally to the consumer, while in Britain the manufacturer
may seil directly to the retailer. Hence, the
British argue that while they seil in Canada
to the samne trade level and in similar quantities as, for example, American exporters, the
British must, because of the combined effects
of section 36 and the anti-dumping law, price
their goods as if tbey were seuling in the
much more compact British market to a
lower level of trade and in smailer quantities. They are thus bard put to compete with
other exporters who, because their domestic
mnarket is similar in structure to the Canadian one, are ailowed to dlaim. trade and
quantity discounts denied the British in
establishing values for duty under the present law. In effect, the existing legisiation
discriminates against certain countries by
imposing a higher valuation base than would
obtain if market conditions in those countries
were similar to those in other exporting
countries. Not only are ordinary duties
assessed on the higher values, but, in respect
of goods of a class or kind made in Canada,
exporters are prevented from reducing their
prices to competitive levels by the tbreat of
anti-dumping duty.

I hope that what I have just said does not
appear to honourable senators as so mucb
gobbledygook, as it appeared to me wben I
read it for the first tirne. I should like to
give bonourable senators a practical example
of wbat is meant by this.
Let us take, for instance, floor polishers.
Suppose a British manufacturer of floor
polishers wishes to export some of his production to Canada. Great Britain being a
very concentrated' country, bis own domestic market there does not require him to sel
to wbolesalers, but permits him to seil to
retailers at a higber price. When be cornes
to export his floor polishers to Canada the
duty which be pays is based on the bigber
price wbicb be charges retailers in bis own
country.
On the other band, take an American
exporter of floor polishers. His method of
business is different. The United States is a
very large country, and the American manufacturer bas the habit of selling in large
blocks to wholesalers ail over the country at
lower prices tban those at wbich. he would
seil to retailers, and when be cornes to export
bis floor polishers to Canada be only pays
duty on the price wbich be charges bis
wholesalers, wbile the British manufacturer
bas to pay duty on the higber price that be
charges bis retailers. Tbat is as simple an
explanation as I can give.
This apparently bas caused a great deal
o! comment and criticism in Great Britain and
very strong representations have been made
to our Goverarnent that this is a discrimination that exists against the British and perbaps otber continental manufacturers, resulting, flrst o! ail, from, the wording of our
Customns Act as it stands at present and, secondly, from tbe difference in the methods of
operation of manufacturers in smailer countries and tbat of manufacturers in large
countries like tbe United States.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Migbt I ask if this would
apply to Britisb cars?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:- I do not know
wbetber it -does. It may apply to British
cars. AIl this section does is to permit the
Governor ini Council to inquire in the case
of any particular industry as to wbetber
these conditions apply. If after inquiry it
sbould. be found tbat tbey do apply to cars,
then it will be open to the Governor in
Council to make the necessary adjustmnents.
Han. Mr. Hayd.n: I think i-t would apply
to any class o! goods being imported.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, it would, provided
the conditions apply, and provided there is
competition between manufacturers in two
countries where the methods of operation is
different, thus establishing different bases
for the value of the goods upon which our
tariff is based.
The proposed new section 37A will provide
authority to remove these inequities, while
at the same time retaining sufficient safeguards against unfair practices. The application of the section will not, of course, be
limited to Great Britain, but will be available to other countries against which the
present law might discriminate.
The third principal change in the Customs
Act is to be found in section 4 of the bill.
It closes a rather interesting loophole that
has been discovered in the Act. The section
is designed to neutralize the effect of transshipping goods through a second country in
order to obtain a lower fair market value
than would obtain had the goods been
shipped directly from the country of origin.
In valuing goods for customs purposes,
we are normally concerned with the fair
market value at the place from which the
goods were shipped directly to Canada. This
is in accordance with section 36 of the
Customs Act. In the majority of cases, the
country of export is also the country of
origin.
However, because price levels, and hence
fair market values, vary from country to
country, goods may be shipped to an intermediate country with lower price levels than
the country of origin and, subsequently, be
imported into Canada at a lower value for
duty than if imported directly from the
country of origin.
You see the loophole. Apparently the Canadian manufacturers have made representations to the department that they would
like to see this loophole closed, and it seems
only reasonable that should be so.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think this led to a
lot of "offshore companies," as they are
called.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps so. I have
dealt with section 5 which is consequential
on section 1. Section 6 is the only one that
remains, and it has to do with goods which
are imported originally into Canada by another government, or for the use of another
government-I think almost wholly for the
Government of the United States-and which
when they have served the purpose of that
government are sold in Canada to Canadians.

June 23, 1965

When they were imported from the United
States for the use by the United States Government they were imported duty free, but
when after use they are resold in either
damaged or worn condition to other Canadians they then have to bear a tariff and
a sales tax. It has been the practice of the
department, in co-operation with the organization which carries on these sales, that is,
the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation, to
agree with that corporation that when the
latter sells any of these United States goods
to Canadians in Canada, 151 per cent of the
purchase price shall be considered as being
the equivalent of what would have been the
customs and sales tax on those goods, and
they have collected that from the Crown
Assets Disposal Corporation.
Here again is a practice which has no
sanction in law, but it has been very convenient because these goods for the most
part are in the far northern part of the
country, away up in the DEW line and places
like that, and the Customs division has found
that it would cost them far more to send
men up to evaluate these things in the far
northern part of the country than simply to
collect the 151 per cent. So, it is a useful
provision. As I have said, it has had no legal
sanction up to the present time although the
practice was studied by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts of the other house
in its eighth report of December 7 last. That
committee recognized the practice as being
sensible and practicable, but recommended
that an amendment be made to the Customs
Act or the Customs Tariff that it has a right
to be applied to the proceeds of all sales
in Canada of United States government
property by Crown Assets Disposal Corporation. That is what this section does.
I do not know if there is anything further
I need say at the moment, honourable senators. If this bill should receive second reading, I shall move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where the senators can ask questions
of the officers of the department in case there
is any further information they should require.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): May I
ask one question before the honourable
senator concludes? Under section 3, or under
any other part of the Act, is there any provision allowing for an appeal from the decision of the Governor in Council?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That question was
raised in the House of Commons, and the
answer the minister gave was this: Yes, there

June 23, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

is an appeal under the relevant provisions
of the Customs Act, to the Tariff Board and
then to the Exchequer Court.
I must add that the minister said he was
not speaking as a lawyer, that he was advised
to that effect; but he did not give an outright opinion.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, there is not a great deal I wish to say
at this time in regard to this amendment to
the Customs Act. The honourable Senator
Hugessen bas explained it very clearly, and
there are just one or two points to which
I would like to draw attention.
In regard to section 1, which legalizes a
practice which has been in effect, I was
wondering if there is any time limit on when
the duty must be paid. When an importer
imports goods to this country and gives a
bond or guarantee to pay the duty, are there
any regulations whereby he must pay within
a week or 30 days, or when the goods are
sold, or something to that effect?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The information I received from the legal members of the department was that normally the delay is three
days, because he gets the goods out and
pays in three days.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I point out to the
senator who asked the question that in section 1 of the bill, which is section (3) of the
new section 22, it is stated:
The Governor in Council may make
regulations prescribing
(a) the terms and conditions upon
which goods may be entered into Canada
free of any requirement that the importer shall, at the time of entry, pay
or cause to be so paid all duties on the
goods so entered inwards;
So that by regulation the time is going to be
prescribed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I was
wondering if a time limit had been determined.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I understand it is three
days.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Three
days has been their practice. Therefore, in
regard to section 1, I do not think there can
be any objection to it. It bas been the practice,
and therefore it is bound to work well, and
it is a good thing that it is now being put
into legal form.
In regard to section 3, from what I have
read I understand that it was the British

car manufacturers who felt they were being
discriminated against, and probably that is
correct because of the way in which they
distribute their cars and other articles by
comparison with the United States.
I should point out that I believe the honourable Senator Hugessen was in error when
he said this was a reduction in the tariff s
which free traders would welcome. As I
read it, actually it is only something to do
away with the discrimination against British
manufacturers, which has existed in the past.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: A rose by any other
name!
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You do
not think this is a rose?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): No,
I do not think it would be so regarded by
those who thought they had been discriminated against in the past.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Maybe
it is a rosebud.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: But does not smell like
a rose.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): No. In
any event, if there bas been discrimination,
and this will result in the removal of such
discrimination, then of course we must agree
with the principle, because certainly I know
of no one who would want discrimination to
be continued through our customs laws. However, it should be pointed out that while we
agree in principle that this discrimination
should be removed, we do not necessarily
agree with the way it is being removed or
with the machinery which is being used to
remove the discrimination. Actually, if the
British have been working under these difficult conditions I am somewhat surprised that
they were not ingenious enough to devise
some method whereby in their business relations they could have come under our existing laws. However, that is their business.
If they felt that it was in their best interests
to sell direct to retailers without setting up
some kind of sales organization to sell to
wholesalers, of course that is their business.
Whether or not this is the best method of
dealing with the problem is another question.
Here it is left to the Governor in Council
to set out the means whereby duties can be
reduced, if it is satisfied there was some kind
of discrimination, and it must be satisfied
on a report from the minister. In this case
it will be the Minister of National Revenue.
In other words, we are leaving it to the discre-

SENATE DEBATES
tion of that minister to determine whether
or not this duty should be reduced. Personally,
I am one of those who feel that as far as
possible-I realize there must be exceptionsmatters affecting the customs should be
determined by the Tariff Board. I would be
much happier if this section, which reads
"where the Governor in Council is satisfied,"
had read "where the Tariff Board is satisfied"
or even if it had gone further and said
"where the Governor in Council is satisfied
on a report frorn the Tariff Board" rather than
"on a report from the minister." I believe
that would have provided better legislation.
I heard the sponsor mention something of
the difficulty in understanding the language.
The same thought struck me. I believe the
draftsmanship could have been improved. For
instance, line 20 on page 4 of the bill reads:
"section 36 or subsection (3) of section 36 is
inequitable in that it results in discrimination". It would have been just as effective to
leave out the words "is inequitable in that it"
and have said "which results in discrimination". I am not satisfied that we need even
the rider at the end about the "value for duty
of goods imported", etcetera. That could well
have been left out of the section without
detracting from it.
My only objection to section 3 is that the
discretion is left to the minister to report
to the Cabinet that the duties should be
reduced. It might have been argued that that
is not the minister, that it is the Governor
in Council; but I would expect that in a
matter of this kind the Governor in Council
would certainly act on the advice of the Minister of National Revenue.
In regard to the question of appeals from
decisions of the Governor in Council, I too
have read what the minister said in the other
house. I would like to see it stated that there
is an appeal to the Tariff Board. Of course,
it is a question of law whether there is or is
not one to the Exchequer Court of Canada.
It would be difficult for any interested person
to carry an appeal to the Tariff Board from
a decision of the Governor in Council, for
actually it involves governmental policy and
I would expect that it would be difficult for
members of the Tariff Board to feel they
should alter such policy. I believe it would
have been much better to put the responsibility on the Tariff Board in the first instance
to say whether or not there was discrimination and, if they felt there was discrimination, to advise the Governor in Council that
a reduction should be made and how much it
should be.

June 23, 1965

I can understand, of course, that in the
practical administration of the departments
it might be difficult and take some time to
have the Tariff Board look into these matters,
but that should not give an excuse for not
doing so if we believe in the principle that
the Tariff Board should do this.
Section 6 apparently involves one of those
cases of practical administration which has
grown up over the years. While this may not
be the best way, it is a realistic way, and they
which to have it incorporated into the Act. I
suppose the only other way would be to have
these United States people who have brought
machinery into Canada to take it back with
them, but in many cases that would not be
practical.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If I may interrupt the
honourable senator, there is an agreement
between the governments of Canada and the
United States that the Government of Canada
will take and dispose of all material which
the United States Government has imported
into Canada and no longer requires.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I can
understand that, and it is probably a wise
provision. Generally speaking, I am in agreement with the amendments and I certainly
agree in principle, but I object to the method
whereby the Governor in Council, on the advice of the minister, is given the authority
and the power to reduce tariffs in this or any
other instance.
Honourable senators, I do not think there
would be much benefit in sending this bill to
committee. It is straightforward legislation
and has been well explained, and I think I
have raised the objections which could be
raised to it. If the sponsor is so inclined,
I should think it could be passed without
sending it to committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If my honourable
friend who has just spoken expressed the
general desire or opinion of the house, that
it is unnecessary to send the bill to committee,
I would suggest that the bill be read the third

agreeable ta honourable senators?

last year and the year before. In relation to
most of these items over the last three, four
or five years there has been an annual extension of the application of the tariff item
and the rate of duty to that particular item.
You will notice that section 3 of the bill
deals with Schedule B, which simply inserts
another item and which, in the circumstances
described in Schedule B, would entitle the
person importing to a drawback of duty to the
extent of 99 per cent. You will notice that
this deals with knitted netting. I do not
purport to be an expert on this, but I understand it has to do with the basic form for
ladies' hats, for which, I understand, heretofore a form of buckram was used on which
certain duty drawbacks were allowed. Buckram is some kind of cotton with stiffener put
into it. The knitted netting is now taking
the place of buckram to such an extent that
the Government proposes that for milliners
who import knitted netting for this purpose,
that is, to constitute the form of the hat to
be made, the knitted netting so imported will
be subject to a drawback in duty of 99 per
cent.
We come now to the next item which is
in section 4 of the bill and which deals with
Schedule C. This refers to goods the entry
of which is prohibited. Schedule C, you will
notice, deals with item 1220 in Schedule C to
the Customs Tariff, and also deals with offensive weapons as defined in the Criminal Code.
The changes occur in relation to items which
are not affected by the prohibition in Schedule C. If you look at paragraph (b) in Schedule C, you will note that reference to Form
42 has been omitted. It says that the prohibition in Schedule C does not apply to
firearms imported by a person who
holds a permit in Form 43 or Form 44,
issued with respect thereto, under section 94 of the Criminal Code.
Previously it included Form 42 which covered a weapon a permit for which had to be
obtained before you could carry it around
rather than maintain it in your own home.
The Government felt that this was unnecessary since every person is required to register firearms, and so it was decided to eliminate it.
The other item is to delete from paragraph
(c) the words "and military type rifles". If
you look at paragraph (c) it reads:
shotguns and rifles of the standard or
auto-loading type....
As the item presently stands it includes "and
military type rifles." It was felt that was a

June 23, 1965

redundancy, and therefore those words are
being removed from this particular item.
That is all in Schedule C.
We come to section 5 of the bill, which may
provoke a little discussion. That section purports to add a new item to Schedule C, which
is the schedule of prohibited goods. The item
to be added will be found in Schedule D to
this bill. If I may summarize it, this has to do
with the prohibition of entry of issues of nonCanadian periodicals in certain circumstances.
If you look at page 6 of the bill, item 1221
(1), one circumstance under which entry
would be prohibited is this: Very often you
have what are called split runs, or a regional
edition, or a special edition of a non-Canadian
periodical, and in that you will find mainly
the material that will appear in the regular
edition that is edited, printed and distributed,
say, in the United States, but you will also
find some inserts referable to Canada and to
the Canadian market. What this first item
under 1221(1) says is that if after September
30, 1965 you find an issue of a non-Canadian
periodical coming into Canada which comes
within the description of being a split run
or a regional edition or a special edition, and
the advertising in that is primarily directed
to a market in Canada, then, in those circumstances, the admission of further issues of
that periodical will be prohibited.
How this operates is that after September 30, if you find one of a series of four
issues of a periodical that violates the conditions of this particular paragraph, then any
further issues will be prohibited entry, and
it will be up to the editor, the publisher,
the distributor, whoever it may be, to make
the necessary corrections. But here you will
notice the prohibition of entry is on the basis
that you have a special edition or a split
run or a regional edition, which means it
is devoted to a particular region.
I think the reasoning behind it is this:
If a publisher in the United States, for instance, or any other country outside of
Canada, publishes a periodical and he has
a certain market for distribution of that in
the States, or whatever the other country
may be, and he makes an extra production
of that periodical in which he inserts material by way of advertising that is primarily
directed to a market in Canada, then that
makes that periodical in those circumstances
a special edition or a split run or a regional
edition. I think the theory behind it, looking
at it from the point of view of money, is
that this is almost a free run at the Canadian market, because I am sure the cost

June 23, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

of printing and publishing the edition which
has been distributed outside of Canada has
been taken care of in the distribution that
has been made.
The second basis on which an issue of a
periodical may be prohibited is where you
find that more than 5 per cent of the advertising space in the edition consists of
advertising that indicates specific sources of
availability in Canada, or specific terms of
conditions relating to the sale or provision in
Canada, of any goods or services. If those
conditions exist, further issues will be prohibted entry. But there is an exception, and
it is where the indication of such sources of
availability or such terms or conditions were
primarily directed to persons outside Canada.
If you find, for instance, that the form of
advertising in a periodical may conceivably
be addressed to the tourist trade of the
United States that may be contemplating
visiting Canada, therefore, there is a distinction drawn between advertising in a nonCanadian periodical which is being distributed in Canada where the primary appeal
is to a market outside of Canada that may
be developed in relation to people who are
going to come into Canada rather than addressed directly to the domestic market.
In this connection I should point out there
are certain exceptions. For instance, this
prohibition does not apply to a catalogue,
newspaper, or periodical, the principal function of which is the encouragement, promotion or development of the fine arts, letters,
scholarship or religion.
I should point out too that on May 25,
1961, a report was made by the royal commission which had been set up in the previous year to inquire into this whole phase
of non-Canadian magazines, periodicals and
newspapers, and their invasion of the Canadian market. I need hardly mention that
we now have as one of our illustrious members the man who was chairman of that
commission, Senator Grattan O'Leary. This
particular proposal to be added to Schedule
C of prohibited goods, and the prohibition
therein of issues of periodicals in certain
circumstances, does not go as far as the
recommendation of the commission. The
recomendation of the commission runs as
follows:
That the entry into Canada from
abroad of a periodical containing domestic advertising be excluded under Schedule C of the Customs Tariff. "Domestic
advertising" shall Include postcards, coupons and inserts contained in a periodical
22624-171

and indicating the availability of a prodduct or service in Canada.
You will note the descriptive language of
the recommendation has been imported into
this prohibitory item in the sense that they
have used the language of "availability of a
product or service" and of "domestic advertising," which in the item is transferred into
"advertising primarily directed to a market
in Canada."
So that while the proposed amendment, and
the addition of this prohibition of periodicals
coming into Canada in certain circumstances
does not go as far as the recommendation of
the commission, it does go a long way. I am
not in a position to say-and possibly the
chairman of that commission is in a better
position-but if I were assessing the
various percentages of damage to Canadian
periodicals and publications caused by the
intrusion of periodicals of the character that
are being prohibited, and other phases that
are being dealt with in other legislation, this
might be relatively insignificant. That is an
uninformed opinion and assessment I make.
It might be entirely wrong; it is just a viewpoint I have.
This particular item with respect to the
prohibition of issues of periodicals in certain
circumstances will not become effective until
January 1, 1966.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable senator who has just spoken if these
prohibitive clauses will apply to special editions of very notable publications such as the
London Times, the London Economist and the
New York Times? These institutions publish
certain editions for Canada which are of
great interest and much attention is paid to
them. These special editions carry advertising
that is of interest, I presune, to the people
of Canada by the mnanufacturers of, say,
automobiles and other machinery in the countries in which the publications to which I
have referred are located. In the past we
have known of very interesting special editions being circulated in this country. Would
this legislation prevent those publications
from entering Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It might very well, if
the special edition meets with the conditions
contained in item 1221, paragraph (1), namely,
if it contains advertising which is "primarily
directed to a market in Canada." In other
words, there must be that so-called Canadian
content of advertising primarily directed to
the Canadian market. If you have that, then

SENATE DEBATES
the prohibition can be applied under paragraph (1) of item 1221.
But, I should point out too that I am
answering my honourable friend's question
in the context of special editions, and it is
only in item 1221 (1) that special editions
are dealt with. Paragraph 2 deals with any
kind of edition of a periodical.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oitawa West): The
question of the "four immediately preceding
issues" comes up, does it not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, in both cases.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Perhaps I should call
attention to the fact that the qualification in
paragraph 1 is that it must not appear in
identical forrn in all editions of that issue.
The special issues that Senator Lambert was
referring to of the London Times and the
New York Times are special editions in respect of Canada, but they always appear in
all editions of those papers and are not
directed primarily to Canada.
Hon. M. Gratian O'Leary: Honourable senators, I have no objection at all to this
particular method the Government has
adopted of excluding these newspapers. The
Royal Commission on Publications considered
what is contained in this clause, but feltand we were so advised by people with
expert knowledge-that this would lead to
a great deal of administrative work, and
that it would be simpler just to exclude
them under a clause of the Customs Act.
This was, I must say, a minor part of our
report, and I wish that the action taken by
the Government supported the royal commission's report as fuly as this clause does.
So far as the objection raised by Senator
Lambert is concerned, it was not our intention ever to exclude special editions of,
say, the New York Times, the London
Economist or the London Times. I think they
are covered by the definition in subparagraph (b) which says that a periodical subject to this exclusion, and in this context, is:
... a periodical, the issues of which, other

than special annual issues, are published
at regular intervals of more than 6 days
and less than 15 weeks and are distributed as issues of a distinct publication
or as a supplement to more than one
newspaper, but does not include
(i) a catalogue...
and

so

on.

I am interpreting it perhaps loosely, but
I think that means that this measure does

June 23, 1965

not in any way cover a special issue of, say,
the London Times, which publishes such a
special issue about twice a year, or of the
London Economist which puts out a Canadian addition once a year. They would not
come under this prohibition.
We had no intention whatever of interfering with special editions of the London
Times, the New York Herald Tribune, the New
York Times or with any such publication. We
were concerned with those little advertising
footnotes that you find in American magazines
which say that certain goods may be purchased
at a certain address in Toronto, or are available in Canada in such and such a city.
There is a vast amount of this advertising
coming into Canada, and we felt that if
those publications that carry it were excluded that would end the matter, because
no manufacturer would pay for advertising
that is not going to reach the customer. If
you allow them 5 per cent or 6 per cent,
then you are going to have people constantly at the border to police these magazines coming in. We felt that this was difficult if not impossible to do. Therefore, we
said they should be excluded altogether, and
that would end the matter.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators, may I ask the honourable senator a
question? He spoke about regulations. Under
these regulations who is going to make the
final decision whether it is 5 per cent above
or below, or whether the advertising is
directed to persons in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would expect, since no
particular procedure is defined in this bill,
that you will find it in the regulations prescribed by the Governor in Council. I think
it was said in the other place when this bill
was being debated that this matter would be
dealt with by the departmental officers in
the same way as any other item of business
that comes into the departrnent. They would,
I think, make the determinations in the first
instance.
Hon. Mr. White: I remind the honourable
senator that he mentioned tourists as an
example. If you look at any American paper
or magazine today you will find pages and
pages of advertising in respect of fall
and winter cruises, and that type of thing.
That is advertising that applies as much to
citizens of the United States as to citizens of
this country. How are you going to make a
distinction there with respect to your 5 per
cent rule as to whether it is directed to

June 23, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Canada or the United States? Do you not
think that there is going to be a difficult
question to decide in that respect?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: From having dealt with
the departmental officers over the years, I
know they have great capacity, and I do not
think this will present many problems to
them. The illustration that Senator O'Leary
(Carleton) gave is a pretty good one. An
American company having an operation in
Canada will, in its American advertising,
carry a description of goods that are available in Canada, and the message that they
may be purchased at such and such a place
in Canada. How do you ascertain whether
advertising is addressed to tourists in the
United States coming to Canada, or directly
to Canadians? I would be inclined, on that
bald description, to say that that statement
was primarily intended to be addressed to
Canadians if the distribution of the periodical was being made in Canada.
Hon. Mr. White: Honourable senators, Senator Choquette wishes to speak on this bill.
If no one else.wishes to speak, I should like
to adjourn the debate on his behalf.
On motion of Hon. Mr. White, for Hon.
Mr. Choquette, debate adjourned.
INTERPRETATION ACT
BILL TO REVISE-SECOND READING
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill S-15, to revise and consolidate the Interpretation Act and amendments
thereto, and to effect certain consequential
amendments to the Canada Evidence Act and
the Bills of Exchange Act.
He said: Honourable senators, though this
is a rather lengthy and a very important bill,
I shall not detain the house long this afternoon.
This is essentially a committee bill. When
one reads the title one might think the subjects covered not very interesting, but that
is not so. I am sure that honourable senators
will find that some of the interpretations
mentioned in the bill are worthy of second
thought.
Before actually dealing with the bill, I
would like to point out that this measure is
being introduced first in the Senate-it did
not come to us from the House of Commons.
One of the reasons for that is that the bill
has no financial implications. Honourable
senators hear from time to time that we do
not have the opportunity of introducing
enough legislation in this house. Of course we

all know that we cannot introduce legislation
here which has any financial implications,
that is to say, the enactment of a measure
which entails the expenditure of money.
Honourable senators, I have taken the
trouble of going through the legislation which
has been introduced in the other house this
year, and I find that all the legislation which
has been introduced has been so called "money
bills." That means that every piece of legislation which could be introduced in the Senate
has been introduced here. I think we should
thank our leader (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa
West) for seeing that we get all the legislation we possibly can. We want legislation, and
I am sure the country has confidence that we
will deal with it in the proper manner.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I have
merely followed in the footsteps of former
government leaders.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I appreciate what the leader bas said. I have
endeavoured to follow what he bas been
doing, and I have been happy about the
success which be bas had.
Another interesting feature about this bill
is that it occurs to me that the first act passed
by the Parliament of Canada after Confederation was the Interpretation Act. This indicates
the importance that the first Parliament
attached to an enactment of this kind.
This bill proposes the first general revision
of the Interpretation Act since Confederation.
Over the years, the Act bas been amended
from time to time and the amendments have
been consolidated in the general revisions of
the statutes which have taken place. However, the Act itself as it was passed in 1867,
subject to these amendments, is still basically
the same as the Interpretation Act which is
being revised by us now. The importance of
the statute over the years has not diminished,
and if anything the extent and scope of
today's statute make a measure of this nature
even more necessary today than in 1867.
The purpose of the Interpretation Act is
to facilitate an understanding of the drafting
of statutes and other enactments.
As I have stated, this bill sets forth many
interpretations. I shall not go through them
in detail today; honourable senators may read
them at their leisure. However, I was interested in one section, namely, section 28,
entitled, "Definitions". In the definition of
the word "holiday", which is to be found
in subsection 19 on page 12 of the bill, I see
no mention of St. Jean Baptiste Day as a
holiday.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators will realize that by
establishing uniform definitions and expressions, and thereby eliminating the need for
their repetition in the law, the drafting of
statutes is simplified and their interpretation
facilitated.
An Interpretation Act also serves the purpose of consolidating in one place rules of
interpretation that have been developed over
the years by the courts and by Parliament.
While the revised Act, that is the Act proposed by this bill, introduces some new provisions to aid in the interpretation of statutes
and other enactments, it is essentially a rearrangement of the present Act and a revision of the language thereof in accordance
with modern drafting standards. However,
the new provisions that have been included
are expected to make the Act even more useful and valuable. For example, provisions
have been added to make it clear that the Act
applies not only to statutes enacted by Parliament, but also to support legislation made
pursuant to the authority of such acts. New
provisions have been added with respect to
the computation of time, with respect to
quorum, to the appointment of public officers,
and to other matters, all of which will be of
considerable benefit and assistance in understanding the statutes.
Finally, I remind honourable senators that
this is a piece of legislation which will be
of benefit not only to ourselves but also to
the courts, and all persons interested in the
understanding and interpretation of statutes
and regulations made by the authority of
the Parliament of Canada.
The legislation is particularly timely, since
Parliament has now passed the necessary
legislation establishing a commission to revise and consolidate all the public general
statutes of Canada. It is important that this
legislation be dealt with as soon as possible,
in order that the important work of that
commission may proceed on the basis of the
new Act as proposed by this bill.
I think honourable senators will agree
with me when I say that this bill is in the
class that might be termed "lawyers' law."
It is essentially a lawyer's bill. It is, without
doubt, the type of bill that should go to a
committee so that it can be given careful
study by all those interested in its provisions. The officers of the Department of Justice will be available to assist the committee
in all its deliberations. If the Senate gives
approval to second reading of the bill, I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, be-

June 23, 1965

cause I believe there are more lawyers serving on that committee than on other committees.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
believe Senator Ross Macdonald has expressed the opinion of all honourable senators
here when he said that this is not a bill
which requires a long debate in this chamber.
There is no principle as such in the bill, but
it deals with a great many matters, such as
definitions, modes of expression and so on,
which makes it entirely a committee bill.
I join with Senator Macdonald in congratulating the honourable Leader of the
Government in having this bill brought before
the Senate. I also congratulate Senator Macdonald on his homework in going through
and examining all the previous bills introduced in the other house during this session.
Of course, it could not have been a tremendous job because more time has been spent
on other matters than on bills. Sometimes one
wonders why more time is not spent on bills
and less on some other matters which are becoming quite time consuming..
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): In the
way we do.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes, in the way we would
like to do.
This is an interesting and important bill,
as the honourable sponsor emphasized. It
is one of the important bills, so far as the
carrying on of the legal affairs of our courts
is concerned.
I also want to compliment the draftsmen
of this bill. Frequently we complain that
bills come to this house without explanatory
notes. I read through this bill quite hurriedly,
but the explanatory notes are particularly
good, and I think the draftsmen and the department deserve congratulation.
The various sections of the bill will have to
be dealt with by the Banking and Commerce
Committee, and I am sure they will be studied
there. When the bill is reported back to the
house, any necessary changes will be made.
Honourable senators, I shall not take any
more time of the house. This is a committee
bill, and the sooner it gets to committee the
better.
Before concluding, I would like to ask
whether the barristers' societies across Canada have had anything to do in recommending
the bill or some of its interpretations. Is it the
result of some work done by a barristers'
society, or is it solely the product of the
Department of Justice?

June 23, 1966

June23. 965SENATE
DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Cannolly (Ottawa West): I arn
afraid I cannot answer that question the way
I would like to, but I will get an answer for
Senator Brooks. I know that at meetings of
the Canadian Bar Association, and indeed at
meetings of provincial bar associations, matters of this kind are uppermost in the minds
of the lawyers. Normaily the provincial associations would deal with their attorney general on their own Interpretation Act, but I
should think that a great deal of the work
done here has flown from. decisions which
have been taken by the courts with reference
to the interpretation of statutes. In addition,
there have been changes in and improvements made in draftsmanship that are sought
to be incorporated here. If Senator Brooks
thinks that officiais of the Canadian Bar
Association ought to be invited to attend sittings of the committee, that can be done.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Not unless they wish
to corne.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I agree that this is a job for a committee rather than for the house itself. Titis
is a mere definition of words. One may be as
arbitrary as one pleases in defining words
which are later used or concurrently used in a
statute, but it is important that the words
should be deflned in their ordinary meaning
and not in an extraordinary meaning. These
definitions of words must be borne in mind
when one is reading a statute. They rnodify
the meaning of the statute.
Let me take an illustration that I notice
here. There is a definition of "land". It is new,
so the explanatory page says, and it defines
land or real property, to include lands and
also to include buildings. 0f course that is
not a political economny definition by any
means. In somne respects it may be a lawyer's
definition, although I think such an extraordinary definition would not be so. Land
does include water, as a matter of law, because water lots are land, but certainly buildings are not land.
When you read in a statute something that
refers to land, and find later that it includes
the buildings, it is not common sense nor is
it reasonable. This is only one clause I have
noticed. If I went through the various clauses,
I might find mucli that is extraordinary and
unnecessarily extraordinary.
The definition of real property is another
matter. "Real property" does include land
and buildings, but the word "land" alone
does not; include buildings and, in my judgment, it should not be made to do sa arbitrarily.

I hope that the committee will give this
matter a very complete study. I think it is
a job for a subcommittee of the standing
committee, as we did with the Criminal
Code.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This should be a case
where two or three men should sit around
the table, with the officiais before them, and
study the effect of each one of the definitions,
with particular attention to the numerous
statutes which have already been enacted.
In that respect the new definitions becorne
exceedingly important because they refer
back to statutes now in eff ect. I think that
such a small cornrittee should study titis
matter carefully and at considerable length,
and then should refer it to us and of course
we will honour their report.
I arn glad to see that the bill is to go to
a cornrittee, and I hope that there wiil be
no rushing of the work of this cornrittee.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I hope
that you wiil be a member of that committee.
Hon. Mr. Rcebuck: I thank you for thatthough, perhaps I should not do so.
Titis is not a matter to be passed over
lightly. It affects the meanings of acts already on the statute book, as well as those
which will be passed in later years. It affects
the very meaning of an act and therefore it
requires the most careful attention.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
I noted the warning given me by honourable
Senator Macdonald (Brantford) that this
is a "llawyers' law" and perhaps I can be
accused of some ternerity in rising to speak
on it. However, I think it should be said
that laymen have an interest in our laws and
an interest in being able to read and understand thern. I know lawyers sometirnes advise their clients that that is a dangerous
thing to do and that it could at tirnes be
expensive. However, one remembers that it
is not so long ago since the prof essional
theologians were giving exactly the sarne
advice about the Scriptures to layrnen.
This long delayed revision and consolidation of the Interpretation Act will be a boon
to many of us who find it necessary often
to read the statutes for our guidance, and
not always are we able to provide ourselves
With or can afford the luxury of a lawyer
at a particular thne.
I should like to congratulate the Department of Justice, flot; merely on this but on

SENATE DEBATES
many other activitives which it has taken
in this field. It seems to me that there is taking place a sort of precentennial spring cleaning of our statutes, regulations and orders in
council. As a layman, I find that most useful.
I should particularly refer to a recent
publication by the Department of Justice
under the name of Mr. E. A. Driedger, who is
known to all honourable senators, which has
been of valuable assistance to many laymen
in understanding the principles behind drafting and even the ordinary day-to-day nomenclature to be used in quoting statutes and in
quoting from statutes.
The interpretations that I find listed here
are of interest to me because I find they touch
on some subjects in which I have been interested personally or professionally over the
years. I think immediately of the law of copyright with which I have been identified now
for some 15 years in one capacity or another.
I think also of the Commonwealth, which is
the subject of definition in this bill.
I realize that second reading is not the
place to go into the bill in detail, but I would
like to make this comment on the definition of
"Commonwealth," which is found at page 11,
as an example of what Senator Roebuck
mentioned a moment ago. One would hope
that definitions in such a bill as this would
not be legalistie at the expense of understanding by those who must rely on common
usage in the normal interpretation of words
in statutes.
The clause proposes that we take over the
word "Commonwealth" and that whenever
we use it in one of our statutes or regulations it would always mean what we know
as the "Commonwealth of Nations." I would
suggest that that definition be considered
carefully, as we might quite properly wish
to refer to the Commonwealth of Australia
or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It
seems rather presumptuous for us to try to
make that word apply so specifically.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Commonwealth is
changing almost daily. This does not say
whether it is the Commonwealth of today,
of when the act was passed, or of when the
matter is under consideration.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: With respect, I think it
does make allowance for the addition of
new members to the Commonwealth. In the
schedule on page 21 it lists the present 21
members, but it takes care of the contingency
which Senator Roebuck has mentioned.
I should like to make a short comment on
some matters which deal with copyright.

June 23, 1965

There are definitions suggested of "broadcasting" on page Il and of "radio" on page 13.
These are two words in common usage, the
content of which is rather fiuid, because of
mechanical advances. "Broadcasting" and
"radio" do not mean quite the same thing
today that they may have meant in earlier
times.
The purpose of this act is obviously to
bring these definitions up to date. I do not
intend at this time to engage in the type of
comment that would more properly be made
in committee, but it is my intention when
the matter is in committee to propose the
addition of a definition of "radio communication." I will do so because the phrase "radio
communication" is used in the Copyright
Act in a very important relationship to the
rights and restrictions of that act-in section
2 which is the interpretation section and in
section 3 which is the section conferring
the sole right of copyright in certain circumstances. It should be more clearly defined
than it is at the present time. I will therefore suggest in committee that the definition of "broadcasting" which appears in
paragraph 4 of clause 28 on page 11 of the
bill be the definition to be given to the
phrase "radio communication." I shall not
take up the time of the Senate any further
in reading these proposed definitions, 1
mention it now only because it may be important for those who are called before the
committee to examine this suggestion of mine
in advance.
I have a further duty here to congratulate
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Connolly, Ottawa West) on bringing this bill
before the Senate. I do that at this time because when I spoke in the debate on the
address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne I omitted to pay a special compliment I had intended to pay to the Leader of
the Government. I now take this opportunity
to join with others in paying my compliments to him not only for bringing this bill
before the Senate but also on the work he
has done for the Senate and to improve, if
I may use the expression, its public image.
I know that many of my colleagues on this
side of the house would also wish to congratulate him and to give him credit for the
very hard and useful work he has done in
that respect.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr.
Croll): If Senator Macdonald (Brantford)

speaks now it will have the effect of closing
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I shall
flot; detain the house too long. I arn pleased
that ail honourable senators are ini accord
with my suggestion that the bill should go
to committee. I have also noted the suggestion of Senator Roebuck that a subcommittee of the standing committee should be
established to give special consideration to
the bill. That, of course, is a matter for the
comrnittee itself to decide.
Senator Grosart has made many suggestions of which the cornmittee will no doubt
take note. I arn sure he will be present to
see that the committee does take note of
them. I was particularly interested to hear
him, say, "I will bring certain matters to
the attention of the committee." I looked up
the new Interpretation Act for the interpretation of the word "will" and I cannot
find it. I find on page 13 that the word "may"l
shall be construed as permissive. On the same
page, in subclause 35, I find that "shall" is
to be construed as imperative. But there is
no interpretation to say whether "will" means
"shall" or "Imay."

incomes.
This year the bill is about as lengthy as
usual. It contains 28 pages and 30 sections,
and in many of its aspects is slow and difficult reading.
Over the years, I have tried to find some
simple way of explaining the income tax
amendments, but it seems to take about the
same length of time to do so each year. However, I will try to shorten my explanations, if
possible. The net result may be that if the
explanations are short, the additional information may be obtained either by asking questions at this stage or waiting until the bill goes
to committee. I should point out to you that the
first items I am going to speak about, in a
series of items, are those which I would
classify under the heading of deductions.
The first one you will find in section 9,
page 10 of the bill. This amends section 33
of the act by adding a new subsection. It

June 28, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

provides for a reduction of tax otherwise
payable by an individual for a taxation year,
of an amount equal to the lesser of $600 or
10 per cent of tax otherwise payable, except
that for the year 1965 you will read the $600
as $300, and you wll read the 10 per cent
as 5 per cent. This is a flat percentage from
tax otherwise payable, called "basic tax" in
section 33.
The tax is computed before deducting any
abatement on account of provincial tax or
any foreign tax credit, but it does not include Old Age Security tax.
In section 6 on page 8 of the bill you have
an extension of the deductions which are
permitted in respect of a wholly dependent
person. This implements budget resolution
No. 2 and extends this right of deduction, on
the same basis as it presently exists in relation to a wholly dependent person, to a niece
or a nephew. The language of the section is
somewhat along these lines: A niece or
nephew of the taxpayer, or his spouse, resident in Canada in the year-that is the qualification. The deduction is on the same basis
as others who are wholly dependent are now
provided for, but there are three additional
conditions: one, if the mother of the niece
or nephew was divorced or separated and
was not in receipt of alimony or similar payments; or, two, if the father of the niece or
nephew was mentally or physically infirm;
or three, if the father was deceased and the
mother was not remarried. The deduction is
$300 if the niece or nephew was a child
qualified for Family Allowance, and $550 if
mot; 50 qualified.
You should note that it is not necessary for
the nephew or niece to live with the taxpayer, but such nephew or niece must be
wholly dependent; and in those circumstances
the income of such nephew or niece cannot
exceed $950 a year.
The second of those deductions which you
find in section 6, on page 8, implements resolution 3 of the budget. This deals with an
aunt or an uncle, and it extends a deduction
for dependents to an aunt or uncle of a taxpayer or his spouse who was resident in
Canada and dependent for support by reason
of mental or physical infirmity. The amount of
entitlement is an amount not exceeding $550
a year expended by the taxpayer.
You will note here that the word is "dependent," not "wholly dependent" on the
taxpayer. It is not required that the aunt
or the uncle should live with the taxpayer. It
is also permitted that some other person may
as well contribute to the support of such aunt

or uncle; but the aunt or uncle must be incapable of self-support by reason of mental
or physical infirmity.
There are two consequential amendments,
which I shall not deal with, for the purposes
of avoiding a double benefit to the taxpayer
in these circumstances.
Honourable senators, you will find in
section 2, at the bottom of page 1 of the bill,
deahing with retiring allowances, that it provides for the conditions under which a retiring allowance may be excluded from the
income of the taxpayer in the year in which
he receives it. This provision is that if in the
year in which the taxpayer receives a retiring
allowance, the allowance is transferred by
him into a registered pension plan, or g
registered retirement savings plan, or a deferred profit sharing plan, then he would be
permitted to exclude the proceeds of that
retiring allowance from his income for the
year. At the present time the taxpayer is not
entitled to do that. If the contribution were
a lump sum pension payment, he would
under the present law be entitled to make
that deduction in those circumstances. It is
therefore bringing the retirement and retiring
allowances into conformity with lump sum
pension payments.
In addition to that you will find in the bill
provisions for other deductions. These you
will find in section 2, subsection 2, on page
2 of the bill. I will give you the series of
them. The first one provides for the deduction of contributions to the Canada Pension
Plan or to a provincial plan as defined in
section 3 of the Canada Pension Plan available
to employees, employers and self-employed.
This deduction is in addition to those already
provided for in respect of a registered pension
plan, a registered retiring savings plan and
deferred profit-sharing plans.
The allowable deductions in this group are
as follows: The amount paid for the cancellation of a lease if the parties are dealing
at arm's length. Heretofore, the amount paid
for cancellation of a lease was classified as a
capital payment. The amount paid by a taxpayer in the year for the landscaping of
grounds around a building or other structure
of the taxpayer that is used by him primarily
for the purpose of gaining or producing income therefrom or from a business. Heretofore this was regarded as part of the cost of
the land.
Another item is the amount paid by the
taxpayer in making any representations in
relation to a business carried on by him, to

limit would seem to, be unf air. I say this
because the amounts which are payable on
a current basis under a pension plan and
subject to deduction are $1,500 contributed
by the employee and $1,500 contributed by
the employer. This amount of contribution
would appear obviously not to be an abuse, as
suggested by the Minister of Finance. In the
circumstances, it is my view it might be more
equitable to increase the $1,500 in so far as
there is an application to pension plans, in
this situation arising in relation to pension
plans, to $3,000.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is there
a vested interest anywhere in the $3,000 as
it is paid in?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Varions pension plans
differ, but ahl these pension plans now have
to be revised. First, it is in light of the ntarlo plan where you must have a vestin
of contributions at age 45-I think was the
latest age. But in earlier plans, vesting was
deferred for a very long time in many cases.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What is the limit on
retirement payments, $1,000 per annum?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is $1,000 times the
number of years.
In section 12 on page 14 you will see a
section dealing with tax transfer payments.
This provision is in the bill because it became necessary to arrange for profit-sharing
of tax deductions with the provinces-mn circumstances, for instance, where an employee
may move from one province to another in
a year, or may live ini one province and work
In another. There are many illustrations of
that, and you would not have to go any
further afield than people living in Hull and
working in Ottawa or people living in Ottawa
and working in Hull, where the deductions
differ as between Ontario and Quebec.
In regard to the Tax Appeal Board and
the Exchequer Court dealing with income tax
appeals, some of the strait jacket sort of provisions are being loosened now. For instance,
after this bill becomes law no longer will a
notice of objection be invalid only because
it was not; served in duplicate and by registered mail.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Which
section is that?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Section 13 on page 15.
Possibly you should have a look at it. It is
section 13 on page 15, and also section 14
at the bottomn of page 15 and continuing on
page 16. On page 16 there is a provision that
where a notice of objection or an appeal to

the Tax Appeal Board or the Exchequer
Court has not been made or taken in the
time limited by the Act, an application may
be made, when this bill becomes law, to
extend the time limit in certain circumstances for an appeal to the Tax Appeal
Board or to the Exchequer Court. Those circumstances you will find enumerated on page
16 in a new section of the Act, section 61 (A).
Then, in section 23 on page 25 of the bill
you will see that when this becomes law, no
longer may an appeal be barred because
a correct number of copies have not been
filed nor the fees paid.
Section 24 on page 25 deals with the question of reply in such proceedings before the
Tax Appeal Board or the Exchequer Court.
You will see that section 24 deals with the
situation where a reply has not been filed as
required or, if it has been, it has been struck
out and a new reply has not been filed. There
are provisions whereby the court or the
board may proceed ex parte to dispose of the
appeal and may make certain assumptions
on the basis of the material which is before
them, or they may provide for the giving of
further notice. This is moving in the right
direction, and, thereforeHon. Mr. Farris: Is that the only one of
the rules and regulations?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In the matter of appeals
to the Tax Appeal Board, where possibly 97
or 98 per cent of appeals in a year
are lost, I would say that the road to a successful appeal before that board is rough and
can by no means be predicted with certainty.
If you look at section 26 of the bull you
will see the additional provision in relation
to solicitor-dlient relationships. You will recaîl that section 1 26A of the Act deals with
this matter of solicitor-client privilege which
may be claimed by a taxpayer in relation to
correspondence or documents or oral statements as between himself and his lawyer.
The additional provision here flot only reaffirms the position of the soicitor-dlient
privilege, but also makes the exception that:
..or the purposes of this section an
f
accounting record of a lawyer, including
any supporting voucher or cheque, shaîl
be deemed not to be such a communication.
Then you will see in section 27, at the
bottom of page 26, a simplification in the
matter of proof that the taxpayer has not
remitted the taxes which he shouhd have remitted, and it simply provides that in any
prosecution for an offence under the Act an

SENATE DEBATES
affidavit of an officer of the Department of
National Revenue, who has charge of the
appropriate records and states that an examination of them shows that an amount required under the Act to be remitted has not
been remitted, shall be received as prima facie
evidence. I would like to ask a question or
two on that when we are in committee, because if anything turns on this particular
aspect of it I would point out that there is
very considerable value in the right to crossexamine, and it is difficult to cross-examine a
piece of paper in a prosecution.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Or anywhere else.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, I agree with youor anywhere else.
There are a few other items that I would
like to deal with before I come to the pièce
de résistance, namely, the magazine tax. I
refer honourable senators to section 15 of
the bill, which is found on page 17. This
section has been designed to block a loophole which has developed in the law, because
under the present practice where you have a
trust it is taxable on its income at the same
rate as that charged against an individual,
but the rules of practice under the Income
Tax Act, in determining what that amount
of income is, have permitted you to deduct
the amount of any distribution made to beneficiaries on the basis that the beneficiaries
will be accountable for the tax, and the department is not losing any tax because the
rate is still the individual rate.
What has developed, however, is that
limited partnerships have been set up in
which there is a corporation as a general
partner, and a trust or a series of trusts as
limited partners. There has been registration
under the Limited Partnerships Registration
Act, and the beneficiaries of these trusts have
been nonresident persons. It can be seen,
therefore, that if the law remained as it is
and the income of the trust is only the income
that is left after distribution to beneficiaries,
then this income, having been distributed to
nonresident beneficiaries, would be beyond
the reach of the taxing authority of Canada.
I should say it would be beyond the reach
of the taxing authority of Canada except for
the element of withholding tax of 15 per cent.
This amendment in section 15 attempts to
correct that.
In section 20 of the bill, at page 22, you
have a provision which, among other things,
is designed to cover a loophole in relation to

June 28. 1965

the proceeds of the disposition of oil and gas
rights, and that extends for several pages. I
would think that no matter what I would say
on it tonight you would still want to ask
questions in committee, so unless I am asked
particular questions I should like to leave
that to be dealt with in committee.
There are what I call certain relieving
provisions in the bill. For instance, under
section 16 on page 18 of the bill, a former
member of the armed forces who transfers
a gratuity or termination allowance to a
pension plan or a retirement savings plan in
the year in which he retires is given equivalent treatment to that which is presently
available to any other taxpayer. In other
words, by transferring his gratuity or termination allowance to a retirement savings
plan or to a pension plan, that amount is not
income taxable in his hands in that year.
If I may I should like also to refer you
to section 18, on page 19, which deals with a
limitation on the amount of earned income
that a taxpayer may deduct as a premium
under a registered retirement savings plan.
At the present time the deduction as a premium or contribution to such a retirement
savings plan is 10 per cent, with a maximum
of $1,500 or $2,500, whichever is the lesser
depending upon whether the person contributing to a retirement savings plan is also
a member of a superannuation or pension
plan. If he is a member of a superannuation
or pension plan his premium deduction for
contributions to a retirement savings plan
would be the lesser of 10 per cent or $1,500.
The figure of 10 per cent has been increased
to 20 per cent, but the maximum limitation
has not been changed. It still remains at
$1,500 and $2,500. I suppose this amendment
has some value where you are dealing with
smaller amounts. I am not considerably
worked up over the great advantage that
this will have.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is that
20 per cent of taxable income?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is 20 per cent of earned
income, but with your dollar limitations. It
is the lesser of the two.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Section 19 of the bill
deals with the prospector's exemption that
has existed for some time in our Income Tax
Act. If a prospector goes out and stakes a
property, or if one person grubstakes another
person to go out and stake mining claims,
and the claims are subsequently disposed of

June 28, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

on the formation of a company with the prospector receiving shares, then whatever he
receives or whatever he realizes on those
shares, under the law as it presently stands,
is exempt from income tax and need not
be included in his income for the year. But,
by reason of a decision made by the Tax
Appeal Board it is now felt necessary to reaffirm what the department thought was
the law, and that is that this exemption does
not exclude from income for the year
anything of the character of rent, royalties or
similar payments that may have been received. In other words, it was never intended that you should receive those as part
of your tax-free benefit.
Then we have a provision which I suppose
might be designated as a further attempt to
get at what are called tax havens. You will
find this in section 28 of the bill, subsection
4, at the bottom of page 27. The method of
doing this is simply to say that the residence
of a Canadian company at all times shall be
the place where it was incorporated.
Over the years many Canadian companies
have changed their place of residence and
have become nonresident with the idea of
avoiding the incidence of tax, and then in
some cases proceeding to those foreign jurisdictions where the tax climate may be very
favourable to doing such things as dividend
stripping and taking out of accumulated income without having to meet the tax requirements in Canada.
The effect of saying that the test of residence will be where the company was incorporated is to make every Canadian company,
if it has purported to acquire non-resident
status by moving its head office and doing
its housekeeping outside of Canada, a company still having Canadian residence and subject to Canadian tax on all of its income
wherever in the world it earned that income.
Of course, there is a practical question still
remaining, and that is if the removal has
been not only the removal of the residence
of the company and the change in the location of its housekeeping, but the removal of
all its assets from Canada then, of course,
a problem is presented that would appear to
me could not be expected to be dealt with
by a tightening-up of this kind.
I direct the attention of honourable senators to section 22(2), which is at the top of
page 25. This subsection deals with the question of mortgage reserves. It is a little relieving and, therefore, I commend it to you.
This amendment increases the rate at which
a taxpayer who is in the business of lending
money on mortgages may build up a reserve.

The Act, in section 85G permits a mortgage
company to deduct an amount as a reserve
equal to 3 per cent of the total amounts owing
to it under mortgages on account of principal
or interest. However, this reserve can be
built up at the rate of only one-twelfth the
full permissible amount each year. If a company is growing at a rate of more than onetwelfth a year it cannot, under the present
law, get its reserve built up to 3 per cent
of the amounts owing.
This amendment does not change the total
amount of the reserve deductible for tax purposes. It changes merely the rate at which
a taxpayer can build up his reserve to this
maximum, which is changed from one-twelfth
to one-sixth.
Section 17, on page 19 of the bill, deals with
the sections we had before us several years
ago on designated areas and new business. I
would commend that to your careful consideration. If I can find my notes on it, and if
you can bear with me, here is the reason and
the thinking behind it.
This amendment has been made necessary
by the passage of time. When the three-year
exemption was introduced in 1963 one of the
requirements for qualifying as a new business was that 95 per cent of the machinery
and equipment owned or leased for use in
the business must not have been used for any
purpose before June 14, 1963. Machinery that
was not used before June 14, 1963, but acquired and used shortly thereafter, may now
have been used for nearly two years. This
opens the way for existing businesses outside
designated areas to move their machinery
and business operations into an area to gain
the tax concessions, or for businesses in designated areas that have enjoyed one or two
years' tax exemption to re-incorporate and
begin a new three-year period of exemption.
The amendment requires that machinery
and equipment acquired after the date on
which this bill received first reading must
not have been previously used. It provides an
exception for machinery and equipment acquired before the bill received first reading,
if it was acquired pursuant to a written contract entered into before that date. This is
intended to cover situations where machinery
has been acquired with the plan of having it
"run in" by an affiliated company during the
period when the new business is being organized.
In the main, I think these are the substantial items. I have not touched upon all of
them in the Act, but upon the ones that are
more important. By reading some of them it

SENATE DEBATES

can be seen that their meaning is obvious and
that no explanation is required. I wish there
were more sections like that.
Now we come to the pièce de résistancethe so-called "magazine tax". This will be
found to implement resolution 19 of the budget
resolutions, and is also in section 4 of the
bill, which adds a new section 12A to the
Act, following the section 12 which already
exists. This has to do with the deduction of
advertising expense. Section 4 provides as
follows:
In computing income, no deduction
shall be made in respect of an otherwise
deductible outlay or expense of a taxpayer for advertising space in an issue
of a non-Canadian newspaper or periodical dated after December 31, 1965 for an
advertisement directed primarily to a
market in Canada.
There is the general principle or proposition running through this whole section dealing with advertising and the conditions under
which the cost of such advertising may not
be a deductible item of expense when the
taxpayer comes to reckon his income in
taxes for the year. It will be noted that the
limiting words are:
.

. .

expense of a taxpayer for advertis-

ing space in an issue of a non-Canadian
newspaper or periodical dated after December 31, 1965 for an advertisement
directed primarily to a market in Canada.
Now, if you want to find the definition of
a Canadian newspaper or periodical, you will
look at page 6 of the bill. A Canadian newspaper or periodical is there defined as follows:
"Canadian newspaper or periodical"
means a newspaper or periodical the exclusive right to produce and publish
issues of which is held by one or more
of the following:
(i) a Canadian citizen,
(ii) a partnership of which at least
three-quarters of the members are Canadian citizens and in which interests
representing in value at least three-quarters of the total value of the partnership
property are beneficially owned by Canadian citizens,
(iii) an association or society of which

June 28, 1965

(A) that is incorporated under the laws
of Canada or a province,
(B) of which the chairman or other
presiding officer and at least three-quarters of the directors or other similar officers are Canadian citizens, and
(C) of which, if it is a corporation
having share capital, at least three-quarters of the shares having full voting
rights under all circumstances, and shares
representing in the aggregate at least
three-quarters of the paid-up capital, are
beneficially owned by Canadian citizens
or by corporations other than corporations controlled directly or indirectly by
citizens or subjects of a country other
than Canada;
And the issue of a non-Canadian newspaper or periodical has a very brief definition. It means an issue that is not a Canadian
issue of a Canadian newspaper or periodical.
So in order to get an understanding of the
scope and extent of those words of limitation that I read a while ago, that is, an
issue of a non-Canadian newspaper or periodical, it is necessary to look at the definition of a Canadian newspaper or periodical.
Then "Canadian issue" is defined.
Also there are certain exemptions to which
this rule in relation to the deductibility of
advertising costs does not apply, as, for
instance, an advertisement in a catalogue, or
any publication the principal function of
which is the encouragement, promotion or development of the fine arts, letters, scholarship
or religion.
Then I refer to that part of section 4 of the
bill which apparently has provoked a great
deal of discussion. It appears as subsection
2 of the new section 12A to be added to the
Act. This is where an exemption is provided,
and where the cost of advertising is deductible even though it may be in an issue of
a non-Canadian newspaper or periodical. Subsection 2 reads as follows:
An issue or edition of an issue of any
newspaper or periodical that is edited in
whole or in part in Canada and printed
and published in Canada and that was
not on April 26, 1965 a Canadian newspaper or periodical shall be deemed, for
the purposes of subsection (1), not to be
an issue of a non-Canadian newspaper or
periodical if-

at least three-quarters of the members
are Canadian citizens,
(iv) Her Majesty in right of Canada
Then there follow the conditions under
or a province, or a municipality in Can- which advertisers in certain newspapers and

(v) a corporation

June 28, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

you, of a Canadian newspaper or periodical,
are entitled to an exemption of their advertising expenses. These are as follows:
(a) throughout the period of 12 months
ending April 26, 1965 issues or editions of
issues of that publication were being
edited in whole or in part in Canada and
printed and published in Canada at the
usual intervals for issues of that publication and have since that date continued
to be so edited, printed and published
without interruption except for a reason
other than the cessation of the business
of publishing that publication; andThis is of general application to general
publications.
(b) in the case of a periodical, the periodical is similar, in content and in respect
of the class of readers to which it is
directed, to the issues or editions of that
periodical that were throughout the
period of 12 months ending April 26, 1965
being edited in whole or in part in Canada and printed and published in Canada.
There follows another exemption, which
provides as follows:
(3) Subsection (1) does not apply with
respect to an advertisement in a special
issue or edition of a newspaper that is
edited in whole or in part and printed and
published outside Canada if such special
issue or edition is devoted to features or
news related primarily to Canada and
the publishers thereof publish such an
issue or edition not more frequently than
twice a year.
There seem to be two points of objection
that have been made to this proposal. One is
in relation to the sanctions. By the sanctions
I mean the loss of right in a taxpayer to
deduct the cost of advertising if he advertises in an issue of a non-Canadian publication. The second is that there should be no
exemptions in relation to non-Canadian newspapers and periodicals. I think that is a fair
statement of the objections.
I do not know of any objection that is
based on the requirement of citizenship of a
company or the individual who may be the
owner of the paper, or that is based on the
percentage of the Canadian ownership that
must exist in order that a newspaper may
qualify for that classification of Canadian
ownership.
It is interesting to note that, in the Report of
the Royal Commission on Publications to
which I referred the other day when I was

dealing with the Customs Tariff Act, and of
which the chairman was our very valuable and
personable Senator O'Leary (Carleton), while
the commission was limited in its inquiry to
periodicals, it reached some conclusions there
that are pretty well in line with the conclusions incorporated in the section which I
have read. For instance, in dealing with the
ownership, at page 77 of the recommendations, the royal commission said:
The final determination of a periodical's
character is made by its owner, and the
simplest and most effective test of a
periodical's responsibility is the citizenship duties of its proprietor.
Then it goes on:
The Commission concludes:
That a Canadian periodical is one published in Canada, owned either by Canadian citizens or, if a corporation, by a
company incorporated under the laws of
Canada or of one of its provinces, and
which is controlled and directed by Canadian citizens and is not a licensee of or
otherwise substantially the same as a
periodical owned or controlled outside
Canada.
I would say that this bill meets the citizenship requirement by the requirement of an
individual being a citizen of Canada and by
the percentage of Canadian ownership of
voting shares and the Canadian personality
of the directors and of the chief executive
officer.
It is significant to note the importance which
the commission attaches, as making for the
character of the publication, to the citizenship
duties of the proprietor of the paper.
When we come to consider the exemption, it
has been very loosely stated that Time and
Reader's Digest have been exempted under
this bill. It is not so baldly stated in the section which I read to you, and which is subsection 2 of the new section 12A. No periodicals
are named. The periodicals have to meet the
test of conditions which are laid down; and
if Time and Reader's Digest meet those conditions-as apparently it is assumed they do
-then they are entitled to the exemption.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Were the conditions
drafted in such a way that it would please
both?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would not think so.
As a matter of fact, I would think that if any
person suggested this, he would be making
a rash assumption. I understand-and, again,

SENATE DEBATES

I am not as well informed on this as Senator
O'Leary may be-that there may even be
some newspapers in Canada which would
meet the exemption test of these conditions.
Whether Time and Reader's Digest are the
only periodicals that meet this, I do not
know; but I know the exemption is drawn in
broad terms. It simply gets down to a question
on that point as to whether, when you have
certain operations fully established in Canada,
and you draw the line as to what would be
the period at which they could be called
fully established and the operation is being
carried out in Canada, you are proposing to
write a law which ousts them from Canadaeven the previous Government did not think
that was the way to deal with things.
I would refer you to The Broadcasting
Act which was passed in 1958. It is chapter
22 of the Statutes of Canada of that year.
I have read the report of the debate. Some
of those who are still in this house participated in that debate. No question was raised
as to how non-Canadian interests were being
dealt with. Here is what section 14 provided:
(1) The Board shall not recommend the
issue of a licence or grant permission to
operate a network of broadcasting stations unless the applicant therefor is
(a) a Canadian citizen, or
(b) a corporation incorporated under
the laws of Canada or any province, the
chairman or other presiding officer and
at least two-thirds of the directors of
which are Canadian citizens and at least
three-fourths of the shares of which (having full voting rights under all circumstances) belong to
(i) Canadian citizens, or
(ii) a corporation other than a corporation controlled directly or indirectly
by citizens or subjects of a country other
than Canada.
Having read the definition of a Canadian
newspaper or periodical to you, I would
point out that certainly the words are almost
repetitive.
Then, I find in subsection 2 this very interesting provision on this point for those
persons and those operations that have become established in Canada in the meantime.
It was thought so important that this provision was made:
(2) The Governor in Council may
exempt from the operation of this section,
upon such terms and conditions as the
Governor in Council may prescribe, any
person who, at the time of the coming

June 28, 1965

into force of this Act, was the holder
of a licence and was not a person
described in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1).
That refers to a Canadian citizen or a corporation incorporated under the laws of
Canada.
Therefore, in 1958 it was felt that even
though the communications represented by
broadcasting were of such value and were so
important to the character and the development of the viewpoint of the people of
Canada, that we wanted a Canadian citizenship test and we wanted the ownership and
the management of these operations to be
in Canadian hands, we still recognized, and
the Government of that day recognized, that
those which were established and operating
at that time had a case to be heard.
It is interesting also to note what was said
after the Royal Commission on Publications
made its report. It made two main recommendations. One was that periodicals containing advertising that is primarily directed
to the Canadian market be no longer permitted to enter Canada from abroad; and,
two, that the deduction from income by a
taxpayer of expenses incurred for advertising
directed to the Canadian market for any
foreign periodicals wherever printed be disallowed.
As reported at the time this matter was
discussed in 1962, the then Prime Minister
of Canada is reported to have said:
It is the intention of the Government
to implement the first of these recommendations; that is to say, the government proposes, in due course, to prevent
the importation of periodicals containing
advertising that is primarily directed to
the Canadian market.
I say, in substance, that is what is done in
the provisions of the Customs Tariff Actnot to the extent of 100 per cent, but that
is what is substantially done.
Then, as to the second recommendation,
the then Prime Minister of Canada is reported
to have said:
... it is the intention of the government to implement it but with an important modification.
In discussing the position of people who
were presently in Canada and carrying on,
that is, those people who were in Canada
at that time-and I assume it included Time
and Reader's Digest-he said:
They have established themselves in
this country in good faith, they employ

June 28, 1965

June28. 965SENATE
DEBATES

Canadian labour, and they attempt ta
supply Canadian readers with a specially
adapted product.
Then hie goes on further:
When Canadian advertisers place advertisements in these latter magazines,
their advertising outlays will continue
ta be deductible expenditures ta the extent of 50 per cent. In other words, hall
the burden proposed by the Royal Commission will be removed from those nonCanadian periodicals that have established
their operations within tis country.
1 suggest ta you that by this, together
with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act,
the attitude of the then Prime Minister af
Canada in 1962 indicated an appreciation of
the respansibility of the Canadian Government ta industry that has been free ta came
into Canada and ta set up in Canada, ta be
properly and fairly treated when we are
reviewing aur laws in relation ta communications, whether they are newspapers, periodicals or otherwise.
About this further suggestion that it was
flot in line with the recommendations af the
royal commission as ta citizenship, are we
ta assume or can we assume fairly and reasonably that having regard ta the nature, development and content of the periodical, a citizenship test and the requirement of Canadian
ownership is most important ta that setup
and is equally important ta Canadian newspapers? Therefore, I would say that the recommendation of the royal commission supporting
citizenship and Canadian ownership af periodicals is the strongest argument in the world
for its extension ta newspapers.
When it cames ta the question of the sanclion there have been an infinite varlety af
suggestions as ta what the nature of a sanction should be. It has been suggested that we
might go ta the newspapers and say, "You be
good boys, and voluntarily agree not ta sell
your shares in the newspapers ta non-Canaclians." It has aven been suggested that we
should pass a law providing for Canadian
ownership of newspapers. If I know anything
about constitutional law-I do not; pretend ta
know ail there is ta know about it; 1 always
defer ta Senator Flynn who has quite a
viewpoint on constitutional. law-I cannot see
how the Canadian Government could pass a
law which would be constîtutianally sound
under which they could prescribe that only
Canadian citizens and companies incorporated
in Canada could own newspapers. I wauld

think such a law would be a very substantial
invasion af the praperty and civil right of
the provinces. What has been done by saying
that a taxpayer who advertises in a nonCanadian publication is nat entitled in certain
circumstances ta a deduction irom his tax of
the amount of money spent in this way, is
completely within the jurisdiction of the
federal Parliament because a deduction from
incame tax otherwise payable lies within the
legislative right af the federal Parliament,
which can say what amaunt shail be paid.
Therefore the Government is an very strang,
firm, legal graund in making that approach.
Whether that sanction is taa arbitrary is a
matter af opinion. A sanction ta have any
value must be such that its violation will hurt
the persan violating it. In aur method of operation I am not sure that persuasive sanctions
work tao well.
I explained earlier tis evening the efforts
ta amend provisions in the Income Tax Act
which we had thought were reasonably sound
and yet means ai circumventing them had
been found. If one were moralizing or attempting ta be persuasive one wauld say, "It
is nat the intent of Parliament, and one should
nat do this or that but should behave properly
as good boys." But, as I have said, a sanction
ta be effective must hurt those who violate it.
It has been suggested that such a sanction
may be an interference with the freedom af
the press. That, in my view, is nonsensical.
First of ail, ta say ta a taxpayer wha places an
advertisement in a nan-Canadian publication
and who therefore cannot deduct the sum
spent in this regard irom his income for
incame tax purposes, that this is interiering
with the freedam of the press, is going beyond
the beyond. The ireedom of the press is not
interfered with in any way. I understand
ireedom ai the press ta caver editorializing
and the reporting ai news. We are now dealing
with the field ai advertising, and there is
nothing ta prevent any newspaper in Canada,
whether Oanadian or nat, from attracting advertisements. It may be, hawever, that the
taxpayer will not advertise in a particular
newspaper, the ownership oi which does flot
camply with Canadian law, but ta say that
this constitutes interference with the freedom
ai the press is ta draw a conclusion iramn coimpletely unrelated situations.
Whether the sanction praposed is the best
ana or not, I do not know. But it certainly
is better than any of the others I have heard
about the voluntary agreement or the passing

June 28, 1965

SENATE DEBATES
of a law which would bring about a constitutional crisis right away. Once we accept
the view, as we have in this Parliament, by
the terms of the Broadcasting Act, which deals
with another method of communication, and
once we accept that it is important that the
viewpoint or the approach to those publications should keep in mind the consideration
that such means of communication should be
dealt within terms of Canadian viewpoint and
Canadian education, then we must take whatever means are necessary to achieve that
result. As I have said, I do not know whether
this is the best sanction available to us, but
I have not heard of any others that even approach its value to assure the desired results.
Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable
senators, the distinguished senator who has
just taken his seat has shown by the ease
and lucidity with which he explained this
rather complicated measure why he has
risen to such eminence in his profession. I
want to say immediately that with everything he has said about press freedom and
about the measure regarding newspapers I
agree wholeheartedly. In fact, I propose
going even further than he has gone.
In fifty years I have not seen or heard so
much agitation by members of my profession against what they fear to be an invasion of press freedom. Now this in a sense
is not a bad thing. In our society, freedom
of expression and therefore of the organs
of expression is so firmly entrenched that
it requires almost overwhelming justification of anything that might be construed as
interference by the state. But, honourable
senators, having said that, there are a few
other observations I feel I should make.
The first thing I must say is that this legislation with respect to newspapers is only an
extension of what a royal commission with
which I was connected recommended with regard to periodicals. I must also say that
having examined it as thoroughly as
I can, I cannot find in it a sentence, a word or a syllable that threatens,
even remotely, the freedom of the press,
rightly understood. I think I should say too
that in saying this, I am not speaking for
any party or for any newspaper group, and
certainly not for the owners of my own
newspaper. They take a different view. I
speak for myself as an individual, as a
member of this Senate, and as one who has
been a member of the newspaper profession
for more than fifty years. I do not question

the sincerity of my newspaper colleagues
who fear this legislation. I am sure they are
perfectly sincere, but I am equally sure that
they are wrong, wrong because of a hoary,
sanctified myth-the hoary, sanctified myth
that the press in some way enjoys privileges
and immunities denied to ordinary citizens.
Honourable senators, there are no such immunities and no such privileges. All that
press freedom means is that the right of free
speech has been extended to the printing
press, nothing less and nothing more. And
that right of the printing press is enjoyed by
some little printer in a garret just as surely
as it is enjoyed by the powerful publisher
of the greatest newspaper. It is the printing
press alone, not some newspaper, the printing
press alone which has been granted freedom
in these matters. And I think it should be
said-and perhaps I am the one to say itthat the freedom of the press never undertook to underwrite the profits of a newspaper. This great constitutional theory cannot be reduced to a commercial convenience.
The marvel to me is that intelligent men who
keep raising this cry about the freedom of
the press seemingly have not read the judgments over the years of the greatest jurists
in the United States, Canada and Great Britain. I will quote just one from the United
States, Mr. Justice Coleman of the United
States District Court. In a judgment in 1955
he said:
Freedom of the press is a constitutional guaranty. Yet this does not give
immunity to the press . . . but merely

secures to the press the same basic
rights and immunities as are enjoyed by
the public at large.
Nothing more and nothing less. This
idea that in some way the newspaperman has some special privilege in the
state is simply not true. All that he has
is the freedom given to every citizen by
the Constitution, the Bill of Rights or
whatever.
And Lord Shaw, whom lawyers in this
house will remember as one of the past
great figures of the Privy Council, delivered this judgment in 1938:
Their Lordships regret to find that
there appeared in one side of this case
the timeworn claim that some kind of
privilege attached to the profession of
the press as distinguished from members
of the public. The freedom of the journalist is an ordinary part of the freedom
of

the

public . . . his

privilege

is

no

June 28, 1965

DEBATES

other and no higher. No special privilege attaches to his position.
We have heard in this debate in recent
weeks people quote the First Amendment
of the Constitution of the United States.
Well, what does it say?
Congress shail make no law respecting
an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press.
Note that freedom of speech cornes first, and
then the press, this being merely an extension
of freedom of speech to the printing press.
I have heard quoted in the past few weeks
a judgment of Sir Lyman Duif in what is
popularly known as the "Alberta Press Law."
Well, what was the Alberta Press Law? It
souglit to impose upon newspapermen the
obligation of printing anything the Government of Alberta rnight send to them in reply
to their criticism. If they dared to criticize
the Alberta Social Credit Government, then
the government said, "We shail send you a
reply. We shall compel you to print our reply
in any way we write it, exactly as we write it,
and at whatever length we write it." That, of
course, was an invasion, not only of the rights
of a newspaper, but of the ordinary human
rights, and the Supreme Court of Canada,
with Sir Lymnan Duif writing the judgment,
declared it unconstitutional. But in that same
judgment, too often overlooked, Sir Lyman
Duif stated:
But the right of public discussion is
subject to legal restrictions, those based
upon considerations of decency and public
order, and others conceived for the protection of various private and public
interests.
I repeat:
... the protection of various private and
public interests.
In other words, what Sir Lyrnan Duif was
saying here was that press freedom. is not; an
absolute; that newspapers have no special dispensation from the laws and regulations
which society lays down for the government
and security of citizens within that society;
that no right includes a privilege to injure the
society granting it.
During ail of my very humble career as a
newspaperrnan I think I have always understood this, that I have no special rights in the
community. And as an editor I neyer thought
you could give some reporter a writing pad
and pencil, and send hlim down the street and

invest hirn with some special significance.
Honourable senators, this is nonsense, and I
think it is tîrne that newspapermen themselves
realized that it is nonsense.
I have been attending newspaper meetings
in Canada for years, and have heard newspapermen rise and quote that poetic declamation of Milton:
Give me the liberty to know, to utter
and to argue according to my conscience,
above ail other liberties.
That, as I said, was a splendid poetic declamation, but, if you look at it carefully
you will find that no more unintelligent and no looser statement has ever
been written in the English language. Give me
the right, according to my conscience, to utter
treason! Give me the right, according to my
conscience, to utter language endangering the
security of the state! Give me the right, according to my conscience, to incite to flot!
Give me the right, as Mr. Justice Holmes put
it, to rise in a crowded theatre and shout
"fire!" Actually, Mr. Milton was a noble poet,
but as a champion of liberty he was an awful
bust. Mr. Milton, this great champion of liberty, urged the authorities in Britain to declare that the religious tracts of his opponents
should be printed only in Latin, when he
knew that not one per cent of the people of
England spoke or read Latin. More than that,
he ended up his life as a weil-paid censor.
Then you hear newspapermen-and the
senator who just took his seat referred to
thls-speaking about the terrible danger of
taxing advertising. Honourable senators,
advertising has been taxed i this country
for years on end. If I take up this evening's
print of the Ottawa Journal or the Ottawa
Citizen I venture to say I would find that
65 per cent of the revenues i those papers;
corne from advertising. Multiply that by 300
prints in a year, and you get a tremendous
amount of revenue, and on that revenue the
Government imposes a tax of 48 per cent.
Actually, under an arrangement with the
Post Office Department, if the Ottawa Journal
or Ottawa Citizen, or the Toronto Star or the
Toronto Telegram today carnies an excess of
advertîsing with respect to their reading
matter the Post Office collects on that excess.
Newspapers are not immune from the laws
of Government or municipalities: they neyer
have and they neyer can be. They are under
Governrnent supervision and Government
control with respect to wages, with respect to
working conditions, with respect to sanita-

SENATE DEBATES

its own, has within it seeds of decay ...
Our sole purpose has been to find a
way to guarantee for Canadians their
own communications media.
That guarantee, we are convinced, is
vital. For while Canada and the United
States may have the same basic cultures,
they each at the same time have domestic
and other tasks and problems-political,
social and economic-which differ widely.
Canada's particular responsibilities, her
government, ber constitutional structure,
her ideals and aspirations, her memories
and milestones, even her discords, are
facts in her existence which cannot be
approached understandingly or usefully
by communications media owned or controlled in another country, even though
that country be friendly. Only a truly
Canadian printing press, one with the
"feel" of Canada . . . can give us the critical analysis, the informed discourse and
dialogue which are indispensable in a
sovereign society.
Some honourable senators may ask: What
about our newspapers? What about the discussion you find there? Well, the answer to
that is that Canada, in fact, has no national
newspapers. We have no London Times; we
have no Guardian of Manchester; we have
no London Sunday Observer or Sunday
Times. We have no national weekly review
such as the Economist, the Spectator, the New
Statesman or the Tribune, and we have no
intellectual monthly publication such as
Encounter.
The report of the royal commission went
on:
Therefore, so far as the printed word
is concerned, it is largely left to our
periodical press, to our magazines big
and little, to make a conscious appeal to
the nation, to try to interpret Canada to
all Canadians, to bring a sense of oneness
to our scattered communities.
The philosophy, the underlying principles,

tion; and, more than that, practically everything that goes into the production of a newspaper is taxed. If you think newsprint is not
taxed, go and ask the newsprint producers.
Newsprint, metals and ink are taxed. Almost
everything that goes into newspaper production is taxed, and what in the name of
common sense has this to do with the freedom
of the press? As I said, the doctrine of the
freedom of the press never guaranteed the
profits of a newspaper, and it never intended,
as I have already said, that the publisher of
a newspaper should have some special dispensation from the ordinary laws of the
nation.
Now, honourable senators, having gone that
far in supporting a contention of my friend
Senator Hayden, I want to take the most
violent exception to what be has said about
periodicals. One of the worst things that he
said was that in some way he thought Time
and Reader's Digest might not be exempt from
this law. Well, if he is not sure he had better
go and ask the Minister of Finance, because
he seems to be certain, so certain that last
week in the House of Commons he said,
"Why, yes, we have exempted these people.
And why did we exempt them? Because they
have been in this country for 20 years." Well,
I hope to show presently what they have
been doing in this country during the last
20 years.
I think I should lay a foundation for what
I am going to say by recalling that in 1961
or 1962 I was asked to become the chairman
of a royal commission on publications,
directed
to make recommendations to the Government as to possible measures which,
while consistent with the maintenance
of the freedom of the press, would contribute to the further development of a
Canadian identity through a genuinely
Canadian periodical press.

June 28, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

provinces, and received and studied 188 briefs
and 200 memoranda. We examined the books
of all Canadian publications and carried out
our own research program with a substantial
staff of economists, lawyers and accountants.
Also, we asked to come before us, and did
bring before us, publishers from the United
States, France and Canada.
Well, what did we find? We found, in brief,
that Canadian periodicals were, in fact, subject to competition, unfair, unjust and crippling. I am not going to weary you tonight
with statistics or descriptions of what are
known as "split runs" or "regional editions"
or even "overflow circulation," but I do want
to deal briefly with what are known as Canadian editions represented by Time magazine
and Reader's Digest.
A Canadian edition, so-called, is a periodical whose editorial content is lifted in whole
or in large part, from a parent edition outside
Canada, and then used in Canada to attract
Canadian advertising. In other words, outside
or foreign editorial matter is dumped into
Canada-in fact, is dumped into Canada in
a way that adds up to the most vicious form
of dumping.
The truth is that the printing of "Canadian
editions" is not a publishing endeavour at
all; it is an importing business. Businessmen
discovered that editorial material developed
for foreign markets could be re-used as a
structure to entice Canadian advertising. With
a product already paid for by a market ten
times larger and twelve times wealthier, the
businessman need only set up offices for the
solicitation of advertising. And that is exactly
what was done.
At the time of the commission's hearings,
Time's Canadian edition was edited in New
York, printed in Chicago and trucked into
Canada for mailing. There was a drop-mail
box in Toronto for subscription returns which
were then sent on to the United States for
processing. Time's entire investment in Canada
for an operation that made $3 million in
profit in five years was three advertising
offices, a few reporters and a chain of "stringers."
Between 1955 and 1959 the Canadian advertiser spent over $31 million with Time and
Reader's Digest, leaving them with a profit
of $6,500,000. In that same period, all major
Canadian consumer magazines put together
got barely $45 million of advertising, leaving
them with a loss of nearly $2,500,000. In other
words, during the five-year period for which
audited figures were available, two so-called
Canadian editions took over 40 per cent of

all Canadian magazine advertising expenditures, leaving less than 60 per cent to be
divided among the nine Canadian consumer
periodicals that we had at that time.
I might add that since then-since our report-these two magazines, these two so-called
Canadian editions, are now taking about 50
per cent of all consumer magazine advertising.
In all, 15 of our periodicals publishing over
10 million copies a year have gone under between 1960 and 1965. I repeat that 15 of our
periodicals publishing over 10 million copies
a year have gone under between 1960 and
1965. When our commission was set up, nine
magazines were regarded as being national.
One died during the inquiry, and four have
died since-two English and two French-and
the total circulation has fallen from 3.5 million
to 2.5 million.
Even more disastrous is the revenue picture.
Advertising revenue of Canadian periodicals
has dropped $8 million, from $17 million to
$9 million, or by 45 per cent. But, in the
meantime, the Canadian editions, so-called,
have had a gain of 26 per cent in circulation,
and a gain in advertising of 2 per cent.
Honourable senators, a few years before
his death, that great American, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, said, in a message to Life
magazine, that:
the great organizations of communication in this country have an obligation
and a responsibility unequalled in our
national life, and basic to our national
future.
And quoting that statement, the Life-Time
organization claimed for America's magazines
two vital functions: The encouragement of
America's national development, and the preservation of America's national heritage. Still
later, less than a year before his death,
President Kennedy told the American newspaper editors that "American communications media is as vital to the United States
as our military defences."
Honourable senators, those words by President Kennedy are as true of Canada as they
are true of the United States, and accepting
their truth, our commission postulated that
Canadian advertisers had a moral obligation,
a patriotic duty, to support their own periodicals. We therefore defined a Canadian periodical as:
one published in Canada, owned either
by Canadian citizens or, if a corporation,
by a company incorporated under the
laws of Canada or of one of its provinces,

SENATE DEBATES
and which is controlled and directed by
Canadian citizens and is not a licensee of
or otherwise substantially the same as a
periodical owned or controlled outside
Canada.
And our main recommendation on that basis
was-and it was quoted tonight by Senator
Hayden-that the deduction from income by
a taxpayer of expenditures incurred for advertising directed at the Canadian market in a
foreign periodical wherever printed be disallowed.
I ask you to note that the only interest
affected by this recommendation was the
businessman who dumps cheaply obtained editorial matter on the domestic market, thus
diverting by eut-rate prices Canadian domestic
advertising from Canadian media. But the
right to own a press, and to print and distribute from it whatever is permissible under
the law, was in no way trespassed. The commission's recommendations involved no regulation of the preparation, content or freeflow of the editorial material of foreign
periodicals; the reader was in no way denied
the periodical of his choice.
Honourable senators, I ask you to note
clearly what has happened. What has happened is that the Government, by this legislation that is proposed here tonight, and
approved by the Commons, bas accepted the
principle of our commission's recommendations, and then proceeded to make a mockery
of the principle-to strangle the principle in
its cradle.
They say that deduction from income by
a taxpayer of expenditures for advertising
in a foreign periodical shall be disallowed;
but then, almost in the next breath, they go
on to exempt Time and Reader's Digest, the
two principal perils to Canadian periodicals,
despite all that the distinguished senator said,
and, in effect, to confer Canadian citizenship,
for the practical purposes of this law, upon
Mr. Henry Luce of New York City, and upon
Mr. Dewit Wallace of Pleasantville, New York.
These two gentlemen, owners of the so-called
Canadian editions I have been describing, are
in effect issued Canadian passports-given a
green light to go ahead with their destruction
of our Canadian periodicals.
When Mr. Henry Luce appeared before our
commission and was subjected to cross-examination, he made this statement:
I may be in some disagreement with my
colleagues. But you said, sir, you want me
to be very plain. I do not consider Time
a Canadian magazine.

June 28, 1965

Mr. Henry Luce says, "I do not consider
Time a Canadian magazine." This legislation
says it is a Canadian magazine, and grants it
all the benefits accordingly. More than that,
not only are these two magazines exempt
from this law, they are entrenched in their
present position.
As someone remarked in the other place
last week, they have locked the hen-coop door,
but they have left two of the biggest foxes
inside.
Honourable senators, this law was not for
the purpose of protecting Canadian magazines
and periodicals from American magazines
that are not here. This law was to protect
Canadian magazines from American competition which is here. But instead of doing that,
they protect and perpetuate
the two
magazines which have brought about the destruction in our magazine industry, which I
have already noted, and which in a few
years, if I know what I am talking about,
will have a more deadly effect than now.
There is something more than that.
In the other place last week, when the
Minister of Finance was being hard pressed
about these exemptions he finally said that
Time and Reader's Digest were entitled to
exemptions because they had been in Canada
for 20 years. Well, honourable senators, I
have tried to show you what Time and
Reader's Digest have been doing in Canada
for those 20 years, and the Minister of Finance knows the facts as well as I do. Yet
this is what he says to them, in effect:
You are practising unfair and crippling
competition against our Canadian periodicals, but seeing that you have been doing
it for 20 years, you have earned the right
to go on doing it.
Honourable senators, if more illogical,
inconsistent and fantastic legislation has ever
been presented to a parliament anywhere, I
do not know when or where it was. I can only
conclude one thing, and I know this same
conclusion has been reached by many Canadians who have been watching this situation,
and there is all too much evidence to support it. There is the statement of the United
States Under Secretary Ball, and of the Secretary of the Treasury, Dillon, in which they
practically threatened retaliation if this measure were passed. I say to you that Ottawa
has been placed in this ludicrous and false
position of introducing legislation of this
character, by pressure from Washington. I
do not think there is any shadow of doubt
about it; and if you read what members of

June 28, 1965

the Lib-eral press are saying, you will see
that they go even further than I do.
Honourable senators, in conclusion, I say
with ail the earnestness I can command, that
if this house votes for this legislation it will
be voting for the proposition that Washington bas a right to interfere in a matter of
purely Canadian concern, and voting a probable death sentence on Canada's periodical
press, with ail that that can entail for our
future voyage through history.

be dealt with by the Senate before we consider the passage of the present measure.
I do believe, however, that some further
explanation would be desirable with respect
to schedule D to the bill, so that no one will
be in any doubt as to the over-all effect of
the present legislation, considered in conjunction with the proposed amendments to
the Income Tax Act, with respect to periodicals. I do not propose to expatiate upon the
controversial matters raised in the other
legislation, but fortunately we have available on this side of the house a senator who
yields to no one in the matter of expertise.
I refer, of course, to Senator Grattan O'Leary
who has made the attitude of those of us on
this side of the chamber clearly and forcibly
known.
The sponsor of the bill, as reported at
page 261 of the Debates of the Senate, said,
in answer to a question put to him by honourable Senator White:
From having dealt with the departmental officers over the years, I know
they have great capacity, and I do not
think this will present many problems
to them.
Honourable senators, I have had the privilege, for a period of five years, of dealing with
those men who look after the tariff legislation, and I am happy to say that I share
wholeheartedly the confidence that Senator
Hayden expressed in them. I found them
alert; I always found that they were great
experts in the field, and ready to co-operate
with whoever sponsored a bill; they were
always ready to brief us, and they did it
most expertly.
Honourable senators, I do not know if this
bill is going to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, but under the circumstances I think it should. This bill and
the one to amend the Income Tax Act should
be dealt with at the same time.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, in speaking to this motion, I must confess that I was unable to be present during
the extended explanation of the bill by Senator Hayden. However, I have since had the
opportunity of reading the debate in which
several honourable senators participated, and
it seems to me that the clear exposition of
the mover of the bill and the answers given
to the questions raised do not require any
lengthy remarks on my part at this time.
It is a familiar experience for me to discuss
the proposals contained in the Customs Tariff
bill which is before us. I cannot honestly pretend that I regularly enjoy the experience.
However, I did go through with a measure
of survival, if not complete success, the "class
or kind" episode of some years ago. It has
been said, and I am afraid wisely, that if you
have proved yourself capable of carrying
trunks upstairs, you will be carrying trunks
upstairs all your life.
In a more serious vein, honourable senators, I have looked at the present bill with
reasonable care and I have had the benefit
of studying the discussions which took place
in the other place, at both the resolution stage
and on the motion for second reading of the
present bill.
I do not oppose it and will vote for second
reading, though there are a number of matters which could stand clarification by the

Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Harry A. Willis: Honourable senators,
I do not think anyone on this side of the house
will oppose this bill. However, I have a few
questions to ask which I consider to be
timely and pertinent.
Why should Canadian National Railways
spend $850,000 when there is already in
existence an adequate railway, the Chesapeake & Ohio, which runs almost parallel to
the proposed line and which could carry the
manufactured goods from the C.I.L. plant
which, I understand, will be distributed
largely in the counties of Kent and Essex?
The best answer I have had to that question
up to this time is that the Minister of National
Revenue stated in the other place that the
Canadain National executive had examined
the situation fully. I do not accept that as
being a good answer, and I think other means
should be explored and that consideration
should be given to the use of an existing
railway, the roadbed of which is in excellent
condition.
Furthermore, the proposed location of this
plant in the Township of Sombra is within
easy trucking distance of the St. Lawrence
Seaway ports. I cannot for the life of me
understand why Canadian National Railways
want to build a spur line 12 miles long to
take their main line into the plant.
There is another point which concerns me
and which I feel is of concern to the country
as a whole. Whenever industry comes into an
area the railway companies jump to do everything they can. But what are they doing with
lines which were established years ago for
the benefit of the pioneer people of this
country? They are abandoning them. Even at
the present time there is an application by
Canadian National Railways for the abandonment of 12 miles of railway line, exactly the
same length of railway from Glencoe to
Alvinston in the same area. And this is happening all over Ontario. I speak only for
Ontario. I do not know about the rest of
Canada. While Canadian National and Canadian Pacific are asking for authorization to
construct these new branch lines, they are
making applications to abandon other branch
lines.
A branch line in the area in which I grew
up, running from Toronto to Owen Sound,
and which was first incorporated as the

June 28, 1965

Credit Valley Railway, was guaranteed by
bonds by the farmers and the people in the
surrounding area who agreed that they
would put up part of the cost. Whereas
years ago there were two trains a day, one
north and one south, and the same at night,
we now wind up today with only two trains
a week. That is happening all over the
place. I think it is time the Government took
a look at what the railway companies are
doing with respect to depriving the ordinary
citizens of Ontario of railway transportation
to and from the major centres. It seems
strange to me that while they are abandoning these lines they are willing to spend
$850,000 to build a spur line to carry the
product from this plant which could well be
carried by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway
which, as I said, is there even now.
I shall support the bill because it requires no expenditure on the part of the
Government, but I ask the Government to
take a close look at applications made by
the railway companies to abandon lines and
thereby affect the lives of people. The people
in my area can travel to Toronto by rail
only two days a week.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ot±awa West):
many of them want to go?

Do

Hon. Mr. Willis: I think they would if
they could. I know what my friend is referring to. On one occasion in the United
States when a commission was considering
a similar application, as each witness was
called, the only question which counsel for
the railway asked was, "How did you come
here today?" And the reply in each instance was, "By car."
However, I do think some consideration
should be given to commuter trains, within
60 or 70 miles of Toronto.
In 1940 or 1942 the Canadian Pacific Railway applied for the abandonment of a line
from a station called Cateract to Elora,
Ontario. I opposed that on behalf of the
municipalities, and a line had to be built
four miles around Belwood Lake in order to
satisfy the people. At that time we produced
bonds that the people in that area had signed
many years earlier, before the railway would
come in there.
I think both railways should make a close
examination of this situation, and they should
not do something merely because C.I.L.
wants to erect a new plant in the township
of Sombra.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, perhaps I shouid say just
a word in reply to Senator Willis. In the
first place, I think the points he raises are
ones which might well be deait with in

lime, to which. the honourable senator referred, an-d the Canadian National Railways'
proposai, I gather the C.N.R. got the business, and that is why it is proposed that the
line shouid be built. Moreover, I gather
from the information supplied to me that it
will be profitable business for the Camadian
National Railways, and I assume it would be
a desirable service to be rendered to Canadian Industries Limited. So it looks as if ail
the parties to the proposai set up by this
bull are very happy about it. And the Chesapeake & Ohio did not get the business; they

Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, presented the following report of the committee on Bill C-124, respecting the construction of a line of railway in the
Province of Ontario by Canadian National
Railway Company from a point at or near
mileage 3.2 of the Froomfield Spur of the
Canadian National Railway near Sarnia in a

Your committee recommends

of 800 copies in English and 300 copies
in French of its proceedings on the said
bill.

consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I move, with leave of

Report adopted.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED
Hon. Mr. Hugessen, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, reported that the committee had
considered Bill C-124, respecting the construction of a line of railway in the Province of
Ontario by Canadian National Railway Company from a point at or near mileage 3.2 of
the Froomfield Spur of the Canadian National
Railway near Sarnia in a southerly direction
for a distance of approximately 12 miles to
the property of Canadian Industries Limited
in Sombra Township in the County of
Lambton, and had directed that the bill be
reported without amendment.
Report adopted.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: With leave of the
Senate, I move that this bill be read the
third time now.
Honourable senators will recall that
yesterday evening in the discussion on second
reading of this measure, Senator Willis
raised the criticism that the branch line of
railway which this bill proposes is parallel
to an existing line, and that therefore its
construction is unnecessary because the
existing line could be used for the purpose
for which this branch is asked. The facts are
entirely correct. Authority is asked to build
this branch line for a distance of 12 miles
due south from Sarnia, parallel to and about
a mile to the east of the St. Clair River, to
a chemical fertilizer plant which Canadian
Industries Limited is proposing to build at
the place called Sombra.

June 29. 1963

June29, 965SENATE
DEBATES

There is at the present time another lime
of railway parallelmng this proposed branch,
belonging ta the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway,
which runs substantially along the shore of
the St. Clair River, and bath of them will
run mnta or thraugh the proposed C.I.L. plant.
The answer ta the question whether this
brandi is reaUly necessary was a subject ta
which your committee directed particular
attention this morning when the afficers af
the railway appeared befare us, in view af
the criticism which had been made by Senator
Willis yesterday evening. The brief answer
is that this project 15 sa enarmous that there
will be ample traffic for bath linies af railway
and that a second line af railway is required.
Canadian Industries Limited prapose ta,
spend about $50 millian on this plant. The raw
material for the plant consists, I understand,
af pyrites or some sort of rock formation
which will came from the sauthern United
States and will be brought ta it by the present
Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Une. The ultimate output af the plant when it is i ful
production is expected ta be ai the arder ai
400,000 tons a year af chemical fertilizer,
of which the Canadian National Railways will
transport about half, that is, 200,000 tons a
year. If yau divide 200,000 tans by the
number af days in the year, that cames ta
a figure of between 600 and 700 tans af
freight per day. This in itself is no small
amaunt ai freight.
Canadian Industries Limited were very
anxiaus ta have the Canadian National came
in with this branch. Yau can understand the
reasons why. In a plant ai this size, which
is praducing many hundreds ai tons ai
material a day, it is essential ta get that
material out and distributed as quickly as
passible; otherwise, it will pile up in enormous and unmanageable quantities. That is
the reasan why the Canadien Industries
Limited were very anxious ta have the use
ai two limes for that purpase. They felt that
if, for instance, ane Uine shauld go out ai
commission for even a few days-by reason
ai a washout or an accident or a strike-they
wauld need ta have an alternative route so
as ta keep their plant ini aperatian.
Some hanourable senatars wrnl prabably
recail that the same question came up about
two years ago in cannectian with a brandi
Uine which I thimk the Canadian Pacific Railway wished ta build ta one ai these enarmaus
new patash plants li Saskatchewan. I think
my friend Senator Aseltime was li charge ai
the bull. In that case the Canadian National
was a]ready there, but the Canadian Pacific
22624-19

wanted ta build a branch ta the new plant.
We were given the sanie argument, that
where you have this enormous production
per day it is almast essential. for the praper
operatian ai the plant that there be alternative facilities for distributian. That, li brief,
is the reason why this branch Is required.
Honourable senatars, I should add twa
things. The first is that li the cansideratian
by the cammittee there was no abjection
taken on behalf ai the Chesapeake & Ohio
Railway. They did nat appear ta tell us that
they were being imterfered with or that this
was unfair competition. There was no apposition af any kind. Secondiy, we were lnformed
that the agreement which is being made
between the Canadien Industries Limited and
the Canadian National Railways gives the
Canadien National Railways a guarantee af
suificient freight revenue from that Uine ta
amortize the entire capital expenditure within
10 years.
Honourable senators, I thought these explanations were due ta the Senate, and particularly ta Senator Wiflts because ai the
criticisms he made last evening.
Motion agreed ta and bull read third time
and passed.

Hon. Mr. Ra.buck: Hanourable senatars, li
connection with the proceedings ai the

a rather unusual character. It is with respect
ta a petition by Monica Shackleton Lindsay
for a divorce from her husband and lin connection with which a resolution has been
passed in favour ai a divorce. It now appears
that the respondent had died before the
resolution was passed. I have here a letter
from the Senate Conimissioner, which reads
as fallaws:

SENATE DEBATES
May 15th, 1965 of Harold Alexander
Lindsay who died in New York on May
10th, 1965.
Since the Resolution was adopted by
the Senate on May 20th, 1965, it was,
according to the opinion of Mr. E. R.
Hopkins, the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel, null and of no effect.
It is my understanding however that
you wish to report this to the Senate,
and I believe the information in this
letter is what you will require for that
purpose.
I make this statement so that it may be
placed on record that our resolution was
passed without knowledge that the respondent
had died previously, and also to place on
record that in the opinion of our Law Clerk
the action of the Senate on that occasion was
null and of no effect.
DUTCH ELM DISEASE
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF REPLY TO QUESTION
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called there is a matter to which I would
like to call attention.
Honourable senators will recollect that
some time ago I asked for information with
regard to the new chemicals which are
advertised for the control of Dutch elm
disease, and I called attention to the great
importance of this development to a large
number of people, if not everyone, within
the Province of Ontario.
I have received a letter in reply to my
inquiry from the Leader of the Government,
in which he says:
You will recall on May 31st last when
the Senate had for consideration an
Interim Supply Bill, that you asked for
information respecting the use of Bidrin
for Dutch elm disease control. The
Departments of Agriculture and Forestry
have furnished me with a reply to your
inquiry, and I am enclosing it herewith.
That reply is as follows:
Several large-scale trials using Bidrin
for suppression of insect species that
carry and spread Dutch elm disease have
been carried out in Wisconsin, Ohio, and
New York. These trials have produced
some promising results but as yet there
is no clear indication that the disease has
been curtailed by the use of this
chemical.

June 29, 1965

Bidrin is extremely toxic both to plants
and animals. It acts as a systemic poison,
that is, it is transported throughout the
vascular system of the plant. It does
kill bark-beetles that attack treated trees
but whether or not insect suppression
takes place before the beetles have transmitted the infection is not clear. Because
of its high toxicity to trees, it is difficult
to achieve a favourable balance between
effective control of bark-beetles and
poisoning of the tree.
The Departments of Forestry and
Agriculture are not recommending the
use of Bidrin for Dutch elin disease control because: (a) It is extremely toxic to
mammals and birds. (b) Its high toxicity
to trees makes it difficult to use. (c) Insufficient evidence of its effectiveness in
disease control is available.
Until it is proven to be effective, the
present recommendations for the protection of elms from Dutch elm disease
should be followed: a combination of
vigorous sanitation (removing and burning dead and ailing trees) and the application of DDT or Methoxychlor in the
spring.
That is the reply; it is disappointing. I
call attention to the fact that nothing is said
with regard to the activity of these federal
departments in the matter of the investigation of the disease and its control. I wish to
say publicly that I would like to see either
the Department of Forestry or the Department of Agriculture apply for an appropriation to cover the expense of investigating
this matter and, if possible, to make some
recommendation of an effective character. I
am sure that everyone in this chamber would
be very glad to vote supply for such a purpose.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, perhaps I should say a few words on
this point.
Senator Roebuck did reply to the letter I
wrote him containing the answer that he
has read to the house today. In addition to
supplying and tabling answers to honourable
senators who asked questions in the debate
on interim supply and the supplementary
estimates, I have referred them to the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance,
and I am informed that they have been
tabled in the committee.
It is appropriate, I think, to suggest that
in due time at one of the forthcoming meetings of the committee the points raised by

June 29, 1965

June29, 965SENATE
DEBATES

Senator Roebuck and other senators mlght
be the subject matter of further inquiry.
With respect to an issue such as that raised
by Senator Roebuck, I think we wiil be
rendering a service if we take advantage of
that forum to have these matters aired and
to press the appropriate departmnent into
action.
INCOME TAX ACT AND THE FEDERALPROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS
ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND PREADIN~G

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Hayden for the second reading of Bull C-118,
to amend the Income Tax Act and the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.
[Translation]J
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I shail be as brief as possible. The thîrty
sections of Bill C-118, an act to amend the
Incomne Tax Act and the Federal-Provincial
Fiscal Arrangements Act can be divided in
three categories. The first category would include ail sections, except sections 4 and 9.
Section 4 is in a class by itself as it establishes
a new principle, that is, the tax on nonCanadian periodicals, as it has been cailed
quite împroperly. In this regard, I agree with
Senator Hayden. This section establishes a
new principle containing
an exception
which I would qualify, for the moment, as
rather extraordinary. Finally, the thîrd category relates to the provisions of section 9
reducing personal income tax by 10 per cent.
As for the provisions I have placed in the
first category, they are ail of a remedial or
corrective nature. Most assuredly, the committee is the proper place to discuss such
provisions. In that connection, may I say that
I always have great pleasure in listening to
Senator Hayden speaking on the Incorne Tax
Act. If we were to judge the Act before us
from his words, we might find it weil constructed and clearly drafted. This is far from
being true. He has a talent for making what
is undoubtedly the most complex legislation
in our statutes appear simple. As an example,
one needs only to read section 30 of the Act.
However, I will not; inflict such pain to the
honourable senators this afternoon.
I now corne to section 4. I have little to
add to what Senator Grattan O'Leary said
and with which I agree. He made a strong
and accurate speech. He threw the necessary
light on the subject matter of this clause.
22624.-19à

The Government's intention, namely, to protect Canadian periodicals, is evidently excellent. A solution to this very acute problem. has
been sought for a long time.
We ail agree that Canadian periodicals play
a fundamental part with regard to the creation, if not the preservation, of a truly Canadian spirit. Of course, competition fromn
American periodicals is for our own periodicals a very serious threat of extinction. The
O'Leary Commission investigated that matter
and submitted recommendations. Here is the
solution proposed by the Government in
clause 4:
... that an expense of a taxpayer for
advertising space in an issue of a nonCanadian newspaper or periodical dated
after December 31, 1965, may flot be
deducted in computing income if the advertisement is directed primarily to a
market in Canada.
This way we assume that advertising wil
be channeiled towards Canadiaxi periodicals.
I amn not sure that this will be definitely the
resuit, but the method which is suggested
here is certainly worth a try.
However, with subsection 2(a) of section
4, the Government exempts from that principle
issues or editions of issues of that publication being edited i whole or in
part in Canada and printed and publlshed
in Canada at the usual intervals for issues of that publication ...
through the twelve-month period ending April
26, 1965.
Senator Hayden told us yesterday that
this description did not single out Time and
Reader's Digest-I do agree-but obviously,
this provision could only apply to these
two periodicals. There is no doubt that
this provision is aimed only at non-Canadian
periodicals that were edited and written,
totally or partly, in Canada before April 26,
1965. Therefore, there is no doubt that some
particular well identified cases are intended
to be covered. The principle itself is not
being amended or modified, but an exception
is being made concerning periodicals published
before April 26, 1965.
If the intention had not been to put on an
equal footing with purely Canadian periodicals-according to the definition given a littie
further down, that is the property of Canadian individuals or Canadian groups--such
periodicals that do not; meet this def[nition,
but are published or written partly in Canada,
then a special treatment could have been

SENATE DEBATESJue9,15
devlsed for such periodicals. It was alleged,
rather, that the intention was to recognize
vested rights of some designated non-Canadian periodicals that were being published
prior to April 26, 1965. As a resuit, Time and
Reader's Digest are the only American periodicals complying with the exception provided in paragraph (2) of section 4. Therefore,
an exclusive monopoly is being set up for
them. Not only are their vested interests being
recognîzed, but they have the guarantee that
no other non-Canadian periodical will compete with them. Not only is the integrity of
their empire being recognized, but above ahl,
that empire is being fortified by the setting up
of a barrier against other American or nonCanadian periodicals that might eventually
wish to follow in their footsteps and have
part of their issues published. or edited in
Canada.
1 say that in that way the Government has
completely destroyed the principle it intended
to lay down in paragraph 1 of section 4. It
has practically destroyed it, for Senator
O'Leary clearly established yesterday the
share of the advertising market held together
by Time and Reader's Digest. New, the Government has seen to it that those two perîodicals will flot have that share of the market
curtailed. On the contrary, it will be strengthened by the elimination of any competition,
except for that of Canadian periodicals, which
is nonexistent because their weakness is the
very reason for this legislation.
Indeed, I definitely have the feeling that
this provision is making the situation worse
than the one that prevailed until now and to
which a remedy was being sought.
I would even go so far as to say that the
Government is thinking in this case-as it did
in other circumistances concerning other legislation we had an opportunity to discuss not
so long ago-that it is more important to
seemn to do something than to do it in reality.
Indeed, it is more important for the goverfiment to give the impression that it is doing
something than to really act.
I admit that perhaps the solution is not
easy; but we are faced with a more serious
mess than that which existed previously. So
far as I am concerned, when this measure is
considered by the comx-nittee, I will certainly
introduce an amendment to elimninate paragraph (2) of section 4, if others do not beat
me to it. I hope that the committee will agree
to recognize that Time and Reader's Digest
certainly do not need charity and that we
must not sacrifice beforehand the objective

June 29, 1965

we endeavour to reach, in grantlng thema this
unjustified and unjustifiable special treatment.
I corne now to section 9 which provides for
a general reduction of 10 per cent, or a
maximum of $600 of the personal mncome tax.
Many observers have suggested that for the
expansion of econontic activity, it would have
been better for the Government to grant a
reduction in corporate income tax. I will
make no comment on this matter, because
I do not think I arn qualified. Moreover, we
are theorizing, and, in my opinion, even
the experts would not be able to arrive at
definite conclusions.
However, I suggest that such reductionand there is no similar phrase in Frenchthat this "'across the board" reduction is not;
entirely equitable. I think it would have been
better if the Government had made some adjustments in the basic exemptions: increasing
by $500 or $1,000 the personal exemption, or
increasing the children's exemption, which,
in my opinion, would have been a very good
decision to make since these are the people
who, are most in need of money and who
could, while spending that money, give a shot
in the arm to our economic activîty. I think
the Governiment erred in this connection.
Subi ectively, I cannot complain, since people
who will benefit the most from this are apparently those included in the income bracket
of senators. It remains that such a 10 per
cent reduction will benefit a very small
number of taxpayers. The greater number of
them will see their net income increase by
a few dollars only-perhaps the equivalent
of $1 -or $2 per month; this total gain will
not even be sufficient to pay the contribution
to the Pension Fund, which becomes operative on January 1, 1966.
Now, another remark on this reduction.
Senator Hayden, in hîs speech yesterday,
mentioned that the reduction will apply to
the tax before deduction of the amount payable to, the provinces. I would like to, agree
with him. However, I would be durious to
know what effect this method of calculation
will have on the revenue which the provinces
derive from income tax and what portion
of the personal income tax will go to the
provinces. Nevertheless, as I pointed out
last year-and in this connection Senator
Hayden agrees with me-lt is becoming increasingly urgent that the taxpayer should
know what he is paying to the Crown, at the
federal and provincial leve]s. It is high time
that the tax rates set by the Federal Income

June 29. 1965

June29. 965SENATE
DEBATES

Tax Act be real and effective tax rates. At the
present trne, they only serve as a basis to
figure out, after deducting this and that,
what is fina'ily owed to the federal treasury.
Under the circurnstances, the taxpayer canflot really know what he is paymng to this
or that level of government and, depending
on what he is payimg, what he is receiving
frorn each level of governrnent. This, of
course, could be discussed further in coinmittee.
In short, a series of corrective measures is
proposed on which. everybody agrees: a tax
reduction which. wiil be more substantial for
some than for others; but what is worse, while
it is quite desirable to protect Canadian
periodicals, the Government is making an exception which, I think, wiil sirnply make the
situation worse.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, I arn not going to take up much time
on this bill. We have already heard three
very fine speeches frorn the honourable Senators Hayden, Grattan O'Leary, and Flynn.
However, I should refer to the part of the
measure which affects the fariner. I would
like some explanation so that we can be sure
the administrators of the Incarne Tax Act
wiil not be troubled too much in making decisions when they corne to hear appeals by
farmers.
Section 2, subsection 3, at page three of the
bill, adds a new subsection 16 to section 11,
which reads as foilows:
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b)
of subsection (1) of section 12, there rnay
be deducted in computing a taxpayer's
incorne for a taxation year frorn a business that is farrning, amounts paid by
hirn in the year for clearing land, levelJing land or laying tule drainage for the
purpose of carrying on the farrning
business.
There are a number of things to which it
rnight refer in the clearing of land. I put
themn in the form of questions. Does it mean
cutting down the bush and clearing off the
sturnps? Does it mean removing the cobblestones or any other stone or rock that rnay
be on the land? Does it rnean rernoving
fencing so that the farms can be enlarged?
I arn thinking in particular of some of the
old rail or wooden fences in Ontario and
Quebec. Does it mean the removal of aId
buildings?
I think that these items, and possibly
others, in the way of clearing land, should
all be specified in the Act so that there is

no question, either on the part of the fariner
or the Income Tax Act administrator, as to
the right to, deduct the cost of clearing land.
It should also be clearly stated as to what
is meant by levelling land. I arn quite sure
there will be endless discussion at the incorne
tax offices next year when farmers undertake
to clear or level their land. The question is,
would the cost of clearing and levelling of
land, whether done by a fariner hirnself or
by the hiring of persons ta do his customary
work, be considered as deductible? This confusion would not develop if the matter were
clearly set out in the Act itself.
One further thought cornes to mind. Before
clearing brush off the land, ail farmers should
have the soul tested before they start cutting
to rnake sure that the soul is suitable for agricultural purposes. We do not want to incur
those tremendous losses which Ontario and
Quebec, in particular, suffered as a resuit of
cutting timber on land that was not suitable
agricultural land. If that happens, it is going
to cost the provinces a great deal to put these
cleared lands back into forest.
One other thing about which I arn not
clear is the landscaping of grounds. Section
2, subsection 2, paragraph (z), page 2 of the
bill states:
(z) an amount paid by the taxpayer in
the year for the landscaping of grounds
around a building or other structure of
the taxpayer that is used by him primarily for the purpose of gaining or producing income therefrorn or frorn a
business;
At the resolution stage there was rnerely
a clause (b) of section 10 which stated:
for landscaping property used by the
taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or
producing incorne.
Apparently there was sorne argument about
this paragraph in the other place, and the
Governrnent has seen fit to add to this clause
and thereby reduce the area that it rnay
cover. It now reads, "for landscaping of
grounds around a building or other structure."
What does "structure" mean? Is it a brick
building? Does this refer to urban areas only
or does it aiso refer to the rural areas, particularly with reference to farrns?
Honourable senators, that is ail I want to
say at this tirne. I trust that I rnay have an
answer to these questions, either frorn the
Leader of the Governrnent or when the bull
is before the cornmittee.
Hon. Allister Gromart: Honourable senators,
I shail confine rny cornients to clause 19

SENATE DEBATES
of the bill. Perhaps because of the great
deal of attention paid in the discussion and
debate so far to other and more controversial
clauses such as clause 4, the effects of the
changes to be brought about by clause 19
have been overlooked.
I was surprised to learn that when the bill
was in committee in the other place and was
examined clause by clause, there was no
comment whatsoever on the effects of this
clause. I .hope it will be very carefully
examined in committee and that the committee will call from the Department of
National Revenue or elsewhere some witnesses who would justify the course of
action which is proposed in this clause.
I object to the clause personally on three
grounds.
In the first place, I think it brings about
an unwise, possibly unfair, and certainly
discriminatory action against primary prospectors and developers of mining operations
in Canada. Secondly, I object to it, because
it reverses what appears to me to have been
a very wise principle of income taxation
asserted by the Exchequer Court of Canada
and upheld by the Supreme Court. In the
third place, I object because it seems certain
that it will retroactively deprive taxpayers
of rights that they have now, many of
which are rights held under existing contracts.
I say it is discriminatory against Canadian developers of Canadian mining properties because at the present moment these
developers, in disposing of a property to a
second developer, normally make a deal
by which they will perhaps take a small
down payment but the major part of their
capital payment in royalties. It was this principle that was strongly supported by the
Exchequer Court. Later the Supreme Court
of Canada rejected the appeal of the Minister of National Revenue against the decision
of the Exchequer Court upholding the right
of the taxpayer at that time to avail himself of section 83 of the Income Tax Act to
regard those royalty payments as being not
taxable as income.
The principle that was asserted, I think
honourable senators will agree, was a sound
principle of income taxation, namely, that
this exemption should be allowed because the
return on the capital investment of the
prospector could be realized only through the
development of the mine. This is not an
ordinary case of renting a property or obtaining royalties from a patent. These are
cases where prospectors or a prospecting

June 29. 1965

company have been involved often in large
capital expenditures, certainly in great risks
of time and money, to find and bring to
early development a mining property. At
the present time they can hope to obtain
some return on that capital perhaps from a
down payment, on sale or rental or lease;
but the essential thing is that they must rely
on the development of that mine for a
return of the capital that is put into it. It is
not usual for a prospecting or developing
company to be given in return for a lease
or rent the whole of the capital invested.
They must rely on royalties, because it is
only through the development of a mining
property that the capital investment can be
returned.
This is the principle asserted by the courts
which this clause now seeks to reverse.
If honourable senators wish to read the
case, it is reported in Supreme Court Reports, and in summary form in Canadian
Tax Cases (1963) at page 51, and also in
Dominion Tax Cases (1963) Volume 17, at
page 1031.
If honourable senators will read the reasoning of the court in establishing judicially the
exemption which this clause seeks to reverse,
they will reach the conclusion that the courts
were much wiser, much fairer and much
more conscious of the importance of encouraging Canadian initiative in prospecting
and developing mines than was the Minister
of National Revenue.
The effect of the clause is simply explained.
I will not read it, as it is a very long clause.
The explanatory note says that these two
amendments-that is, the amendments to
subsection 2 of section 83-would add the
underlined words, to provide that rental from
royalty received as consideration for an
interest in a mining property may not be
excluded from income. It goes on to say that
this implements paragraph 16 of the Income
Tax Resolution. Having said first that the
tax exemption subsists where the mining
property is sold for a consideration or where
the prospector receives capital shares of the
corporation, the underlined words add:
unless it is an amount received by him
in the year as or on account of a rent,
royalties or similar payment.
My comment is: Why add those underlined
words? Why say that he may not in the
ordinary course of business say, "I wish to
recover my capital and a profit by taking
whatever you can give me as a down payment and then recover the rest as you prove
up my faith in this mining property"?

June 28, 1865

June29. 965SENATE
DEBATES

I want to emphasize that this is flot similar
to other cases which could be cited in incarne
tax practice where continuing annual payments from inyvestment are taxed. This ia a
case where the prospector or the prospecting
company simply must rely on sornething such
as a royalty payment to get back the capital,
let alone a share in the future development
of the mine.
Clause 7(3) says:
This section is applicable to the 1965
and subsequent taxation years.
I take it that this means that even if there
is an existing royalty contract under which
a prospector or prospecting cornpany has
made a deal to recover part of his or its
capital in rayalties-believing the Act as it
stood ta protect that construction-the Parliament of Canada is now asked to say
"No," retroactively-"«You were right at
the tirne; you had every right to expect to
receive this money tax free, but now, in spite
of the fact that the Exchequer Court and the
Supreme Court of Canada upheld that right,
we now say it is ail off frorn here in. Your
deal is off; you will have to pay tax on that
money regardless of any consideratian in
your mind when you undertook ta take part
of your capital return in royalties and only a
smali part, perhaps, as a down payment."
I believe, as I said at the start, that this
clause 19 is unwise legisiation, that it is
an unwise reversai of a sound principle of
taxation supported by the courts; that it is
discriminatory in the extreme in that it is
retroactive in relation to existing agreements
and existing contracts. I would hope, since
I amn not aware that there wrnl be any representations before the cornrittee, that the
committee will itself take sorne account of
the observations I have made and perhaps
flnd sorne menit in thern. Knowing the chairmnan as I do, I arn sure that will happen.
It may occur to, honourable senators to ask
why, if this situation is as I have reported
it to be, there have been no representations
made during the course of the passage of
this legisîntion. I amn unable to answer that
question. I speak today on my own; I speak
without briefing on the matter; I speak only
from some experience I have had and from
the fact that the injustice of this was drawn
ta my attention in a letter. It has occurred
to me that the reason may be the tatolerable
haste with which legislation is presented to
Parlianient towards the end of a session or
shortly before a recess. Once again we have
a pile-up of such legisiation.

If there is menit in this particular case as
I have put it before the Senate, what chance
is there for a thorough examination and, if
necessary, anxendment if we are faced with
a timetable such as we are given to believe
is presently before us? This haste marks the
whole passage through the other place of
this legisiation. In carnmittee there was no
reference whatever to some of the clauses,
including this particular one, except a note in
Hansard of the other place that clauses suchand-such to 19 were passed. They were not
even called tadividually as far as Hansard
goes.
I make this as one more protest against this
piling up of legislation, and I think one is
entitied to suspect, at leat, if flot ta assert
that this hasty presentation of legislation is
becorning an instrument of government. I
hope that is not the case. I hope this delaying
of legislation until we are ail "under the
gun" is not a device of governrnent ta get it
thraugh speedily. If this is the practice, I
hope that it will be discontinued by the
present Governrnent.
Han. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Acting Speaker: I mnust inform
honourable senators that if Senator Hayden
speaks now it wifl have the effect of closing
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators,
rnay I deal flrst with the points raised by the
last speaker. I would point out ta him that
I tao have voiced complaints at times about
the rush of legisiation towards the end af a
session. It occurs to me that in this case,
however, thxe budget resolution came down
when the budget was presented in April of
this year; so that from that time until the
end of June there has been time for the
realization ta sink in that this change was
being made in this section dealing with
prospectons. I should a]so point out ta rny
friend that the function of the court is ta
interpret the law, and the function of Panliament is ta legislate. One cannot canclude
frorn anything that the court has said or
from its reasons for judgment that it was in
any sense legislating. It was taterpnettag the
section as it existed in the law at that time.
I would also point out ta my friend that It
ia one thing ta say that the consideration
that a prospector receives for mining dlaims
he may have staked is excluded as a matter
of law from his incarne, and then to go thxe
further step and say that that exemption

SENATE DEBATES
should extend to the exclusion of royalties
payable and based on production from that
property. You might use the same kind of
argument in saying that if the prospector
receives shares from a company which
acquires those claims from him, the dividends payable on those shares should at some
future time also come within the exemption
because the dividends, as the royalties, result from the operation and production of the
property.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: It might not be a bad
idea if it were part of the capital consideration.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: First of all we are not
discussing what is a good idea or what is
not. What we are discussing is the law, and
the law as Parliament thinks it should be,
and since the Supreme Court of Canada has
determined that within the language presently used in the section of the Act, the rent
and royalties element received by a prospector is exempt from income. Parliament is
now saying that it was never intended that
this should be so because rent and royalty
partake of the character of income from the
operation of the property, and therefore that
is not the kind of consideration we were
exempting.
I think most of the questions my friend
Senator Pearson asked can be dealt with in
committee. As to what is a structure and
what is a building, I am sure if Senator
Pearson were asked that question he could
answer it himself. I suppose a bridge might
be a structure, especially if there was a tollgate beside it. I suppose a radio tower might
be a structure, and it might be a business
and income might be received from it; and
if one did landscaping in the area, it would
be a cost deductible from the income received
from the operation of the business or from
the tower or from the building.
On the other questions as to how far landscaping goes, and to what extent the cost of
installing tile drainage would be allowable,
those are all items in respect of which I
expect there will be regulations laid down
in accordance with the usual practice of the
Income Tax Department, and there will be
definitions which will bring about uniformity
in the interpretation and application of these
provisions throughout the whole taxation
system across Canada.
Now I come to the points raised by Senator Flynn, who never disappoints me. I was
interested today when he said that we were

June 29. 1965

really granting a monopoly to Time and ta
Reader's Digest in doing what we have done,
and that as a result of what is proposed at
the present time the last state of Canadian
periodicals is going to be worse than the
present state.
I was curious, and I went back and read
again what the former Prime Minister of
Canada said on this subject in January 1962,
when, if I am not mistaken, my friend was
a member of that Government. It seems on
that occasion that the Government proposed in
relation to magazines of the character of Time
and Reader's Digest to allow 50 per cent of the
cost of advertising in those magazines as a
deductible item. I would then expect that the
vigour with which my friend opposed that
suggestion at that time could be measured
in terms of being 50 per cent as vigorous as
the vigour he put into his presentation today when the disallowance is 100 per cent
of the cost of the advertising. It becomes a
matter of whether you subscribe to the principle, as even the former Prime Minister of
Canada did, that if you have a business that
is established in Canada and is carrying on
an operation in Canada and has done so for
some time, you are then going to change the
ground rules to such an extent that that
business may be put on terms under which
it would have difficulty in carrying on such
business in Canada. That is the principle.
You must decide whether the situation in
relation to those periodicals is such, and the
financial position of those periodicals in
Canada is such, that we must prevent all
competition to the Canadian periodicals. I
am not prepared to accept that, but when we
are in committee we can ask the questions
and see what lies behind it.
After a business comes into Canada, takes
on a Canadian operation and invests money
in Canada, pays its corporate income tax
when it makes a profit in Canada, and pays
withholding tax on dividends when they go
out of Canada as a result of a successful
operation, I say it is a bad principle to
create abroad the atmosphere that at any
moment when it suits our purpose or the
view of those who have authority to do it,
we can change the ground rules. It is bad to
earn a reputation for having that kind of
uncertain atmosphere in business in Canada
and that uncertain approach by Government
to business. I think even the previous Government recognized that in relation to the Broadcasting Act, because at the time that Act

June 29, 1965

DEBATES

came into force there were a number of radio
stations in Canada that were not Canadian
owned, and some of them were not subject
to the statute at the time it came into force
because they had a licence. But when they
had to appiy for renewal of that licence they
became subject to the Act, and on renewal
they were granted by order in council unde-r
the provisions of the statute an exemption
from having to meet the citizenship requirements.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? The O'Leary Commission,
we understood, was set up more or less for
the guidance of the Government in connection with what is being done now with
regard to magazines. Perhaps it was not
primarily for that purpose, but that was
one of the matters which were to be given
serious consideration. I would like to hear
'the honourable senator's comment on that.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not; appreciate your
question.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: You were stating that a
few years ago certain action was taken.
Subsequent to that there was a commission
set up to make a study, which we understood
was more or less for guidance of the Government in matters of this kind. Instead of an
improvement; being made, the opinion is that
matters are worse as far as Time magazine
and Reader's Digest are concerned. I arn just
asking the honourable senator if the O'Leary
Commission recommendations were taken
into consideration at ail in this matter.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Weil, as my friend
knows, the scope of the inquiry of the
O'Leary Commission was to investigate
every aspect of the Canadian periodical publishing industry, with a view to ensuring
its place in Canada's way of life. In due
course there was made a report contalning
a number of recommendations, which I discussed last night. The Government that had
the first opportunity to deal with those
recommendations was the previous one, of
which I believe the leader opposite was a
member.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Not at that time.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Were you not?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: At one time, yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. And the crystaflization of the recommendations of the O'Leary
Commission at that time was that certain
magazines were prohibited entry under
Schedule C. But the recomniendations that
22624-20

the cost of advertising by a Canadian in nonCanadian periodîcals should be disallowed 100
per cent was not accepted by the Goverinent
of the day in 1962, for reasons which were
given and which I stated last night and again
today. And that recomniendation is not; being
accepted in the present legisiation.
This becomes a matter of Government
policy. It becomes a matter of weighmng the
pros and cons of ail the things a government
must look at when it is settling policy that
may have a serious effect upon the business
reputation and the stability of government
and business and the approach of government
to business in Canada. These are ail factors.
As a resuit, we have polîcy. The policy in this
case is reflected in titis bill. In other words,
if you have been conducting your business
in Canada, no matter whether you be wealthy
or not so wealthy, and you are doing a good
job and are paying your taxes, the question
then is: Should you be put at a disadvantage
of this kind and discriminated against? This
bill says "No."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Titis is exactly why I
put the question I did to the honourable senator. Could any other American or nonCanadian periodical which wanted to establish
itself in the saine manner as Time and
Reader's Digest in the future, benefit by the
treatment afforded those periodicals by titis
legisiation?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is the point I was
trying to make, that you are creating a
monopoly.
Hon. Mr. Hlayden: The answer is that any
publisher who wants to come into Canada
is on notice as to what the state of the law
is in Canada. My friend Senator Grosart was
complaining bitterly a few minutes ago about
retroactivity in connection with clause 19.
Cannot we get together on it, or is retroactivity the kind of thing that is sometimes
good and sometimes bad, depending on what
proposition you are supporting or criticizing?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am not discussing that.
I hope the honourable senator realizes that
by this legisiation Time and Reader's Digest
have acquired a status which will make it
impossible for any other non-Canadian periodical to compete with them. Therefore, this
is a monopoly. It is in that sense that I used
the word "monopoly."
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not agree with my
friend that as a resuit of this legisiation they
are acquiring this status.

SENATE DEBATES

The Act has been of great value to the
children it was designed to serve, and in the
past eleven years a goodly number of children
received university education as the result of
this legislation.
I sum up by indicating that this is the kind
of bill that appeals to the Senate, in that
moneys are used for a worthwhile purpose
and paid to those who are most deserving and
in respect of whom, no matter how much we
spend, we cannot compensate for their
sacrifice.
I ask honourable senators to approve this
bill without sending it to committee. I do not
expect to be able to answer all questions, but
I have had enough documents sent to me with
respect to this bill to enable me to at least
try.

Hon. Mr. Croll: That is a calculation of
what a pension would be worth to one who
is under 21 years of age under the Pension
Act.
Hon. Mr.

Perhaps the most comprehensive statement

SENATE DEBATES
ever placed on the record about this nongovernmental agency was by the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Brooks)
when he spoke to a similar measure to the
one we have before us, in 1961. I would
refer aH senators interested in the detail of
the organization of the Army Benevolent
Fund to that statement.
To return to the bill before us, I might
summarize its significance in this way. The
Act, as passed in 1947, set an interest rate
of 2j per cent for the funds on deposit with
the Receiver General of Canada. This was
amended in 1952, when the rate of interest
paid was increased to 3j per cent on the first
$5 million, and remained at 2j per cent on
the balance.
The next amendment was in 1961. On that
occasion the interest rate was raised to 4 per
cent on the first $5 million and to 3 per cent
on the balance. The bill before us proposes a
further increase in the rate of interest paid
by the Government for the use of these funds
to 4a per cent. This rate is to apply for a
period of five years. At the end of the fiveyear period following the coming into force
of this Act, the rate will be automatically
reviewed and set by the Governor in Council
for a further five-year period at the effective
interest rate on long-term Government of
Canada bonds. This quinquennial adjustment
in the interest rate is to take place automatically for the life of the fund.
Perhaps some information about disbursement under the fund would be of interest.
The balance at March 31, 1965 stood at
$5,552,028. The number of recipients of assistance in the fiscal year 1964-65 totalled 3,085.
Payments under the fund have been larger
than expected, and the average annual outlay
over the last 10 years has been $520,000. The
net outlay in 1964-65 was $451,544.
The fund is probably in its peak years of
activity, and undoubtedly the next decade
will witness a decline resulting from a decline
in the number eligible for assistance.
The new rate of interest will provide an
additional $34,000 per year in revenue for
the fund and this, of course, will be a benefit
to all our veterans receiving assistance under
this program.
One final note. The Government, in addition to paying interest on these moneys,
makes a grant to assist in defraying the cost
of the administration of the Army Benevolent
Fund. The value of this annual grant is
presently $18,000.
Honourable senators will note that this is
something which comes not from the Govern-

June 29, 1965

ment, but rather from the army itself. It is
an accumulation of funds from canteens,
which funds are in the hands of the Government, and for that consideration, naturally
they are paying interest on it.
If there are any questions, I shal be only
too pleased to answer them now.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, it
is unnecessary for me to make any extended
remarks on this bill.
First, I wish to congratulate the sponsor
(Hon. Mr. Baird) on his explanation of the
bill, and also to thank him for the compliment he paid me as sponsor of the similar
bill which came before us a few years ago.
Frankly, I wish I had before me the remarks
I made at that time, which would make my
task easier at the present time.
The subject matter of this bill is well
known to all veterans, as well as to others.
The Act was passed in 1947. The fund has
given tremendous help to many thousands of
veterans all across Canada. It provides
assistance to veterans who do not receive
help from other funds, such as pensions, or
the War Veterans Allowance, although at
times the fund supplements both.
In many cases a veteran who has sickness,
or whose family suffers distress of some kind,
appeals to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Often it is found that such veterans
cannot be helped by a pension because they
are not pensioners, or that the War Veterans
Allowance is not available to them. In many
cases they are helped by this fund which,
as the sponsor (Hon. Mr. Baird) pointed out,
does not cost the Government anything. The
fund was made up from receipts from canteens during World War IL. The Canadian
Legion contributed to the fund, as did the
Knights of Columbus, the Salvation Army,
and similar organizations.
The interest rate on the fund has been
substantially increased. At first it was 2j per
cent, which the Government paid; then it
was 4 per cent up to $5 million and 3j per
cent on the balance.
The fund, which originally stood at $9 millon odd, is now approximately $5 million,
and the Government has guaranteed to pay
4a per cent. That is the situation today. This
fund is expected to last, I understand, for
30 years, and it will continue to help our
veterans.
Perhaps honourable senators would be interested to know some of the ways in which
the Army Benevolent Fund has helped individuals. I obtained a report on the Army

Benevolent Fund, giving some examples.
When I was Minister of Veterans Affairs I
used to corne in contact wlth rnany sirnilar
cases. This report af the activities of the
Arrny Benevolent Fund is best told lIn terms
of the people it has helped.
The widow of a veteran who died in 1959,
and two of her children who were emotionally disturbed required financial assistance.
A grant from the fund was used to permit
the widow and children to return to her home
town in Nova Scotia and to establish a new
residence. A veterans organization assisted
ini findlng part-time work for her.
A 61-year-old veteran who was forced to
give up construction work due to il1 health
was helped. His wife hàd previously been
employed in a small confectionery store
which was up for sale. A grant was made to
assist in tis purchase. The store is being
operated by the wif e and it is expected that,
if the veteran's health improves, he can engage in part-Urne employrnent to supplement
the fainily income.
The eldest of five children of a War Veterans Allowance recipient was an honour
student. The fund made arrangements under
which the student aid facilities of a leading
university would be made available to permit
this student to enter university in the fail af
1964. The Army Benevolent Fund made a
grant to provide transportation expense.
A 47-year-ald veteran lost his wife through
terminal iliness. The plan of assistance arranged by the fund included a part-tirne
housekeeper to look aiter the five surviving
chlldren, settiement of the medical and funerai debt, and transportation expenses for
the veteran's mother to move from British
Columbia to Ontario to care for the children.
Those are some samples of the work which
this fund is undertaking and which is of
immense help to the needy.
Honourable senators, I entirely agree with
the sponsor af the bil <Hon. Mr. Baird) that
it J.s unnecessary ta refer this bil to a commlttee.
Han. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the sponsor
of the bill, who administers the fund and to
whom applications should be made for
assistance?
Hon. Mr. Baird: I thlnk I cavered that.
There are commnittees in many different

WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE ACT, 1952
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND PREADING

Hon. C. G. Power maved the second readimg of Bill C-127, ta arnend the War Veterans Allowance Act, 1952.
He said: Honourable senators, in speaking
to this bill I almost wish to make a plea ta
be made eligible under it, because at one
tirne it was known as the "worn-out veterans
bil."
I confess that I sponsored a similar bill
i the Commons back in 1930 and had the
pleasure of appearing before Senate comrnittees ta defend it in that year and in subsequent years. I had what was sometirnes
called a pleasure, but at other Urnes could be
cailed a trial, being subi ected ta severe
questioning by such veteran watchdogs of
the Treasury as the Honourable Arthur
Meighen on one side and the Honourable
Senator Dandurand on the other. Ail I can
say now is that if this bull got through the
Senate in 1930, having been subjected ta
the kind of criticisrn it got here in those
days, it must have been pretty sound legislation.
It was intended originally ta pravide for
allowances ta servicernen who had served
overseas in an active theatre of war, but
who, because there was no ostensible indication of a disabiity which they had suffered
on accaunt af their service or attributable ta
their service, were not pensianable or, if
pensionable, received only a small pension.
It was felt that it could be assurned that the
hardship, the strain af service in the trenches
-and, I repeat, in the front line-would be
such as ta have affected the mental and
physical capacity of these men. If they had
reached the age of 65 and were consldered
ta be unemployable an account of tis assurned incapacity, they were entled ta the

SENATE DEBATES
provisions of the War Veterans Allowance.
Since that time the act has been altered
almost beyond recognition. Frankly, I am
not responsible for many of the alterations
and do not take any responsibility for them.
It now embraces a large number of people
who would not have been qualified when the
Act was passed originally.
At the present time there are 84,000 veterans, widows and orphans who are recipients under the legislation, and the cost of
allowances is approximately $91,500,000.
To the best of my recollection-and I am
not entirely clear about this-at the time
the bill was introduced it was felt that it
would reach the peak of expenditure some
time in 1949. Of course at that time there
was only one war to take into consideration-there were no Second World War veterans. The amount that it was presumed
would be involved in 1949 was a great deal
less than this $91 million.
The bill provides for sanction by legislation of the increased benefits payable as War
Veterans Allowances under the Appropriation Act of December 1964. These changes
took effect on September 1, 1964, and they
are incorporated in this bill.
Apart from that there are some relatively
minor changes designed to improve the operation and administration of the Act. For instance, it is proposed that the maximum
equity in real property allowed a recipient
be increased from $9,000 to $10,000. I presume
that is to allow for the increased cost of
building a house since 1961, when $9,000 was
allowed.
It is proposed to extend service eligibility
to Canadians who served in the British and
Allied forces only in the United Kingdom on
the same basis as Canadians who served in
the Canadian forces. Under the present Act,
those people who saw service only in the
United Kingdom are eligible if they served
in the United Kingdom for a period of one
year prior to November 12, 1918. This makes
eligible Canadians who served in the Allied
forces and in the Imperial forces, but never
got beyond England.
There is certain eligibility for a widow if
she remarries. Of course she loses the War
Veterans Allowance, but should her husband
die within five years she can be replaced
on War Veterans Allowance.
There was in the Act-and I cannot remember just why-a provision whereby a
recipient of a War Veterans Allowance who
went to hospital was taxed $10 a month

June 29, 1965

or some such small amount. Because he was
hospitalized he was presumed to be maintained by the Government, and on that account they took away from his allowance an
amount of $10 a month. I am told that this
caused as much expense in the administration
and accounting that the department judged
it not worth while trying to collect.
For the same reason, under a certain section
of the Act veterans who were only temporarily unemployed could register with the
National Employment Service and if they
became employed they went off the War
Veterans Allowance Act. There have been
very few such cases, and at the present tirne
the departmental officers feel that it is not
worth while making provision for them. At
the moment, there are none at all.
There is wide discretion being given under
the present legislation to the War Veterans
Allowance Board with respect to widows of
war veterans. Under legislation before this
bill was introduced, if a veteran died within
a year after his marriage, the widow did not
receive the War Veterans Allowance unless
it could be shown that the veteran, at the time
he married, was in such a condition of health
as to justify his having a life expectancy of
at least one year. It bas been found difflicult
to apply this rule, and the board has asked
for discretion in dealing with such a case
with respect to the life expectancy of a person who marries. Under this bill the board
may in its discretion award the Veterans
Allowance to the widow.
I think that covers all the clauses in the
bill to which reference is necessary. There is,
however, one clause that frankly I do not
understand, and I hope I do not have to explain it. It deals with Canadians who served
in the Imperial forces or in Allied services in
England. In order to qualify under legislation existing for the last five or six years,
they must have served 365 days in England
prior to November 12, 1918. Now for some
reason these people are being allowed to
count as part of the 365 days the period
from the date of their embarkation in Canada
and, if they returned to Canada, the period
from the date of their embarkation in England for their return. I cannot say I know
the reason for this, but I am sure that this
clause, including the 10 days' travelling time,
would apply to only a small number of
persons.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I apologize for interrupting the honourable senator, but I do so to
mention that it bas been found in a number

June 29, 1965

June29, 965SENATE
DEBATES

of cases that veterans were three or four
days short of the 365 required under the original Act, and the Legion and other veterans'
organizations have been quite insistent that
the time spent sailing should be included. 1
think there were a number of ships involved
with sorne thousands of rnen on board, and by
including the tirne spent i sailing this would
allow a number of men to qualify who otherwise would flot do so.
Hon. Mr. Power: I arn sure the officers of
the department will thank my honourable
friend for defending them against my criticism. I accept his contribution in support
of that particular clause.
Han. Mr. Brooks: I think I was explaining
it rather than supporting it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): If they
came from Vancouver, could they include the
time spent on the train?

would say it meant on ship, but I arn not
sure.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: You can also embark on a
venture.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators,
we are indeed fortunate to have in the Senate two former ministers of Veterans Affairs.
The honourabie senator who introduced the
bill has been known over the years as one
of the very best friends of veterans in
Canada.
In my opinion this bill is one of the pillars
of the Veterans' Charter. I amn sure every
honourable senator has encountered cases in
bis own vicinity where the benefits payable
under this Act have been of the greatest possible assistance to the veteran and his dependents.
Throughout the years since the First World
War, frorn the time when we first had a
departrnent dealing with veterans' affairs, it
has been the practice and custorn in both
houses that members of ail parties have
worked together to promote and improve legisiation concerning the welfare of the veteran
and his dependents.
This bill, as explained by honourable Senator Power, covers a number of arnendrnents
and changes in the Act. He has covered practically ail of thern. Certain new and varied
definitions are included. There is a schedule

to the Act showing the new ailowances and
their ceilings. As he pointed out, these ailowances were increased hast fail. There is now a
provision dealing with payments where both
husband and wife are veterans. Another
arnendment increases from. $9,000 ta $10,000
the exemption of the value the veteran's residence for the purpose of determining incorne
under this Act. This is reasonable when one
considers the increase i the value of houses
and real estate each year. There is also provision for payrnent of allowances to the veteran and dependents whle the veteran is ini
an institution, and new discretions are given
to the War Veterans Aflowance Board. Generally, when a discretion is given to a minister there are many complaints, but I know
that nobody wilh complain because of the
discretion given to the Board. There is yet a
further amendrnent extending the ellgibllity
o! people who are to benefit by the Act, and
I do not think anybody wiil object ta that.
I have considered this bull very carefuhll
and in my view ahl the changes and arnend.
ments are for the benefit of the veteran and
his dependents. We support the bull, and we
f eel that it will not be necessary to send it
to committee.
Hon. Malcolm Hollei: May I ask the sponsor o! the bill if by any chance these arnendments to the War Veterans Allowance Act
will give a better deal to the Newfoundland
Foresters. Though they served in England,
they do not get the same benefits under the
War Veterans Alhowance Act as do the foresters from the mainland. I arn going to fight
until they do, and for that reason I would
ask the sponsor if their position is to be inproved under this blill. They served in England for three or four years.
Hon. Mr. Power: 1 think they were enlisted
as civihians in the Imperial service. I do not
remember the narne of the particular act,
but I know there is legislation which covers
the payments to be made in such circuinstances. I do not think there is a war veterans
alhowance applicable to such persons. Perhaps
my honourable friend Senator Brooks knows
the particular legislation I have in mind. These
are what one rnight cail semi-civilians; they
were not actuahly in the armed services but
were enlisted to do forestry work.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: But the distinction between the mainlland forestry workers and the
Newfoundhand forestry workers was simply
that you were able ta pay for uni!orrns for
yours, and we in Newfoundland could not
afford to pay for uniforins for ours. There-

SENATE DEBATESJue9.16
fore, they are flot eligible for the same
beneflts.
Hon. Mr. Power: Arn I right in thinking that
the Newfoundland Foresters had no connection
with the arrny whatever? I think they were
civilians and were enlisted by the Imperial
Governrnent.
Hon. Mr. Hollett: Yes, but they are Canadians now, I hope. What is the definition of a
Canadian at this particular point of time,
ini 1965?
Hon. Mr. Power: I arn under the impression that there is nothing in this bill that
covers them.
Honi. Mr. Hollet±: Would it not be a good
idea to insert a clause ini this bill to cover
these men? I know men who served as
foresters ini the First World War and who
today are as old as I arn and are incapacitated and get no recognition whatever.
Hon. Mr. Power: I arn sorry, but I do not
think that the Senate could insert any clause
in this bill which would involve more expenditure for the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I rather hesitate to get
into this controversy, but as the honourable
senator who sponsored the bill has said, the
Newfound'iand foresters who enlisted in the
Second Wrrld War were enlisted as workers
for the British Armiy. They were flot taken
actually into the British Army, but were
civilians taken to Great Britain and worked
there, mostly in Scotiand.
Hon. Mr. Hollett: Just like mainlanders.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: No. The Canadians ini
the First Worid War were soidiers as such.
Many of thern enlisted in the army, and because of low categories were taken into the
Forestry Corps, which was a branch of the
service like the Railway Corps and others.
These men you speak of were neyer in the
arrny as were the foresters in the First
World War. Many of thern served in France
and other areas.
Hon. Mr. Hollett: They were drafted.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes, but they did that
work because they were ini the army. Once
they did that, then, they would be ini the
army and would be looked after, but the
men who did not enlist would be civilians.
Senator Power referred to a certain act,
the narne of which I do not recali. The firefighters, nurses and others were flot i the
arrny. If they were wounded. by bornbing
or if they were hurt while serving, or if

June 29, 1965

anything of that kind happened to thern,
they carne under the act and they could get
a pension or a war veteran's aliowance. I do
not think the British made provision in that
way for these men you are speaking of.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: It is the duty of Canada
today to make provision, not Great Britaun,
not only for those serving ini the Second
Worid War but also for those who served
in the First World War. They are Canadians;
they were fighting for Great Britain and
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Power: I would not have qualified thern at any tirne, even if they were
Canadians and were in forestry.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The veterans' organizations usually recornrend people for consideration.
Hon. Mr. Holleli: In other words, a mainlander who enlisted in the arrny and went to
England and the war was over and he was
in Engiand a year before retunng to Canada,
is taken care of; but a Newfoundlander who
is now Canadian who enlisted ini the forestry,
went to England, spent a year or more there
and then carne back is not taken care of.
What is the difference?
Hon. Mr. Power: As I said earlier, 1 was
one of those who deliberately kept the foresters, Canadian and ail foresters, out of the
provisions of this Act because I did not think
the occupation of forester was such that
they suffered the strain and hardship o! those
serving in the trenches. This Act was originally intended to cover those who could be
assurned to have disabilities that were not
obvious but nevertheless were caused by
the hardship and strain of serving in the
trenches. I, for one, deliberately left out
Canadian foresters who served in the Jura
Mountains ini France and in the Pyrenees, but
those who, have been dealing with this matter subsecjuently have been bringing more
and more people in. I do not know why they
do not let ail the civilians ini, because the
persons rnentioned by rny honourabie friend
were civilians.
Hon. Mr. Hollei: And mainland foresters,
because they wore a uniform. were soldiers,
but Newfoundlanders who did not wear a uni..
f orm. but served in Great Britain like mainland foresters, do not corne under this Act.
I thunk it is time sorneone took notice of this
situation.

PRIVATE BILL
AETNA CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY
OF CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading
of Bill S-18, to incorporate Aetna Casualty
and Surety Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of Bill S-18 is to incorporate in Canada the
Aetna Casualty and Surety Company. The
American parent company has already been
doing business in Canada for 47 years. It now
wishes to incorporate a Canadian company for
the purpose of transacting business in Canada
in future.
The first directors of the new company will

be the promoters named in section 1. The
capital of the company is to be $5 million,
of which $1 million in capital and surplus
must be paid in before the company may
commence business.
The head office of the company will be in
Toronto, and by virtue of section 6 the company will be empowered to carry on business
in the fire, casualty and surety fields, but not,
of course, the business of a life insurance
company.

Honourable senators, if the bill receives
second reading, I shall move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, where the promoters of the
bill will be available to answer any questions
which may then arise.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

As it is a very simple and somewhat matterof-form bill, and as I am informed the committee will be having several meetings within

SENATE DEBATES
That the Senate do unite with the

Government in relation thereto, and to
report from time to time its observations

That a Message be sent to the House

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I move consideration of the
motion standing in my name.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, before this motion is disposed of I would
like to take a few moments to discuss it. I
do not propose at this time to go in any detail
into what has been proposed regarding the
work of this committee. We know the essence
of the resolution is that the committee will
consider the state of penitentiaries under
the control of the Government of Canada,
and the plans of the Government in relation
thereto.
This makes for a narrow term of reference. No doubt the committee will do most
useful work by giving the public an authoritative report on the present state or condition
of our penitentiaries, and also by reporting
whether the plans of the Government in
respect thereto are, in its view, adequate.
I understand that the terms of the resolution were drafted in a narrow sense because
a commission with very wide terms of reference has been appointed. This commission is
to examine and report on the whole correctional process from the very initial investigation of an offence through to the final discharge of a prisoner.
I have read some criticism of the appointment of this committee and, indeed, of Gov-

June 29, 1965

ernment plans for the building of new correctional institutions before the report of the
commission is made. Under normal circumstances it might be better not to build new
institutions until the report of the commission is received.
However, from what I have read-and my
reading has included some of the addresses
given by the Minister of Justice-the situation is such that delay cannot be permitted.
Some, if not all, of our penitentiaries are old,
and all are overcrowded. Indeed, the buildings as such are not now suitable, if ever
they were, as correctional institutions. Some
of them were built in the days when the idea
was simply to punish the person who had
been convicted of some offence under the
Criminal Code. I dare say they were functional in those times and for that purpose;
but, I believe that society has long since
given up the idea that a person is sent to
a penitentiary only as a punishment. At
least, I hope we are more enlightened in our
thinking, and that we are now concerned
about a person who commits an offence
against society; that we are concerned about
him as a person, about his future, and about
his family, if he has one.
It is my hope that the committee will
interpret its terms of reference as widely as
possible, and that it will discuss and hear
discussions on many aspects of our penal
system, even at the risk of duplicating some
of the work of the commissiop. Indeed, since
this committee will be reporting first I would
hope it would have some discussion with the
members of the commission because I feel
their views will be of value to the committee.
Honourable senators, anyone reading statistics regarding our prison population must
be concerned and alarmed. It is evident that
our prison population is too high in relation
to that of other countries. For example, it
has been stated that the Canadian prison
population rose from 22,747 in 1962 to 23,512
in 1963. In that same period Britain's prison
population dropped from 31,700 to 29,000,
and it must be remembered that the total
population of Britain is much larger than
ours. I do not know enough about the system
in Britain to understand whether this is a
good comparison, but in any event it causes
one to wonder why our prison population is
so high because, generally speaking, we are
a law-abiding people.
It may well be that our probation system
should be used to a larger extent. I appreciate the fact that there is, for various rea-

June 29. 1965

June29. 965SENATE
DEBATES

sons, a shortage of qualiýfled probation officers,
but surely this can be overcome. I should say
here that I happen to have some knowledge
of the work done by these people, and it is
a useful and very valuabie work. Probation
officers are doing difficult work with patience,
understanding and ability.
We know too that the Parole Board is
working well in a sympathetic, yet reallstic,
manner, and is returning prisoners to society
as soon as there is a reasonabie indication
that they wrn flot return to crime. The board
is especiaily sympathetic to those who commit what niight be termed a casual crimepersons who have not offended before and
who are not crixninals in the sense that they
have foilowed a pattern of lawbreaking
over a period of time. However, we must
realize that while probation officers are and
the Parole Board are to be carnmended on
their work, our prison population is increasing.
I sometimes wonder if persons: are sent to
federai penitentiaries when a shorter term
in a municipal institution wouid suffice, provided there were sufficient such institutions
with facilities for the proper care, training
and empioyment of such persons. Indeed, I
have known of instances where a judge after
sending a convicted person to a federai penitentiary has mentioned that he would have
sent hirm to a municipal jal had he not feit
that such an institution was not; a proper
place for the convicted man.
Honourabie senators, we ail realize that the
sentencing of persons convicted of offences
is a camplex and difficult matter. Anyone
reading of sentences given in various parts
of Canada for the saine off ence must be
struck by the variation or inequalities of
the termns imposed. No doubt some offences
are regarded as more serious in some regions
of the country than ini others. It is to be
expected that samne judges wiil take a more
seriaus view of certain types of crime than
others, but it has occurred ta me that it is
perhaps time for us ta take a new look at
the administration of the criminal iaw in sa
far as the sentencing of persons canvicted of
indictabie offences is concerned.
In my view, it should nat be part of the
duty of a judge ta impose sentence upon a
convicted persan. After ail, the main responsibility of a judge in a criminal case is to
preside at the trial, ta ensure that there is
a fair trial according ta the ruies of evidence,
and to properly instruct the jury, or, in a
non-jury triai, to judge the evidence pre-

sented and to render a true verdict according
to that evidence. As a general rifle, before
their appointment as judges, iawyers receive
fia speciai training in this work. A judge,
upon his appointment ta the Bench, has had
no special training in the sentencing of persons to faderai penitentiaries.
1 put forward the suggestion that it might
weil be a better system if, after a person has
been found guilty, the sentence not be imposed by the trial judge, but that there be
a board constituted, not necessariiy composed
of either judges or iawyers, which wouid set
the sentence. Such a board wauid have ta
be set up on a regional basis, and perhaps
this type o! system might be difficuit ta put
inta affect. If it is tao difficuit ta put into
practice, then it is my opinion that something
elsa should be done in the near future.
I believe there should be an automatic review of ail sentences that impose a termn
in a federal penitentiary, and such a review
could be undertaken by boards set up in the
various provinces for the purpose. If it is
thought that that might not be the best way
of deaiing with the problem, then there
shouid at ieast be an autamatic review of
ail such sentences by the courts of appeai of
the provinces.
If this couid be done-if we couid take
away from judges the responsibility of inposing sentences, ieaving that duty ta another
tribunal-then I believe it wouid have the
effect of giving this matter a more uniform.
aspect across -the country, and of doîng away
with the inequalities and variations in sentences that we read about. We wouid hear
no more of cases in which a persan is sentenced ta a two-year term and another person
sentenced ta a ten-year termn for what is
apparently the same offence.
Of course, I quite understand that in some
of these cases perhaps special circumstances
are involved. However, I think it is time
for us ta take a new look at the administration o! aur criminal iaw in sa, far as the sentencing o! persons convicted, of indictable
offences is concerned.
Honourable senatars, I amn afraid I have
wandered far f romn the terms o! the resolution proposed. I will conclude by saying that
I believe the proposed comxnittee can render
a very useful and beneficial service, and
knowing at least that some members o! this
chamber will be on that cammittee, I arn sure
such service wifl be rendered.
Motion agreed ta.

SENATE DEBATES
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

Then Senate resumed from Thursday, June
3, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque,

seconded by Hon. Mr. Aird, for an address
in reply thereto.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, as previous speakers in this debate
have done, I congratulate the honourable
Senator Bourque and the honourable Senator
Aird for their very fine speeches as mover
and seconder of a motion for an Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. I
also congratulate all other honourable senators who, before me, participated in the debate.
Many things are mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne that are of great interest
to me, and about which I would like to
comment. However, some of them have
already been covered adequately by other
senators. I do not wish to go over the same
ground, although I do want to say that I
support all the legislation proposed in the
Speech from the Throne, and especially those
matters which I feel will be of particular
benefit to the people of my own province
of New Brunswick.
The proposed measures to assist family
farms will mean a great deal to New
Brunswick, where we have a large rural
population and where many family farms
have been abandoned because it was not
economically possible for them to carry on.
We hope that with the assistance the Government plans to give, this trend in New
Brunswick to abandon farms will cease.
Because fishing is one of the chief sources
of income of the people of my province, since
the Speech from the Throne was delivered
our people have been eagerly awaiting the
proposed measures regarding an expanded
National Fisheries Advisory Development program. One of the first measures to implement this program is the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act, which is Bill C-121, and
was so ably explained in this house last
Tuesday by Senator Connolly of Halifax
North. He referred very favourably to the
federal Minister of Fisheries, although on
reading his speceh I could not find that he
mentioned the minister by name.
I would like to say that in New Brunswick
we are happy and proud that Canada's Minister of Fisheries, the Honourable Hedard

June 29, 1965

Robichaud, comes from our province. The
name of Robichaud, a French Acadian name,
held by the Premier of our province, by the
honourable Minister of Fisheries of the federal Government, and by a Justice of our
Supreme Court, is a very well-known name
in New Brunswick and very highly regarded
there.
An article which appeared in one of our
provincial papers recently stated that the
Premier's family is descended from Charles
de la Tour, who was a Lieutenant Governor
of Acadia in the early days of the 17th
century. One of the most interesting and
romantic stories of early Canada is that of
Charles de la Tour and his brave and dauntless wife. I understand that our Premier
does not make any claim to this relationship,
but it would certainly be interesting if it is
true that our New Brunswick Premier is a
descendant of this family.
Before the Honourable Hedard Robichaud,
the federal Minister of Fisheries entered the
political arena, he was for some years a
most successful Director of Fisheries for our
province. Through the experience he gained
then he thoroughly understands the problems
of fishermen and has given special attention
to the needs of the small fishermen, which
include very many all along the east coast
of Canada who make their living in this
manner.
Honourable senators will be interested to
know that 80,000 Canadians fish for a living.
Although Senator Connolly (Halifax North)
told us that in 1963 the primary production
of fish was valued at $129 million, its commercial value now exceeds $200 million
annually. This places Canada's fisheries
among the most important in the world.
Canada ranks third in the world in fish
exports, and is surpassed only by Norway
and Japan. Two-thirds of the fish landed by
Canadian commercial fishermen are exported
to other countries, with the United States
being the biggest customer, but shipments to
Britain and European countries are increasing every year. With such a large proportion
of our fish harvest being exported, and thus
bringing much money to Canada, it is easy
to understand how important the fishing industry is to Canada's economy.
The policies of previous federal governments have given help to fishermen, but
most of that help went to larger operators
in the fish business. Since Mr. Robichaud
has been minister, he has stressed the great
need for help to the small operators as well,
as is shown by Bill C-121.

June 29, 1965

June29. 965SENATE
DEBATES

Many things are taking place in New
Brunswick which have been advocated by
the Minister of Fisheries, who is New Brunswick's representative in the Cabinet, and
have received his support at the ministerial
level, such as the deep-water harbour at
Belledune Point which, when completed, will
have a depth of 42 feet and will be able ta
accommodate the most modern deep-draft
bulk carriers. The port will provide initially
for handling about five million tons of cargo
per year. This tonnage will become available
as a resuit of the $200 million smelter and
industrial complex being constructed by the
Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation
and East Coast Smelting and Chemical Company Limited at the site. These two companies wiil share in the cost of the protective
work and the wharves.
Two weeks ago Dr. M. J. Boyle, President
of Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation, announced that, in addition to the $200
million complex already started, building
would also start immediately at Belledune
Point of a $20 million ammonia plant, which
will provide more work and more cargo to
be shipped from the new deep-water harbour.
Another project the Honourable Mr. Robichaud has supported is the construction of
the new Grand Manan Ferry and Terminais
at Black's Harbour and North Head, whicb
are greatly needed, since the transportation
in use at present is înadequate to accommodate the dwellers on the islands and even
more inadequate to accommodate the very
many tourists who every summer visit the
Canadian islands in the Bay of Fundy, especially since the Roosevelt-Campobello International Park was established on Campobello
Island in 1964.
The grant of $2J million towards the
construction of the Centeial Building in
Fredericton, the new Air Terininals at Moncton and Fredericton, the increase in the federai share for the construction of the TransCanada Higliway from. 50 per cent to 90 per
cent, the increase in assistance being provided
for the construction of slips, particularly
fishing vessels, the grant; to: the New Brunswick Researcli and Productivity Council of
$I* million towards the building of a laboratory and associated equipment, and the
approval of the federal Government to the
grant, through the Atlantic Development
Board, of $20 million to assist the Mactaquac
hydro project, are ail matters whicli the Honourable Mr. Robichaud bas been supporting
consistently and successfully. On~e of lis outstanding accomplishments as Minister of Fisli-

eries was the convening of the first FederalProvincial Conference on Fisheries in history,
which was lield i January 1964, and the
result of whidh is that a national development
program in fisheries is being implemented.
I agree with Senator Rattenbury when lie
said in his excellent speech in tliis debate
that New Brunswick needs power, adequate
transportation including roads, more teclinical training and greater support for bigler
education. There should be also more opportunity for retraining those whose jobs may
have become obsolete in this day of increasing automation.
Senator Rattenbury covered these matters
very tlioroughly and I will not repeat what
he has told you, except that I would like to
make it clear that I, too, support the Mactaquac hydro power project situated about 14
miles above Fredericton on the Saint John
River where the Mactaquac River, a modest
stream, flows into the Saint John. In the
language of the Maliseet Indians, Mactaquac
means "Big Branch," whicl is an appropriate
designation for this tributary of the beautiful
Saint John River. When completed, tlis
development will produce 504,000 kilowatts
of power from six units. Eacli of tlie six generators will bave a capacity of 84,000 kilowatts and the first two units are scheduled to
go on Uine in 1968. This immense development
will supply mucli of the power New Brunswick needs for full development of its resources.
In agreement witb both Senator Fournier
(Madawaska-Restigouche) and Senator Rattenbury, I am also very mucli in f avour
of the proposed corridor road across Maine
which will link New Brunswick and
the other Maritime Provinces with Quebec.
As so mucli passenger and freiglit traffic is
carried these days by cars and trucks, this
road, wbicli is many miles shorter than any
other road from the Maritimes to Quebec, will
diniinisli transportation. costs for freiglit and
wili increase the nuniber of tourists wlio
will visit the Maritimes. According to a spending formula developed by the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics, the value of tlie tourist
industry to New Brunswick for 1964 reaclied
over $58,573,000, and we certainly favour anytbing that wrnl increase this important industry. This corridor road wiil make the
Maritime Provinces more accessible to
tourists, particu]arly those from Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, the Prairie Provinces and
British Columbia, and it will also assist Maritime farmers and other producers to get their
goods to the markets of Quebec and Ontario

SENATE DEBATES
and the western provinces more quickly and
with less cost. It should also reduce the transportation costs on manufactured goods shipped
from those provinces to the Maritimes.
Honourable senators, I am following eagerly
the work of the Company of Young Canadians. For many years I worked with Canadian Girls in Training and with Girl Guides.
I have the greatest faith in our young people.
I find this project exciting beyond measure
and look for great things to come of it. In
the press I read that a member of the House
of Commons has suggested it might be a good
idea for Canada to organize a Company of
Older Canadians as well. Studies regarding
the fields of opportunities for Canadians who
have reached what is now considered the
normal retirement age but who are still
alert and active, have made the members of
the Senate Committee on Aging realize that
in Canada opportunities for retired older
citizens to do something useful are very
limited indeed. Perhaps a Company of Older
Canadians, whether called by that name or
some other, is one of the recommendations
that the Senate Committee on Aging might
consider including in its report, for there are
many worthwhile things such an older group,
with their knowledge and experience, might
do.
I cannot refrain from putting in a plea for
increased federal assistance for our universities. Our Maritime universities are almost
unable to cope with their financial problems.
I am sure you know that the fees charged
each student are far from enough to pay the
expenses of keeping a student at a university.
These problems are increased for New
Brunswick universities because of the number
of students attending our universities from
outside our province.
The present formula regarding federal
grants for higher education is based on the
per capita population of each province. The
amount assigned to a province under this
formula is divided among the universities in
the province according to the number of
full-time students in the universities in that
province. Our New Brunswick universities
have a large number of students from outside
Canada and from other provinces of Canada.
Although we strive for excellence and are
flattered that our universities are considered
good enough to attract outside students, under
the present formula for federal grants New
Brunswick universities are at a great disadvantage. For instance, under this formula,
for 1964-65 the national average paid to

June 29, 1965

universities per student is $241. The amount
paid per student in Newfoundland is $370.
In Ontario the amount paid per student is
$282, but in New Brunswick it is only $214
per student.
The Bladen Commission set up by the
Canadian Universities Foundation in March
1964, of which our colleague the honourable
Senator McCutcheon is a member, is studying
the financing of higher education in Canada
and is expected to report with recommendations in 1965. It is earnestly hoped in New
Brunswick that this commission will recommend some formula, setting policies for
the allocation of funds by governments for
higher education, that will result in a more
equitable allowance for higher education in
New Brunswick. If such a recommendation
is made by the Bladen Commission, we
sincerely hope it will be implemented by the
federal Government.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why is that distinction
made in the low allowance for New Brunswick students?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: University grants are
based on the per capita population, and that
determines how much each province will
get. That amount is divided among the
universities in each province, based on the
number of full-time university students. Because the number of university students in
New Brunswick is increased by many students
from outside the province, the amount for
each student is reduced. That is why we get
the lower amount.
I am sure it is unnecessary for me to tell
honourable senators that I am keenly interested in all the proposed measures which
have to do with social progress, such as the
Canadian Assistance Plan, the study to be
made regarding the price we in Canada pay
for drugs, the amendments to various acts
to improve the position of veterans and their
families, and several others.
Doubtless I will be speaking on a number
of these bills when they come before the
Senate and I will not refer to them further
today. Before closing, however, I want to
make reference to the paragraph in the Speech
from the Throne which states that arrangements are to be made to decide the issue of
capital punishment.
To me this is a most important issue. I had
the experience of sitting on the Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on this matter and which began its meetings in 1954 and continued into June 1956.

June 29, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

In that committee we heard many witnesses
who had close personal knowledge of the
degrading and demoralizing effect capital
punishment has, not only on the condemned
but also on many others who, because of the
positions they occupy, have to attend and
take part in executions. I had a reasonably
open mind on this subject when the committee started its hearings in February 1954.
Long before the committee finished its
hearings I had definitely decided that I could
not conscientiously support retention of capital punishment, and I still hold those views.
I do not intend to make a prolonged speech
at this time stating arguments on this subject,
but I do want to say that I for one was
convinced that no evidence was presented to
the committee which proved to my satisfaction that capital punishment is a deterrent
to crime.
I felt then and still feel it is morally wrong
for the state to take life just as it is morally
wrong for an individual to do so, and I also
believe that the motivation behind such punishment is not retribution for a crime but
is society's wish for revenge, which surely
is an outmoded and unchristian motive.
I am not convinced that there can be no
possibility of error in criminal cases involving
the death penalty, and I am very conscious
of the irrevocability of the death sentence.
Certainly, if this matter is debated in this
chamber I hope to enlarge on and add to
these reasons for my support of abolition of
the death penalty. Besides what I have said,
I want to draw one fact to the attention of
honourable senators.
The Joint Committee on Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries reported to
the House of Commons and the Senate on the
matter of capital punishment in June 1956,
but this report has never been debated in
either house. Very often when I have listened
to panel discussions or debates on this subject outside Parliament, I have heard reference
made to the report of the joint committee on
the matter of capital punishment and especially to the fact that the report recommended
the retention of capital punishment.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I am sure from these
discussions and debates that many people are
of the opinion that if this recommendation
was not unanimous it was supported by most
of the members of the committee. As a matter
of fact, at the meeting on June 21, 1956, when
a vote was taken regarding the committee's
stand on the matter of the retention of capital

punishment, only 17 of the 28 members were
present and although a majority of those
present voted for retention, the votes in favour
were a minority of the committee members.
I had not been aware that this important
matter was to be voted on by the committee
on that day, and it may be that some of the
11 members who were absent did not know
it either. However, a vote was taken of the
committee members present on the question:
Shall the committee recommend that capital
punishment be retained? And the committee
voted for retention by 10 to 7. A motion was
then made in committee that because so
many members were absent the absentees
should be polled on the question. The chairman considered this to be irregular, but a
vote was taken and this was negatived by a
10 to 7 vote of the committee members present.
It was suggested that the recorded divisions
be treated as secret, but the chairman held
that this would be irregular and contrary to
proper procedure unless the committee had
been authorized to hold secret proceedings.
I recall very vividly inquiring at that
time if a minority report by those who did
not favour retention could be made, and I
was told it was impossible to submit a minority report with a committee report. I
was quite new in the Senate at that time and
I did not know this myself. I now know that
this is in fact the situation. I was told that
if I felt strongly about this matter I would
have an opportunity to present my views
when the report was debated in the Senate.
However, as I said, the report has never been
debated in the Senate. The reason for this
may have been that the Government of the
day felt that the time was not opportune,
or that the Canadian public was not sufficiently informed on the matter for the introduction of any legislation.
However, even though the studies of the
joint committee and the report which contained some recommendations did not result
in a debate in either house, the joint committee served a valuable purpose because
the lengthy reports of the hearings which
appeared in the press aroused great interest
throughout the country and brought the matter
to the attention of the public. Actually, although I feel sure it was not set up for that
purpose, the committee proved to be an
exercise in public education on this important
matter.
I am making reference to this today because
I want to point out that after the joint committee had studied the subject of capital
punishment over a long period of time, not

SENATE DEBATESJne2,16
ail members of that committee, not even a
large majority of them, voted for retention of
the death penalty.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops),
debate adjourned.
VETERANS' LAND ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr.
White) informed the Senate that a message
had been received from the House of Commons with Bill C-128, to amend the Veterans'
Land Act.
Bill read first time.
Hon. John J. Connolly moved, with leave of
the Senate, that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for second reading at the
next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
On the notice of motion for adjournment:
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
I thînk it will be agreed on ail sides of the
house that we have had a very busy and f ruitfui afternoon. I arn very grateful to ail honourable senators for the help and co-operation

June 29, 1965

they have given at this particular stage of the
session. There is talk that the summer recess
may begin very soon, perhaps tomorrow. 1
do not think there is any likelihood that anything will happen tonight in the other place
to affect our position or that would make
it necessary for us to be here.
I now move, with leave, that when the
Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned
until tomorrow morning at il o'clock.
In making this motion I know there is a
certain rîsk involved because if they should
conclude their legisiation on the other side
it may be that they will endeavour to, have
Royal Assent. Nevertheless, we have to do
our own work, and we have a very important
committee meeting at eight o'clock this evening to consider the Income Tax Act. For that
reason and because of the information which
1 have been given, I feel it is appropriate
that we should now adjourn until tomorrow
morning at il o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: May I say that I entirely
agree with the honourable leader. I think the
course that he has suggested is appropriate
and I do flot see any reason why he should
apologize to, anyone.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
ila.m.

the Chair.
Prayers.
THE MINISTRY
SUGGESTED PORTFOLIO CHANGES

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
considered, I would like to make a suggestion
with all deference to the Prime Minister.
Owing to the fact that the office of Minister
of Justice is presently vacant, I suggest that
the Leader of the Government in the Senate,
the Honourable Senator John J. Connolly,
Q.C., be appointed Minister of Justice; and
that the present incumbent of the office of
Solicitor General be appointed to the Bench
or transferred to another department; and,
in order to equalize things, that Mr. Jean
Chrétien, M.P. for Saint-Maurice-Laflèche, a
very bright lawyer and an able man, be
appointed Solicitor General at the earliest
possible opportunity.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
the country might be better served if the
present Prime Minister should continue to
elect his Cabinet, and if the honourable senator should not have the power of making the
appointments he has suggested, especially in
respect of myself. I do appreciate the flattery
and the kindness which inspires his remarks.
I have felt from the beginning that the
office of Leader of the Government in the
Senate is very much a full-time job. I should
add that the administration of the office is
made possible only because of the cooperation I have had from all parts of this
chamber. But it is nice to have a man on the
team who thinks well of the fellow who is
trying to call the signals! I do appreciate
what Senator Pouliot has said.

HON. J. WESLEY STAMBAUGH
HON. NANCY HODGES
RETIREMENT FROM THE SENATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called
I think it is appropriate for me to refer to
the fact that since the Act making provision
for the retirement of members of the Senate
was passed by Parliament, two of our colleagues have taken advantage of its provisions and have retired. Both of them are
from western Canada.
The first of these senators to whom I
refer is the Honourable J. Wesley Stambaugh
of Alberta. Honourable Mr. Stambaugh was
the first senator to take advantage of the
legislation. He was a long-time advocate of
the retirement of senators. He advocated the
idea in this chamber many years ago, and
when the opportunity presented itself he
showed that he had the conviction not only
in theory but in fact.
I do not want to deal with a retirement as
a too-sad occasion. I think that any senator
who retires will be able to retire in dignity
after good service. This is particularly true
of the two senators to whom I shall refer
this morning.
Senator Stambaugh was born in the State
of Michigan, the son of a Methodist minister.
He came to Canada 60 years ago, and became
a successful farmer. He married and had
five children. He has been a colleague of
ours in the Senate for just over 15 years. I
can say without reservation that Senator
Stambaugh's service in this chamber has
been valuable indeed.
During his service in this house, Senator
Stambaugh was a direct, outspoken man.
He was most knowledgeable, particularly of
problems of western Canada, and more particularly of agriculture. Of course, be was
interested in other western problems and,
indeed, in national problems such as transport and communications which are so vital
to western development. He was extremely
well informed on the spectacular oil and gas
development which has taken place in western Canada since he came here.
Senator Stambaugh served on eight standing committees and on two very important
special committees, the Committee on Land
Use and the Joint Committee on the Canada
Pension Plan. Despite the fact that the Senate was not sitting when the latter committee was in session and that his health at that
time was not particularly good, he had such

SENATE DEBATES

a high sense of duty that he came to Ottawa
shortly after the New Year and remained
here, as did other members of that joint committee, during the entire winter until the
work of the joint committee concluded.
Senator Stambaugh is a man of great common sense and of high idealism. He is also,
as honourable senators know, a great outdoorsman. There are very few of the important lakes in western Quebec and eastern
Ontario which he does not know and where
he has not fished. He is a most enthusiastic
and skilled fisherman. Perhaps a good many
senators have been the beneficiary of some
of his catches.
Wes. Stambaugh was a respected, faithful,
popular and, indeed, beloved comrade in the
Senate. I must confess that when he came
to see me just before he left for his home
in Bruce, Alberta, I felt a deep sense of loss
in parting from him. He has given fine service
to his country, to his province, to his party.
He has earned the respect and gratitude of
all of us. I know that all honourable senators join in wishing him many happy years of
retirement.
Honourable senators, may I now speak of
the retirement of the Honourable Nancy
Hodges, who is the first lady to retire from
the Senate.
Nancy Hodges' name is a household word
in Victoria, and indeed throughout British
Columbia, as well as in national circles, especially within women's organizations.
Mrs. Hodges was at one time President of
the National Federation of Liberal Women
of Canada; she was President of the Business
and Professional Women's Club, and President of the Women's Canadian Club of Victoria.
Mrs. Hodges, like Mr. Stambaugh, was
born outside Canada. Born in England, she
came to Canada at an early age. She was a
journalist, and worked with her husband for
many years on the Victoria Daily Times.
Those of us who remember her speeches in
the Senate, and recall meeting here with her
on various occasions, will know what an
expert she was in the use of the English language for which she had a fine appreciation.
No doubt this talent was chiselled out of her
wide reading and the work that she did for
many years, not only as an active journalist
but also as a parliamentarian.
Senator Hodges was not unknown to politics. When she came to the Senate she had
already been successful in three out of five
elections for the British Columbia Legislature.
She had the unique distinction of being the

June 30, 1965

first woman to occupy, permanently, the chair
of the Speaker in a Commonwealth legislature.
Senator Hodges served in the Senate since
1953. She was a faithful and diligent senator,
not only in the chamber, but in the work of
some of our prominent committees. Unfortunately for her and for the Senate, her health
declined, and she was not able to carry out
the duties that attracted her early interest
in the work here.
I am sure that I express the hope of all
honourable senators that her retirement may
very soon bring better health to her.
To Senator Hodges, we owe a great debt
of gratitude for the fine and the elevated
character of public service she has rendered
to this country.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I concur fully with the remarks which
have just been made by the Leader of the
Government in the Senate. He has left little
for me to say about these distinguished
former senators and colleagues of ours. However, I wish to take this opportunity of
making a few personal observations.
Usually, when we pay tributes it is to the
memory of an honourable senator who has
passed to the Great Beyond. Today we are
paying tribute to two of our former senators
who are still in the land of the living, and
I think this is the proper time to say what
we think about them. It seems to me much
more appropriate than to wait until they have
passed away.
I note that the Leader of the Government
referred to these two former senators, who
have taken advantage of the Retirement of
Senators Bill, as the Honourable Wesley
Stambaugh and the Honourable Nancy
Hodges. We were told when this Act was
passed that any sen'ator who retired under it
would continue to be known as "the honourable" lady or gentleman, as the case may be.
I was particularly well acquainted with
Senator Stambaugh. He was a fellow fisherman friend and now that he has retired I wish
him good fishing for the rest of his natural
life.
It bas been said that he came to Canada
from the United States some 60 years ago.
He arrived in Canada in 1905 and was one
of the early pioneers in the district of Alberta
where he settled. I am not sure whether he
took up a homestead or not, but I know he
acquired land holdings and farmed successfully, and still does, in that great Province
of Alberta.

June 30, 1965

June30, 965SENATE
DEBATES

It niight be interesting to honourable senators to know that since he retired, and returned home, they have had wonderful rains
in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. Whether
his retirernent had anything to do with that
1 do flot know, but I arn willing to give hlm
ail the credit I can. He will be very happy
with the present crop situation in the Prairie
Provinces; it is a wonderful thing to see.
They have had some five, six or seven inches
of raja; the prospects -are for bumper crops,
and I amn sure that Wesley Stambaugh is
enjoying those prospects just as much as I am.
Senator Stambaugh has a delightful personality. He is a good companion and, as
I said before, a good fisherman. I hope that
he will have a long life, that he will have
good health and, as the Leader of the Goverament has said, will enjoy hi-s well-eairaed
leisure.
With regard to the Honourable Nancy
Hodges, I wish to say that she was a fine senator and she was and is a lovely lady. When
I say "lady" I mean a real lady in every
sense of the terrm. I enjoyed rny friendship
with her duriag the 12 or 13 years that she
was a member of the Senate. I know we will
sorely miss her.
One of the things in which she was deeply
interested was parlîameatary divorce. She
wanted to get rid of it, just as 1 did. Perhaps
honourable senators have forgotten that, after
having been unsuccessful ia 1938 and again
la 1955 ia trying to reform our divorce laws,
in 1956 1 took a different angle and brought
in a bill to amend the Exchequer Court Act,
giving the judges of that court the power to
deal with and decide in every respect divorce
applications or petitions which came from the
provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland.
I introduced the bll to amend the Exchequer Court Act on February 15, 1956; 1
rnade the speech on second readiag shortly
thereafter, and on March 6 the honourable
Senator Nancy Hodges rose la her place and
spoke as seconder of rny motion. She made an
excellent speech on that occasion. This measure was debated for some three and a haîf
months, and when it came to a vote we were
quite badly beatea. However, at the present
moment I woader if what we did ia 1956 has
not had some bearing on what has happeaed
since that time, for now we have a Commissioner, who is a judge of the Exchequer Court
of Canada, taking evidence. I arn hopeful that
Senator Hodges and I are entitled to take
sorne credit for that having takea place. At
any rate, we did our best to lay the grýound22624-211

work and I arn still hoping, and I think it
will corne about ia tirne, that these divorce
matters will be removed eatirely fromn the
Senate and will be considered in the Exchequer Court.
I certainly appreciated the help which was
given to me by Senator Hodges la coanection
with that bill. She kept up her interest, because every timne when she came back to the
Senate she would ask me, "When are you
going to introduce another bill to amead the
Exchequer Court Act?" I rerninded her that
I was instrumental in bringing a bill la 1938,
another la 1955, and still another in 1956,
and that I was a]most ready to throw in the
towel. However, she kept her interest up to
the present tîme.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We were always sure
of one vote frorn the Liberal side.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As I said before, the
Leader of the Goverament has left very littie
for me to say about these two honourable
colleagues who have retired from. the Senate.
I hope the honourable Mrs. Hodges' health
will improve, that she will live for maay
years to corne and that she will enjoy not
only health and happiness but her wellearned leisure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed frorn yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opeaiag of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Aird, for an address
la reply thereto.
Hon. Sydney J. Smith: Honourable senators,
I welcome this opportunity to speak very
briefly on the motion moving the reply to
the Speech from the Throne.
The debate on this motion has now been
under way for more than a month and maay
honourable senators have participated in it.
However, the lapse of time and the fact that
many speakers have preceded me does not
depreciate to any extent the warmth of rny
congratulations to the mover and seconder
of this motion. May I also at this time extend
my congratulations to my leader, the Honourable John J. Connolly, and to the Leader
of the Opposition, the Honourable Mr.
Brooks, and to His Honour Speaker Bourget.
Consideration of the Speech from the
Throae read by His Excellency the Governor
General at this session of Parliament, presents an opportunity which is quite unusual.

SENATE DEBATES
Most subjects discussed in the Throne Speech
to date have economic values to the people
of Canada. It might be that some items of
legislation would have greater value for the
poor and lesser for the rich. In other cases
our decisions on legislation might affect the
economy of underprivileged or developing
countries and do less for the more fortunate
countries and communities. But in all such
issues that I refer to as economic, our
judgment might prove faulty, but we do not
suffer pangs of conscience, as an error can
always be corrected later by an amendment.
But I must remind honourable senators
that the Speech which we are now considering contains a reference that demands a
degree of soul-searching that no economic
issue ever presents, because whatever action
we take does not affect the material welfare
of anyone-it is a matter of life and death.
The reference is:
Arrangements will be made for you
to decide the issue of capital punishment.
My Government will appoint a special
committee to study and make recommendations on a comprehensive policy
for the correction and rehabilitation of
prisoners.
I have tried to maintain an open mind
on the subject of abolition while studying the
issue. I wanted to consider both sides of
the question, and I am inspired to speak on
the subject at this time because I consider
that so far it has been largely a one-sided
debate.
At this point I wish to congratulate the
honourable senator for Fort Garry (Hon.
Mr. Yuzyk), who gave this subject exclusive
attention in a masterly manner during the
early stages of this debate. His treatment
of the subject reflected a very definite viewpoint which we might expect from the secretary of the Canadian Society for the
Abolition of the Death Penalty. I did look
forward to further light on the subject that
would help me to weigh up both sides of the
question before coming to a conclusion.
I attended the panel discussion recently
conducted by the Society for the Abolition of
the Death Penalty, but I found that it was
not actually a discussion but rather a presentation by a group of international leaders in
the campaign for abolition. Many of the
speakers were distinguished professional defence lawyers who have had long experience
in a great many murder trials. It is just
natural for such lawyers to have an abolitionist viewpoint. Likewise prosecution law-

June 30, 1965

yers would naturally lean towards retention
of the death penalty. I would like to hear
from a similar group of professional prosecutors, judges, and police officers whose
experience had been on the prosecution side
of murder trials.
The question of abolition of capital punishment is so important and so serious that it
deserves consideration of every viewpoint.
I have studied the subject sufficiently to
learn that there are very definite differences
of opinion, but I have also learned that
the supporters of abolition are so well organized that it is inviting people who have not
reached an opinion of their own to climb
onto the abolition bandwagon. Some think
that they would be looked on as a sort of
moron if they take a stand for retention.
I believe that a large majority of those
charged with either capital or non-capital
murder can be classified as mentally ill, sex
maniacs, perverts, etc. I think the basic cause
for people in these categories getting into
trouble is their inability to discipline themselves, and I believe that in our society
people who cannot discipline themselves must
be disciplined by the state. One of the major
functions of our judicial system is to fulfil
that responsibility. And may I remind honourable senators that there is little chance
of miscarriage of justice, due to the fact that
our judicial system is founded on the principle of giving the accused the benefit of the
doubt at all times and under all circumstances.
Built into our judicial system is a parole
and rehabilitation program. This is an area
in which I believe there is a serious weakness. The parole and rehabilitation program
encourages a type of sincere, but often overzealous, people and organizations that are influenced more by their hearts than their heads
to exert pressure for lighter sentences and
more lenient parole. Such persons and organizations show more concern for the comfort
and welfare of cold-blooded killers than they
do for the mothers, widows and children
of police officers and others who have been
their victims.
In addition to the kindly, well-meaning
people there is another class who are considered respectable citizens, who have developed a disregard for the whole system of law
and order in recent years. I suggest that
perhaps the increasing disregard for law
and order is to some extent due to the
increase in the number of citizens who are
coming in contact with the law through the

June 30, 1965

June30. 965SENATE
DEBATES

medium of parking tickets, speeding tickets,
charges for impaired driving, etc. It is a new
experience for increasing numbers of citizens
to be charged with infractions. Out of this
situation has developed a fellow-feeling between the so-called respectable citizen who
considers it excusable to break rules and regulations, if he can get away with it, and the
more hardened lawbreaker who is charged
with more serious crimes, such as robbery,
assault, and even murder. There was a time
when decent, respectable citizens feit duty
bound to go to the aid of a police officer who
called for their help, but it is quite a common
occurrence in this day and age for people to
refuse to assist police when called on to do so.
In fact it is considered smart today to avoid
being a witness or giving evidence that would
assist the prosecution of the law.
Disregard for law and order is closely
related to the campaign for easing up on
penalties and urging for parole in the name
of rehabilitation. To illustrate my point I
have here the officiai police files on two recent cases in British Columbia involving two
men who killed four police officers after being released or paroled. I now quote from
the file of George Booth, who lived in my
home town of Kamloops, in British Columbia.
The police report reads as follows:
In 1957 Booth, then 27 years of age,
was committed to a mental hospital. He
was released after 4 months treatmnent.
He worked as a labourer when jobs were
available. Otherwise he existed on social
assistance. On the morning of June 18,
1962 Booth was questioned by a conservation officer in relation to a rifle he
was carrying in Kamloops. Booth immediately raised the rifle and threatened
the officer. The matter was reported to
the RCMP and 3 constables-Pedersen,
Weisgerber and Keck-followed Booth in
an effort to talk him into laying down
his rifle. Booth took off and was pursued
by the police. Eventually Booth shot and
killed Pedersen and before his companions could take over he also shot
them. The 3 constables died immediately.
Booth ran off into a hilly wooded area
where he opened up fire on a party that
had been organized to locate him. Without warning Booth commenced firing at
members of the search party and was
fatally wounded in an exchange of gun..fire. These 3 young policemen left wid.ows and young children.

As there was no prosecution, this case is
not recorded in available tables showing
police officers killed while on duty.
The second police file is on Russell Spears,
and reads as follows:
Russell Spears had been known to the
police for criminal convictions from 1935
to 1962. The crimes committed by this
person were generally of a violent nature and included rape, aggravated assault, and committing an offence while
armed. After escaping custody in 1949
Spears lived for more than a month in
the woods and wounded a policeman
before being apprehended. In 1935 he
was sentenced to 18 months definite and
12 months indefinite with 5 strokes of the
strap. In 1937 he was paroled. In 1939
he was. sentenced to 10 years for rape
and released in 1946. In 1948 he wag
sentenced to 1 year at Penticton, B.C,
and escaped. In 1949 he was sentenced
to 2 years and was released on expiration of the sentence. In 1959 he was
charged with rape and contributing t,
juvenile delinquency and sentenced
years and released on expiration of to 3'
sentence. In 1962 he was charged with rape
and common assault. Following his last
jail sentence he was living in a shack
near Kelowna, B.C. Constable N. M.
Bruce of the RCMP, Kelowna detachment, went to Spears', cabin on April
lOth, 1965 to investigate a complaînt and
on approaching the cabin, Bruce was immediately shot by Spears. He died 4
days later as a resuit of the bullet wound
through his right lung. Spears escaped
and following a 9 day hunt his trail was
followed by a police service dog that
knocked him to the ground and when'
he was ordered to surrender he turned
the gun on himself and committed suicide.
This is another case in which no prosecution will take place and it is apparently too
recent to be found in the records of policemen murdered while on duty.
The Ottawa Journal of May 8, 1965, lin
referring to this matter, said:
At the recent funeral of a mounte&
policeman at Kamloops, B.*C., were his
widow and the widows of three other
young Mounties who had also been killed'
on duty. Too easily we forget how
dangerous police work can be when saývage men are being hunted.

SENATE DEBATES

I happen to know of these two cases; that
is why I have cited them. I know the circumstances and I knew these young widows when
they were school girls in Kamloops. They
would not be widows now if parole from
prison and release from mental institutions
were not so lax. Too many killers have been
allowed to become repeaters.
According to Norman Campbell, writing in
the Ottawa Citizen of June 24, last, there
were 21 police officers murdered in Canada
in the past 25 years. Mr. Campbell's authority for these figures is the White Paper just
issued by the Department of Justice entitled,
"Capital Punishment-Material Relating to
its Purpose and Value." That is the White
Paper which I think has reached the hands
of every Member of Parliament in both
houses. I am sure that honourable senators
have received this book, and I refer you to
Table F on page 105. This table is entitled,
"Capital cases in which policemen were victims in course of duty January lst, 1940 to
May 25th, 1965." This table contains 21
names, but it does not tell the whole story.
It refers only to cases in which the killers
of the policemen were tried on capital murder
charges.
In addition to this list of 21 police officers
who were murdered, Table G on page 106
of the same booklet lists 11, what they term,
"Reported Cases" in which 14 police officers
were killed in a period of less than 20 months.
That period is so short because, as is explained by way of a note on Table G:
Information on this comprehensive and
detailed basis is not available for previous years.
I know there were a great many more
police officers killed in cases where there
was no prosecution. The Booth and Spears
cases I have referred to accounted for the
killing of four police officers, and nobody
was brought to trial because in one case the
suspect was shot in an exchange of gunfire,
while the other committed suicide before
being taken.
There is another table on page 108, of this
White Paper which reports the killing of
four prison guards, bringing the total of
police and guard killings disclosed in this
report to 39. If we add to this figure the
number of unprosecuted cases for the same
25-year period I am sure that the total would
run well into three figures. The two cases I
happen to know about and referred to add
four to the number.
Honourable senators, I ask you, is it any
wonder that the Canadian Association of

June 30, 1965

Chiefs of Police make the recommendations
that we find in Part 2 on page 12 of this
Department of Justice White Paper? This
paper bas been placed in the hands of each
member of both houses, and I sincerely
recommend it for your reading and study.
It is not biased; it is designed to give the unbiased facts; and it gives you a pretty good
chance to size up both sides of this serious
problem.
Before closing, I would like to refer just
briefly to three claims that are commonly
made. It has been claimed that capital punishment is unchristianlike. It has been
claimed that capital punishment is being
abolished in most countries and states. And
it has been claimed that capital punishment
is not a deterrent to crime.
I find it difficult to agree with the argument
that capital punishment is unchristianlike, for
the reason that it is common practice to support conflicting views by conflicting Biblical
quotations.
I am not going to bore honourable senators
with a lot of supporting evidence on that line,
but I want to refer to a news item which I
have no doubt came to the attention of many
honourable senators, because it appeared
recently in the local press. It is a Canadian
Press despatch under the date line of Windsor,
Ontario, June 12. I will not read it in full,
but it reports a resolution passed by a group
of 35 ministers of the gospel, which they
wired to the Prime Minister, in which they
called for the retention of the death penalty
for murder. They said:
We have taken this action with the
guidance of the Bible. In Genesis, chapter
nine, verse five, it says: "Whoso sheddeth
man's blood by man shall his blood be
shed." That is the basis of our belief for
this particular action.
Those are the words of the organization of
35 ministers.
There is also supporting evidence along this
line in a book I received yesterday, as I am
sure most of you did. It was a report of a
radio talk by someone from Toronto speaking
on behalf of the British-Israel Society in
which many quotations from the Bible were
used in support of that argument.
I find it difficult to believe that abolition
is as general as it is claimed to be, because
champions of abolition refer to abolition and
non-abolition countries and states. I find that
these two terms are often used very loosely
in newspaper reports. The Ottawa Journal
carried a news story on May 8 last from the

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

State Capitol of Vermont and under the positive heading, "Abolish Capital Punishment,"
whereas the fine print reads:
Under the legislation, death by the
electric chair is abolished in most cases.
Juries, however, could call for the extreme penalty if the defendant is convicted for a second time on a case not
related to the first conviction, and when
the person killed is a policeman or prison
guard on duty.
A few days ago there was a similar despatch from Albany, New York, announcing
the signing by Governor Rockefeller of a
state bill abolishing capital punishment. And,
as in the case of the Vermont despatch, when
you read the fine print you find there were
similar exceptions made retaining the death
penalty in cases where a policeman is killed
when on duty or when a life convict commits
a killing in prison or while trying to escape.
These are only two recent cases that indicate
the term "abolition" is not to be taken too
seriously. In other words, "abolition" sometimes means modified legislation wherein
capital punishment is retained in certain
extreme cases.
I also find it difficult to believe that capital
punishment is not a deterrent to crime. Those
who claim that it is not a deterrent are
jumping to a hypothetical conclusion which
they cannot support with any concrete evidence. There is just as good ground for those
who say it is a deterrent as for those who
say it is not.
In conclusion, I must say that after very
serious and exhaustive study of this subject
I have come to the conclusion that I cannot
give my support to the abolition of capital
punishment, unless some exceptions are provided which would retain the death penalty
for those convicted of capital murder of police
officers or prison guards while on duty, and
an assurance that much greater care would
be exercised in granting parole to those who
have been convicted of capital or non-capital
murder.
Motion agreed to, and the address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne adopted.

PRIVATE BILL
GENERAL MORTGAGE SERVICE CORPORATION
OF CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved the second
reading of Bill S-17, respecting General Mortgage Service Corporation of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, my explanation of this bill can be very brief. Its main
purpose is to change the name in English of
the company. The company was incorporated
several years ago by Act of Parliament under
the name of General Mortgage Service Corporation of Canada. The word "Service" is
not now appropriate because it suggests a
company of the character of a mortgage
broker, whereas the company is a direct
lender on first mortgages, and it now desires
to drop the word "Service" from its title in
English. The French name of the company
never contained the word "Service", and
therefore that name remains the same.
Clause 1 of the bill changes the name in
English. Clause 2 gives the company power
to carry on business under either the name
in English, General Mortgage Corporation of
Canada, or the name in French, Société
Générale d'Hypothèque du Canada.
Clause 3 is the usual clause that preserves
the rights of creditors and others, notwithstanding the change in name.
Clause 4 changes the designations of the
bonds issued by the corporation. These bonds
have hitherto been called Series A Mortgage
Bonds and Series B Mortgage Bonds. The
word "mortgage" is dropped from the titles
of these bonds for the reason that in securities
circles, mortgage bonds are generally considered to be bonds secured directly by a
mortgage on real estate, whereas these bonds
are secured by a group of mortgages themselves. Consequently the titles "Series A
Bonds" and "Series B Bonds" are more appropriate designations.
This is my explanation of the bill, honourable senators, and if it receives second reading I shall move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Ordered that the

VETERANS' LAND ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. David A. Croll moved the second reading of Bill C-128, to amend the Veterans'
Land Act.
He said: Honourable senators, yesterday
was a particularly good day for the veterans
of Canada and for the Canadian people. This
house dealt with a bill to amend the Children
of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act, a
bill to amend the Army Benevolent Fund Act,
and a bill to amend the War Veterans Allowance Act, 1952. We now have before us a
bill to amend the Veterans' Land Act.
This is a very important bill containing
17 beneficial amendments, some of which are
very important. When this bill is compared
with the Soldier Settlement Act-which was
a comparable piece of legislation passed after
World War I-it will be realized how much
progress we have made.

June 30, 1965

June30, 965SENATE
DEBATES

Honourable senators, I think it is of interest
to know a little of the history of how this
Act came about. Immediately after the war
there were about 85 members of the House
of Commons who were veterans of World War
I or World War II, and one of the first things
we did was to establish a committee on veterans' affairs. Senator White was a member of
that committee, as were Senator Brooks, Senator Ross Macdonald and Senator Isnor. Senator Power was a member emeritus, of course,
and I was privileged also to be a member.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Do you
mean Doctor Power?
Hon. Mr. Crail: Yes, Doctor Power.
We had ail corne back fromn overseas to
Parliament determined to do something for
the men and women who had served overseas.
It should be said that as a resuit of the
activities of that group of veterans, as well as
others who were members of the Committee
on Veterans Affaira, there came about a great
public document known as the Veterans'
Charter.
On the floor af the house I supported the
Liberals, and others supported the Conservatives, but when we got into commlttee we
ail supported the veterans. I think the Veterans Affairs Committee was responsible for
givmng the Honourable Ian Mackenzie, who
was the minister at that time, and later the
Honourable Milton Gregg, the biggest uloers
any minister ever had, because we insisted,
"This must be done for the veterans." And, of
course, it was done.
We came back from World War II with the
thought in aur minds, "Well, neyer again."1 We
were flot thinking of "neyer again war," but
that neyer again would the veterans of this
country be treated as were the veterans after
World War I. When we finished drafting the
Veterans' Charter it was as good as any ini
existence any place ln the world, and much
better than most.
The Honourable Ian Mackenzie was an outstanding Minister of Veterans Affairs, and the
Honourable Milton Gregg and the present
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <Hon.
Mr. Brooks) belong to the same class. In ail
the years I was a member of the committeeand that was for all the time I was a member
of the House of Commons, as was Senator
White and the others I have mentionedwe fought very hard for the veterans. When
Senator Brooks had an opportunity to put
what he advocated into practice, lie did so. I
was reminded of that fact when the Leader of
the Government spoke today about the Han22624-22

ourable J. Wesley Stambaugh advocating the
retirement of senators at the age of 75. When
that provision was enacted, Senator Stambaugh did what lie had advocated.
We started then to build a different world
for the veterans and we are stiil at it. The
Veterans' Land Act, in my opinion, is one of
the prize pieces of legislation that came out of
the Veterans' Charter. I think ail honourable
senators wiil understand when I say that
one of the men who made the Act was Brigadier Rutherford.
Last year $45.5 million was loaned under
the Act, and the total amount loaned since its
inception is $614 million.
A total of 121,286 veterans have taken advantage of the Act. The percentage of repayment of debt is 96.9 per cent, and the percentage of instalment repayment is 99.4 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Quite a record!
Hon. Mr. Croil: And if you consider the
prepayrnents that were made, it represents
a collected amount of 102.7 per cent. In
1963-64 there were 9,475 farm applications
dealt with, and-3,632 smaflholders and fishermen were provided with additional loans.
The amendments corne frorn the study
made by the Committee on Veterans Affairs
in the other house, along with the experience
under the Act and the presentations that are
made by Legion branches and interested
bodies.
I have already lnd.icated how this Act came
into effect. It has been one of the most successful pieces of legislation. What they are
trying to do now is to serve veterans who are
already on the farms and smallholdings, ta
make available increased boans, and to update and introduce new and imaginative concepts of administration.
Most veterans like to deal with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and that in ltself
is a compliment. We are now bringing to the
Veterans' Land Act the same financlal provisions that we have under the federal Farmn
Credit Act. In this Act it la proposed ta increase the maximum amount for commercial
family boans from $20,000 to $40,000, and for
small family farms from $12,000 to $18,000. In
addition, subsequent loans may be made as
the principal indebtedness Is reduced, so long
as the debt remaining at any one time does
not exceed $40,000 for commercial family
farms and $18,000 for small family farms. It
is proposed ta increase the maximum financlal assistance for part-tlme farmers, that

SENATE DEBATES
is, smallholders, and for house construction
from $12,000 to $18,000.
There is a changing farm community, with
new sources of revenue developing largely
from tourist trade and summer recreation
trade. This financial help will assist to provide
small businesses which are not directly related to farming, and it is thought that about
20,000 will be eligible to take advantage of
this.
In addition, there is a revolving fund of
$380 million which will facilitate lending and
will be reviewed every five years.
Then there is a section which provides that
if a veteran has a bad crop or a serious illness
he may pay only the interest on his loan and
need not meet the repayments due under the
contract.
There is also provision to reduce the minimum amount of group life insurance to 50
per cent of the debt. Previously it was 100
per cent. There is also provision to permit a
veteran's spouse to be covered.
There is a time limit for general utilization
of the Act, so that the department can plan
the administration of it intelligently.
One section deals with consolidation of
debts. It permits consolidation of all previous
agreements into one agreement and provides
for repayment within a 30-year period.
In addition, there is no authority at the
present time to retire debts other than farm
debts, and this Act provides the right for
retirement because of permanent improvements. This will assist the smallholders and
the commercial fishermen.
I can only say of the Act that it speaks
very loudly for itself. It was highly commended in the other place. It comes from a
source that is well known to you. I hope that
this house will deal with it today and endorse
it without sending it to committee.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
agree entirely with what the sponsor of the
bill (Hon. Mr. Croîl) has said.
First, may I say what a pleasure it was
for me to be a member of the Veterans
Affairs Committee in the House of Commons,
and to be associated with Senator Croll,
Senator Ross Macdonald, Senator White, Senator Isnor, and the others who have been mentioned, particularly, of course, Senator Power,
who was one of the architects of the Veterans'
Charter.
The Veterans Affairs Committee was one
of the most active committees in the House
of Commons for quite a number of years
following World War II, and even before. The
Veterans' Charter was the product of that

June 30, 1965

committee, based largely on recommendations
which were made to it by veterans organizations across Canada. It is a thorough study
of the needs and requirements that were
necessary for veterans.
The Veterans' Charter laid the foundation
for these amendments we are now considering
and for those which were made in the past
and became part of the charter.
My honourable friend spoke about the
Soldier Settlement Board. When World War
I was over-the first great war in which
Canadians had ever taken part-it was
not possible to realize just what the requirements would be for the returned men. A
fair start was made, and unquestionably
we benefited after World War II from the
efforts that were made after World War I.
Last night I took the opportunity to review
this bill. It is lengthy and is well prepared.
May I commend the draftsmen of this legislation, particularly for the excellent explanatory notes they have provided for honourable senators. As I said a few days ago about
another bill, I think good explanatory notes
are a necessary part of drafting. The veterans
legislation has been well prepared and the
explanations in most of the bills are easily
understood. As I went through these explanations last night, and, having had considerable
experience in this respect, I found it very easy
to follow the various sections and to know
their purpose.
As the sponsor explained, this bill simply
brings the Veterans' Land Act up to date.
I was a little surprised to learn, either last
year or the year before when we were considering the Farm Credit Act, that the Veterans' Land Act was not considered at that
time, because many of the sections which are
in the Veterans' Land Act today corresponded
to those of the Farm Credit Act at that
time, such as the increase in the amount of
loans, the extensions of time, and other
assistance.
Losses sustained by the Government under
this measure have always been less than one
per cent at any time.
When I had the honour of being Minister
of Veterans Affairs, I visited many farms
across Canada and, almost without exception,
when I went into a community I would find
veterans who came under the Veterans' Land
Act, many of whom would be serving as heads
of farm organizations and other forms of
public organization.
I also wish to pay tribute to the man who
was undoubtedly the great architect of the
Veterans' Land Act, Brigadier Rutherford,

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

who organized the Veterans Farm Land Organization all across this country. Men were
trained under him or at schools, to go out
and appraise farms and advise farmers as to
what was the best buy in the matter of stock
or machinery.
When the Farm Loan Act was put on our
statute books these same men were borrowed
from the Veterans' Land Act Organization to
assist the general Farm Loan Act administration. They are the backbone not only of the
Veterans' Land Act today but also the backbone of the Farm Credit Act.
Honourable senators, it is not necessary to
review all of this. The bill runs to 15 pages
containing some 20 sections. The honourable
sponsor of the bill has reviewed them. They
simply bring up to date what was the Veterans' Charter and the amendments to it
since the first bill was passed. The bill mentions the revolving fund. The revolving fund
is in the Farm Credit Act. There is one good
phase of this new bill, namely, the creation
of discretion for the director in certain matters. Also there is the insurance scheme,
which the honourable sponsor mentioned.
We could mention many advantages which
are in both acts and which are helping our
veterans across the country in farming and
fishing by means of small loans.
I will not analyse this bill as it is not
necessary to do so. This bas been an excellent
Act and always well administered. We have
had good men dealing with it. We have had
the returned veterans themselves, the field
men. Brigadier Rutherford was himself a
returned man. I do not think there bas been
a better Act or better administration of an
Act. Indeed, this is one of the best on the
statute books of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: I should like to ask one
question. I wonder if the sponsor of the bill
could explain if there is a mistake on page 7,
in the explanatory notes regarding clause 7.
It says:
The purpose of this amendment is to
authorize the Director, with the approval
of a veteran, to enter into a group insurance contract insuring the spouse of that
veteran in an amount of not less than
fifty per cent of the indebtedness of the
DirectorShould that not be "the veterans"?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I think
it means "to the directors."
Hon. Mr. Croll: I think it is a mistake. I
wonder what Senator Brooks would say it
means.
22624-22à

Hon. Mr. Brooks: I would say it is a misprint.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is not
in the text of the bill; it is in the explanatory
note.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I remember immediately following the First
World War having had something to do with
the Soldier Settlement Board, which was set
up at that time to provide farms for veterans
of that war who wished to establish themselves on the land. Of course, that was our
first experience of that sort of thing, after the
First Great War. As I recall it, we ran intoconsiderable trouble in connection with the
settlement of soldiers upon the land and there.
were quite a large number of defaults.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Did not we try to makefarmers out of everybody? That was one ofr
the reasons for the defaults.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. And of course
when the depression came on we found that
a lot of men had assumed obligations they
could not possibly meet.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Not only veterans, but
people generally.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As a result of our experience after the first war we have done
much better after the second war under this
Veterans' Land Act, the amendment of which
we are considering today. That bas been
amply demonstrated by the figures which my
honourable friend bas given us, of the enormous proportion of payments that have been
made up to date.
The only question which arises in my mind
bas to do with the last sentence of my honourable friend who introduced this bill, in which
be suggested that we should give it third
reading without sending it to a committee.
Two observations occur to me in connection
with that. This is quite a long bill, running
to 15 pages and containing quite a number of
sections, some of which are rather complicated. I am a little concerned about the
reputation which this Senate bas always
prided itself upon, of looking carefully into
complicated legislation of this kind, particularly when it relates to financial matters. For
that reason, I would rather favour sending
it to committee.
Secondly, it is always a good thing to have
the permanent officials who are dealing with
an important measure like this have an
opportunity to come before a committee of
this bouse and tell their story. I think they

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES
appreciate doing so, and we get a lot of
information out of them.
I agree that my honourable friend gave a
complete explanation, but if we have the
officials of the Veterans' Land Act before us
-it could be a short committee meetingit seems to me that we would be able to get
even more information and perhaps a better
picture as to how this Act is being administered and more details than the mover could
possibly give us of the particular amendments
now before us.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: If honourable Senator Croll speaks now it will have the effect

if we had lots of time that would be a good
procedure.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I do not want to press the point in any way,
but I must say that if we do not send the bill
to a committee we will be depending upon
the word and the experience of the sponsor
and of the leader on the other side, that this
is a good bill in every respect. I am quite
willing to accept their word on that.

overcome these transitional problems of the
workers and manufacturers it is proposed,
in the first place, that an Adjustment Assistance Board be established under section 15
of the Department of Industry Act. This board
will consist of a chairman, and a senior official from the Department of Industry, the
Department of Labour, the Department of
Finance, the Department of Trade and Commerce, and the Industrial Development Bank.
The plan to assist manufacturers which I
shall deal with later will be administered by
the Department of Industry.
The item I am dealing with at present
will provide worker benefits, and will be administered by the Department of Labour.
This item proposes that certain transitional
assistance benefits be granted to workers,
and these benefits will be considered as a
special supplement to unemployment insurance benefits. It is proposed that the weekly
benefit payment shall be equal to an amount
which is 62 per cent of the earnings of the
workers who are temporarily dislocated while
plants are being enlarged, or facilities in the
plants changed in a way to meet the purposes
of the program. This amount of 62 per cent
of previous earnings will include the unemployment insurance benefits to which a
worker is entitled normally for being laid off
during this period, plus an additional 2j per
cent of those benefits for each dependent.
The combined transitional assistance and
unemployment insurance benefit would be

subject to a maximum of 65 per cent of the
average weekly wages and salaries in motor
vehicle and motor vehicle parts industries
taken together.
There will be a waiting period for one
week before the transitional benefits are paid.
The total of a worker's transitional assistance and unemployment insurance benefits,
plus earnings up to $18 a week and/or training allowances, should not exceed 75 per cent
of his weekly straight-time wage from the
company at the time he was laid off. If the
total exceeds 75 per cent, the transitional
benefit will be reduced accordingly.
I should add that where appropriate, the
Department of Labour, working in co-operation with the provincial governments, management and union representatives, will
provide training under federal-provincial
programs as a condition of receiving assistance.
I have before me a table, which might be
of value, if placed on the Senate Hansard.
It gives an Indication of the wage levels in
the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts
industries and the proposed transitional
assistance that is provided by this item. At
this point of my remarks I ask permission
to file this document so that these figures can
appear in the record of today's proceedings.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, that is the explanation of the
first item.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I wonder if the honourable
leader would be good enough ta tell us how
and ta what account that $5 million will be
charged?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It will
be charged ta the same account in Vote 5c that
the general Estimates of the Department of
Labour are charged, and of course will corne
out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. It

wîll then be credited ta that portion of
Estimates of the Department of Labour.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Wili it have any connection
with the Unemployment Insurance Fund?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No,
there is no connection. The dovetailing
between ail the payments that might be made
from. the Unemployment Insurance Fund
would be regulated as a resuit of the arrangement made by the Adjustment Assistance
Board, ta which I have referred.
Honourable senators, may I now read the
second item, Vote L27c, on the schedule of

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

this bill-Loans, Investments and Advances,
in the Department of Industry. It reads as
follows:
Loans, in the current and subsequent
fiscal years and in accordance with terms
and conditions prescribed by the Governor
in Council, to assist manufacturers of
automotive products in Canada affected
by the Canada-United States Agreement
on Automotive Products to adjust and
expand their production; such loans to be
made for the purpose of acquisition,
construction, installation, modernization,
development, conversion or expansion of
land, buildings, equipment, facilities or
machinery and for working capital; and
to authorize, notwithstanding Section 30
of the Financial Administration Act, total
commitments of $20,000,000 for the foregoing purposes during the current and
subsequent fiscal years.
If I may deal generally with this item, I
would first of all draw the attention of
honourable senators to the fact that we are
here discussing the matter of loans rather
than a grant. These loans are to be made to
the firms, the companies, the industries, who
are to take part in and help develop
the ideals in the Canada-United States agreement with respect to the production of automotive parts in Canada. We are talking here
about financial assistance for firms who must
embark on fairly substantial capital expenditures to meet the purposes of the program.
If the Canadian parts makers are to take
advantage of the plan, it is obvious that they
must become increasingly competitive and
flexible in their operations. In some instances,
some of these manufacturers will be asked by
their customers to make new products, or to
manufacture existing components on an expanded scale and more efficiently perhaps than
they do now. As a result, many Canadian parts
makers will have to engage in substantial reequipping and expansion programs to take
advantage of the opportunities that the plan
provides.
In addition, increased working capital will
be required in order to operate at these new
expanded levels. So the purpose of the loans
provided for in this item is to assist these
companies and firms to acquire the capital to
accomplish these objectives.
The loans will be made available to those
automotive products producers who have a
reasonable prospect of a profitable operation.
As the item says, the loans are for the pur-

pose of "acquisition, construction, installation,
modernization, development, conversion or
expansion of land, buildings, equipment,
facilities or machinery..."

They may also

be made for the purpose of working capital.
These loans will carry interest at the rate
of 6 per cent, and will be repayable over not
more than 20 years on loans that are secured
on land and buildings, and not more than 10
years on loans secured on other property.
A special fund will be set up for the
purpose of making these loans. The administration of the program will be the responsibility of the Adjustment Assistance Board
to which I have just referred.
The Industrial Development Bank will be
co-operating with the board and will be
responsible for the day-to-day administration
of the loans which are to be made under the
program.
Firms manufacturing the automotive products covered by the automotive plan will be
eligible for the loans, except those companies
which manufacture automobiles or firms affiliated with automobile manufacturers. It is
felt that these companies and firms have
access to adequate financial resources for the
capital expenditures that they would be required to make to dovetail with the purposes
of the plan.
There is a good deal of money involved in
both of these items, and I do not say that
they are, inconsequential. I do think, however, that this is evidence of a new initiative
in. Canada, I think it is a promising initiative
in Canada. The co-operation of the industry
and of organized labour gives one a feeling
of relative assurance that the program will
be a very beneficial one for the Canadian
economy.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
I am sure we are all indebted to the Leader
of the Government for the explanation in
such great detail of these two items in
Schedule C of the supplementary Estimates.
I think the honourable leader, with his usual
skill, has managed to coat a not altogether
palatable pill with a sugar coating of words,
explanation and plausibility which may not
altogether be justified by the facts as they
are presented in the figures before us.
I think it is fair to say that we have here
an object lesson in cause and effect which I
am sure will be of benefit to the Government.
It is not accidental that both of these items
refer to the Canada-United States Agreement
on Automotive Products. We all remember
that when this agreement was begun it was
announced with much fanfare. I am sure we

SENATE DEBATES
all hope that it will be an outstanding success
in terms of increasing production and personal and corporate income to Canadians
from the manufacturer of automobiles, their
parts and accessories.
On the other hand, we were not told at
that time that one of the economic consequences of that agreement would be a very
substantial displacement of labour. The
honourable Leader of the Government referred to it as a "transitional problem of
adjustment" for these workers. Of course
what it means is unemployment. The item
itself is more explanatory in that it simply
uses the word "unemployed." The fact of the
matter is that workers have been thrown out
of work as a result of this action by the
government.
I think it is fair to say that this was not
anticipated by the Government, because if we
are to assume the credibility of what we
read in the papers, even the distinguished minister representing the Windsor area was himself surprised and flew immediately to that
area to find out what it was all about. This
seems to me to be another object lesson showing the necessity for more careful planning
and collection of data, and more concern
for the economic consequences of government actions, no matter how well-intentioned
they may be.
We have had other examples since the
present Government came into power of
hasty action which gave the impression of
being more concerned with its impact on
public opinion than its effect on the problem
to which it was addressed.
I am not for one minute suggesting that
the Canada-United States Agreement on
Automotive Products will be a failure. As I
said a moment ago, and I am sure every
Canadian will agree with me, I hope that it
will be a success. But what I wonder-and
perhaps the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Connolly, Ottawa West) will inform us
further on this-is whether this amount of
$5 million in Item 5c for the relief of workers, and which is in effect a supplementary
unemployment insurance benefit while the
workers are temporarily, I hope, unemployed,
is the final amount. Is this the total amount
anticipated to be spent as a result of this
agreement to the workers of the automotive
industry?
I hope the leader will also inform us in
more detail about the other item, the loans
to manufacturers, which appears as item L27c.
What is the total amount of the expenditure

June 30, 1965

from the public purse to support this automotive agreement?
I wonder if he could give us some information as to what the total amount might be
before some of these wonderful results that
are anticipated will begin to appear in the
pockets of Canadians.
Another question which I am sure the
public is asking and which I hear wherever I
go is: What effect will this have on the
consumer? We have here assistance to manufacturers of automobiles, and we have here
assistance to the workers in the automotive
industry. But what about the consumers? Is
the consumer ever going to be able to buy an
automobile for less money? Is this huge
expenditure of public funds going to bring
down the cost of an automobile in Canada?
This is what the public would like to know.
We are told this is going to increase mass
production of automobiles, parts of automobiles and the Canadian components of
automobiles.
Those of us who have studied economics
over the years have been told over and over
again that the great justification for mass
production is the consumer benefit of a lower
price. I would hope that the honourable
Leader of the Government when he comes
to reply will give us some information on
that aspect, as well as some further indication of the anticipated total cost of this
agreement in relation to Item 5c which deals
with the workers and Item L27c which deals
with the industry.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I do not wish to speak on this legislation, but I wish to point out to the leader
that he told us that this Act may be cited as
Appropriation Act No. 6. Is there, perhaps, a
mistake there? I have here the English as well
as the French version, and there seems to
have been a correction made.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (O±awa West): I should
have said Appropriation Act No. 5. It was a
mistake. I am sorry.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must inform honourable senators that if the honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) speaks now it will
have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I need only take a few minutes.
I thank Senator Grosart for his comments.
First of all, he said something about the
failure of the Government to anticipate dislocations that are to be provided for as a
result of the moneys to be supplied by this

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

bill. I would point out that on page 5 of
a news release issued January 15, 1965,
when this program was announced by the
Minister of Industry, this paragraph appears:
A number of important features have
been incorporated into the program to
enable the Canadian motor vehicle and
automotive components industries to
make adjustments within a framework of
expanding output and a minimum of dislocation. Unique circumstances prevailing
in the Canadian industry make it necessary to provide for an adequate transiotinal period during which Canadian producers may adapt their facilities and
operations to the new opportunities with
a reasonable measure of security.
I may tell honourable senators that the
matter of the dislocation not only of the
industries themselves but of the workers was
the subject matter of very lengthy negotiation
with the industry, leading up to the point
where the agreement with the United States
could be signed. There has certainly been
no hasty action in respect of this problem.
This problem has been anticipated, and now
is the appropriate time to deal with it because the program is to be implemented
almost forthwith so far as Canada is concerned. Therefore, provisions must be made
for the dislocations we have been expecting.
The honourable senator referred to the
fact that there will be some unemployment.
I am not unduly worried, and I do not think
any honourable senator should be, about the
prospect of unemployment in this country.
I would point out that the average level of
unemployment in Canada today is at a lower
point than it has been since 1956. I think
that some of the credit-not ail, but some of
the credit-for this very favourable situation
in respect of the labour force goes to the
Government for the programs it has initiated
in respect of the economy.
Senator Grosart asked if the $5 million is
the last that will be asked for-"Will more
money be demanded?" In a program of this
kind, one which is new and experimental, I
believe the Government must make its best
estimate, in consultation with industry and
with the trade unions, as to what the dislocation is likely to be. I can say that this is no
more than an estimate. I hope it will be adequate, and normally a government does not
ask for more than it needs. It is hoped that
not only the $5 million required for the
assistance of workers, but also the $10 million
which is thought to be adequate for the

purposes of loans to industry, will be sufficient. However, I do say this, that with the
prospects for increased economic activity
which this program promises, I would not
have any serious objection to coming back
and asking for an increase on either of these
accounts, if the program works out the way
it is expected to.
The honourable senator asked too, what
is the consumers' interest in this-will cars
be cheaper? The minister has said that in
time it is expected that cars will be cheaper,
that the retail price of a car sold in Canada
will be comparable to that of a similar car
sold in the United States. I believe that is
a result everyone wants to see achieved. But
at the same time we must not forget that
what is primarily sought in this program
is a vast expansion of the automotive industry and a vast new market for its products in the country to our south. As a result
of this there will be more, and I hope better, jobs for Canadians, an expansion in
the economic activity of this industry and
a great many other industries which will be
affected as a result of the development of
this program.
I do not want to promise that the program
is going to be completely effective. I do not
want to say it is going to solve ail our problems, but it seems to me to be a worthy
kind of initiative for Canadians to take in
this very competitive time in which we live.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate,
I move that the bill be read the third time
now.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I am informed that in the other place
they are now debating interim supply,
and that following consideration of that bill
they will take up consideration of the bill
with respect to area incentives, of which we
now have some knowledge.
I cannot predict exactly what the timetable will be, but I should inform the Senate

SENATE DEBATES
that I am advised there is unanimous agreement in the other place that they will adjourn for a summer recess this evening.
Therefore, I have to ask for the indulgence
of the Senate to deal expeditiously with whatever bills come before us, so that the wishes
of I think everyone in Parliament can be
met. This would mean that Royal Assent
would take place some time this evening.
I therefore suggest, honourable senators,
that we adjourn now, to reassemble at the
call of the bell at approximately 8.30 p.m.,
at which time we shall survey the situation.
Honourable senators will remember that
last spring an uncertain situation developed
which kept us here much later than any of
us desired. It was harder on the younger
men than on the older, as far as I could
judge. In any event, should the bell not ring
precisely at 8.30 p.m., I am sure all honourable senators will understand that we are
still working out an arrangement.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8.30 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 6, 1965
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-131, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service for the financial
year ending 31st March, 1966.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John J. Connolly: With leave of the
Senate, I move that this bill be read the
second time now.
Honourable senators, I understand that as
many copies of this bill as are available have
been circulated. In any event, I have supplied
two foolscap sheets, which I will refer to as
I speak. It might be a convenience to the
Senate if I restrict myself to the contents of
these sheets.
May I say generally, that honourable senators will see listed in the first table the total
proposed budgetary expenditures and loans,
including the Old Age Security payments.
In the main Estimates the total proposed is
$7,601,722,232. Of this amount $3,219,091,388
represents statutory payments, such as payments for family allowances, old age pensions,

June 30, 1965

and items like that, which are provided by
statute and are paid every year from the
time the statute first came into existence. The
balance of $4,382,630,844 is the amount required to be voted by Parliament this year
if the main Estimates are to be approved.
There were three supplementary Estimates.
Supplementary Estimates (A), in the amount
of $2 million, Supplementary Estimates (B) in
the amount of $278,389,959, which are also to
be voted, and Supplementary Estimates (C)
which were considered earlier this day, in the
amount of $15 million, which also require to
be voted. The total amount of government
expenditures for the present fiscal year, excluding payments from the Old Age Security
Fund is $7,897,112,191. In addition, some $905
million will be paid out from the Old Age
Security Fund. Therefore, the total actual
money which is contemplated for expenditure
this year is $8,802,112,191.
There may be further supplementary Estimates to come to us in the normal course,
but that is the spending prospect as it appears
to us tonight.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is approximately $9
billion altogether for the year?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
actual figure is $8,802,112,191.
Another $200 million would make it $9
billion.
May I deal with the approvals which have
been given already. First, Appropriation Act
No. 1 granted two-twelfths generally of the
main Estimates, plus additional proportions of
certain other items, to the 3lst May, 1965,
in the amount of $762,547,249.03. That was
approved some time ago.
Appropriation Act No. 3 granted one
month's supply, or one-twelfth generally of
the main Estimates, plus additional proportions of certain items, in the amount of
$380,770,370.34.
Appropriation Act No. 4, which was the
full supply for Supplementary Estimates (A) in
the amount of $2 million, was granted by
Parliament some weeks ago.
Appropriation Act No. 5, which was the
full supply for Supplementary Estimates (C),
was granted earlier today in the amount of
$15 million.
The bill now before us is Appropriation Act
No. 6. It proposes to grant four months' supply,
that is, supply to October 31, 1965. Generally, four months' supply is being asked
for, four-twelfths of the main Estimates, plus
certain other special items, and seven-twelfths

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

generally of the Supplementary Estimates
(B), plus certain additional proportions of
special items in the supplementary Estimates.
Honourable senators, may I pause here
simply to say that by the first supply bill we
granted two-twelfths; by the second interim
supply we granted one-twelfth. Altogether
three-twelfths of the main Estimates have
been granted, plus certain additional amounts.
This evening we are asking for four-twelfths
of the main Estimates, plus some extra
amounts; and we are bringing the supplementary Estimates up to the same authorization as was granted for the main estimates,
namely, seven-twelfths, plus some additional
items.
I think that this recapitulates the position
in respect of the main and supplementary
Estimates to this point.
Honourable senators, I come now to the
bill before us. First of all, it grants fourtwelfths of all the items to be voted in the
main Estimates, except External Affairs Vote
15, and Mines and Technical Surveys Vote 70
for which no proportion is granted, and
External Affairs Vote 20 for which the proportion is three-twelfths. There are departmental
reasons why these exceptions are made in
these particular votes.
In addition to that, there are additional
proportions of certain items in various departments that are asked for. If honourable
senators have the schedules before them, I
can refer to them.
The first is Schedule A which asks for an
additional four-twelfths of certain items in
the Department of Agriculture, Votes 25 and
45; for Legislation, Vote 15; for Loans, Investments and Advances, Vote L30; this all
being Schedule A in the main Estimates.
Schedule B asks for an additional twotwelfths of the Northern Affairs and National
Resources, Vote 15, in the amount of a little
over $21 million.
Schedule C asks for an additional onetwelfth in certain items in Agriculture, Fisheries, Mines and Technical Surveys, National
Film Board, Northern Affairs and National
Resources. That is Schedule C.
Hon. Sarto Fournier: We have (d) on the
leaflet. However, it is just a detail.

In respect of the supplementary Estimates
which have been tabled in this bouse, and
which are treated in general in the way in
which the main Estimates are treated, this
bill will ask for seven-twelfths of all items
to be voted in those Estimates, plus an additional four-twelfths of certain items in these
supplementary Estimates, Agriculture, Mines
and Technical Surveys. Then there are some
items under Loans, Investments and Advances.
In addition, there are three-twelfths of
one of the items in respect of Finance in the
supplementary Estimates for which additional
money is required. In the past I have
taken the additional items in the schedules
and explained them one by one. I have found,
generally speaking, that this information was
superfluous and I suggest now that if there
are any particular items referred to in the
sheets upon which any senator seeks information, I shall do what I can to provide it from
the data before me.
Honourable senators, certain of these items
with respect to Northern Affairs, Agriculture,
Fisheries, and Mines and Technical Surveys,
show special and rather urgent requirements
for money because some of the programs proposed by these items are developed more intensively in the good weather period. This
means that the department requires extra
money to defray the costs of those programs.
Generally speaking, this is why the extra
amounts are required in addition to the fourtwelfths or four months' supply asked for in
respect of the main Estimates and in addition to the seven-twelfths asked for in respect of Supplementary Estimates (B).
We have been over the form of this bill so
often together that I feel it is an imposition
on honourable senators to outline what the
different sections mean. I think I can sum up
the situation by saying that this bill is in the
usual form. I should give honourable senators the further assurance that in no instance
is the total amount of any one item being
released by this bill, and this is true of all
interim supply bills, unless there is a very
special reason for doing so and the reason is
specified. I say further that the passing of
any of these items tonight will not prejudice
the right of any honourable senator to disHon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The cuss, either in the house or in the Standing
schedules to which I am referring are the Committee on Finance, any of the items in
schedules in the bill. I am not referring to the main Estimates or in the supplementary

SENATE DEBATES

payment on account so that the departments
will be able to finance their operations. Parliament will not be back in full session until
after the summer, but the work of Parliament
and of the departments of government must
continue and the bills must be paid. Honourable senators are also aware that the main
Estimates and the supplementary Estimates
are before our Standing Committee on Finance, and ail honourable senators, whether
or not they are members of the committee,
are entitled to attend any sitting of that committee and to make such inquiries as they
feel they should. In that way they can generally satisfy themselves that the amounts
required to be voted, large amounts from
time to time, are needed to keep the Government supplied with the wherewithal to meet
its accounts.
I hope I am not short-circuiting or shortchanging anybody by the explanation I have
given, but if there are special questions on
any particular items in the schedules I shall
endeavour to answer them.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
an interim supply bill at this stage in the
parliamentary process is not, of course, unusual, but this bill departs in two respects
from the normal type of interim supply bill
we have had before us.
One is that it contains a very large sum
from the Supplementary Estimates (B). The
second is that we are now being asked to vote
supply in this amount for a period of four
months, that is, until October 31 of this year.
I do not know whether there is any particular
significance in that date. We ail know that
Parliament is going to take a recess, but perhaps the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa West), from
his knowledge of the higher councils, might
feel disposed tonight to advise us whether it
has any electoral expectancy in the autumnof which we have heard so many rumours.
As the honourable Leader of the Government has said, most of the items we are
asked to vote now are in the main Estimates
and have been before us for a good many
months. They have also been before our own
Standing Committee on Finance.
I think this is an appropriate time to say
that the work that has been done by that
committee, under the chairmanship of Senator
Leonard, has brought not only great distinction to the Senate but also makes it much
easier for us to consider and pass large
amounts such as this at the last minute and
under the gun, because honourable senators

June 30, 1965

can have the assurance that these items have
been examined carefully by that committee,
of which I happen to be a humble member.
Indeed, I felt in the past year, sitting at the
feet of Senator Leonard, that I had been taking a post-graduate course in public finance.
When I see some of the large amounts that are
now required to assist in and improve higher
education, it makes me realize that the mere
B.A. which I got some years ago is today far
from sufficient for one who is expected to do
his duty in the Parliament of Canada, particularly in respect to this volume which we
know as the Blue Book. In fact, in preparation
for the assignment I have been given here I
have been trying to find my way around it,
and I must say there is nothing more difficult
than to try to relate the specific votes in a bill
such as this to their apparent counterparts
in the main Estimates.
In view of the late hour and His Honour's
very kind invitation, which I know we are
ail anxious to accept as soon as possible,
it would not be becoming for me to discuss
these figures at any length. I will make no
comment whatever on those items that are
related to the main Estimates, but I would
like to say a few words about some of the
items that are before us from the Supplementary Estimates (B). Not ail the items to which
I will refer are actually in the schedules
before us but, of course, the supplementary
Estimates vote in the bill is for seven-twelfths
of the total in Supplementary Estimates (B).
One of the very large items in that schedule
is for technical and vocational education. I
think this is a good time to say that I do not
think we can spend too much at the present
time on the development of our educational
facilities in this country.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: It is a remarkable fact,
however, that to find what the federal Government is doing in the field of education
you have to search ail through the various
departments, because the technical and vocational grants come under one department, the
Department of Labour. We find the assistance
to universities under another department.
I should like at this time to suggest that
one of the things the Government could do
to assist in the development of secondary
and higher education in Canada is to bring
ail of these items together under one ministry.
I am not suggesting that a Minister of Education should be appointed because I realize
there are constitutional difficulties in the way

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

of that. But, regardless of sections 91 and 92
of the British North America Act, the federal
Government is in the field of education.
I endeavoured to discover the present total,
and I made several inquiries of officials, but
nobody was able, in the short time available,
to give me a figure. There is, however, in
this appropriation bill the large amount of
$42 million to extend the present grants to
the provinces for vocational and technical
training.
I have one comment to make. I happen
to have some knowledge of one of these
institutes, namely, the Ryerson Institute in
Toronto. I am amazed at the fact that we
are sending out graduates from such institutes, who are required to have a grade
13 education for admission and then complete
three or four years of study, without awarding them a degree. Consideration should be
given, perhaps at the provincial level, to the
awarding of degrees to students who take the
very extensive courses provided by technical
and vocational institutes.
There is a large item in the Estimates
of the Department of National Defence under
the heading of "Loans" about which I should
like the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa West) to
give us a little more information. I am referring to Vote L26b. If it is not possible to
provide that information at the present
moment, then perhaps it can be made available at some later time.
I should like to draw the attention of
honourable senators to the item for defence
support and assistance to cover direct expenditures on behalf of countries not members of NATO, which is found on page 6. I
wonder if the honourable Leader of the
Government would care to enlarge on that.
This is an item that has increased over the
years, and I am sure many honourable senators would be interested to know the reason
for our defence support to countries outside
our NATO obligation.
On page 12, in the Estimates of the Department of Labour, I find an item calling for the
expenditure of $300,000, under the Special
Services Branch, for newspaper, radio, film
and other publicity. I do not know whether
that covers the current advertising carried on
by the Department of Labour, which is published in our newspapers at public expense.
Full page advertisements are appearing in our
newspapers in connection with the Labour
Code, and carrying a photograph of the
Minister of Labour. I am not one of those

who say that a government should never
advertise, because I believe a government has
an obligation to communicate and give information to the public, but I have serious
doubts as to whether it is necessary for a
government advertisement to include a photograph of a minister, in spite of the fact that
this particular minister is very good looking.
His predecessor the Honourable Michael
Starr was also a very good looking minister.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): But, he
was married.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Yes, he is married, and
the present minister is not. This may have
something to do with the fact that there is
an increase in the number of Canadian
females in the labour market, and it may be
very good policy.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I would
hope it might help him.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I think it will, and I
think it will give particular comfort to a
minister who is a bachelor.
On the other hand, the line rate for a full
page advertisement in the newspapers of
Canada is very high. I have had some experience in this field, and it seems to me
that this controverts one principle or criterion in the examination of such a policy.
This is the question: Is this legitimate information that should be furnished to the
public, or is it propaganda for the glorification of a minister?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honourable friend a question? I recall reading
in the debates on the Labour Code in the
other house that members of the Opposition were insistent that when the Labour
Code was passed, the Government should
publicize its provisions as soon as possible
so as to make everybody in the country
aware of who was and who was not covered by it. That was done at the suggestion
of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I agree with the general principle that this information should
be widespread and made known, but there
are many ways of communicating information. In this case, the only persons directly
concerned would be the employers of
labour directly connected with the federal
Government.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Or the employees.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I was going to say that.
It: is important eat all times to acquaint
members of the ýpublic of their rights, and

SENATE DEBATES
I have no objection to this being done. My
objection is that this is an excess of zeala full page advertisement featuring the
minister's picture. I do not think it was
wise to have the minister's picture, if the
Government wishes to avoid confusion in
the public mind-and I am sure it does-as
to whether this is the legitimate communication of information or whether there is a
motivation of propaganda. I do not say there
is. I merely suggest to the Government that
the way to avoid it is to leave out the
minister's picture, no matter how good looking he may be.
If I may, I will pass on to an item under
Privy Council. This is an expenditure of
which I shall make no complaint.
Vote 15b, under Privy Council, is as follows:
Expenses of Commission under Part I
of the Inquiries Act to inquire into allegations of improper conduct on the part
of public officials in connection with
extradition proceedings concerning Lucien Rivard.
I think that was money well spent, and I
commend the Government for initiating that
commisison and carrying it through to the end,
as they have done.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: What is the amount of
that vote?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: The amount is $40,000.
Under the Department of Secretary of State
is an item which may be a kind of comment
on the extraordinary meaningless of money
when we find it before us in such large
amounts. Upon looking at this bill, somebody said, "It cannot be money at all." This
illustrates the point. There is an item of
$257,000 as an expenditure for the committee
to limit election expenses. Here is a committee
which is going to tell the Government, and
presumably candidates in elections, how to
limit their election expenses and yet will
spend $257,000 to find out how others should
limit their expenses. I would only suggest
that some action be taken on the earliest
possible occasion to limit the expenses of the
committee inquiring into the limiting of expenses.
Somebody once said to me that a good
way to find out who are the best political
housekeepers is to examine the Estimates
carefully. I found a rather interesting example, and I will mention no names. On
page 30 I came across an Item under the
Transport Department's Estimates for service

June 30, 1965

between Twillingate and New World Island.
I am sure my colleague from Newfoundland
will be interested in that. It is in the amount
of $19,750. I thought that was a lot of money
for that type of thing. However, on page 27 I
found another item under Vote 20b:
Construction or acquisition of ferry
vessels and equipment; Ferry vessel for
the Twillingate-New World Island Newfoundland Service, $57,000.
I immediately thought of Bonavista, and
sure enough, on page 22 under Public Works,
I see "Bonavista-Breakwater repairs-To
complete, $115,000." And immediately afterwards, "Bonavista, the slipway and storage
area, $100,000."
Honourable senators, there are many other
things I would like to say about the Estimates, and I should have liked to discuss
them fully, as I have quite a few notes here.
I feel I should pay a compliment to the
Leader of the Government for providing us, as
he has done now for about a year, with these
extremely interesting documents-which, as
far as I know, are unique in our parliamentary process. I believe they are prepared in
his own office. They are by far the best summaries that I have ever seen of governmental expenditures. While they naturally do
not contain all the items on which I have
commented, they are most helpful and they
do give an excellent picture of the expenditures that we are asked to consider and to
which we are to give our consent.
I conclude by saying again that I have no
hesitation at this time in acceding to the
passing oqf these Estimates. Even though
they have not been already considered by
our Committee on Finance, they will in due
course obtain that consideration and I think
we can rest assured that if there are any
items which should be drawn to the attention
of the Senate, that will be done.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to
say at this moment, except to thank my own
leader for the opportunity of engaging in this
interesting assignment, although I do wish
he had not put me in the position I am in,
of being the last man up on the team, at a
time when nobody is very much interested
in listening to the last man.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
if Senator Connolly speaks now it will have
the effect of closing the debate.

June 30, 1965

June30, 965SENATE
DEBATES

Han. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honaurable senators, I thank Seznator Grosart for
the remarks hie has made and for the care
that he has given ta this bill and ta the
supplementary Estimates.
He finished his speech by saying that hie
found the sheets which I have provided ta
be useful. I would hope that would be generafly f elt ta be the case in the Senate, and I
would plan ta continue this saine practice on
other supply bilis-given time. There may be
occasions when a bill cornes ta me very late
and when it is impossible ta prepare these
sheets. I think they let honourable senators
see quickly where we are in the consideration ai these various supply bis.
Senator Grosart started by using a rather
unusual phrase, "electoral expectancy." I
have littie ta say about that. Perhaps he and
the members of his party have "1great expectations." I would assure him that, unlike
Mîcawber, the Government is not "'waiting
for something ta turn up."ý
He suggested that bringing the education
items together under one authority, or even
under one minister, might be useful. Certainly it would be helpful if the items could
be grouped. 1 would suggest, however, that
this might be a matter ta be considered by
aur Cammittee an Finance. I rather doubt
that anything is possible, that they could be
ali under one autharity, because people who
are cbarged with the administration of same
of these items naturally fall for their main
work into variaus departmnents. The honourable senator might ask this question of the
Secretary of the Treasury Board when hie
cornes before the Committee on Finance.
Senator Grosart asked also about reasons
for external aid ta two non-NATO countries. One af those, I remember quite well, is
Tanzania. I do nat; recail the other country.
There are very good reasans for such assistance. In the case of Tanzania, it is a very new
country and it has been without armed farces
and without the means of trying ta establish
law and order wîthin its boundaries.
It is said that there are certain subversive
elements in these cauntries that must be controlled if law and order is ta prevail. Here
again, I think it is apprapriate ta say that
this matter might very well be inquired inta
in the Standing Committee on Finance, and
I belleve that the explanation which would
be given of the Gavernment's action i respect
of these twa cauntries would be readily
accepted by the members ai this house.
.The honourable senator has also been critical of certain advertising progranxs under-

taken particularly by the Department af
Labour, and of the fact that the minister's
picture appears ini the advertisements. Well,
I suppose that the appearance of a picture ai
a minister always has a pahitical. connotation,
even when it is in the news section af a
newspaper. But I should not be surprised if
the model for this particular set ai advertisements -was taken from some ai the programns
advertised by the Government ai the Province
ai Ontario, because I think this practice has
been used very generally there and passibly
in other provinces as well. Frankly, I see no
reason why the picture ai any minister should
not be included in connection with a programn
af his department that is ai such importance
ta all the people af Canada as is the Labour
Code. I need not tell the honourable senator
what constitutes goad advertising practice. I
for one would certainly look at an advertisement with a picture more readily than I
would at an advertisement withaut one, and.
if the picture were that ai a pretty girl I
would look at it even more quickly.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Is the
honaurable Leader af the Government aware
that the mînister stated that this was not a
picture ai hini because ai the poor likeness?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
hanourable senator also talked about the
cammittee's inquiring into the prospect ai
limiting election expenses, and the fact that
$257,000 might be spent on that project. This
is fair game for political comment. But ini
view ai the experience ai the honaurable
senator in cannection with this general field.
af elections and his knowledge ai the magnitude ai the cost ai electians, if this cost could
be substantiaily reduced even in one or two
elections as a result ai the operations ai a
committee that would cost this amaunt ai
money, I would say that we would stili have
a bargain.
The honourable senator also refers ta special items introduced into the Estimates In
cannection with a certain area i the Province ai Newioundland. Ail I can say about
that is that perhaps since 1957 that area has
been more or less neglected, and perhaps
some ai these facilities have fallen into such
disrepair that it is necessary ta make some
expenditures down there ta restore normal
services.

portation equipment; 33 per cent by the
chemical industry; 9 per cent by the textile
industry; and 2 per cent by the machinery
manufacturing industry.
I should say-and this indirectly bears out
the point I made a moment ago--that ten of
the firms which went into this program
invested about $300 million of the total of
$500 million, and provided just a little less
than half of the jobs that are expected to be
provided, or that in fact have been provided as a result of the program.
Generally speaking, I think it can be said
that the program has had a beneficial result,
but it is felt that improvements can be made,
and will be made by the proposals contained
in this bill.
One of the tests heretofore applicable for
designating an area as appropriate for the
incentive has been the existence of a labour
surplus, or unemployment, during the summer months in the N.E.S. area in question
for the previous eight years. Another test was
whether or not the growth of employment
in the N.E.S. area that was being looked at
was below the national average. Another
factor was the seasonal unemployment, particularly during the summer months in the
area due to production changes in a manufacturing industry, re-tooling, and conditions of that kind.
Honourable senators, the new test or new
considerations proposed by this bill are somewhat different, and they may appear to be
rather abstract and perhaps complicated.
However, the Government expects that they
will provide better results than the ones that
have been obtained heretofore.
I should like to summarize these new considerations that will apply to the determination of the designated areas. The first is unemployment. Consideration hereafter will be
given to the ratio between the number of
registered unemployed in the National Employment Service area and the number of
paid workers in the area for the whole year.
I am informed by experts-and these are
people who deal with statistics and who believe that this program can benefit by the
change-that this figure, when determined,
will be a useful figure to compare the unemployment situation in the various National
Employment Service areas, and that they will
have a better picture of how great the need
is in certain areas than they were able to
obtain heretofore.
On the question of growth of employment
in a given area, formerly an eight-year pe-

riod was used. It is now proposed that a fiveyear period shall be used.
Special attention-and this was apparently
not one of the criteria adopted before-will
be given to the National Employment Service
areas where employment has continued to
decline and where that can be measured by
statistical information.
The fourth of the new tests to be applied
will be the low-income test.
Honourable senators, sometimes an unemployed person fails to register at the National Employment Service office. It is possible, however, to determine the average
income in a National Employment Service
area, and it is therefore proposed to compute a
figure of the average non-farm family income
for a given area as determined by the national
census, from the information supplied by the
national census through the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. I am told that this figure
can be revised every five years, although the
census takes place every ten years. It will be
beneficial even where the area is part rural
and part urban, because the figure on nonfarm family income is likely to be higher
than the average of all income in a mixed
National Employment Service area.
I conclude this part by saying that this
sounds abstract and complex. However, I
think the original tests were equally abstract
and complex, but they proved to be helpful, and these newer tests are expected to be
still more helpful. With the new tests it is
believed that the new designated areas which
will qualify for special treatment to remedy
unemployment and to provide a stimulus for
the economy in that area, will cover 15 per
cent of the labour force instead of 10 per
cent under the old standards.
I should also say that this legislation, like
the past legislation, is experimental. It is
based upon our own experience over the past
two years. I am informed that it is also
based upon similar legislation which has been
used in the United States and in some European countries. Of course there are differences in Canada, especially arising out of
the fact Canada is not a unitary state but
a federal state, and the solution to some of
these problems lies within the jurisdiction of
the provinces. So, close consultation with the
provinces in the working out of these programs is essential.
The purpose of the legislation is to provide
better and more employment opportunities
for people in areas of slower growth. It is
hoped that the application of the new legislation will result in a higher rate of growth

SENATE DEBATES
and better employment within areas that are
designated as areas in need of assistance.
As I have said, heretofore the incentives
were accelerated capital cost allowances and
certain tax remissions. Now it is proposed
that grants will be made to assist the new
manufacturing and processing industries to
establish themselves within the designated
area. These grants will be paid out of the
federal Treasury to new and existing manufacturing and processing industries, to assist
them to expand their facilities or to establish new facilities.
The grants will be based upon the fixed
capital investment which the industries
which decide to locate or expand within those
areas will make. The grants will not be
taxable income in the hands of the industries, that is, of the companies that receive
them.
I would remind honourable senators that
the bulk of the investment will be made by
the industries themselves. The cost to the federal Treasury is expected to be roughly
equivalent to the cost which it incurred as
a result of the program which has been in
existence up to now.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): What bas

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That I
cannot answer, and for this reason. I think
my honourable friend will appreciate my difficulty here. The capital cost allowance is an
allowance that is going to be made to the
company that sets up in the given area and
will be based upon its capital investment in
land, buildings, equipment and so on. The
computation of that allowance for a given
industry would not be available until the tax
return for a given year was made. The program has been running for two years. I wish
I could tell my friend how much this would
mean in taxes that were not paid or were

by the federal Government so far to the
plan.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I should
point out that up to now no money has been
paid out. Up to now these have been tax
remittances and tax holidays for three years.
There may be a figure that can be developed
to apply to the new jobs-15,000 to 17,000
new jobs. I will have some work done on
that and will supply the information to my
friend.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: The honourable senator
spoke of $500 million being the cost of 16,000
jobs. Did I understand that correctly?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
$500 million is the amount that has been
invested by firms which have established
new industries in the designated areas.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Might I ask my leader,
is not the Industrial Development Bank
equipped to do that very job to which he
is referring? They have the staff and all the
facilities. I wonder why they cannot be used
to do that job.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The Industrial Development Bank is a lending bank.
What is proposed now is a series of grants
in which the Department of Industry, having
surveyed the application, will be able to make
the payment. This is a matter of a grant; it
is not the supervision of a lending program.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: But this money is paid
back?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No, these
are outright grants. Instead of tax remittances, they are outright grants.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They are not loans.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): They are
not loans. Instead of tax holidays, they are
grants. The rate of grant will be 33 per
cent of the first $250,000 of capital invested
by the firm. This is designed particularly to
help smaller firms, because they require more
labour and are not as highly mechanized as

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does a firm which obtains one of these grants still qualify for
capital cost allowance in addition to the
grant?

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No. These
are two separate programs. If I may I would
like to touch on the point which Senator
Aseltine has raised after I finish this portion
of my explanation.
When the amount of capital invested is over
$1 million, the percentage of grant will be
20 per cent of the investment in excess of
$1 million, but the maximum grant in any
case will not be more than $5 million. The
same formula as to the rate of grants will
apply to the expanding of existing facilities
in cases where the expansion program is
approved. The tax incentives heretofore applied will continue to be available until March
31, 1967, but a firm that enters a designated
area to set up a new industry under the old
system cannot take advantage of the new.
I think I am accurate in saying that after the
passing of this legislation, if it is passed by
Parliament, the old system will be discontinued for new applications.
I may say that firms qualifying for assistance under the new program may take a tax
credit instead of a grant if they. are in the
position where they are earning money.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Would not that be the
same as allowing them depreciation?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No,
because the capital cost depreciation is based
upon the value of the buildings and equipment and the depreciation rates that apply.
In the case of a tax credit, if the firm is
entitled to a grant but is earning income
which is taxable, it can offset its tax against
the amount of the grant.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And then it would have
the usual depreciation?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Then
they would be subject to normal depreciation.
The program is to expire on March 31, 1971.
I have not tried to explain the principles
of this bill by dealing with the sections one
by one, but I have tried to give a general
explanation of the purport of the bill. The
program, as I say,* is basically the same as
that approved by Parliament two years ago
and which has proved to be reasonably successful. The new criteria proposed by this
legislation will be even more beneficial, will
not be more onerous upon the treasury and
will cover much more of the labour force
than has previously been the case.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): I
wonder if the leader would add a few words
of explanation in connection with clause 13,
wherein reference is made to amendments to

the Income Tax Act. I must say I am a little
confused with the explanation given in the
bill itself. I am referring now to page 5 of
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
amendments to the Income Tax Act are designed to provide for manufacturing or processing businesses which are the types of industry intended to be helped by this bill.
Perhaps that would be clearer if I were to
express it this way: It is considered that a
manufacturing or processing business would
do most for a designated area, and the purpose of the income tax changes is to make it
as clear as possible that the industry to be
assisted in the designated area should be a
manufacturing or processing industry. For
this reason, a gas or oil well, logging business,
mine, construction project, farming or fishing
should not be included within that definition.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to speak at any
length on this bill. As the honourable leader
says, it is an experimental bill, and I will
probably be better able to discuss its implications and effect after it has been in operation for a period of time.
Generally speaking, I think there will be
approval of the measure. I would like to read
a short quotation from the Chronicle Herald
of Halifax dated June 9 last because I agree
with the view expressed therein, and it perhaps expresses it better than I could. It states:
The policy of direct grants to new or
expanding industry in underdeveloped
areas will be a more powerful incentive
than the tax holiday and rapid depreciation provisions now in force. It will provide companies with substantial amounts
of cash (equivalent tax credits will be
made available as an alternative) at a
time when such aid is most needed. Tax
holidays, of course, presupposed an early
profitability that could not always be
realistically expected.
The direct-grant method has enjoyed
increasing support among economists,
business men and politicians in the Atlantic provinces, particularly in Nova
Scotia. This part of the Prime Minister's
announcement, therefore, should find a
ready acceptance in this region.
There is one thing I particularly like
about this bill, and it is this: It seems to be
an effort to bring employment to people in
these underdeveloped or distressed areas,
whichever you want to call them. Too often
have we heard it stated that people must be

SENATE DEBATES
prepared to move to centres of employment.
We have heard it stated in this chamber that
the workman must be prepared to move
perhaps two or three times during his life,
that he must go to where employment is to
be found. I say this measure is an attempt
to bring employment to the workman. We
cannot expect workmen to live in a sort of
trailer town, ready to hitch up and move to
some other centre at a moment's notice.
People like to settle, to build and take roots,
as it were. I do not subscribe to a policy
which seems to say that those seeking work
must move to a centre where employment is
available.
Surely in this day and age when we send
men hundreds of miles into orbit, when they
are planning to send men to the moon, we
should have enough skill, ability and vision to
bring employment to people no matter where
they are living.
Honourable senators, I point out that in
these areas about which we are speaking it
is just as important to keep existing employment as it is to provide new employment.
This bill, for example, applies to new manufacturing and processing facilities, or to the
expansion of existing manufacturing and processing facilities. I presume the reason is that
this type of industry provides a fairly high
rate of employment. It is a little difficult to
follow the definition of a new facility:
"Facility" means the structures, machinery and equipment that constitute
the necessary components of a manufacturing or processing operation.
What happens in an area of this type when
an industry such as a mining industry wishes
to modernize its operations? As I see it, under
this legislation it could not get a grant. I
would think in many cases it would be much
easier to keep existing industry. It might be
much less expensive to maintain existing
industry than to allow it to disappear, and
then endeavour to bring in new industry.
As I said, it is not my intention to
speak at length on this bill. Only time will
tell whether the new standards will prove
to be more beneficial than the old. I do hope
and trust that it will not be too long before
we are able to say there are not so many of
these distressed areas. I come from one of
them, so perhaps I have a special concern
about them. I can tell you that it is an awful
thing to meet a man who is middle-aged or
past middle age who has lost employment
and has absolutely no prospects for the future.
You do not help him much when you say to

June 30, 1965

him, "You can get employment on a construction project," especially when he bas
spent 20 or 25 years building up some security
for himself and is then abruptly turned onto
the labour market. Such a man is in a
desperate situation.
It is my hope, as I am sure it is the hope
of us all, that this legislation is most successful. If it is discovered it does not go far
enough, then I hope there will be no hesitation
in broadening its scope so that it will apply
not only to new or expanding industry but to
any industry in such areas as are set forth
and which are in need of assistance.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

APPENDIX

(See page 321.)
MEETING OF COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERS, 1965-FINAL COMMUNIQUÉ
At the meeting of Commonwealth Prime
Ministers, which ended today, Pakistan,
Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia were represented by their Presidents. Britain, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia,
Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and Tobago,
Uganda, Malawi, Malta and The Gambia were
represented by their Prime Ministers. Jamaica
was represented by the Acting Prime Minister; Ceylon by the Minister of Justice;
Cyprus and Kenya by the Ministers of Externals Affairs.
This was the first Meeting at which Malta,
Zambia and The Gambia were represented as
Members of the Commonwealth; and the other
Commonwealth Heads of Government were
pleased to welcome them. The Prime Minister of The Gambia informed the Meeting
that it was his country's desire to continue
her membership of the Commonwealth after
introducing a republican form of Constitution
and to accept The Queen as the symbol of the
free association of the independent member
nations and, as such, the Head of the Commonwealth. The Heads of Delegations of the
other Member countries of the Commonwealth assured the Prime Minister of The
Gambia that they would be happy to recognize The Gambia's continued membership of
the Commonwealth.
The Prime Ministers took note that their
Meeting was being held during the International Co-operation Year which itself stemmed
from a proposal by the former Prime Minister of India, the late Mr. Nehru. They
recorded their sympathy with its objectives
and their desire to assist in its success.
The twentieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations fell on the last day
of the Meeting. The Prime Ministers sent a
message of greetings and of good wishes to
the Organization to mark this occasion.
The Prime Ministers recognised that the
Commonwealth, as a multi-racial association,
is opposed to discrimination on grounds of
race or colour; and they took the opportunity
of their Meeting to re-affirm the declaration
in their Communiqué of 1964 that, "for all
Commonwealth Governments, it should be an
objective of policy to build in each country
a structure of society which offers equal

opportunity and non-discrimination for all its
people, irrespective of race, colour or creed.
The Commonwealth should be able to exercise constructive leadership in the application
of democratic principles in a manner which
will enable the people of each country of
different racial and cultural groups to exist
and develop as free and equal citizens."
In the course of a comprehensive review
of the major current international issues, the
Prime Ministers noted with concern that,
despite the efforts of many countries to promote peace and stability throughout the world,
dangerous conflict, or the threat of conflict,
persists in several areas. They expressed
their conviction that in these circumstances
all possible steps should be taken to reinforce
the authority of the United Nations Organisation; and they discussed in this context the
question of China's representation in the
Organisation. They also reaffirmed their belief
in the importance of the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations; and they renewed
their support for the efforts now being made
by a Committee of the United Nations to
establish just and equitable principles for
authorising, organising and financing peacekeeping operations. They considered it essential that the General Assembly, when it reconvened, should be able to function normally.
They welcomed the voluntary and unconditional contributions which had been made to
the United Nations in order to help towards
relieving it of its financial difficulties; and
they expressed the hope that, as a result of
these and other actions, the United Nations
would be able to discharge its functions. The
Prime Ministers pledged their loyalty to the
United Nations, the success of which they considered to be essential to the maintenance
of world peace.
The Prime Ministers expressed serious concern over the grave situation in Vietnam
and the danger of its developing into a major
international conflict. They reviewed the
various efforts which had been made to
achieve a peaceful solution to the problem;
and, bearing in mind that the Commonwealth,
by virtue of its wide membership, represented
a very broad spectrum of opinion in the
world and that their Meeting was taking place

further progress of British territories to independent membership of the Commonwealth
since their last Meeting. They welcomed the
assurance of the Prime Minister of Britain
that it remained the objective of his Government to lead to mndependence, on the basis of
democratic government and the principle of
universal aduit suffrage, such of the remaining territories as desired it and could sustain
it; and that the British Government would
continue to seek to devise the most appropriate alternative arrangements for such
smafler territories as were unable, or unw.illing, to proceed to full independence.
In relation to Basutoland, Bechuanaland
and Swaziland the view was expressed that
such economic assistance and guarantees of
territorial integrity as were necessary to
maintain the territories as independence states
should be given.
As regards British Guiana, while differing
views are held on the constitutional arrangements best suited for the country, the Prime
Ministers welcomed the British Government's
intention to hold a conference later this year,
one of the tasks of which would be to devise
a constitution, and to fix a date, for independence. The Prime Ministers noted the
British Governent's recognition of the need
for adequate machinery to ensure human
rights and due judicial processes.
As regards the countries of the Eastern
Caribbean the Meeting expressed the hope
that the assistance urgency required to
strengthen their economies and ensure their
viability so as to enable them to sustain the
obligations of independence would not be
delayed by the discussions on political
arrangements.
Rhodesia
The Commonwealth Secretary informed the
Meeting of the attempts which the British
Government had made in recent months to
resolve the problem of the further constitutional development of Rhodesia. He explained
the considerations by which they were and
would continue to be guided in their approach
to the question of Rhodesian independence
and emphasised that central to these was the
necessity to provide guarantees that future
constitutional development should conform to
the principle o! unimpeded progress to majority rule, together with an imimediate improvement; in the political status of the
African population and the progressive elimination of racial discrimination. As they had
repeatedly made clear, the British Govern-

ment would only recommend to Parliament
the grant of independence to Rhodesia if they
were satisfied that this was on a basis acceptable to the people o! the country taken as a
whole. He emphasîzed the dangers of the use
of force or unconstitutional methods by any
party; and he reaffirmed in this connection
the policies o! the British Government as indicated in their statements o! 27th October,
1964, and 29th April 1965.
The Heads of Government of the Commonwealth took note of the Commonwealth Secretary's statement. They reaffirmed their previous statement that they were irrevocably
opposed to any unilateral declaration o! independence by the Government o! Rhodesia,
and further reaffirmed their insistence on the
principle o! majority rule.
While the Prime Ministers reaffirmed that
the authority and responsibility for leading
her remaining Colonies, including Rhodesia, to
independence must continue to rest with
Britain, they also reaffirmed that the question
of membership o! the Commonwealth by an
independent Rhodesia, or by any other newly
independent territory, would be a matter for
collective Commonwealth decision.
The British Prime Minister was urged by
other Prime Ministers to convene a constitutional conference at an early date, say within
three months, which ail the political. leaders
mnRhodesia should be free to attend. They
reaffirmed that the object of such a conference should be to seek agreement on the steps
by which Rhodesia might proceed to independence within the Commonwealth at the
earliest practicable date on a basis of majority
rule. In this connection they welcomed the
statement of the British Government that the
prmnciple of "one man one vote" was regarded
as the very basis of demnocracy and this should
be applied to Rhodesia.
An appeal was made for the immediate
release o! ail the detained or restricted African Leaders as a first step to diminishing
tensions and preparing the way for a constitutional conference. A further appeal was
made that the death sentences passed on
persons now awalting execution for offences
under the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act
should be respited.
It was further urged that, should the
Rhodesian Government refuse to attend such
a conference and to release the detainees, the
British Goverument should introduce legislation to suspend the 1961 Constitution and
appoint an interim Goverument, which should
repeal oppressive and discriminatory laws and
prepare the way for free elections.

SENATE DEBATES
The British Government said that they
were actively engaged in discussions with the
Government of Rhodesia; and they undertook
to take full account, in relation to these discussions, of all the views which had been
expressed during the Meeting. In this process
of seeking to reach agreement on Rhodesia's
advance to independence a constitutional conference would, at the appropriate time, be a
natural step. If the discussions did not develop satisfactorily ih this direction in a
reasonably speedy time, the British Government having regard to the principle enunciated by the Commonwealth Secretary of
unimpeded progress towards majority rule
would be ready to consider promoting such a
conference in order to ensure Rhodesia's
progress to independence on a basis acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.
The Prime Ministers renewed their call to
all leaders and their supporters in Rhodesia
to abstain from violence and to co-operate in
the work of fostering tolerance and justice,
as the basis of a society in which all the
inhabitants would be assured that their interests would be protected.
Economic Affairs
The Prime Ministers then turned to consider problems of aid and development. They
recognised that economic and social development constitute a long-term co-operative
enterprise in which all countries can work
together. The importance of economic planning in relation to development would call
for an increased supply of experts; and concerted measures would therefore be required
in order to enlarge and mobilise resources of
this kind by means of adequate facilities for
education and training.
The Prime Ministers appreciated the importance of programmes of economic aid to
the developing Commonwealth countries.
They took note of the contributions made to
such programmes by Commonwealth countries both collectively and individually; and
they agreed that these programmes should
be maintained and expanded as far as possible. They endorsed the concept of co-operative forward planning of development aid
which would apply not only to matching thé
assistance provided by the developed countries with the needs of the developing countries but also to the supply of personnel for
schemes of technical assistance, to which they
agreed that high priority should be given.
They welcomed the establishment of the
British Ministry of Overseas Development

June 30, 1965

together with the decision of the British Government to provide loans free of interest in
appropriate cases; they also expressed their
appreciation of the similar loans already
provided by the Government of Canada and
of the fact that the Government of Australia
makes its aid available wholly on the basis
of grants. It was suggested that, in those
cases where financial assistance would remain unused, or give rise to serious internal
problems, because of the inability of some
recipient countries to finance local costs,
donor countries should consider making financial contributions to cover a proportion
of such costs. The Prime Ministers recognised the importance of the flow of direct
investment to developing countries and expressed the hope that, insofar as economic
circumstances permit, the minimum restriction would be placed in its way.
The Prime Ministers recorded their satisfaction at the constructive outcome of the
Third Commonwealth Education Conference
in Ottawa last August; they looked forward
to an equally successful result for the Commonwealth Medical Conference which is to
be held in Edinburgh in October 1965.
The Prime Ministers agreed that effective
development is promoted not only by aid but
even more by trade. Moreover, they were
convinced that an expanding exchange of
goods and services, by emphasising the interdependence of the countries of the world, was
one of the most effective ways of promoting
the growth of international understanding
and the elimination of the causes of friction.
In further discussion of economic development in the Commonwealth, emphasis was
laid on the importance to the economies both
of Britain and of certain other Commonwealth countries of emigration to Britain
from those countries. The Prime Ministers
recognised that the extent of immigration
into Britain was entirely a matter for the
British Government to determine. The hope
was expressed that in operating such immigration controls as they might think necessary, the British Government would continue
to give preferential treatment to Commonwealth citizens; and they welcomed the
assurance of the British Prime Minister that
there would be no differentiation in any restrictions on account of colour or creed.
The Prime Ministers welcomed the work
which had been done since their last Meeting
in carrying forward the initial impetus to the
expansion of trade which was provided by
the United Nations Conference on Trade and

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

Development; and they pledged themselves
afresh to press for more outlets for the trade
of developing countries.
They stressed the importance to the development of the economies of member countries of the Commonwealth of the prices
obtained for their primary commodities, particularly where the prices of primary produce
fell in relation to prices of manufactured
goods. The low levels to which the prices of
cocoa and some other commodities have fallen
are a matter of serious concern to producers.
The problem of commodity prices extended
beyond the Commonwealth and the Prime
Ministers endorsed the need for consideration of the strengthening of existing international commodity agreements, where appropriate, and stressed the urgent need of
negotiating further agreements of this kind.
The Prime Ministers agreed on the desirability of exploring means by which Commonwealth trade might be encouraged and
expanded. One possibility would be to enable
Commonwealth Governments, in planning
their economic development, to take into
account each others' plans. An exchange of
information of this kind might enable production to be more effectively matched to
requirements in the Commonwealth and
thus increase trade between Commonwealth
countries.
The Prime Ministers accordingly agreed on
the following measures designed to further
these objectives, while at the same time
reaffirming their support for the Kennedy
Round of tariff negotiations now proceeding at
Geneva, which these measures wilI not affect.
They agreed to arrange discussions between
officials of Commonwealth Governments in the
first instance, with the help of the Commonwealth Secretariat, in order to examine these
issues further and to prepare for an early
meeting of Commonwealth Trade Ministers.
These official discussions could also pay
special attention to problems of individual
commodities of particular interest to Commonwealth countries, in order to see how far
policies could be co-ordinated within the Commonwealth with a view to appropriate further
action, whether on a Commonwealth or international scale.
They also agreed that subsequently the
appropriate Ministers or officials in Commonwealth countries should meet to consider the
extent to which each country's production and
plans, as foreseen, could meet requirements
in other Member countries.
Ministers decided to consider through the
medium of the Commonwealth Air Transport

Council means of promoting a closer understanding of the basic civil air transport
requirements of Member countries.
In addition the Commonwealth Secretariat
will examine the possibility of arranging for
the results of research to be shared more
widely among Commonwealth countries.
Commonwealth Foundation
At their previous Meeting in 1964 the Prime
Ministers considered that it might be desirable
to establish a Commonwealth Foundation to
administer a fund for increasing interchanges
between Commonwealth organizations in professional fields; officials were instructed to
consider this proposal in greater detail. At
their present Meeting the Prime Ministers
approved a report by officials and an Agreed
Memorandum on the establishment and functions of the Foundation which is attached to
this Communiqué.
Commonwealth Secretariat
At their 1964 Meeting Prime Ministers saw
a Commonwealth Secretariat as being a
visible symbol of the spirit of co-operation
which animates the Commonwealth and instructed officials to consider the best basis
for establishing a Commonwealth Secretariat.
At their present Meeting the Prime Ministers
had before them a report by officials which
they approved and an Agreed Memorandum
on the establishment and functions of the
Secretariat is attached. As already announced,
they have unanimously approved the appointment of Mr. Arnold Smith as the first Secretary-General.
COMMONWEALTH MISSION ON VIETNAM

Statement of Guidance
1. To enable the Mission to approach its
assignment meaningfully, there should be certain broad areas of agreement regarding the
requirements for ending the conflict in Vietnam peacefully.
2. There is already general agreement on
certain basic considerations:
(a) there is an inherent risk of the conflict
in Vietnam escalating into a wider war.
(b) for this reason there are grave doubts
as to an early or final solution by military
means.
(c) a comprehensive cease-fire and a conference of all the parties directly involved in
the situation seem to provide the essential
precondition to the solution of the problem.
3. Bearing in mind these considerations
and also the purpose of the Mission, it should

SENATE DEBATES
be guided by the following ultimate objectives during its consultations with the
parties principally concerned:
(a) a suspension of all United States air
attacks on North Vietnam;
(b) a North Vietnamese undertaking to
prevent the movement of any military forces
or assistance or material to South Vietnam.
(c) a total cease-fire on all sides to enable
a conference to be convened to seek a peaceful solution.
(d) the objectives of such a conference
might be to:
(i) end the war in Vietnam;
(ii) secure the withdrawal of all foreign
military presence from Vietnam and the
neutralisation of the area;
(iii) establish, for a period, an international peace force, under the auspices of the
Geneva Agreement, to safeguard peace in
Vietnam;
(iv) establish principles for the eventual
unification of the country through free and
internationally supervised elections.
Commonwealth Mission on Vietnam
The following statement was issued by the
Mission on 19th June, 1965:'The mission appointed by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Meeting is to explore the circumstances in which a conference might be held to end the fighting in
Vietnam.
Meanwhile, in order to create the conditions in which the mission can carry through
its work, the mission is appealing to all
parties concerned to show the utmost restraint in military operations as a step towards the total cease-fire which the mission
hopes will be established at the earliest possible opportunity. The mission would wish to
meet all the parties concerned.'
Commonwealth Mission on Vietnam
The following statement was issued by the
Mission on 24th June, 1965:Because of certain misunderstandings which
have gained currency during the last few
days, the Heads of Government of Britain, of
Ghana, of Nigeria and of Trinidad and
Tobago wish to clarify the basis on which
they agreed to form a Mission in connection
with the problem of Vietnam.
The Mission was appointed by the London
meeting of the Heads of Government of the
Commonwealth and on behalf of the Commonwealth as a whole.
The Commonwealth as such is in no way
committed to either side of the conflict in

June 30, 1965

Vietnam and has formed no collective view
except on the urgency of re-establishing conditions in which the people of Vietnam may be
able to live in peace. Although within the
Commonwealth there is diversity of opinion
on the Vietnam problem, there is complete
unanimity as to the need to find a peaceful
solution.
In the discharge of the task entrusted to it
the Mission will be guided by the views of
the Commonwealth as a whole and not by
the views of any individual member of the
Commonwealth.
It is in this context that the Commonwealth
is satisfied that its Mission must make direct
contact with all the Vietnamese parties. It is
re-iterated that positive steps should be taken
by all outside parties to exercise restraint in
military operations while the Mission is carrying out its task.
AGREED MEMORANDUM ON THE
COMMONWEALTH FOUNDATION

A Commonwealth Foundation will be established to administer a fund for increasing
interchanges between Commonwealth organizations in professional fields throughout the
Commonwealth. It will be the purpose of the
Foundation to provide assistance where it is
needed in order to 'foster such interchanges.
2. The Foundation will be an autonomous
body, although it will develop and maintain
a close liaison with the Commonwealth Secretariat. Like the Secretariat, the Foundation
will be accommodated at Marlborough House.
3. Within the broad purpose indicated
above, the Foundation will include among
its aims the following objects:
(a) To encourage and support fuller representation at conferences of professional bodies
within the Commonwealth.
(b) To assist professional bodies within the
Commonwealth to hold more conferences between themselves.
(c) To facilitate the exchange of visits
among professional people, especially the
younger element.
(d) To stimulate and jfcrease the flow of
professional information exchanged between
the organizations concerned.
(e) On request to assist with the setting up
of national institutions or associations in
countries where these do not at present exist.
(f) To promote the growth of Commonwealth-wide associations or regional Commonwealth associations in order to reduce the
present centralisation in Britain.

DEBATES

(g) To consider exceptional. requests for
heip from. associations and individuals whose
activities lie outside the strictly professionai
field but fail withln the general ambit of the
Foundation's operations as outlined above.
4. The Foundation could usefully develop
informai contacts with the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association. To avoid the risk
of duplication with the activities of existing
organizations concerned with cultural activities and the Press, the Foundation shouid
flot initially seek to assume any functions in
these fieids.
5. The policy of the Foundation will be
directed by a Chairman, who will be a distinguished private citizen of a Commonwealth
country appointed with the approval of al
member Governments, and a Board of Trustees who shouid be expected to meet at ieast
once a year. The Board of Trustees will consist of independent persons, each subscribing Government having the right to nominate one member of the Board. These
nommnees, even if officiais, wiil be appointed
in a personal capacity. The Commonwealth
Secretariat wll be represented on the Board
of Trustees by the Secretary-General or an
officer appointed by him.
6. There wiil be a fuil-time, salaried Director who wiil be appointed, initiaily for a
period of not more than two years, by Commonwealth Heads of Government coilectiveiy
acting through their representatives in ýLondon. He wiil be responsible to the Board of
Trustees.
7. The Director will require a smail personal staff: general office services wiil be
provided by the Commonwealth Secretariat.
8. It is hoped that Commonwealth Governments wilI subscribe to the cost of the Foundation on an agreed scale. Payment of the first
annuai subscriptions will be made as soon as
the Director has indicated that a bank account for the Foundation has been opened.
It is hoped that, in addition, private sources
may be wiiling to contribute to the funds of
the Foundations.
9. The accounts of the Foundation wiil be
audited annuaily by the British Comptroiler
and Auditor-Generai, whose report will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees. The
financial year of the Foundation will be from
lst July to 3Oth June.
10. The budget of the Foundation wiil be
subject to the approval of the Board of
Trustees.

AGREED

MEMORANDUM

COMMONWEALTH

ON THE

SECRETARIAT

I. Establishment of the Secretariat
Pursuant to their decision announced after
the conclusion of the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers' Meeting in July 1964 the Commonwealth Prime Ministers have decided to
establish forthwith a Commonwealth Secretariat. As envisaged in the communiqué
issued at the close of the 1964 Meeting, the
Commonwealth Prime Ministers see the Secretariat as being at the service of ail Commonwealth Governments and as a visible
symbol of the spirit of co-operation whlch
animates the Commonwealth.
II. Site of the Secretariat
2. The British Government wili arrange
for the Secretariat to be accommodated in
Marlborough House.
III. Functions of the Secretariat
3. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers
have given further consideration to the role
of the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the
following paragraphs record the functions
which they have agreed it shouid perform.
4. The Secretary-General and his staff
should approach their task bearing in mind
that the Commonwealth is an association
which enables countries in different regions
of the world, consisting of a variety of races
and representing a number of interests and
points of view, to exchange opinions in a
friendly, informai and intimate atmosphere.
The organisation and functions of the Commonwealth Secretariat should be so designed
as to assist in supporting and building on
these fundamental elements in the Commonwealth association. At the same time the
Commonwealth is not a formnai organisation.
It does not encroach on the sovereîgnty of
indivîdual members. Nor does it require its
members to seek to reach collective decisions
or to take united action. Experience has
proved that there are advantages in such
informality. It enables its members to adapt
their procedures to meet changing circumstances; converseiy there wouid be disadvantages lin establishing too formai procedures
and institutions in the association.

SENATE DEBATES
General Considerations
5. Both the Secretary-General and his staff
should be seen to be the servants of Commonwealth countries collectively. They derive
their functions from the authority of Commonwealth Heads of Government; and in the
discharge of his responsibilities in this connection the Secretary-General should have
access to Heads of Government, who will
indicate the appropriate channels of communication to them.
6. The Secretariat should not arrogate to
itself executive functions. At the same time
it should have, and develop, a relationship
with other intra-Commonwealth bodies.
7. The Secretariat should have a constructive role to play. At the same time it should
operate initially on a modest footing; and its
staff and functions should be left to expand
pragmatically in the light of experience,
subject always to the approval of Governments.
8. Against this background and in the
expectation that, as its contacts spread, the
Secretariat could expect to receive increasing
calls on its resources, the various functions
which it will exercise fall under the following broad headings: international affairs,
economic affairs and general and administrative functions.
International Affairs
9. Consultation is the life blood of the
Commonwealth association. At their Meeting
in July 1964, the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers expressed the view that on matters of major international importance a
fuller exchange of views could very appropriately be promoted on an increasingly
multilateral basis through the agency of the
Secretariat. They were particularly anxious
to ensure that there should be opportunity
for fuller participation by all member countries in the normal processes of Commonwealth consultation. At the same time they
showed themselves conscious of the importance of maintaining the unwritten conventions which have always determined those
processes. The Secretary-General will observe
the same conventions and act in the same
spirit.
10. In so far as Commonwealth Governments agree that the Secretariat should discharge any specific task, it will be fully at
their disposal. In general, however, its purpose will be to serve them by facilitating
and promoting consultation on matters of
common concern. To this end, subject to the

June 30, 1965

general principles set out in paragraphs 12
and 13 below, the Secretary-General will
arrange to prepare and circulate papers on
international questions of common concern to
all Commonwealth Governments where he
considers it useful to do so. It may also
prove helpful if, in consultation with the
Governments concerned, he arranges occasional meetings of officials of member Governments for the exchange of information
and views on agreed subjects. Such meetings
might on occasion, if member Governments
agreed, take place in various Commonwealth
capitals or elsewhere.
11. The general principles which the Secretary-General will observe are set out in
the following paragraphs.
12. The functions of the Secretariat are
envisaged as being inter aHa the dissemination of factual information to member countries on matters of common concern. "Factual"
information cannot be precisely defined; but,
provided that the Secretary-General proceeds
with circumspection in the exercise of this
function, he is authorized, where he thinks it
useful to do so, to prepare and circulate,
either on his own initiative or at the request
of a member Government, papers on international questions of common concern,
provided that these papers do not propagate
any particular sectional or partisan points
of view, contain no policy judgments or
recommendations by the Secretariat and do
not touch upon the internal affairs of a
member country or disputes or serious differences between two or more member countries.
In addition, the Secretary-General will, on
the request of a member Government, circulate papers submitted by that Government
on international questions of common concern, provided that, if these touch upon the
internal affairs of member countries or disputes between two or more member countries,
they will not be circulated without prior
concurrence of the country or countries concerned. The Secretary-General has discretion
to refuse to prepare or circulate any paper,
whatever its origin, which in his view propagates any sectional or partisan point of view
or would for any other reason be liable
to be offensive to any member country or
countries.
13. The position of the remaining dependent territories within the Commonwealth
is one matter which continues to command
lively interest among member countries. The
Secretariat could play a role in this field;
and it might circulate to member Govern-

June 30, 1965

SENATE DEBATES

ments balanced papers on the constitutional
advance of the remaining territories or on
their progress towards independence, on the
understanding that the responsible member
Governments would always be closely consulted in the preparation of the papers.
14. The Secretariat will be guided by the
principles outlined in the preceding paragraphs because it is important that it should
develop as a unifying element within the
Commonwealth. But, provided that it begins
modestly and remains careful not to trespass
on the independence and sovereignty of the
member Governments whose servant it will
be, it will be possible for it to grow in the
spirit of the Commonwealth association itself.
All Commonwealth Governments wish to
contribute to this process and will be ready
to assist the Secretary-General in every
possible way. In particular the SecretaryGeneral will from the outset establish close
relations with Commonwealth Governments
and with their representatives in London;
and Governments will arrange to keep the
development of the Secretariat's functions
under regular review, by means of an annual
report on its work. By these means the
Secretariat will gradually accumulate, with
the passage of time, a body of knowledge
and experience which will contribute to an
even closer understanding among member
Governments on those major international
issues which are of common and continuing
concern to all the members of the Commonwealth.
Economic Affairs
15. The Secretariat will discharge several
valuable roles in the economic field, the more
important of which are outlined in the following paragraphs. Several intra-Commonwealth bodies are already actively at work
in this field, and their relationship to the
Secretariat is to be examined in accordance
with the arrangements set out in paragraphs
23 to 26.
16. The Secretary-General will initiate,
collate and distribute to member Governments material bearing not only on economic
problems, but also on social and cultural
issues in respect of which the potential value
of his work could be considerable. He is
authorized to follow up the specialised factual
reports of the varlous agencies already at
work in these fields by promoting wider
ranging studies on, e.g., the inter-relationship
of agricultural and industrial growth in the
new Commonwealth. In this connection the

Secretary-General may implement such tasks
by commissioning, within the limits prescribed
by his approved budget, specialist studies
from outside expert sources rather than by
engaging additional permanent staff.
17. Apart from servicing meetings of the
various Commonweath economic bodies, the
Secretariat may, as appropriate, be represented at meetings of these specialised agencies in order to keep in close touch with
their activities; and it will also keep in touch
with the various United Nations agencles
whose work in Commonweath countries will
on occasion be of direct concern to it.
18. In connection with the general economic
aspects of the Secretariat's work, the proposals advanced at the last meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers for the initiation
of joint Commonwealth Development Projects
in individual Commonwealth countries are
relevant. The passage from the 1964 communiqué read:
"In particular they considered a proposal
that development projects might be launched
in individual Commonwealth countries, which
would be implemented by various members
acting in close collaboration and contributing
whatever resources-in men, money, materials
and technical expertise-they could most
appropriately provide. Such projects, which
would be additional to the support which
Commonwealth countries already provide to
the United Nations Special Fund and Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance,
could be directed to a number of different
purposes--the improvement of agricultural
production and the development of natural
resources through extension services, training
and research; the enlargement of professional
and technical training; the development of
new industries; and so forth. But they would
all be inspired by the common purpose of
promoting the development of the Commonwealth by a co-ordinated programme of joint
or bilateral projects. The British Government said that they would be prepared to
make a substantial contribution to projects
of this kind within their expanding programme of development aid. The other member Governments expressed support for the
objective of the proposal and agreed that
further consideration should be given to the
basis on which such a programme might be
established."
19. As regards the Secretariat's general
functions and, in particular, its activities in
the economic field, it is important that nothing

SENATE DEBATES
should be done which might disturb the
existing channels of economic and technical
assistance to member countries or duplicate
the present bilateral and multilateral links.
The functions of the Secretariat in connection with the Commonwealth Development
Projects are therefore expert and advisory
and will not detract from the right of member countries to determine their own aid and
development programs.
20. Subject to these basic considerations
the Secretariat will be able to play a valuable
part in assisting member Governments, at
their request, in advancing, and obtaining
support for, development projects and technical assistance in a variety of fields on a
multilateral Commonwealth basis, as appropriate. It will also help in the expeditious
processing of requests for such assistance
nade by one Commonwealth country to
another. In this connection, it will prepare and
make available to Commonwealth Governments up-to-date information on the possibility of securing aid and technical assistance
in various fields from individual countries of
the Commonwealth.
21. Thus the Secretariat, by accumulating a
reliable body of knowledge on the aid potential of the Commonwealth to which member
countries can usefully have recourse for the
purpose of promoting their own development,
will enable Commonwealth countries generally to co-operate to the maximum extent
possible in promoting the economic development of all.
22. In general, the Secretary-General, in
discharging his functions in this field of
economic and related affairs, will be guided
by the principles set down in paragraphs
12 and 13.
Proposed Review of Intra-Commonwealth
Organizations
23. A comprehensive review of existing
intra-Commonwealth organizations concerned
with economic and related affairs will be
carried out, in view of the changing nature
of the Commonwealth and of the fact that the
multiplicity of organisations working in these
fields has created problems of staff and
finance.
24. The main purpose of this review will be
to examine whether existing work on economic and related affairs is being unnecessarily duplicated; how far the activities of
the Specialised Agencies of the United Nations
now supersede those of existing intra-Commonwealth bodies; what Commonwealth
bodies might usefully be absorbed within the

June 30, 1965

Secretariat; which have functions so specialized that they cannot profitably be so
absorbed; and how close co-operation between
these latter and the Secretariat, particularly
in the light of the needs of the changing
Commonwealth, can most effectively be
achieved.
25. In order to secure an impartial appraisal and to protect the future relationship
between the Secretariat and other Commonwealth organisations this review will be carried out by a smal committee, appointed
by Commonwealth Governments, under an
independent Chairman. In order to safeguard
the Secretary-General's position he will not
be a member of the Committee. Nevertheless,
he will have the right to be present or to
be represented throughout the proceedings
of the Committee and to participate in its
discussions. The Commonwealth organisations
concerned will, of course, have the right to
submit evidence to the Committee.
26. Pending the outcome of the review the
Secretariat and the Commonwealth Economic
Committee will work in the closest consultation. Again without prejudice to the review,
the Secretariat will take over from the Commonwealth Relations Office as soon as convenient the secretarial functions which that
Department at present carries out on behalf
of the Commonwealth Liaison Committee.
Servicing of Commonwealth Meetings
27. The Secretariat, operating as the visible
servant of the Commonwealth association, will
carry out the task of servicing future meetings
of Commonwealth Heads of Government and,
where appropriate, other Ministerial and official meetings open to all members of the
Commonwealth. The Secretariat will be able
to rely on the host country for such secretarial
help as it cannot itself provide and for assistance in matters of accommodation, hospitality,
transport and the like.
28. The Secretariat will service the annual
conferences of the Commonwealth Economic
Consultative Council and meetings of the
Commonwealth Liaison Committee. The more
technical or specialised organisations, e.g.,
the Commonwealth Education Conference, the
Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee
or the Commonwealth Telecommunications
Board will, pending the proposed review of
Commonwealth organisations, continue to organise their own meetings.
29. As regards Meetings of Prime Ministers
the Secretary-General will henceforth serve
as Secretary-General to each Meeting. Subject to the principles set out in paragraphs
12 and 13 above, his duties will include the

June 30. 1965

June30. 995SENATE
DEBATES

preparation, collation and circulation of
papers on agenda items, together with such
background papers as appear appropriate, the
production of minutes; and, with the assistance of the host Government, the general
organization of the Meeting.
30. As to the preparation of the agenda
itself, the Secretary-General will be responsible for co-ordinating this process in the
light of such direct discussions as Commonwealth Heads of Government may find convenient. Heads of Government will maintain
the practice whereby the provisional. agenda
is drawn up, after consultation among themselves, in the formn of a it of broad headings
for discussion and they also reserve to themselves decisions on the timing and location
of their Meetings.
IV. Administrative Arrangements
31. In consonance with the above functions
of the Secretariat, its administrative organisation will be as follows.
32. The Chief Officer of the Secretariat
will be the Secretary-General, and ail members of the staff of the Secretariat will be
responsible only to him.
33. The Secretary-General wil be appointed
by Commonwealth Heads o! Government collectively. He will be a man o! bigh standing,
equivalent in rank to a Senior High Commissioner. A significant part of bis duties wiil be
visiting member countries of the Commonwealth.
34. The Deputy Secretaries-General will be
appointed by Commonwealth Heads of Government acting through their representatives
in London. One Deputy Secretary-General
will have the necessary qualifications and
special responsibilities for economic matters
and should deal, on request, with development projects. As the work of the Secretariat
expands, it may become necessary to appoint
a second Deputy Secretary-General who will
be prîmarily concerned with the other functions o! the Secretariat.
35. The paramount consideration in the selection of staff and in the determination o!
conditions o! service will be the necessity
of securing the higbest standards o! efficiency,
competenoe and integrity, due regard being
paid to the importance o! recruiting the staff
on as wide a geographical basis as possible
within the Commonwealth. The SecretaryGeneral will have discretion, in the light of
the above considerations, to appoint senior
staff to tbe service of the Secretariat from
among panels of names submitted by Commonwealtb Governients, who need not feel
themselves limited to Government servants
in submitting nominations.

36. The Secretary-General bas autbority to
make appointments o! junior staff, subi ect to
the approved budgetary limitations.
37. Ail persons appointed to the staff of the
Secretariat must be subject to clearance to
tbe extent that their own Governiments raise
no objection to their suitability for empîoyment. AUl members of the Secretariat, whatever their origin, must be lstrictiy impartial
in tbe discharge of their functions and place
loyalty to the Commonwealth as a whole
above ail other considerations.
38. Senior officers, including the SecretaryGeneral and Deputy Secretaries-General, will
be appointed in tbe first instance for not more
than five years and preferably not less than
three in order to, ensure continuity of administration. In determinlng the period o! tenure
o! otber individuel officers, the SecretaryGeneral will no doubt wish to bave regard
to the need to stagger appointments in order
to avoid a complete change o! senior staff at
any one time.
39. The British Government wiîil introduce legislation in order to give the Secretariat a legal personality under United Kingdom law and to accord to the Secretariat and
its staff the immunities and privileges whicb
are set out in Annex A.
40. Other Commonwealth Governments wll
take steps to accord corresponding immunities and privileges to the staff of the Secretariat wben visiting their territories, subjeet
to whatever constitutional processes are required.
41. The cost of the Secretarlat will be
borne in agreed shares by Commonwealth
Governments; the scale o! contributions hs
set out in Annex B.
42. The annual budget will be considered
by the Commonwealth High Commissioners
in London or their representatives, together
with a United Kingdom representative, meeting as a Finance Committee. The budget wiil
then be submitted to Commonwealth Governments for their approval. The Senior Commonwealth High Commissioner in London or
a representative o! the British Government
will be responsible for convening the Finance
Oommittee as necessary.
