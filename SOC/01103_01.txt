exceede ail previeus records, and the growth
cf our industries and internai trade keep
pace with the deveiopment cf our external
commerce.
Whilst in certain cf the western provinces
the cropa did not realize the sanguine expeczations which had been formed in the early
epring, yet the total yield was reasonably
satiefactory, and the eastern provinces in this
regard have been more than ordinarily
blessed. The conditions now existing over the
whole country conclusively deinonstrate that
even with lesser production at some points,
the vastness and variety cf our resources ensure at ail times a high degree of progress
for the whole country.
Negot.iationls for the acquisition frerm the
Âdmiralty cf the two cruisers ' Niche ' and
'Rainbow ' have been carried on with His
Majesty's goverument, and the two ships have
ncw arrived and are stationed in Canadian
waters, in pursuance cf the policy adopted
last session for the creation cf a naval service.
The Hague Tribunal, te which was referred
the controversy between Great Britaîn and
the United States, with reference te fisheries
iii Canadian and Newfoundle.nd waters, has
rendered a decision which has been accepted
hi ail parties interested as a fair aud equitable adj ustment cf this long-pending dispute.
The resuit is gratifying, inasmuch as it wili
tend -mot only te promote peace and frîendship between us and our neighbours, but aise
te further the practice of settling international questions by means cf arbitration.
Marked progress is being made in the construction cf the National Transcontinental

hoped that ere long a satisfactory arrangement can be made for «the operation of the
finished portions cf the line, pending the completion of the road from Moncton te Wannipeg.
The construction of a line of railway te
Hudson bay, which has occupied the attention
cf the people for many years, has cassumed
practicai shape. Already a contract h"a been
awarded for the construction cf a bridge
forming part cf this railway, across the Saskatchewan river at Pas Mission, and the work
is now iii progress. During the present sessien, a measure wiil be laid before yen providing for the prosecution and completion cf
tiiis work with ahl Possible speed. The connection of the great West with the eastern
portions cf Canada and aise with the over-

seas markets, by this new rail and oceam
route, w.ill mot caly open up a new section Of
Canada, but will greatly assist in the deveicpment of trade, and thns benefit both producers
and consumers.
The construction of the bridge across the

for the erection of the superstructure have
been received from four responsuble cernpainies. and are now being considered.
It is expected that the contract wili shortly
be awarded and tiie work pu-shed forward to
compietion.
Whiie recognizing the importance cf the
Canadian home trade axid the great value cf
the market for our staples in the Uniited
Kingdom, my govennment feel that they
shonld avail themselves cf every opportunity
to promote f.riendly commercial relations with
the British colonies and foreigu countries, so
that our surplus products may be admitted
into the marekts of those countries on the
most favourable terme.
In purenance of thie poiicy, commercial arrangements, involving -reductions of our customs duties, have been -made with Itialy and
Belgium and a reduced echedule cf duties bas
been granted te the Netherlands.
The desirability cf more equitable tariff arrangements, between the United States and
Canada has long been feit on tuis aide cf the
border. The commercial policy of the Republic has not hitherto favoured importe from
Canada. Wc have bought largely from the
United States, but they have bought much
less f rom us in returu. It je gratifying to
find that a more liberal policy is now flavoured by the neighbouring country, and that
the government at Washington express a desire to establ-ish better trade relations with
the Dominion. Following the negotiatiens
which teck place some months ago between
the President cf the Uinited States and my
government, the results of which were at the
time communica-ted to parliament, a furtiier
conference between representatives cf the two
countries lias been held in Ottawa. While ne
conclusions have been reached, and ne forinni
proposals made, the free discussion cf the
subject that has taken place encourages my
government te hope that at an early da.y,
without any sacrifice cf Caiiada's interests, an
arrangement may be made wh.ich will admit
mamy cf the produets cf the Dominion into
the United States on satisfactory termas.

NOVEMBER 22, 1910a

of trade and transportat ion between the British West Thdies and ,Canada has been held

Majesty, including among its members two
of my ministers. The report of the commission will be laid before you.

THE ADDRESS.
The order of the day being called:
Consideration of Ris Exoellency the Goverthe

Hon. Mr. ROCHE rose to move the adoption of the address.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-I think we are proceeding in a very irregular way. Before the
orders of the day are ca],led we Bhould deal
with the business under the headmng of
routine proceedings. The firgt notice of
motion on the paper is one by the right

hon. leader of tne House.
hon, gentleman does not wish to proceed
with it, he should rnove that the order be
postponed.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Probably it would be a convenience to the
House if I were ta move the appointment of
the nominating committee.
Hon. .Mr. POWER-This seems to be a
departure from the usue.l practice of this
House. The practice bas been that in accordance with what was supposed to be the
oourteBy due to His Excellency, the address
in reply to his speech should be considered
before any of the business of t.he House.
It will be seen that if we proceed with one
of those notices of motion we are bound, if
we wish to be consistent, Woproceed with
the whole, and the entire afternoon, which.
is supposed Wo be set spart for the consideration of His Excellency's speech, will be
devoted Woothcr matters.. It would be better to adhere to the practice o! dealing with
the Governor's speech first.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The course I was about to take was in
accordance with a suggestion o! one or two of
my hon. friends. I have no doubt my hon.
friend is strictly correct, and I will let the
motion stand. If my hon. friend opposite
bas no objection, we wvill proceed with the
order of the day.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-I have no objection whatever, but the notices of motion
should be called, and by courtesy allowed Wo
stand until after the adoption of the address.
The SPEAKER-The motion for the consideration o! the address should take precedence, as a matter of practice. It was
ordered to be proceeded with Wo-day.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-We have our order
paper and must follow it. If there is a
practice that we should discuss and dispose of the address first I amn quite willing
to let my notices of motion stand, but I
want to adhere to our raie. We have received petitions, reading of petitions and reports of committees were asked for a.nd of
course there were noue. Then reports af
committees were called for and notices of

inquiries and motions alsa.
through the routine proceedings to that extent, and when it camne ta notices af inquiries and motions they should have been calied and 1 was willing to let mine stand until
after the adoption of the address.
The notices of motion were allowed to,
stand.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE-I have risen for the
purpose of moving the adoption of the address in response ta the gracious speech oi
His Excellency the Governor General, and
I shall take the liberty of making a few
comments as I pass along upon the topics
contained in that speech. It is obvions that
the ancient sarcasm which bas been7 almoat
crystallized into a proverb-tbe speech is
more remarkable for -what it does nlot contain than for what it does contain-does not
apply ta this speech, ibecause it la replete
with interesting and weighty subjects f rom
beginning to end. His Exceiiency in a
very pleasant way alludes ta the mark of
distinction canferred upon him by His
Sovereigu in extending bis term af incumbency of the office af Governor General for
another year, and the pleasure -%hich bc

vince of Nova Scotia, which is the garden
of the world, stili the high prices which
have prevailed, have given to the horticulturist compensation for bis toil and
some ready money to purchase his necessaries. The fisheries have not been 80
prolific as in other years, but with the
high prics which have prevailed, the *fisherinen have been rewarded for their toil,
and have re-ceived a fair amount as a Teturn for their enterprise, skill and labour.
Another subject the Governor General
bas been kind enough to allude to in bis
speech is the arrivai of the «Niobe ' and
I went on board the
the ' Rainbow.'
' Niobe ' at Halifax and found ber a very
substantial sbip. Tbe officers are entertaining and ail the appointments are first
class. The guns and equipment are quite
suitable to that ship, and to instruct the
young men on board in ail the evolutions
required for great guns in ships of greater
hize and more formidable ini armament. 1
trust there will be no tears shed over sacrifices made by people wbo join the navy. I
believe there will be no recruiting in therural districts, that amongst the maritime
population there will be enough who will
avail themselves o! the training to bring
the complement o! the ship up to that
character whicb. will enable her to execute
ail the purposes for which. she is required
as the nucleus and the training ground for
the navy. On the Pacifie 'My Little Rainbow' bas arrived. I believe the people of
the province of the setting sun rejoice at
the arrival of a vessel o! the Canadian
navy and feel already a sense of protection
and gratitude that their interests have been
cared for and that ail their maritime concerns are under the surveillance of a power
adequate for thieir protection.
1 shall briefly allude to the ilague Tribunal and thé questions which were £ubrnitted to that tribunal for an award. It
is necessary, in order to understand that
question, to refer to -the conditions of tbe
Treaty o! 1783. In that year Great Bnitain ha-d just concluded a great war
'wbich had been carried on in aIl quarters
of thbe globe. On the one hand waa England and on the othezr hancV were France,
Spain and the United States. The war

waxed in importance, and had been identjfied with the interest of England. badi
terminated in disaster, and the people
were in gloom and apprehension. They
thought the Eun of England had set, that
it wou]d go back to be a vassal country,
that France and Spain wvould dominate,
as they had dominated before. and that
England would return to the days of Charles
Second a.nd James Second. People wbo
have lost some great possession are very
likely to throw eome very small one after
it, and so the plenipotentiaries of England
and the United States had some formai
negotiations. It seems that England had
to submit to a humiliation at that time,
but very fortunately at the moment the
UJnited States plenipotentiary to the Court
of Madrid arrived in Paris, Rodney
achieved hie memeraible vic4tory, givine
the Englisb a vantage ground which tlbey

to eut off from the Unitpd States all that

to divide it aruongst them, for the purpose
of indemnifying tbemselves for the cost
of the late war. In addition to that, they

This led to several divisions, and also
fishing intereats on the coaat. The British

Commissioner, Mr. Hartley, a member of
parliamient, had very littqe knowledge ef the United States and the fishermen of
Nova Scotia and between the authorities on
the concerns and interesta cennected with
fishing, or other iuterests, cf what were the subject of the privileges converyed under
this treaty. It 'was thought necessary and
supposed te be insignificant possessions
in the interest of peace that this treaty
of the British Crown in North America,
should be submitted to the Hague Tribunal
and they made concessiones which ought
for a settiernent of the suibject in 'contrenet to have been yielded. John Adams asversy, aud to the Hague Tribunal were subserted that as they had fished in commen

decided in favour of Great Britain, with a
reference to the Hague Tribunal or a committee thereof with regard to the reasonableness of the regulations to *be formed;
which. in fact rwas upholding the British
sovereignty and malntaining oui rights
over a very important and most essential
ele.ment ini the conduct of the fisheries.
The second question was :Have the
'United States a right to employ subjects of
other inations as a crew? The object of the
United States was to enable their fish-f
ing vessels to procure crews in Newfoundland, or to have foreigners as part of their
crews. This was decided in favour of the
United States; that under the treaty they,
had that liberty.
The thIrd question 'was: Can American
fisherinen be subi ect to light money, harbour dues, &c. Newfoundland had made
some extreme exactions in that way, and
had made regulations practically'excluding
American fishermen, 'and it was a loss to
them. That was decided in favour of the
United States, -the tribunal holding that
they were not subject to liglit dues, and
other exactions of that kind.
The fourth question was : Are Amenican fishermen, when ailowed to enter hanbour for shelter, wood and water, subjeet to
light money, and harbour dues? This was
decided in f avour of the United States with
a proviso.
The most important question was No. 5:
From where must ha measured the three
marine miles off any of the coaste or creeks,
and harbouns referred in said article.
Decided in favour of England and Canada. The ancient contention that they
were te keep three miles off the heads of
the amaller bays was upheld. The tribunal
decided that whenea bay was so large as
to lose that character, the line was to be
drawn over a separation of ten miles and
the thnee marine miles computed from that.
This was the most substantial contentioý
put forward by the British government.
The sixth question was: Have the United
States liberty te take fish in the baya, hanbours and creeks on that part of.-the south
coast of Newfoundland that extends from
Cape Race te a point on the northern and
western coast of Newfoundland. Decided in
favour of the United States, Newfound,
land's view being extreme.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

The seventh and last question was . Are
the vessels of the United States, which
resont te the treaty coast for the purpose of
exercising the liberty referned te in the
article of the treaty of 1818, entitled te
have for these vessels the commercial privilege accorded by agreement or otherwise.
This was decided in favour o! New!oundland. The tribunal held that the commercial privileges did flot extend te foreigu
vessels as weil, that if a vessel was engaged
ln a commercial voyage she could flot also
take up a fishing voyage, and if she were
engaged in fishing she could not be engaged in a commercial enterpnise. &o that you
see in three of the most important of these
contestations the Canadian-Bnitish case
prevails. Tis was a great triumph for
Canada and will be of lasting benefit te the
fishing inhabitants of the maritime shores.
The Canadian case was well prepared by
the Depsrtments of Justice and Marine and
Fisheries, showing the advantage of utiizing local knowledge, as compared with conducting negotiations apart fnom Canada.
The treaty of 1783 was conducted in the
absence of men of expert information and
very valuable righta were transferred te an
allen power for reason o! state, perhaps, in.
which we had no great interest. The Canadian commission that conducted these negotiations were the Hon. Mn. Aylesworth,
associated with Sir Wm. Robson, Sin
Robert Finley and Sir Jamnes Wint-ar, Newfoundland.
The gentlemen who prepared the evidence, were Messrs. Ewart and Tilley, the
Canadian officiais of the Fisheries Department participating, and a material advantage has accrued from their prolonged and
systematic labour. We-ought te congratulate ourselves on the material advantage
gained. That portion o! the 'wealth of the
sea is our rightful inhenitance, and we have
the moral satisfaction of knowing that the
pretensions put fonward by Canada werefounded upon substantial rights, and that
it was not a flimsy pretense, for the purpose of gaining an advantage-that it Waal
a right of sovereignty which. was asserted
and maîntained with calmness and dignity
and force, and which will avail Canada in
ail subsequent negotiations. We possess an
undoubted international right accorded to
us b.y a peaceful tribunal romposed o!.

retain that right. It will be useful to us
as showing from the prestige of aucces
upon this occasion that ail subsequent
conditions are founded on the sanie êubêtantial moral grounds and wîll redound
to the reputation of Canada.
The next topic I shail allude to is the
Transcontinental railway, a subject of
great intereat to every portion of the country. Our hopes a.nd fears are bound up
with the Transcontinental railway. Great
expectations have been excited in ail portions of the Dominion by its construction
and progrese and by the hope of hta early
termination and at the risk of trespassing

I shall quote the language of the speechthat the bridge across the Saskatchewan is
finished and the whole uine will be pushed
towards 'completion.
The next subject in which we are interested greatly ie the bridge at Quebec. It
was a ehock to the people of the whole couxntry when they heard that the Quebec bridge
had f allen, and although they grieved over
the loss of life and the postponement for a
time of this great enterprise there was one
universal determination, build the bridge
Up no matter what it costs, build it stronger,
that that link between the commerce of the
west and the commerce of the east may be
in a position to serve its purpose not only
as a material work, but to testify ta the
people of the east and west that the material bond which binde themn together cannot be severed and that the country wil
make every sacrifice to maintain those comimercial and friendly relations between al
portions of the great Dominion.
Allusion bas been made in the speech to
the trade of Canada with the United Kingdom, and also to the extension of trade
relations by a decreased tariff with Holland,
Beigium and Italy, but I think the interest
of those who are present will be more concentrated on the condition of trade with
Great Britain, because it je the mother
land, and because our trade with that country bas always been of considerable proporThe
tions and considerable importance.

that trade:

A subject of great importance, both to
the maritime provinces and to other parts
of Canada, and of great importance to the
United States also, is reciprocity in trade
between the United States and Canada.
There are differences of opinion on this
subjeet. In some portions of the country
they wish to lower the duty, and in some
portions they wish to have unrestricted reciprocity with the United States. In other
portions they require the tariff wall to be
kept up. I am informed that preliminaries
were conducted between -gentlemen sent
,from the United States to Ottawa to ascertain whether somie articles of consumption
might not be admitted at lower rates, or
f ree of duty. One of these gentlemen, alter
leaving Ottawa, has unfortunately passed
away from us, teaching us 'what shadows we
are and wvhat shadows we pursue. The conduct of the United States in the .past has
flot ibeen such as to invite confidence. Those
statesmen in the United States who have
guîded the destinies of the repu.blic had no
friendly feeling for Canada and no liberal
sentiment towards their neighbour. Their
policy has ýbeen to exact the uttermost f arHon. Mr. POCHE.

Some Teferen-ce has been made in the
.speech from the Throne to the trade between the West Indies and Canada. That
trade is increasing. We are taking- more

NOVEMBER 22, 1910
of the production ai the West Indies and
the West Indies are beginuing ta take mare
of ours. I trust that that trade will graw.
With botter means ai communication and
more knowledge oi the 'wants of the people,
trade will greatly increase in that direction.
Allusion is made ta the contîguaus waters
treaty, a treaty tending towards amicable
relations between the United States and
Canada with rezard ta public works on
Trivers and streams 'where the interests ai
the twa cauntries unite. I trust that that
will tend in the general direction ai peace
and goadwill, and alsa secure the best ma,
lerial interests ai the two countries.
This brings me ta a very interesting part
of the Governor General's speech, and that
is pramised lezislation in which we are al
going ta hare a part. Firat af aIl, a Bill is
to be int-roduced with regard ta banka and
banking. I may say the bankers af the Daminion have met and conferred and have
given their views as'to the best means of
banking, ta make it secure and popular and
satisfactory ta ail classes. They have laid
their views before the gavernment, and 1
believe the Rovernment has incorporated
thase.views in a Bill. It is ta aur satisiaction-we are proud ai aur institut ions-that
the banking systema ai Canada is being Tegarded as worthy ai consideration, and ai
imitation in the United States, that our
principles are superiar ta those on which
Ujnited States banks are iaunded, that
whereas some of the National banks ai the
United States have been embarrassed, and
twa or th.ree banks in London itself have
failed, no bank in Canada bas had ta succumb during the past year, showing the
stability ai aur institutions and that aur
ruodel is imitable, and probably will be
adoDted in that great country ta the south
ai us.
There is anather subi ect ai great intereat
Ia the west, that is the establishment ai
terminal elevators for the -protection ai
grain in transit. 1 have no daubt the gav,ernment would give assistance in that direction, and the legislation wiIl be ai great interest to thase portions ai thé country
which produce grain and ta other partions
which axe the fortunate receivers and transmitters ai that grain. Last ai aIl, legislation is ta, be submitted ta us for the regulation of labour disputes. We are aIl inter-

il

ested in the condition of the labourer, and
in the quieting of labour. A great desideratum would be attained if the labourera were
satisfied.that tribunals acted f airly and for
their interests. It behooves every one who
has influence with labourera to convey that
impression to their minds, that they are not
oppressed by capitalistsasnd that capitalists
do nat over-prevail in these arbitration
boards, but that the interests of the labourers are entertained and cared for and that
they are dear to the government and as
dear to any ai these tribunals as the interests of capitalists or any other class. It
is the duty of public men and the public
press to explain the sinister effeet of
strikes. Wàhen men are prevailed upon to
resort to brute force alDd violence, a strikze
is a calamnity in any community, and we
should endeavour to show its malignant
efiects, which flu upon women and children and heipless people. We will be conducting a good work and achievinig a favourable terminaticm if we pas. such legisiatian
as will be satisfactory ta the labouring
classes and quiet them and enable them ta
take their part in the development ai this
great country.
Again, ini conclusion, the Gavernor General wishes for us success and invakes the
aid of Divine Providence ta guide us in aur
deliberations. We ireciprocate and repeat
that prayer. The destinies of Canada are
great; a brilliant future is before it. Who
will have wisdom and strength to conduct
the multifariaus affaira ai this great country? We are assured that ' there is a
Divinity that shapes oui ends roughhew
them as we will,' and ta His guidance we
trust; but we oursélves must do our part-;
and if we work in combination, with wisdom, judgment and harmony, we will
receive ail the material advantages whicli
are before us in the destiny ai this great
country. But if, unhappily, there should
be firebrands-and I know some people are
beginning ta sow the seeds of discord-I
would remind themn that it was the torch
of a Roman legionary which destroyed the
temple that %vasforty-six years ini building-,

SENATE

to make Canada first among the nations of
the world.
Hon. Mir. BELCOURT (Translation)The task of seconding the address in
repiy to the speech from the throne
bad been entrusted, by the right hion.
the leader of this House, to our new
colleagu'e, the hon. senator for the division of Kennebec. Our hon. friend has
been prevented from fulfilling this duty
by an indisposition which, we hope, will be
slight and of a temporary nature, and we
trust that the pleasure we would have had
in hearing him for the first time in this
House, is but postponed for a future occasion. 1 wvas invited, at the last moment,
ta speak in bis place; consequentiy, being
completely unprepared, the remarks I have
ta offer must neccssari]y be brief.
His Excellency first alludes, in feeling
terins, ta the great loss sustained by tne
British Empire and the civilized, world, in
the death of HRis Mlajesty King Edward
VII. We recall, as if tbe event had occurred yesterday, the shock, the grief, nay,
the consternation with which we learnt, one
morning that our beloved king had breathed
his last. From ail points throughout the
vaat British Empire, and from ail the civilized peoples throughout the world, arose
a unanimous cry proclaiming the exaited
virtues of is Majesty and the glory of
the reign that had just ended. Ail were
unanimous in proclaiming that the deceased monarch had won the unbounded
affection, loyalty and admiration of bis subjects. When the king ascended the throne
of bis ancestors, world wvide wonder was
frît as to how Ris M-Najesty could 1add lustre
and eplendour to a reign ' caming immIediately after a period sa brilliant as that
of the Victorien era. But the king bad
no sooner taken the scepter in bis hand
than hie devoted bis undivided energy and
the admirable and uncomparable qualities
of bis magnificent diplomacy ta preach
and to teach contemporaneous peoples the
practice of union, good will, concord and
peace; and at the end of bis tao brief
occupation of the Throne, he had won, in
the fulfilment of this task, so verily worthy
of a king and so essentialiy humanitarian,
imperishable glory; hie had secured for bis
naine and for bis work, immortality. At
the time of his accession to the Blritish
Hon. Mr. ROCHE.

Throne, those who had cherished and
preached the doctrine of universal peace,
held but a wavering faith and uncertain
hopes in the.succesa of the cause; encouraged, however, by bis exainple and bis
success. they bad, at the turne of bis death,
regained faith, strong, robust and active,
and the cause of universal peace had made
great progress. From that turne, the ultimate realization of what is no longer looked
upon as a beautiful dream and an alluring
Utopia, bas been followed with greater
confidence and stronger hope. I amn a believer in its success, and lu the fact that,
sooner or later, sooner rather than later,
this dream wili becoine a real, active, and
positive reality. Peace lover thougb I be,
I arn none the less convinced that it is
absolutely necessary that any nation that
wishes to niaintain its place in the world
and uphold its integrity and honour, must
provide a comprehiensive system of national defence; and by national defence, I
mean the defence of the territory and of the
flag, the protection of the national domalu
in the interior and on the coasts, the protection of its trade routes, as well as of
the life and property of its citizens. I
must therefore confess that I understand
with difficulty, or rather net at ail, the
bitter and violent campaign pursued, in
certain quarters, against the -national defence policy of the present governinent. I
have followed attentively and with ail the
intellectual faculties at my disposai, the
different phases of the strif e and opposition offered ta the ministerial programme,
and I have vet to discover what solid arguments form the basis of this opposition.
I find it dîfficuit to convince myseif that
those wbo sa violently abject ta the government's palicy, are ready ta deny that a
nation is bound in honour, as well as by
interest ta prepare, orzanize and maintain
a systei of national defence. On the other
hand, those who now abject ta a naval
service, have long ago admitted the necessitv of a land service. We have had an organized land militia service for more than
fifty years, and we have, by unanimous
consent; constantly increased
and improved this militarv organization. Would
it not be expedient Vo inquire, from those
who abject to the naval service, what difierence in principle there is between it and

NOVEMBElI 22, 1910
the land militia service; why they countenance the latter and absolutely reject the
formerP If wue were like certain European
countries, completely surrounded by other
nations, if we had not a seaboard on twQ
oceans, if we bad. not vast waterways in the
interior and across our territory, if we had
not commercial routes on both oceans, if
we did not own immense and rich fisheries,
I might understand the objections of those
who would like to restnict our national defence to a mere land military service. Attacks may not be by land only; our shores,
our fisheries, our harbours are equally exposed to attack, I would even say mon?
exposed than the interior of the country.
We must not forget either that the Imperial government lias, by deg-rees, handed
over and entrusted to our cane the maintenance and protection of our naval stations on both oceans, and bias withdnawn
the garrisons whichi, until recent years, it
maintained in this country. We are therefore bound in duty and honour, to protect,
on land1 and on sea, thbe integrity, prosperity and future of our national domain.
Once more, I venture to ask tbose who
resist s0 violently the creation and maintenance of a naval servite, on what principles, on wvhat grounds they base their
Moreover, it
objection and opposition?
does not seem possible to me that objection can seriously be taken to the obligation for ail portions of the British Empire to assist the Imperial govennment, if
need be, to maintain and preserve the
integrity o! the flag which safeguards our
liberties, our rights, our lives and our
property. I do not believe there is a single
Canadian who would dare to pretend
sbould the British fiag be in danger,
should the British Empire be seriously
tbreatened, that the duty of Canada would
not be to join the othen parts of the empire, in ensuring- the maintenance of the
flag and o! the empire to whicb we belong. I cannot conceive that ther-e can be
any doubt expressed as to the necessity
!or us to defend our domain, and, in case
of common danger, contnibute, according
to our means and resources, to the safeguarding of the common cause, the comIn saying this, I have
mon interest.
merely mentioned the .material interest;
but for every self-respecting citizen thene

13

is also- the obligation which bis sense of
honour imposes. I hope, and moreover 1
believe that there does not exist in this
country a single subject of the empire who
ever -forgets that, after ail, we are members of the great imperial f amily; and
that, if we claimi and take advantage of
the privileges off ered to us by the imperil family, we also have the duty and
the obligation imposed upon us by hondur
and by our titie of members of that empire of contributing to the expenses and
obligations of this national and imperial
association; as in the case of every association which cannot be founded or exist
except on the basis of mutual contribution, calculated on the means of its members, and proportioned 0o1 the benefits derived therefrom. I repeat it, if the obligation for Canada to create and maintain
a naval national defence, is denied, the
obligation to establisli and maintain a land
military service must also be denied; and
this double negation would lead us to the
logical conclusion that we have no more
use for our militia, our ports, our naval
stations, and that but one thing is left
for us to do: .demolish the latter and
throw our ammunition and guns into the
sea. 1 do not know if those who persist
in the opinion that we are flot under the
obligation to establish and maintain a
naval defence service, have ever looked
into the question of what would happen
if the British Empire were seriously in
danger. If they have flot looked into it.
it seems to me that they have failed in
the most important duty imposed upon
them in examining, appreciating and dis-'
cussing this grave matter. If, as I have
just said a few moments ago, the existence
of the British Empire were seriously menaced, if the supremacy of the empire
should comne to an end, lias it ever been
asked what the fate of the Dominion would
be? Would there be a disposition to humbly beg f rom the American governiment,
a place among the States of the American
union? Would we be Teady to accept the
probably humiliating, if not disastrous,
conditions and obligations, which would
be imposed upon us in this role of mendicant? Moreover, in agreeing, under these
circumstances, to form part of the Ameni-

part, the necessity, for the estabishment
and maintenance ai a national defence imposes itself, and I cannat conceive hoiv
any doubt can be entertained for a moment in cannection Nvith the matter. But
it is abjected that the creation and maintenance ai a naval service would inevitably involve Canada in participating in
ail imperial wars, wherever they may take
place, whatever cause may have led ta
them, and whatever interest may be at
stake. This is a consequence which does
not logically follow the position taken by
the g-overnment, and the system itlhas

who are not blinded by vain words, by
mnere phantoms, or by dangers existing
only in the imagination af those by whom
they are evoked-it must be clear and evilent that w-e do not intcnd ta take upan
our jsh ouiders the obligéation af participating in ail the wars ai the empire.
If I ri2htly understand, and» there seenis
ta me no doubt about it, the intention ai
the governinent is ta organize the national
defence so as ta maintain peace inside and
outside of the Dominion, ta secure the protection af aur national territary and property, and moreaver, in case of danger for
the whoie empire, ta contribute, wfthin
the limit of its resources, 'ta the common
defence and ta the uphalding ai the Imperil fiag. It may 1m stippuse-d, witiot
attaching any doubt as ta the loyalty and
devotedness of Canada ta the empire that
difliculties may arise in India, for instance,
in Egypt, or other remote portions ai the
British Empire, in the suppression ai which
it would be neither just, opportune nor
necessary for Canada ta engage.
For my part, I repeat it, peace laver
though I be, confident as I arn ai the ultimate success ai universai peace, that, so
long as the warld's opinion is not Bufficiently eniightened ta put an end ta huge
armaments and ta exaggerate militarism,
it la the duty ai the Canadian people, as
ai every ather nation, ta assume the protection ai its territory and praperty.
1
cannot see howv the vast and ever increasing autonamy which we enjay and intend
ta hold, can suiffer by the creatian and
maintenance ai a naval service, or by the
placing of aur means ai defence at the disposai ai England when the interests ai the
empire ta which we can nover be indifferent, are rnenaced or scriously endanigered.
I believe that, for reasons on which it
is useless t-a insist, the nature ai the
naval service whichi the goverinent lias
introduced in this country, bias been falsely
interpreted and grossly misrepresented. I
am convinced that, when light is thrawn
upon the subject, when public opinion is
quietened, and when the minds ai the
people are freed framn the delusian and
terrorism imposed upon theni, public sentiment will reassert its-eli and irom one

,tic. It must be remembered that, in connection with the naval service, history,
as in many other instances, but repeats
itself. Ail will recail that the land military service bas been for a great many
.years, the object of serions opposition and
pronounced antipathy from a certain number of people. However, to-day, nobody,
not even those who are violently opposed
to the naval service, entertains anLy opposition to the land military service. It wili

frankly, 4to have light Vohrown upon the
inatter, and I amn convînced that this wilI
happen ere loni.. The naval service wil]
be accepted, just as the land military
service bas been.
I have but a few minutes left to say a
word on sonie of the other subjects mentioned in the address. A reciprocity treaty
with the Unite-d States, if one can be concluded to the advantage of Canada, would
be but the necessary complement of the
eninisterial programme. The present governiment bas concluded a treaty of commerce with France which will certainly
procure considerable advantages. It bas
also concluded, with Belgium, Italv and
Holland, commercial agreements, whicb
will no doubt contrîbute to the increase of
our trade and to the prosperity of the country. The objections advanced in certain
localities against negotiation of a reciprocity treaty with the United States, rather
appear to be iiispired by a feeling of wounded seif-pride on the part of those who believed there was cause for humiliation for
us in the fact that the government of the
Republic had, up to the last few years,
re*jected our offers of negotiation. It would
to my mind be a serions mistake to refuse
to negotiate with our neighbours for the
purpose of increasing our commercial relations with them. There exists to-day,
in the United States, a pronounced feeling
in favour of reciprocity; there is a desire
for a reduction of the American tariff, and
there is an evident wish for an extension
of commercial relations wîth us. It must
not be forgotten that, on this occasion, our
neighbours took the initiative, and that it
was they who first applied to us. It would
be, te my mind contrary to our national
interests to refuse to enter into the pro-

We may feel assured
that our government will nlot propose, and
if it did, we shall always have liberty to
reject, a fiscal agreement against the interests of the country.
For a.great many year., the citizens of
the western provinces, have been demanding the construction o! the Hudson's Bay
railway. I am noV competent, nor have I
the experience necessary to express an
opinion on the real value and probable
succesa which may be expected from this
new transportation 'route. What. we know
ia that, if the wèstern provinces believe
that this railway is necessary for their
commerce and prosperity, if they insiat
on its construction, they should defray
the cost of it themselves; for, as everybody knows, the railway is to be bult by
means o! the sale o! lands reserved for
that purpose by the Dominion government,
and these lands are ail situated in the
west. After consulting the latest report
of the Department of the Interior, I notice
that the product of the sale, up to date,
amounts to nearly 22 millions, and if we,
add to this- surn the interest accrued on
the product of these sales, ail belonging
to the western provinces, it ivill be seen
that the total suma requîred for the construction is already at hand, the estimated cost thereof havîng been estimated
at 25 millions. We may therefore without
hesitation express our complete approval
of Vhis undertaking of the government.
With reference to the treaty in connection with the international waterways between the UJnited States and Canada, to
the Act based on these negotiations and
the resultant treaty, I would wish, if there
is yet time, Vo propose to the government,
to introduce into the treaty or into the'
Act, certain provisions with a view to
putting an end to that crime against
nature, on which I addressed the House
in the course o! lest session-I mean the
contamination and pollution of our greet
fluvial arteries, by the criminal deposit,
practised at ail times and stili continuing
to-day, of sewerage from aIl parts o! the
territory bordering on these weterways.
It ia high time thet our great weterways,
our lekes and streams cease to be used
as sewers, generating and spreading the

SENATE

contagious diseases from which we periodically suifer. I arn convinced that if the
commission, which has chargeý of the protection and safeguarding of the international waterways, was requested to take
this matter in hand, a solution would be
found equiitable and salutary for the
United States as well as lor Canada.
There is another question noV mentioned
iu the speech from the Throne, on which,
if -I am allowed, I would like to say a
word. I would not dare raise the question, if it were not the subject of almost
constant discussion iii the press and elsewhere, and if, during each session, the
discussion of this question were not imposed upon us in this flouse and elsewhere: I mean the question generally
known as 'The reforma of the Senate.' For
a number of years this honourable flouse
itself bas been stirred by this persistent
controversy, and bas itself discu-âsed at,
a certain length what wvas meant thereby
and what would be the best thing to do
I have up to
iu connection therewith.
now been careful not to take part in the
discussion, because as a new comer here
1 felt that I did noV possess the required
knowledge - -of parliamentary procedure
as it applies more especially Vo the Senate. Moreover, I thought it was wise and
prudent Vo allow the old and experienced
members Vo express their opinions before
expressing my own. I would request however, that I should to-day be permitted Vo
offer my appreciation on this grave and
important question so persistently discussed, so continuously raised, and Vo
which some day, sooner or later, a solution must be found. I believe that to this
flouse especially falîs the duty of considering and dîseussing the question, and
that it is in this flouse that the solution
of the difficulty will be the more readily
found. I hasten to state that, in my mind
the words ' Reform of the Senate 'are flot
exact. I do not believe that the Senate,
as it is .constituted to-day, needs reform;
1 believe, on the contrary, that the SenaVe as it is constituted Vo-day, contains a
selection of men as qualifled and as representative as it is possible Vo find for
the working of parliamentary mechanism,
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

and if to-morrow if the present senators
had to be replaced, I do not think it would
be possible to make a selection of men
more competent than those who occupy
the senatorial seats to-day. It is flot so
much the Senate itself which it would be
wise and prudent to alter, but the mefXiod
or mode of selecting the senators. I have
no hesitation in saying that, for my part,
after having given the subi ect my best and
constant attention, the Senate wlll neyer
be what it ought to be; that it will neyer
exercise the influence and authority it4
ought to exercise, so long as the senators
are chosen as they are to-day. Direct election by the people is the principle which
ought to be substituted for the present
method. With institutions as essentially
demnocratic as ours, a Senate chosen by
the executive and appointed for if e, seems
Vo me an anachronisin. I do not pretend
to, submit to-day or even later a detailed
plan of the manner in which these elecions could or should be made; I simply
desire to be :permitted to-day Vo, express
my personal opinion, that the solution of
the difficulty is to be found in a mode of
direct election by the people; and I would
wish that-following the example ot the
House of Lords; which, at this mome~nt,
bas taken in its own hands the task of
conforming to public opinion in Englandour Senate would deal with and decide
for itself the question which it has been
ag-reed to call the reform of the Senate.
In concluding, I regret having tried
your patience, hon. gentlemen, especially aiter my promise, at the start,
of being brief in rny remarks, and 'I
join with His Excellency the Governor
General in askîng and in praying for the
blessings of Providence on our labours

REVISED EDITION

SENATE
THE ADDRESS.
DEIBÂTE RESUMED.
The order of the day being calied:
Further consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General'a speech on the occasion of
the opening of the Third Session of the Eleventh Parleament, and of the motion of the
Hon. Mr. Rche, seconded by the Hon. Mr.
Belcourt, that an humble Âddress be presented to Hlie Excellency the Governor General in
anewer thereto.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It may seem
somewhat strange that it invariably fails
to the lot of the particular chair which 1
happen to occupy to be the first to congratulate hion, gentlemen on the oppositè
Bide of the House to whorn ie çelegated
the duty of moving and seconding- the address and to speak in ternis of.courtesy, of
compliment and of cong-ratulation of the
manner in 'which they discharge their diffocuit duty. It gives me very great pleasure to express my sense of appreciation of
the manner in 'which my hion. friend from
Halifax moved, and my hon. friend fromn
Ottawa seconded the address. It je entirely
unnecessary for me to speak in complimentaxy termes of- thosehon. gentlemen for
the purpose in any way of encouraging
them in the performance of their duty in
this Chamber, hecause they are both veterans in political life and seasoned speakers,
both on the platform and on the floor of
parliament. I regret to some extent that
the original programme as outlined, and as
appeare upon the address, was not carried
out, s0 that I could extend my congratulations ta my hion. friend from Kennebec who
has been recentiy introduced into this
House, and who has corne out from the
storm and stress of weather that seems to
be biowing up within the political boundarles of Drumrnond and Arthabaska. 1 have
to congratulate that hion. gentleman upon
hie reaching this Chamber at Nvhat 1 might
caîl the psychoiogicai moýnent. That hion.
gentleman seeme to have had a measure of
foresight with which the government itself
has not been bieseed, and I congratulate
hlm that hie so exercised hie foresight as
to escape from the wrath to come. Had the
government displayed the same foresîght
which my hion. friend from Kennebec has
exercised it le needless to say my hon.
friend would not be ln this Chamber at the
Hlon. Mr. LANDRY

present moment, but would doubtless be
like many of bis compatriote from the province of Quebec, wondering what a day may
bring forth, calling upon the mounitains and
the hlls te faîl upon them and to hide
them from the indignation of the electorate
of the province. If the government could
have rolled back the ecroîl and foreseen
what did happen in my hion. friend's native
county, we should not have had the opportunity of discussing a very intereeting recent political event in that province.
I wae particularly struck with what my
hion. friend from Halifax said yesterday as
to the undesirability of fire brande promoting racial and religious differences in Canada, and by the remarks of my hion. friend
from Ottawa teuching the samie question,
when in a rather more diplomatie way, lie
expressed regret that many of the peopie
of Canada did not thoroughly nnderstand
the varions important principies invoived
in the Naval BiII of hast session.
I muet say that while I have been more
or hese in touch with political hife for some
years past, more than necessary attention
has been given te what seeme te bie a very
large stock in trade of many of the political
leaders of the province of Quebec. I amn
surprised at my friends of the Liberal party
manif esting such hysteria, et the alle.-ec
disloyaity of their compatriote within that
province. Ever since I can recollect political events ln Canada, my attention has been
more or hese directeci to the fact that this
kind of thing le te a very large extent indulged in in that province at every by or
general election, and while I am not prepared to say that the party to which I bolong bas absoiutely kept its ekirte clear of
ail charges which might be made along
these particular linos of racial agitation
yot I have no hesitation whatever in saying,
that the greateet sinners of ail have been
my hion. fionde opposite.
No party within this Dominion lias
profited more by promoting agitation of
this character than the Liberal party. It
je within the recollection of every hionourable gentleman present thýat prominence has almost always been given to this
particuhar clase of political warfare in the
province of Quebec. The chief aluner of
ail has been the Prime Ministor himeîf. I

ask hon. gentlemen, even tbose who may differ from me, as te the cause to which they
ascribe that the present Prime Minister o!
Canada leads bis politioal party in his
present capacity, is it not iby reason of
his commanding practicaly a solid majority from, bis nqtîve province, a majority
that exceeds bis majority in parliament, a

other questions. Mr. Perrault, the government candidate in Drummond and Arthabaska, the gentleman who was the mouthpiece of the government and seeking the
suffrages of the people of the constituenCy
said:
Our fleet is not, and never will be. imperialistic; it is a step towards the independence of
Canada.
Again enother candidate, a member of
the provincial House at Quebec declared
that :' It was a step towards the independence of Canada,' for offly a nation
could have its own navy :
Now, I ask myself the question as to
where this charge o! disloyalty belongs. I
ask, is it more disloyal for the Nationalist
party of the province of Quebec, represented
by Mr. Bourassa and his friends, to have
strongly taken the position that the Naval
Bill ehould have been submitted to the vote
o! the people of Canada, that the present
autonomy of the provinces of Canada sbould
be maintained in its integrity as against the
imperialistic movement which seems to be
paramount at the present time, than for
the frienda o! the government to represent
to the people of Quebec that the government, by establishing a navy, bas taken the
first step to sever the ties which bind this
Dominion to the mother country. lIn this
country of free thought and free speech the
cha.rge of disloyalty should not lie against
those whoc maintain that the present autonomy should be continued in its integrity
any more than it could be said that the
Little Englander is dîsloyal to the empire
to which he belongs. There wvas a time
when Bright, Cobden and Gladstone strongIy advocated the severance of the colmiîes
fromn the empire, and particuiiirly ti.e IDominion o! Canada. lIt was well linown. and
will ha found in the memoirs of flic late
Goldwin Smith, that at the tinte of the
civil war ini the United States, Bright and
Gladstone suggested that for the purpose of
propitiating United States sentiment and
bringing it into harmony with that of Great
Britain, Canada should be severed f rom the
empire and lianded over to the American
republic. Would it be thougbt that Bright
and Gladstone were necessarily disloyal, or
that as British citizens tbey were less ezititled to the respect and confidence of that

copoeia, in anticipation of some coinpound, or seme composite %trade theory
being found to meet the divergences and
the irreconcilable views of the Liberal
party.
I should like to ask my hion. friend
opposite are we to pare down the present
tariff until we reacli a revenue tariff basis,
as was our experience previcus te 1878, or
are we te prepare the way by further paring it down se that the Prime Minister may
be able to redeem the promises he made to
the people cf Canada previcus to the elections of 1896, namely to introduce into
Canada free trade as it then was and as it
is in England, or are we to further experiment with it so thet the Prime Minister
may be able to redeem the promises whicli
he made to the farmers of the Northwest
upon his recent pilgrimage to that country, when hie apologized for the existence
cf the present tariff as simpIy an expedient
te answer the purposes cf the time being
and with which he was net et *al1 in sympathy, but which. he hoped in course cf'
time weuld give way to the free trade system as* they have it in England, and as
advocated *by the Manchester school cf
which he was a disciple. The Prime Minister informed the people cf the west that
he was thoroughly in sympathy with that
particular school, with Cobden, Bright and
Gladstone, and that he hoped the time
would shortly arrive when there would be
a supersession cf our present fiscal system.,
in
by that
which
to-day
obtains
Great Britain. May I ask, hon. gentlemen
what about the preferential tariff in view
cf those other experiments? Is thîs system, which lias been extolled by the gevernment-from the time of jts introduction
down to the present moment, to be slxipwvrecked *by the many side winds and the
shoals towards which the government
seems te be drifting., with a view cf wrecking it. This is the idol cf the Liberal party
upon *which they stumbled in 1898, whcîx
it was the intention of the governinent to
extend the preference to ail countries having a lower tarif than our ow n, but
by reason cf constitutional difficulties
found it necessary te èxtend to England
exclusively the preferential tariff which
to-day she enjoys. Why did net the representatives cf this government at that

time insist upon that preferential tariff
being a mutual one? I venture to say
that if the governinent of Canada in 1898
had taken strong greund upon this question -mutual preference would have te-day
existed between the Dominion cf Canada
and Great Britain ; but there was a sinister design 1 venture te say in the gevernment adepting the pelicy which it did.
in saying that Canada did net want anything in return, that it was opposed te
mutual preference. If mutuel preference
had been established at that time, if reciprocal trade relations had been established
between Great Britain *and Canada. the
governinent would riot have had the free
hand that it has since enjoyed te tinker
with the tariff and to try ail the fiscal,

manifesto--and the lion, gentleman can
ea-sily verify tbe correctness o! that statement if hbe chooses-that it bardly becomes
tbem to burl taunts of disloyalty promiscuously in the Huse. The thing was done in
former days once or twice in the other
Chamber, and after I took the trouble to
read a little list o! the antecedents and performiances of some of the hion. gentlemen
wbo were sitting opposite me, the charge o!
disloyalty was dropped, and I would advise
my bion. friend that be migbt as well drop
it on the preserit occasion. My bion. friend
takes another ground anid says-and I
tbink bie says rightly-tbat it is in the bighest degree desirable and expedient, in a
country like Canada, that Nve in ail possible
ways and in ail possible fashions nurture
our national spirit, that the national spirit
is a precious possession of any country,
and that it is a misfortune that in some
parts of Canada we are not as hornogeneous
as other countries bappen to be. I prize
the national spirit of Canada as highly as
my hion. friend or any man. I arn a Canadian and I believe bie is a Canadian. I
am a Canadian through and througb and I
bold the bonour of Canada dear as I hope
and 'trust every member o! both bouses in
this parliament will do, but any one wbo
bas care!ully observed the progress of Canada during tbe last fourteen years and the
position whîch the present Prime Minister
o! Canada occupies in the eyes of the world
at large, will bear me out in saying that no
man bas done more to promote the growth
of a national spirit in Canada and to bring0
Canada prominently before the eyes of the
world than Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Touching the recent events to wbicb the
hion. gentleman devoted so much attention
in the earlier part of bis speech, events
wbicb followed the valuable addition wbich
we bave just bad to the ranks of the Senate,
I would say to the lion. gentleman that I

that point. For rny own part, I am not at
aIl sure that the results of the election in
Drummond and Artbabaska, nrÉich I may
allude to, as hie bas alluded to tbem, 'will
not prove, on the wbole, a blessing in disguise. I think it will tend strongly to

the opportunity to the friends of Canadian

extreme position which was taken up in
that respect by the gentlemen wbo opposed
the governinent candidate in Drummond and

these gentlemen, when they appeared in another part of the country, were pleased to
disavow, and very pointedly, ail the statements that lied been attributed to them in

of the French Canadians. If my hon. friend,

gentleman declared himself-and I daresay
declared himself correctly-to be quite as
loyal a man as any member of His Majesty's opposition, the lion. gentleman and
his friends not excepted. Taking the whole
thing aIl aoeound, I think the bion. gentleman will not find that any very great accessions of strength, particularly in the province of Ontario and 'in the western provinces, are likely to corne to bimself or bis

V. 'The Canada Gazette' lias not at any time
frem the lGth of April. 1910, up to this date
published the Frenchi Version cf the sixty Acte
heQreinbefore cited.
And inquired of the government.
Why, in face cf the positive Order cf this
House, lias the Minister who controls the publocution of 'The Canada Gazette' not thought it
hie duty ta grant the Frenchi element cf this
country that measure of Justice wh.oh the conetitution that governe ue guarantee to it P
ls it the intention of the government ta
persist in this denial of justice or to g*v its
officera the order to ccmply with the ob1ý;ation
which both the lawe of the country and the
orders of thie Houe impose upon .them?
He said: I do net pretend that the minister himseli
lias refused in the past
I arn askor would refuse now what
ing to-day, -but there must be negligence samewhere, and if the officer who
publishes the 'Canada Gazette' knows bis
duty, I thinklihe should perfarm the obligations wich are iniposed upan hias. French
and Englieli are the two officiai languages
cf Canada, and if the English people have
a riglit te have their laws published in
Englieli, the French element of this coun-

try have an equal riglit, and I dlaimi it as
a right, net as a faveur.

We are asking

what was promised and what was given
ta us when we entered confederation. It
was known at the trne thaf7the province

had been granted te us. I desire that
the pact inta which we entered be respected, and where we have any riglit that At

asking many times less than we are entitled to.
Hon. Mr. WATSON--Order, the hon. gentleman should flot make a speech on an

right.

Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Does the hon. gentleman persist in his point of order?
Hon. Mr. WATSON-If according to the
rules it is open to debate an inquiry of
chis kind I have nothing to say, but I didl
not think an hon, gentleman making an
inquiry had a right to make a speech.
How.ever, I admit I arn not posted on the
rules.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-I accept the admission of the hon, gentleman and 1 hope that
at another time when he does flot know
the rules he will not raise a point of order.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-AUI right. I wiiI
not be like my hon. friend.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-We are only asking
what is our right and what we dlaim as a
right to the French elernent in this Dominion. The laws are published ini English
and in French. They corne from the House
of Commons in both Frenchx- and English.
We cannot pass them here unless they are
printed in both languages. What 1 arn asking for here is not. for the province of
Quebec alone, but for the whole Dominion.
~Vhen the English version is prmnted in the
' Canada Gazette ' for the English speaking people of this country, I dlaim that the
French version should be printed for the
French speaking people also, not for the
people of Quebec merely, but for the benefit of the whole Frenchi population-of the
Dominion. We have lawyers and others
who like to know what the law of the
country is, and as soon as those statutes
are published in the ' Canada Gazette ' in
the Engflish lang-uage, I renew my claini
that they should be published in French.
I cali the attention of the minister to the
fact that we passed a resolution last year
on that subject, and I hope that in the
future whenever a law or ordinance of any
kind is published in the ' Canada Gazette'
in the Eng-lish lan.guage it shall also be
published in the French language.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
reply to the hon. gentleman's ques-In
tion I rnay say he is quite correct in saying that as far as possible the publication
should be made simultaneously.
Hon. Mix. LANDRY.

Under the provisions of section 32 of
chapter 80 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, ' The Public Printing and Statîonery
Act', responsibility for the publication of
the statutes of Canada and of the ' Canada
Gazette' is placed by parliament upon the
King's Printer, without any control or
direction of any minister of the government in that respect.
The publication of the statutes in the
'Canada Gazette' is a matter of temporary convenience for the benefit o! the public prior to their being issued in bound
volumes.
It has not been the practice since confederation to publisli the statutes in French
in the ' Canada Gazette '. However, a resolution of the Senate, dated the l4th of,
April, 1910, directed that thereafter statutes
should be published in the French as wel
as in the English language. Since the l4th
of April, 1910, statutes have been received
at the Printing Bureau, certified by the
Clerk of the parliaments. under his seal of
office, for prmnting, as follows, viz:
English-Chapters 71 to 150 inclusive,
May 12, 1910. Chapters 151 to 177, May 13,
1910.
French-Chapters 71 to 176 inclusive, May
13, 1910. Chapter 177, June 18, 1910.
These statutes were not published in
French in the ' Gazette ' mainly because the
copies received for that purpose on the
dates above referred to contained numerous errors. The copies were returned for
correction and it was not until the l5th of
July that the last of the corrected copies
were received at the Printing Bureau. 'At
that time the work on the annual volumes
of the statutes had so f ar advanced that
it was evident that the French and English versions might appear together, and
as a matter of fact their sirnultaneous publication was made on the 3rd of August,
1910.
If the French statutes had been publish'd in French in the ' Gazette ' a delav of
from three weeks to one month in issuing
the bound volume would have - occurred.
As it was the French statutes were pub
lished complete within ten days o! the time
within which they could have been published in the ' Gazette.'
Hereafter the French statutes wil] ap-

MILITIA REGULATIONS AND ORDERS.
INQUIRY.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY inquired o! the governmént:
1. How does it happen that it has been
necesaary to wait until the 5th of November,
1910, to pnblish in French in the 'Canada
Gazette' the King's Regulations and Orders
for the Militia of Canada, 1910, which have
been in force sinçce the l2th February last,
the date of their promulgation ini English in
the 'Canada Gazette'?
2. Why have the said Regulations and
Orders only been published partially in
French, when it has been thought necessary
to publish them. at full length in the English
language?
3. Does the government intend to cause to
bie published immediately the whole of the
French version of the Regulations and Orders
in question?

proofs for the French version were not signed to print by the department until the 12th
of November, 1910. The English version
was Gazetted on the 12th of February, 1910
and three-fourths of the French version
was Gazetted on the 5th of November, 1910.
The printing of the French version is not
yet complete. The balance will be inserted
in the ' Gazette' on the 2eth of November,
1910.
The reply to question No. 2 is: About the
Ist of October, 1910, work was begun on the
supplornent of the ' Gazette,' issued on the
5th of November. which contained the first
instalment of the French version of the
regulations, but as it wvas seen that if the
regulations were published in one issue it
would greatly delay publication of the regulations for ordinary circulation, the last
forma having been approved of by the Department of Militia and Defence a week
later than the date of the supplement, and
it was decided to publish it in two parts.
The balance will he published in the ' Gazette ' of the 26th of November, 1910.
The reply to question No. 3 is: The answer to this is contained in the answei to
question No. 2.

THE LIBRARY 0F PARLIAMENT.
REPORT 0F LIBRARIANS ADOPTED.
Hon. Mr. POWER moved that the report ai the joint librarians af parliament
be adopted. He said, there are one or
two points which perhaps it may be wel]
ta say a word about. The report contains
the following paragrapli:
Ail the current literature of the day has
beon procured in as full a measure as the
resourees of the library will permit. These
resources are more heavily taxed now than
in previaus years, owing to variaus causes,
and a small addition ta the library grant has
been asked for. The expenditure for books
in the library has been managed --ith some
degree of econorny, and the grant lias been
increased but once in five and twenty years.
That is a paragrapli which should have
been more particularly addressed ta the
memnbers ai the government than ta this
House. The whole grant for the purchase
and binding ai books for the Parliamentary
Lîbrary I understand is only $ 12,000. Considering that the cost ai the staff is very considerable, a little more liberality ahould be
shown ta the library in the matter ai furnishing funds ta purchase, at any rate, desirable current literature. The next paragraph speaks ai the problem of providing
increascd space in the library and says that
it still presses for solution. Back in the
year 190>4 the Library Committee af that
time reported their approval ai a plan submitted by the Dominion architect, and it

step in advance. What position the government may take, of course, I arn not in
a position to say; but shonld a proposal
of the kînd suggested by the 'Times' corne
from the imperial government to Canada,
I express the hope personally that our government will take it into their favourable
consideration.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I hope, if a proposai
is rnade, that the govemnment will very
seriously consider its provisions bei are
they undertake ta go inte a scheme of this
kind. I amn not a believer in state-owned
telegraph lines or cable lines. In England,
the government have, as a great many
people think, unwisely taken possession of
the telegraph business, and it wauld not be
unnatural that they shonld wish to have a
cable te conneet their land lines with; but
heretofore in Canada we 'have not gone in
for state telegraph limes, and I hope that
we shall not do sa. If there were to be
another cable laid and owned -by t.he state,
I respectfully submit that one laid
by the route indicated wonld nlot be 'a
desirable one. There are already several
cables laid directly from the Old Country
te Newfonnidland and Canada. It ia not
necessary to go through the United States
at ail, and it does seem to me that, inasrnuch as private enterprise bas neyer
thoughlt the attractions of the round about
route by the Faroe Islands and Greenland
were sufficiently great to induce them to
lay cables that way, there is no reason
why the goverrnent should do it; the
presumiption is the other way. If the
cable is to be laid, it would be better to lay
it frorn Irelani or the south of England to
either Newfoundland or Canada. There is
no reason why we shonld have a state-owned
cable at ail, but if vve have. to have one, I
respectfully submit we had better follow
the example of business corporations and
have a cable direct from the Unitel Kingdom to Canada.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Has

saying that Canada bas net heretofore gone

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL.

Hon. Mr. POWER-I amn very mucli
obliged to the hien. gentleman for calling
mv attention to the Pacifie cable. I had not
forgotten that, but I thought it just as well
te say nothing about it. Our going into that
Pacific'cable business was one of the rnost
injudicious steps the governrnent of Canada
have ever taken. That cable ia of considerable value I suppose to England, and perhaps to Australia, but I amrnft aware tbat
it bas ever been of any material advantage
to Canada. This country pays es much as
the Australasian colonies do, and I assume
if a state cable betwen Canada and the
United Kingdom were gone on with that
Canada would be expected to pay hall the
cost, wbîch I think 'would be exceedingly

THE DRY DOCK AT QUEBEC.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
moved that the House do now adjourn.
Hon. Mr. CROQUETT-I should like,
before the motion is put, to cail the attention of the goverrnent te an article which
appeared in this morning's ' Citizen,' giving the opinion of Mr. Andrew Allan on the
subject of the graving dock at Quebec. The
article is as follows:DOCK PLAN NOT DEÂD.
Mr. Ândrew Allan on the Levis Dry Dock
Project.
Montreal, Nov. 29.-The etory that bas been
about the street to the effect that the recently
for med Dominion Dry Dock Company has
abandoned its plans is given a denial by Mr.
Andred AUlan, president of the new oompany.
In Au guet the oompany wae formed with a
directorate made up of representatives of the
varions shipping firme and it wae decided to
secure a site opposite Québec and there te
establish a modern dry dock capable of containing the largeet ships which night corne
to the St. Lawrenoe. Lately it has been rumoured that for want of capital the whole thing
will have te be given ever.
'There je nothing being dene at pre6ent.'
Mr. Allan said, 'but I expect that the th-ing
will corne to life again at any tirne. 0f course
yon cannot build a dry dock withont money
any easier than von eau build a house, and
while -we had $800,OOO snbecribe'd by the big
shipping intereets, this was not enough te go
on with and there has been no effort made to
get more money.'
Although Mr. Allan could. not say what the
enterprise would cost, shipping men suggeet
that anywhere fromi twe and a half to five
million dollars will be needed for the work.

NO VEMBER 30, 1910
'I want a dry dock in Mcntreal and I will

baes o4f millions of dollars occurs the need for

- I do flot know what will be dont with the
affairs of the Dominion Dry Dock Company,'
Mr. Allan sajd. 'For the present they are
dead, burt they will have ta corne ta life again.
In view of this most important declaration by Mr. Allan, and which bas been
made by other people as well, that a drydock should be constructed at Quebec for
the present, and that although a large sumn
of money has already been subscribed, there
has net been enough furnished ta carry out
the project, I think the government eught
ta make an appropriation for the purpose
cf carrying on the work. A dry dock at
Quebec is needed at once. It is necessary,
not only for 'Quebec, but for the whole
Dominion, and, as a good Liberal, I may
perhaps add, in the interest of the goverfiment.
I arn
sure that the
people
will austain the government if they undertake the construction of the work without delay. They might, in the meantime,
lay aside some other undertakings whieb
are not as neoessary. We have the statement made on the authority of a man of
large experience that a dry dock should be
constructed at Quebec before some disaster
occurs involving the boss of millions. I
agree entirely with Mr. Allan on that point,
but towards the close of the interview hie
expresses an opinion with which I cannot
agree. . He say:'When the jealousies between Quebec and
Montreal are eettled then shipping conditions
on the St. Lawrence wîll have a better chance
ta thrive,' Mr. Allan added.

Quebec ail the same. I wish people would
cease making the unfounded charge against
Quebec that we are jealous of Montreal. The
lion's share has been given ta Montreal,
and
Quebec has never blaxned thc
government for that; we hope now that
the government will turn their attention te
Quebec, and lu the interest of the entire
Dominion construct a dry dock there before
somne disaster coecurs which will cost millions to the country. The government should
appropriate a sufficient sum ai money without delay to begin the work. We ahould
have a dry dack large enough ta accommodate the 'largest vessels that are likely te

be there. I migbt say that the general
belief at St. John-a belief largely founded
upon observations made from time to time
in government papers-is that a dock is
to be built at 6t. John, the onlyopilace in
the maritime prýovinces or any province of
eastern Canada which can be reached at
ail seasons of the year. While I bave no
objection to docks at Quebec or Montreal,
it would be.f ar better, if the governmcnt
are going to put capital into a dry-dock,
that it should be at a port which is open al
tht- year round, inasmuch as large Canadian steamers now corne to St. John. I
do nlot say tbis with any idea to disparage
Halifax, which is an excellent port, and
might weli expect ta bave a dry-dock; but
for the real purposes of the country the
dry-dock shouid be at St. John, and it is
understood in that city that the goveriiment wiil shortly begin the construction
of a dry-dock.

that they were, judging from what we -have
seen and heard, and we are glad to feel
that no jealousy wili interfere with the
growth of these cities. The bouse will
recognize that the matter of first importance is a dry-dock somewhere in the east
to care for the Atlantic situation, and in the
west to care for the Pacific situation. It is
a surprise to me to hear the hon, gentleman from Montreal suggest that, doubtiess
in connection with that feature of our
shipping, it would be desirable to consider
what should be done in Montreal to care
for the dry-docking of the inland shipping.
Sureiy that would naturally come to a city
like Toronto for instance, the centre of the
lake and river system, rather than at the
extreme end and below the rapids where
the inland navigation is so small cornpared
with what it is in the upper lakes. It is
oniy necessary to mention that to appeai
to the House that in the matter of a drydock for iniand repairing of ships, it
shouid surely 'be at Toronto or that vicinity.
Hon. Mr. ÇLORAN-We have no objection.
Hon. Mr. JONES-Toronto is in the right
place, and 1 arn not suggesting that for any
political reason, but for the interest of Canada, and therefore in the interests of the
government.
Hon. Mr. GIBSON-There bas been a dry.
dock at Port Dalhousie ever since the Welland canal was built, for taking care of the
vessels passing up Lake Ontario and
through Lake Erie. I do not know what
dlaim Toronto would have, because there is
a dry-dock already at Port Dalhousie.
Hon. Sir GEORGE ROSS (Middlesex)That is miles away.
Hon. Mr. GIBSON-Thie Welland canal
couid be .made larger without much expense, and I amn sure my hion. friend from
Toronto wouid naturally give way in favour
of a more desirabie place at the mnouth of
the Welland canal.
Hon. Mr. KIRCHHOFFER-I

listened with pleasure and attention te

is to be bult it must be located at Montreal, Quebec or Toronto. I speak for a far
larger constituency than any of these
places. I want to tell hon. gentlemen that
I see the government advocating and promising that they are going to have water
communication ail the way up to Edmnonton ibefore they get through. I represent
a constituency -which is situated on one
of the fineat witerways there la in -the
whole of the Northwest, the Assiniboine
river, and in connection with that waterway which the government proposes to
improve through to Edmonton, we could
make a very good connection by digging
a canal of not more than 180 miles between
the Assiniboine river and the North Saskatchewan which would enable us to connect with ail the west and east as weil,
and I think Brandon is the proper place
to have a dry-dock, which 'would be useful
not only to the east but also to the west.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-The hon. gentleman from Grandville, in bringing this
matter before the Senate, might realize
for one moment that the location of the
dry-dock la not absolutely in the hands
o! the government. Far from it. The law
passed last year provides that the government shaîl, by way of subsidy to any coinpany that shahl build a suitable dry-dock,
guarantee interest at the rate of three and
half per cent on the amount ranging from
one and a haîf up to four and a haîf million.
But surely the gentlemen undertaking this
commercial enterprise must be -the peopie to decide where it is most advantagcous for them to estabiish their works. I
understood, for instance, some of'the
shipping men to say that at Levis a graving dock of a permanent nature-that is
a masonry gravinig dock-should be bult.
The time required for the construction of
such a dock would be four or five years. I
have always contended that these masonry
Ail the
graving docks were obsolete.
new docks being built are floating docks,
and these floating docks can be moved
from one place to another. In fact, a
graving dock has been towed from England to Durban, several thousand miles.
Another graving dock was towed from the
United States to the Philippine Islands. It

NOVEMBER 30, 1910

was proposed that a permanent masonry
graving dock should be biiilt at Levis. I
think it would be a poor policy for the
government to countenance the -building
of these obsolete docks. The government
should insist on giving the gubsidy only
to those 'who will agree to build floating
docks, which I understand do not cost
more than 25 to 30 per cent of the amount
required for the masonry graving docks,
and are equally efficient. Those floating
graving docks are simply like the letter
' U' in shape and open at both ends, 80
that even if the dock is only 5W0 or 600
feet long, it can accommodate a much
larger ship, because the ship can be
handled at both ends. The advantage of
the floating dock is that not one Ion of
water more is pumped out to float and lift
the ship than is actually pecessary for
her displacement. The water is allowed
to enter these floating docks and they are
sunk to the draft of the incoming, ship.
Then the ship is moved inside tihe dock,"
pumping is immediately stsrted and the
pressure commences, and shortly the ship
is lifted out - of the water and only the
water absolutely necessary for the displacement of the shlip is pumped. The
pumping out of the dock is one great item
of expense in working the ordinary masonry dock. Be the ship ever so amali,
tihe whole dock must be emptied i order
that the vessel may be high and dry. One
cau readily sec the advantage of the floating dock. Then in regard, to the cost of
these floating graving docks, I should like
to give the Minister of Trade and Commerce a word of warning. I have heard
the prices that some gentlemen who itend to build these fioating docksare asking for their construction. 1 have figured
out what it would cost per ton, and their
prices are away up ini the air, in my humble opinion. One of these floating docks
is simply a huge steel box. They give as
an excuse that these graving docks, having te be in water that freezes over iu
winter, require to be very strong. I have
consulted some experts on the subject, and
that
they are not of the opinion that
should very materially increase the cost
of these doeks. So that before entering
into a subsidy contract with any com-

pany or syndicate, it would be well for
the goverument to inquire elsewhere as to
what the cost would be. These docks
are to be found in ail parts of the world'.
There is an immense dock at Bermuda.
Another question which was before the
government at the time the law was passed was whether the government could pay
a subsidy for a dock which would not be
ofa permanent nature. Some great contractors thought it was necessary for the
government to build a masonry dock.
They said that a floating dock, being
made of steel, would not be a permanent
structure, but a dock at Quebec or Montreal resting ini fresh water, if properly
painted, would resist the action of rust
for a great number of years, perhaps a
great deal more than the time for which
the subsidy would be granted, a period of
thirty-five or forty years. The idea was
that on1e of these floating docks would be
buit and towed to Montreal. The excuse
for putting a dock at Montreal was to provide one within two years which could
be used pending the construction of the
one at Lévis, which, might occupy five
years. Should an accident take place below
Quebec the floating dock could be towed
easily, much more readily than an ordinary
timber raft, and sunk where the ship was
and towed back to Montreal or wherever the
dock might be located. I want to make it
clear that the govern.ment would have very
littie to say as to the location. Whatever Sir
Hugli Mian or Mr. Andrew Allan may say
about rivalry between Quebec and Montreal, or the government interfering, is of
very littie moment at the present time,
since whoever builds the dock will have
the right to decide where it shall be located. It ie a business matter. The company
will secure the necessary water lot and the
land en .the shore where ail the workshops
will be established before going to the
government. Then they will ask the government if they will accept the location,
and the government must either accept or
rejeet it.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-The hon. gentleman's remarks do not apply to the
point I have raised. 1 amn asking the
government to build the dry-dock themselves. The hon. gentleman says it would

SENATE
take four or five years to build the dock at
Lévis; that is ail the greater reason why
the work should be undertaken as soon as
possible. The sooner the government start
to work the better in the public interest.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-The lion, gentleman knows very 'veil that for the past
ten or fifteen years the Dry Dock Subsidy
Act has been amended, and the subsidy
has been increased three or four times in
order to attract private capital to undertake such enterprises. The last sacrifice
the government 'vas ready to make by the
Act as amended last year seems not to be
large enough to tempt capitalists to build
at even St. John, N.B., or Lévis. I may
Bay to my hion. friend fromn Toronto that
when I spoke of vessels engaged in our
iniand navigation coming to Montreal, it
was wit.h a view to expi.aining that there
la at that point a junction of inland and
ocean-going navigation. Ve*ssels of ten
or twelve thousand tons, and even as large
as fifteen thousand tons, can reach that
point. I was simpiy expiaining 'vhy theMontreal Harbour Commissioners had decided to put a dry-dock there, because considerabie tonnage 'vas coming there fromn
both directions. When a boat is damaged, every effort is made to reach the
point of destination where its cargo is to
be unlcaded. I think the hion, gentleman
from Grandville and I wiil live to see two
dry-docks on the St. Lawrence, perhaps also
one at St. John, with the Halifax dock enlarged, and 've 'viii realize then that very
many boats which may be injured below
Quebec 'viii manage to rcach the Montreai
dry-dock, because their cargoes wiil be
destined for that place.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-The hion, gentleman
says that the amount 'vhich the government
are prepared to guarantee for the construction of these fioating docks bas been increased for the purpose of tempting private
capital. Why bas private capital flot been
secured for sucli works?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I based my answer on second-hand information but which
1 believe te be correct; the necessary capital bas been about provided for. the Levis
dry-dock by a subscription of four mnillion dollars, on which the gevernment
Hon. Mr. CHO1QUETTE.

wili pay interest at three and a baîf
per cent for thirty-five years. I understand from despatches wbich have appeared
la the press of Quebec ana Montreal that
the only point of difference is, wbere those
bonds, wben placed on the market, will be
sold at less than par, a demand bas 'been
made, as I see by a despatch in the press,
that the government sbould allow the interest to be reckoned on bonds which ýYvill
bring four million dollars net. So it seems
to me that the syndicate that la handling
the Levis proposition bas very nearly
reached the point of success.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Suppose, after
increasing the amount of the subsidy and
guaranteeing interest, the government cannot induce capitaiists to undertake the
building of these dry-docks, are the government prepared to undertake the construction
of these works, or shail xve have no dry-dock
at ail? That is the question. The dry-dock
is an absolute necessitv, and if private capital cannot be found to undertake its construction the government must buiid it.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I have the bonour to
direct attention to the fact that there is
nothing before the House.
THE WORK 0F THE SESSION.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-On the motion
to adjourn, I wish to say a few words on a
subject that bas been taken up by the press
in connection witb our adjournment over
the holidays. Attention is called to the fact
that the Senate is forced te adjourn eariier

It was a private conversation; it was madle

In it Bishop Fallon incidentally remarked
that the census of 1901 had been stufl ed so
far as Quebec was concerned. Bishop Fallon
has spent the greater portion of his life in

This suspicion that the Quebec census was
unfairly taken naturally is difficuit to prote.
A document has just been issued, however,
which throws a ligh't on the situation. Ilt is
prepared by the Clerk of the Crown in
Chancery, Mr. J. G. Foley, and is entitled
* Resumé of General Election, 1908, and ByElections to January 1, 1911.' It simply
igives for each constituency, where practicable,
the numýber of voters on the Eist, the votes
polled, the votes for the several pa-rties end

8HIP BUILDING YARDS AT QUEBEC.
INQUIRY.
Flou. Mr. LANDRY inquired:
1. Ras the right honourable the Prime
the
ieter received from the Board of Trade ofMincity of Quebec, a request with regard ta the
establishmient of ship building yards in that
*locality. for the pur pose of encouraging the
construction in Canada of iron and steel ocean
going veesels, bringing to bis notice, at the
*saine time, that within a year four steel vessels had beeD buiît at Quebec. where there are
yards in a position to show themselves capable
of meeting the circumstances?
2. Ras the board of trade expressed the
epinion on this subject, that it is of the
greatest importance that Canada should becorne again what it was forty years ago, with
regard to sbip building, and consequeutly one
,of the principal countries in the world as
regards commercial transportation, and that
this magnificent resnlt eau be obtained by the
judicious encouragement by the federal authorities of ship buildingP
3. What answer 'did the right ' honourable

The order af the day having been called:

Hon. Mr. DAVID said: My object in

which have been made against the Senate,

mons, not taking into consideration sonme
Bills which were rejected, and the Insurance Bill, which was almost coinpletely
recast and to which about onc lîundred
and fifty amendments, if I rememiber correctly, were made by the Senate. I make
this motion in order that these two statements may be recorded as a continuation of the return laid before this
House two or three years ago.
Those statements will show clearly and
conclusively that a great deal of work wvas
done by this Chamber. A very important
fact to be mentîoned is this: that all the
amendments made by the Senate have
been approved of and acceptcd by the
Commons, and v~e therefore have the right
to conclude that if constitutes a certificate
in favour of the work done by the Senate,
and proves that those aincndments werc
properly mnade. If they liad not been
properly made there would be on our
statutes not only Bis passed during thle
last two sessions, but hundreds of Blills
passed since confederation which would
be very imperfect, and which would not
do credit to the legisiation of the Dominion
parliament. Are we to conclude that those
amendments were not approved of by gentlemen who advocate the abolition of the
ScnateP My contention is that the Senate
is doing a Rood work, and if this Chamiber
did not exist it would be necessary to
establish a revising body, which would
take the place of the Senate, and that those
who speak of the abolition of the Upper
House do flot know what they are talkingabout. I do flot think the sayings of these
crîtics really deserve the attention of this
Chamber. As te the reformat;on of the
Senate, if is a different question whichi no
doubt deserves the attention of the public
mcen of this country. This is flot the fume
to discuss the merits of the question, but
I will take occasion to correct certain assertions which have been made in newspapers in connection withi views -%hich I
expressed two or three years ago in regard
to Senate reform. It has been charged
tlîat I expressed the opinion that the bcst
reform. whicb could be made would be to
have one haif of the members appointed
by the legisiative assemblies and the other
hiaîf elected by the people. I neyer said
that, but I stated that there were tu o

systems which appeared to me t0 be most
practicable if a reform should be found
necessary. My proposition w'as either to
have one-hiaif of the senators appointed for
tif e by the federal government and the othcr
haif elected by the people, or appointed by
the provincial governments. I thought the
most efficient way would be the latter,
because it would give to federal and provincial governments the guarantee of protection which they require. The hon. member
for Middlesex (Sir c1eo. W. Ross) in a very
elaborate speech, proved that no change
in the constitution of the Senate could be
made wit.hout the consent and approval of
the provinces, and I think hiis views are

tion of the Senate was one of the esSential
considerations in the seheme of confederat ion; without the creation of the Seniate
there would have been no confederatio-n.
That is the reason why I think that the
system which would give to the provincial
governments the right to appoint half the
members of the Senate when it would be
thought necessary to reform the Senate
would be the most acceptable to the provinces. I wanted only to lay these facts
before the public and before those who are
now engaged in disc'ussing the question of
reform or abolition of the Senate. The
vork actually done by the Senate should
appeal to the common sense and judgnjient
of reasonable people. Having obtained tlic
statements which I desired to be brought
down, I heg now to withdraw my motion.
The motion was wîthdrawn.

this article. At page 975, Dr. Walton says:
In Canada tise ancient view of marriage
as a life long union of a man and a womaiî
stili holds the -field, whereas in the UJnited
States marriage is coming to be regarded as
a contract of a much less permanent character which -may be terminated 'without mucb
dificulty by either party. It would appear
that divorce has now become a primary necessity of life -in the republic, while in the more
conservative northern haîf of the continent it
remains tise luxury of the few.

Tîse consequence is, it is harder te get a
divorce in British Columubia ; the law is
more exacting- as to causes than in tIse
oticer provinces, but, notwithstanding that
fact, British Columbia, with a population

things that we desire, is one of the most
beneficial aiid civilizing experiences that a
man or a community can go throueh. Hon.
gentlemen have spoken here on more than
one occasion as to the desirability of having a. divorce court. Now, I have not myself been able to see-I have not had any
evidence -vhich vwould lead me to think
that there is any neeessity for such a court.
We have here a committec of the Sciiate,
composed largely, the rnajority, I think, of
men of the legal profession, one or two
doctors and a couple o! other gentlemen
who are looked upon as representing the
average common sense business man, and
that committee have neyer applied to this
House asking that a change shiould be
made. They do their work, I think, quite
as satîsfactorily as the average court does.
They do not complain, and I do not see
why we should, under the circumstances,
undertake to give thenm relief that they are
not asking for. Then, again, public opinion does flot ask for a change. One may
travel through the country and find very
few who will say it is desirable that greater
facîlities should be given for divorce than
are at present -afforded ; aud the natural
conclusion. of ail this is that if there is no
crying demand for a divorce court we
should let things go as they are. The present condition is infinitely better than the
condition of things in England, France and
the United States, I fail to see any reason
why we should be making unnecessary
trouble and trying, without. any solid or
substantial reason, to bring about a condition of thing-s which is most. undesirable.

Hon. Mr. IPOWER-I do not thînk that
the hion. gentleman puts the distinction
betweerr an order and an address just as it
really is. If the documents that are soughit
are u.nder the control of the government
here and no outside governmnent is involved

question itself. Probably no question can
affect the welfare of a nation more seriously
than the separation of man and wife, and
the breaking up of the home, the making
orphans of children before the proper time,
giving scandai to the young, whi]e procuring iuxury and lust for the oid. What attacks the home attacks the nation itself,
and Canada may wcll feel proud of its
record in regard to divorce. I know that
Canada bas in the lower bouse, as well as
in the upper Chamber, men wbo are not
afraid to express their views in regard to
this matter without restriction. Canada bas
in both chambers men who cannot be led
away in their conclusions and in their judgment by sentimental reasons or by sympathy, and the country wili find in thern
men who wilI uphold the marriage relation
as At should be upheld and as the highest
authorities want it to be upbeid. It should
not be a question o! sect or religion. The
question is one o! too much gravity and too
much seriousness to be solved by any sectarian or sentimental view. The legisiatures of this country have done their duty
weli in the past. They have made it diflicuit in the vast majority'of cases to separate man and wif e. As long as parliament,
through its committee, does that work, it
will be benefiting the country at large, and
the country will agree with the view expressed to-day by the lion. gentleman frorn
Halifax that we are not in need of further
avenues leading to the destruction of our
homes, either by means of provincial
or other courts, and the more difficuit this separation of man and wife
can be made the better for ail concerned. It rnay be a bardship for a f ew
nda-mighity few according to Canadian
experience-to endure the marital relation
with people that they do not like, that they
'have good reason to despise, that they have
good reason to fear, but wve must remember
thut ail goverument and ail law must be
based on that one common principle-the
good of the majority, the good of the whole
people before the good of a few. That

Act of parliament, and why shouid it

marital relations? That is a question that

should not try to have a further extension
of courts to dispense divorce at wiil. In
the past I have endeavoured to secure the
assent of this honourabie House to a Bi!l
dealing with this question from a moi-al
standpoint, and from a moral standpoiint
alone. We must accept the situation as it
is. Under our constitution- divorce cati
be granted by parliament, but parliament
has a right to say to whom a divorce shall
be granted. and 1 have placed before this
honourabie body the contention that the
guilty party in a divorce suit should flot receive the protection of this parliament as
hie or she bas been receiving it in the past.
I hold it is not right to encourage immorality, as we do encourage it when we say
to the man who bas forced bis wife to seek
a separation, who has given sufficient reason to the Senate and parliament to grant
a divorce, that he shall have the right to
marry again. It is not proper to give to
that man, 'who lias by his crimes and offences against f amily rights and famiiy privileges brouglit about this condition of
thinga, the same power and privileges and
the rights as are given to the innocent party.
That is a contention that I have had occasion to put before this honourable House.
It received quite a large support and was
very nearly being adopted on one occasion,
and I feel that in the near future this honourable body and parliament as a wholc,
will come to the conclusion on moral
grounds that it is not in the interest of the
family, or in the interest of society that a
man who is condenined by parliament for
his immorality, brutality or other vices
shall have the right to go into another home
and seek the hand of another wornan. A
penalty should be împosed upon the guilty
party. I arn not advocating the righlt of the
innocent party to marry. I have no right
fromn my religious point of viexv to do 8o.
but I certaînly have the righlt to ask, parliament not to give to the guilty party,
whether At be the wife or hiusband, the right
to recommence a life of shame with another
party and build up another f amily on such
a basis. It ia bad enough for himself to
have broken the heart of bis wife, and to
force his home into a state of abandonment, leaving the children without proper
protection, and wîth scandai for ever before

the tribunal in which divorces are granteci.

INCORPORATION 0F RAILWAY
COMPANIES BILL.
SECOND READING.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS xnoved the second reading of Bill (A) An Act to provide for insorporation of railway comnpanies.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Explain.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-On two previous oc.casions I brought this niatter before tbe
Senate, but did not elicit as fuli a discus~sion on the subject as it deserved. Still thc
press bas taken it Up and it bas been
favourably received by the press throughout
the country. The object of the Bill is to
provide a new system for the incorporation
of railways. The old system that bas been
in force for a great many years bas outlived
its usefuiness, and the plan which I submit la one which will be a great improvement on the old system of granting railway
charters. As every one knows who bas had
experience on the railway comnitt-ees of
the two Houses, as far' as grantifig charters
are concerned the committee have very little power. They have to follow certain rules
which are laid down, and -outaide of those
rules very little can be done. Hon. gentlemen will agree witi mie that after we have
granted the charters and given extensions
of time to the companies asking for them,
the usefulness of the committees of both
bouses if they ever had any, bas gone, and
that the tirne of those committees could be
l)etter occupied with other work in connection with the affairs of the country.
I submit that this Bill is a step in the
right direction and la keeping up with the
tixnes. The business of the country la increasing rapidly, and it la absolutely necessary that the timie now wasted in the Rai.way Committee in both Houses should be
employed more usefully in some other direction. I wish to draw the attention of

18, 1911
the bouse to the record of wvhat the conimittees have done in the last 20 years. Wc'
have been employed largely in granting
raîlway charters, and I will show the House
hiow much our labours have conduced to
the benefit of this country. We have granted a great xnany charters and renewals of
charters, but so f ar as the actual work ixi
connection with those charters is concernied,
Littie or nothing has been done. There is
a class of men in this country called ' charterniongers ', and I suppose other cou.ntries have a isirnilar class. Persons who
imagine that they can obtain a charter which they will be able to dispose of.
corne to parliament for it. Under our procedure it is inexpensive. The committee
never inquire into the bona fidcs of the
prornoters, or their financisi ability to build
one trestie on the road, but they are granted power to build a railway sorrnetirnes two
or three thousand miles long, and expropriation powers to go on people's land and
destroy it, without inquirmng as to wliether
they can pay for the damage done. After
the charter has been in existence for two
years, without a shovel full of work having
heen done, they corne back to parliament.
and state that something bas rendered it
impossible for them to finance their road,
and they ask for an extension of two years
time, which is granted. I venture to say
that some of these charters have been kept
alive for 25 years in that way, although not
a shovel full of dirt bas been excavated on
any one of them. Any one %vholistens to
the discussions in the committees of the
House of Conons in regard to applications for extensions of time, wvill see that
the niembers have becomne disgusted with
the practice, and the people o! thie country
look upon the matter so seriously that petitions have been forwarded and resolutions
frorn boards of trades have been presented
to tixe government, and visîts have becix
mnade here, as in the case of my own city,
where the mayor bas been endeavouring to
put a stop to this kind of thing. The peopie say: ' These men -have had years and
years to build the road and have not
shown that they ever tried to do so, but
are simply jockeying like twvo professional
wrestlers on the stage. They say: ' No mat-

going ta go south and build a road, but iii
the meantime we are gaing to hold what
we have in the narth and keep the charter '. It may be said that a charter does

outside of the Dominion are asked to furnîsh money ta finance such an enterprise
At dues amount ta something. Suppose a
charter is granted ta build a road throughi
a tract of country, and At is a fertile country, there is perhaps traffic enough ta maintain une road, but not enough for two, the
Canadian Pacific railway and the Canadian
Northemn bath have charters for a line
through that country. The moment the
Canadian Northern railway talk about
building, the Canadiafl Pacific railway say:
' Oh, we are going ta build 'a road there
right along side of it.' Now that is going
ta endanger their schemes ta abtain capital outside of Canada, because people wil]
say: 'That district will support one road,
but not two, and when we are asked ta
lend money to finance the construction of
two roads, we are nat going ta do it.' Iii
this way men who are prepared ta build
a railway are shut aut and cannot get money
ta build. I submait that such a condition
should be put an end ta. *We know very
little about the topography of the country
where we grant charters, or the probable
coat ai the road, or what bonding powers
should be given, or anything else. A certain number of gentlemen with a lawyer
that they employ came along and hang up
a map in the 'Railway Committee room,
and they take the pointer and say: ' This
is a charter ta, build a road from Timbucktoo ta some other place,' and some member
asks: ' How far is it? ' and the promot2r

or will part of it go into the road and part

country? That is a proposition that is
bothering the country at the present time.

States system. In the United States the
granting of charters is practically free.
Over there they must be bana fide applications, because the promaters mu5t put
ay,
up money.- Anybody who can raise, s.
about $500 a mile, cash in the bank, can
obtain a charter, after complying with the
Act, ta build a road. They do not require
ta go to the legisiature, but they go ta the
Railway Commission and to the Secretary
of State, and alter they obtain the approval of the Railway Commission they receive
a certificate from them, giving permission
to build the road, and if they do not proceed with the construction, the $500 spent is
forfeited. I have gone throngh the practice
in every state ai the union, and have
endeavoured to aacertain what would best
suit the circumstances in this country,
and 1 have iramed the present Bill largelv
from the statute of the state af Massachusetts. I have here the Rlailway Acts af
Massachusetts, Michigan and Indiana, and
in no case is there any impediment placed
in the 'way af per3ans building a road if

sorne money before they ask the country
to grant themn the right ta build. I ask

so, and that people who have no money and

putting a government stamp on the proposition. The promoters go to foreign countries, and say :'HRere we have a charter
from the Dominion parliament,' and people
wbo do flot understand it invest their
money. Thousands have loat money in
that way, wbicb la an injury not only to
themn but to the people of Canada, because
it affects our credit. We want to see that
every dollar of money brough.t into the
country is properly invested. and ,provides a fair return. In that way we shall
attract more capital than we have been able
to get in the past. By giving charters to
speculators we ena-ble them to go to England and get tbe trust moneys o! wvidows
and orpbans invested in these ventures,
and the first tbing they know the whole
thing bias gone up in smoke, to the great
injury of the credît of Canada. It is tixne
sucli a practice should be put a stop to, and
this Bill of mine will have that effect. The
work o! the Railway Committee of this
Hou3e in grantîng these charters is the
case of a mountain in labour producing
a mouse. This document I amn about to
submit to the House to be placed in our

di1

record is rather lengthy, but it is valuable. It shows the num-ber of railways
which have been chartered in the last 20
years, the unileage of those roads, the
extensions of time that have fbeen asked
for, and the number of charters that have
lapsed, -and the amount of mileage that
fias been buit. It will s'how what our
labours have amounted to. 1 will give the
summary. 1 'will leave out the charters
granted to the Canadian Northcrn, the
Grand Trunk railway and the Canadian
Pacifie railway and merely take. the small
fry. We have granted charters for 223
railroads. Some mileage has 'been bujlt
by 23 and nothing bas been done by the
other 200. One hundred and fourteen charters -have lapsed. The extensions of timie
granted were 221. We have granted a total
mileage of 78,181, and out of that there lias
been 1,346 miles built, and that has been
built by one road in Quebec a*nd a couple
of others ; the others have buit four, five,

the money. If they desire a charter for a
certain uine sirnply to keep another coinpany froni building ini the saine district,
they -%vi]l hesitate before spending the

of Railways is continual'ly bothered with
route mnaps and plans which hie is asked to
approve, w-herc the prornoters neyer intend
te build the road. I remnember in rny owu
town. the Grand Trunk Pacific in-j
tended to construct a hile, and the Cauadian Pacifie railwsy and the Canadiani
Northern railway hiad charters for sirnilar
lines on which they had neyer turned a sod,
and they produced route miaps for roads
which would paraliel the line thiat the
Grand Trunk Pacific railway proposed to
*build. The local governiment wvere guaranteeing the bonds of the Grand Trunk
Pacific. They took a long time te approve
of the Grand Trunk Pacific plan because they
said if the Canadian Pacifie railway and Canadian Northern railway were going in there
it would be a question whether the raad
would pay; but they at Ilast granted thé
assistance and the Grand Trunk Pacific
bas gone on, and we have not heard of the
matter since. It was a case of jockeying
and tbey have not proceeded with it. Under the provisions of this Bill, such procedure ivill be stopped and we will not be
bothered wît.h if. The first clause of the
Bill reads:

and the proceeds deposited ina bank, then
the share holders elect a board of directors.
Hon. Mr' DAVIS-As we have agreed to
send this Bull to the Railway Committee,
it is iinnecessary to discuss the details
further at present. There are a number of
experienced gentlemen on that committee,
who will, no doubt, amend the Bill to make
it more perfect. I drafted the Bill iyself.
1 had the law clerk look over it, bùit he
made no changes. The phraseology may
not be exactly right, but we have on the
committee legal gentlemen like the hon.
niember froin De SalIaberry (Mr. Beique).
and engineers like my hon; friend from
De La.naudière (Mr. Casgt'ain), and I have
no doubt they will put the Bill iii a satisfactory shape. 1 have made the statemient
that nobody can get a charter for railway
wiîthout being prepared to do certain things
and to put up money. They have to ernploy
engineers to survey the route and prepare
plans a.nd specifications and estimates of
the cost of the road. Besides th at, they
have to put up a lot of money in a bank
before they can do anything to indemnify
anybody whose property may be damaged.
Provision is made to prevent them withdrawing that money from the batik, because after the money is deposited in the
bank for this purpose it has to stay there_
until it is released by order of the court.
1 have another provision to prevent pooling. Very often, after a railway is constructed, another company may undertake
to build a parallel line, and a pooling arrangement may be made between the two
companies. With the present Railway
Commission it is hardly possible for them
to do that to any extent, but it is as well
to provide against it, as 1 do in this Bill.
The tirne has corne when there should be
a change in the systern of granting charters.
TJnder the proposed plan w-e have the
Secretary of State, and the Board of Railwvay Commissioners, and if we are not
satisfied mith them, the Minister of Rail
ways and his deputy can approve of these
plans. They know the naines of the competent engineers in the country and can
feel assured that none of thein would put
his naie to any report which wvas not
correct in every particular. That is more
than we are getting under the present sys-

teni. In a country growing as rapidly as
Canada is, suppose a railway were needed
at once, the enterprise cannot be proceeded
with until a charter is obtained. The promoters have to wait until parliament, meets.
If they -wanted to build in May or J une
next they could not do it. They would
have to wait a year longer to procure a
charter froin parliament. Under the systein outlined in my Bill they could be at
work in three months. In the committee
we will be able to frame a Bill that will
be satîsfactory to everybody. I should like
to see this Bill go to the House of Cornmons. The Sen'ate has been accused of
lacking in initiative. If we sent Bills like
this to the Lower House it would show
that we can initiate measures here as welI
as they can in the Commons.
Hon. Mr. DAVID-A]though this Bill contains some good things, and ehows that perhaps the existing law could be amended
with advantage, I consider it objectionable
in principle. I arn opposed to the principle
of it for two good reasons: First, because
the effect of passing the Bill would be to
lessen considerably the importance of parliament. One of the most important functions of parliament is the incorporation of
If you eut off that
railway companies.
power I do not know what may be left, for
if you deprive parliament of the poiver of
incorporating railway companies you may
do so with respect to _dealing with other
matters. If railways are to be incorporated
by a raiiway commission, why not deal
with banking and commerce and other matVers in the saine way? Then w-e would
have the governrnent and legislation of the
country administered by commiss;onl. I
arn not ready to accept such a principle.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Will the lion. gentlenman point out to me any important changes
that have been made by the Railway Coininittee in Bilîs during the hast four or five
years except such changes as -the law cherk
or the minister bas told them to make?
Hon. Mr. DAVID-I arn not recdy to go
into details to answer the liOn. gentlemnan's
question, because it might entail a long dis*cussion. That will corne later on. The
*work done by the Senate and the Hou69

SENATE

of Con)iimons so far hias been satisfactory,
and I call the attention of the hon. member
to this proposition: If Bis are passed by
parliament which. do not receive proper
consideration, there is more danger if we
acc,.pt the proposition contained in this
Bill. If there are abuses now, there will'
be many more under the proposed system.
I think there would be less publicity and
less probability of opponients of a Bill fighting it. Under the present system, before a
Bill cornes up for consideration in the
Hous-. of Gommons or the Senate, notices
must be published for weeks in advance.
Then the Bill has to be read three times
in each House, besides being referred to,
the conimittees of the two Houses. There
is thus much time given for those interested in the projeet to oppose or support the
Bill as they think proper. linder the proposed system, those who are opposed to, a.
railway Bill would not have the same
chance of fighting it should the measure
now before us be adopted.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-The Bill is a step
in the right direction. It is a practical
Bill. The hon. genternan frorn De Lanaudière spoke of the powers, of provisional
directors. I can tell him that provisions]
directors have al'l the powers of directors
until a board of directors is elected, provided they do nothing prejudicial to those
who are interested in the company. They
are clothed with ail authority, and, furthermore, the Railway Act under which this
Bill coines, provides what the directors shahl
do. This Bill provides that the shareholders, in the firat instance, shalhl be masters of the situation, and can have a meeting called wlienever they like. There can
can be no very great harm in it, especial as this Bill deals with people wi~'o are
in ecarniest, wNho are flot geting speculative
charters, people who mean) business, and
are going to serve the country. Such pro
moters have nothing to fear, because they
ivili be supported by the public at large.
Their ohject is not to traffie in charters.
I have been forty years in parliament off
and on, and my experience lias been that
the work of the committee bas been obstructed a great deal by arguments and
discussions over matters which could ha

Hon. Mr. DAVID.

une if those on the cuimiittee who hiad
rpal practical knowledge of railm-ays aud
railway legis1atio.,i had a chance to threslh
thie niatter out. But, unfortunately, between the notoriety caused by the pre«,s
and ather causes, somne people do a lot of
talking which might he avoided. My hon.
friend says rt la because lawyers are looking for big fees. 1 cannot for a moment
believe that they have anything but the
best interests of the country at heart.
This Bill wiIl have to be miodified to soine
extent, but its object is to provide that
railways can be built when wanted, instead of waiting a year or two before the
promoters are al'lowed to go to work. 1
can point to an instance where if people
could get letters patent, as this Bill provides for, they would be at work building a
railway inside of ninety days. Under the
present law they cannot possibly get a
charter through parliament before the end
of May, and they lose the opportunity of
going into the money market and getting
capital for their enterprise. The Bill should
be sent to the Railway Committee, and if it
is flot ini proper shape it can be amended
there. The principle of taking these details out of the House is a good one and
should be 'adopted. My hion. friend was
talking only yesterday about a divorce
court. The whole principie of lerisiation
is changing; the ideas of people are changing, and the country is changine. I have
just returned froDI the other side of the
Atlantic, and from what I hieard there I
know that this country will boom and develop in a remarkable manner. We cannot contemplate what its future mvill be.
'Ne cannot foresee the class of people who
will corne, and the nionev that %willflow
into Canada and the industries that. will
lie establishied. If that is the case, and
people desire te construct, railwxa'-- in the
western country, we should have leoisiationi
which will enable themi to do so without
bcing delaved througlh the necessit\y of getting legisiation fromn parliamielt.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAl.N-As I understanci

A jrovisional direùtor is one who lias ne
stock iii thje conmpany, because the stock
hia- lot been allotted. The provisional
dirê-ctors are flot supposed to have put an>
niee in the enterprise, except perhaps,
a le,,~ to get the Bill. After the Bill is passcd, they allot the stock and in doing so
create shareholders. As soon as that stock
is accepted, the provisional directors disappear and the shareholders elect a board
of directors 1 have seen that take place in
practice. The lion. gentleman frorn Mille
les (Hon. Mr. David) sars that by giving
aiway thie riglit te deal with railway charti-rs wc would curtail the powers of parliamut, and we woulcl have vers- littie to dIo.
If -%ve look across the line. %ve find there
are înany- states, as wvell as the central gevernmrent. th at do xuot issue railway charters; nevertheless they have enough te cecupy their time without considering railway
charters. 1 am flot oppose to the principle
of the Bill; far irom it. 'More than ten
years ago in this House I introduced a Bill
object was to compel
on similar lies. M-Ny
those who were getting railway charters to
comiply with the. requirements of the law
as in England. There, before one can obtain a railway charter, lie niust first submit
a plan and profile aud show what the cernlumy intend to do. Thosa plans show clearlv
how they are to cross every highlway, what

favour then of exacting those requiremients
befor, an app)lication could be madle. Then
it -would be for paxliament to decide the mat.
ter or to adopt as an alternative the principle of tlm Bill now before us, which is to
allou, auybody who has the means, as they
do in Ille United States and other ceuntries, to build a railway as hie would carry
out any other large enterprise. Our syétemn
nt present-and I have said it repeatedly
for year.,-is very faultv. A few schemers,
chartermongers, obtain a charter and then
when some railway company wants te build
a hune iii the same district they object, as
they have often objccted and very successfuly before this parliament, te what they
clains is unfair competition, and an infringemient of vested rights. Suppose the
Canadian Pacific railway or the Canadian
Northern railway want to huild a branch.
they encounter a gentleman who has had
a charter in the same 'locality for soe time,
who objects on the ground that he has been
at considerable expense making surveys
and plans and is just about getting capital
to proceed with his lie, that his representative is now in England, and as aoon as hae
returns with the necess'ary capital hie will
proceed with the construction of fhe road.
Bona fida anterprises have heen obstructed
in that wav because somne fake promotars
have prevailed on the Railway Committea
not to grant a rival charter. I hope a Bill
on lines similar 4o this may be drawn%by
the committea, and if adopted by p:arlismient it would certainly do a great deal of
good. Anothar objection to the prasent
system of granting charters- is that in other
countries, and especially in England, wlien
yeu go with a royal charter te secure capita:l, people thinki that the gevernmient must
1have looked carefully into the scheme becemnpany power te issue
fore giizthe
bonds. They think five par cent bonds
would be safe and that they would
gat their five per cent eut. of the railwav

Here is wvhit takzes place iu the old counitry,
I amn iufornied: Promotars of railway
scemies go thiere with a lot of bonds, submuit themi te soine broker, and say they have

SENATE
been authorized by the government of Canada, and have a royal charter, to issue
bonds to the amount of $40,OO0 per mile.
They offer these bonds cheap, provided they
can seil for cash. The bonds are purchased
and a small advance is made on them.;
The promoters take the money and return
to Canada, and very often the railway is
not built and the bondholders are left with
these bonds on their hands on which they
may have paid perhaps twenty-five or thirty
cents on the dollar. They bought these
bonds for the purpose of putting them on
the market but they are never put on the
nmarket and remain in the vaults of the
brokers.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Is that the history

should be allowed a charter unless he has
mioney to bui'Id the road, and that under my
Bill nobody wiil ask for a charter unless
lie can furnish the money. I make the statenient now, that outside of the provisions
I have miade in this Bill the Railway Commnittee have not been able ta dot an ' i' or
cross a ' t.' It looks like a comic opera.
They sit there granting charters day by
day. If we abolish this present systeni of
granting charters and extensions of time
it wi'll give satisfaction to the country and
it will save three or four weeks of the tîme
of parliament. This is simply inserting
the thin edge of the wedge, because thereý
are other matters that might be dealt with
more profitably by parliament. We have
seven millions of a population and parliamient sits six months. What would it be if
we had a popu'lation of forty miions? We
Nvould require a different system of dointr
business, and this is one of the modes in
which the tume of parliament can be saved,
and people outside will be better satisfied.

INQUIRY.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY inquired:
1. The' military authorities having, under
the «anthority of section 183 of the King's
Ordek-s and Regulations for the Canadian
Miilitia, 1910, appointed an, officer -brigade
major îfor a fixed period of three years, can
they aubsequently, but before the expiration
of the period of his terni of office, force that

afjicer, without his knowledge and against bis
will, to change and accept a similar position
'n another brigade?
2. If this power exista, in virtue of what
regulation or of what section of the law can

it be exercisedP
3. In practice, do the authorities consider
as similar, the -position of a brigade major
in a rural corps, which is called out every
year for brigade training, and the position

of a brigade major in a city corps, which is
neyer cailed iipon to practise -brigade exer-

cises?
4. Is an alteration iu tlhese cond't.ons îiot
to be considered rather a forfeiture than a
promot'.on, and is it of a nature to strengthen
a refusai which actual regulations seem to

permit and justify?

reading of BillI (6) An Act te amend the

Some hon. MEMBERS-Explain.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH-I have not had
charge of the Bill, but, as I understand, it
is to enable a person who lias rnortgaged
bis property to discharge the mortgage
when overdue on payment of one month's
interest, instead of having te pay three
rnonths' înterest as formerly. I arn only
speaking frorn recollection of the Bill as
it carne frorn the House of Commrons.
Honi. Sir G. W. ]ROSS (Middlesex)-Mýy
lion. friend froin Lindsay bas explained
the Biri. Under Sec. 10 of Chiap. 120 of the
Revised Statutes, it is provided tbat wbhen
a rnortg-aze extends beyond five years it
can be paid off on payment of the principal and interest overdue, by advancing
three rnonths' interest or giving three
months' notice. That did not apply, however. to rnortg-agues given by a joint stock
Seccornpany or other corporations.
tion 10 of Cap. 120, PRevised Statutes
secwith the
original
does
away
tion, and substitutes the new provision
explained by' the hon. gentleman. It is a
Hon. Mr LANDRY

very simple provision, and enables those
who are borrowers te -et rid of the obligation on giving one rnonth's notice or payment of one month's interest. It bias corne
up from the Commons, where it wvas passed
unanirnously.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I think that the
House should not be in too great a hurry
in dealing with this matter. In the first
place, as to the policy of the measure, it
must be borne in mind that while we look
after the interest of debtors who niay sometimes suifer fromn having to psy .three
niontbs' unearned interest, and who, if tbis
Bill went into operation, would have to psy
only one month's interest, we should also
have sorne consideration for tbe position
of tbe lenders. Althoughl general]y, the
mortgag-ee is supposed to hp a tyrannical
capitalist, as a matter of lact Mihen not a
trust cornpa.ny-and this deoes not apply to
trust companies-the mortgagee is very
often a widow or a representative of
widows and children, and to say that n
party wbo owes a very considerable sumn of
money on mortgage, can at any time that
he pleases pay off that mortgage, with the
addition of only one month's interest, is a
proposition about which there rnay be two
views. The law as it now stands,
requires three months' notice or thtee
rnonths' interest. Take tbe case of a
trustee or executor who boans nioney on
behaîf of the famîly interested in the estate
which he represeLnts, whichi ray be a considerahle surn of perbaps ei0it. or ten
thousand dollars. It rnay be very difficuit
in ,sorne places-though not in the new
provinces in the west-to secure a suitable
re-investrnent for that mioney on bebiaîf of
the parties who are dependent on tbe incorne arising frorn tbe rnortzge for their
livelihood. I caîl attention to thiý ini order
te show that on the mnerits there is sornething to be said on both sides. There is
another point also which 1 think is perUnder our constihaps very important.
tution, parliarnent lias tb'e right to deal
with interest it is true, but tbat rigbt
is merely the right to deal -%ith the
rate of interest whichi may be exacted. Parliament, as I understand it,
bias flot the right to deal with civil rights
in the province, and rnortcages are things

whicli are con trolled by the provincial
le.-islatures. The riglits of the mortga.eor
and tlie miortgagee tire things whicli are
dealt witli by tlie provinciail aw~, and I
doubt if we have the riglit to interfere witm
thenm. It is true tliat in this cliapter 120, of
the Revised Statutes, parlianient did undertake< to deal to a certain extent witli this
question of the paying off of mortgages
and tlie interest to be allowed; but my own
feeling is that when parliament did that,
it perhaps travelled beyond its proper
spliere. I do not propose to move against
the second reading of this Bill; but 1 have
grave doubts as to whetlier parliarnent lias
the riglit to pass this measure. and I trust
the Coinmnittee of Banking and Commerce to
wvhich this Bill wlll lie referred, I assume,
will give reasonable consideration at any
rate to) botli the objections-to tie, consti-1
tutional objection and to the qjuestion of
policy.
Hon. '-%r. CLORAN-If the initerpretation
of the Bill just given by the lion. gentleman from Halifax is correct, it certainly
sliould not be before parliament. He hias
said that one of tlie objects of the Bill is
to give the right to the debtor to cancel the
niortgage at any moment and psy it off
whlen lie pleases.
Hon. Mr. DERBYSHIRE-No; after the
miortgagýe becomes due.
CLORAN-I know; that la wliat
Hon. M.Nr.
I arn corning at. If the staternent of the
lion. senator is correct, tlie. Bill would not
be a fair one, and tlie lion. senator froin
.Halifax stated distinctly that it would be
unjust to the creditor, the lender, to give
to the borrower tlie option to pay off lis
inortcgage at any time. Tlie Bill does not
say anything of the kind. The Bill does
nlot Say that the borrower shali have the
riglit to pay it at any time. It is only aiter
the nîortgage lias become matured. It is
oniy w-len the time nîentîoned in the agreenient, or contrart, lias expired, and the
nîortgage is overdue, that tlie borrower
shial have a riglit te go to the hender, or
the mortgagor to go to the mortgagee, and
say: 'My mortgage is overdue; I arn prepared to pay yen. Tlie law in the past
gave you the riglit to collect froin thre-e to
six nîonths' interest to allow me to pay

il

off that debt. Now, under this law, 1 arn
o.nly obliged to pay you one rnontli's intevest.' That, to my mmid, is fair, especiglly when the mortgage lias matured and
is overdue. If the lender wants to continue ami renew the niortgage, let hira enter
into a new agreemient. If lie, in the first
place, lias lent moncy for five years, the
borrower cannot pay that off before the
five years have expired without his consent. If at the end of the five years the
borrower does flot pay the rnoney, the
rnortgagee lias à riglit of action againat hlmi
and can sue in the courts for the recoverv
of the amount. If lie allows the mortgage
to run that is his own business; but we
sliould not conipel the miortgagor to psy
hirn six iuonths' interest whien lie is prepared to pay it off. If tlie lender, atter hiS
inortgage expires at the end of five years,
wishes to reniew the sanie contract, ail lie
lias to do is to sig-n the sarne document over

lawyer, but simply to duplicate it; so tliat.
under tlie circurnstances, the Bi'll is flot as
radical as the lion, gentleman frorn Halifax
would lead us to believe. When the mortgage is overdue and the lender is flot
anxious to renew it, one montli's interest
is enougli to cail quits, e&%pecially wlien the
debt is ail paid off. If the borrower wants
an extension, all lie lias to do is to ask tlie
lender to extend tlie time. I think the Bill
is an improvement on the old condition of
things, especially as it affects mostly
farmers. It does not affect borrowers in
the city very inudl. It is farmers in the
country who mnay not have tlie rnoney at
the very moment the mortgage is due, wlio
allow tliese things to run. Tlieir crops are
not yet sold, and tliey are unable, at the
moment, te lay their hands on the money.
Under the old law, wlien the mortgage was
overdue for one day, if the mortgagor wvent
the next day to the lender lie could not
discharge tliat mortgage withlout, paying
from tliree to six months' interest, and thnt
by sanction of law.

According to our law, especially in the province of Quebec, a rnortgage is a mnatter of

affect property and civil riglits. Whiat is
the object of the Bll? It is not a question
purely and solely of interest. The object
of the Bill is to relieve property from a
lien, or mortgage, which had been est ablished upon that properhy by the mutual
consent of the debtor and credîtor. We
already have the legal means in our province te do what is required under such circuinstances, and it is wihhin the jurisdiction of the provincial legishature to hegislahe upon this question. Every question

Hon. Mr. WOOD-Thie meaning of this
Bill is not clear to me.
1 do not kilow
wllether it is unders-tood by other members
of the Senate; but the rneaning- is certainly flot clear to -me. Clause 10 of the
Act i the Consolidated Statutes to which
reference is made, applies to mortgages
where the date of payment is more than
five years froni the date of the mortgage.
If, af-ter the expiration of tive years, the
debtor (or the miortgag-or) choose to pay
the mortgage hie can do so -by givinig
certain notice 10 the mortgagee. This Bill
seemns to be soniething on the same lines,
to enable the rnortgagor to pay the mort.
gage off. Tlie point 1 arn not clear about
is that hie is entitled te pay the debt after
the date stipulated in the agreernent lias
exh)ired for paynient thereof, or te date
which rnav lie stipulated in any renewal
or agreement. If it mieans that hie can
only give this notice aiter the lime nientioned ln the rniortgage or the renewal
agreement bas expired, I do not understand the necess-ity for lte Bill. At aIl
events, in the province from which I corne,
New Brtunswick, so far as 1 know, after
the lime has expired il is stipulated in
the mortgage or any agreernent for the
payment of money that when tlie lime lias
expired the debtor nay pay at any lime.

He does siot require 10 give Iliree or

<)piinion such legislation is miscliievous. It
<Joes flot resuit in any good, and as a general rule is more oppressive to the debtor
than it is to the creditor. However, 1
presurne this Bill will be sent to the Coinxnittee on Banking and Commerce, where
we can hear from those who are in favour
do it, and thoroughly understand its provisions, and have it explained more fully
than it eau be to-day.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I am. opposed to
the policy and principle of the Bill on the
ground that it is a manifest interference
'aith the law of contrast, particularly in a
,class of case:: where thiere cannot be said to
be any mark-ed hardship. Much legisiation
of this chiaracter origfinates throughi somne
îsolated and aggravated case, to which possily attention of the member of the district. rnay be invited, and hie concludes that
c1eneral leciýlatiOn should be pla&ed upon
the statute-book, notwithstanding the absence of hardship, except in that particular
case. In the first place, manifestly this
legisiation is going to apply to every province of the Dominion of Canada. I see
no distinction between a mortgage and a
hypotheque.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SÇOTT-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Both are simply
charges upon 'land. My hion. friend from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has
given us a scieritifie explanation of what
both securities mean in the different provinces, and has explained that hie is not a
lawyer, whichi 1 think is manifest, but a
land survevor. I thilik hie entirely mis

sýmnply a charge upon land. It is not a
conveyance to the mortgage of the legal
esta te; but operates nierely as a security
upon land.
Now this is not going to operate as a relief
to the mortgag-or, as seems to be the impression on the part of those who sympathise
with him. The operation of this kaw, if it
came in force. wou'ld be that the mort-ngee,
on the expiration of the mortgage would not
trust to the whim or caprice of the mortgagor to. give the thirty days' notice at any
iglht choose. The mortgagee

would, if default shoeuld bie made at the due

date of either interest or principal, at once
start proceedings for the recovery of his
principal and interest. It is nianifestly to
the advantage of the mortgagor that the law
should remain as it is to-day. Could it be
said that a mortgagor is injured or is entitled t-o relief if, say for a period of four
or five years, lic goes on paying his interest
at a, particular rate on the principal money,
and then makes default, notwithstanding
his knom-ledge that the naortgage mnust be

been paying for a series of years? IMy lion.
friend from Westniiorland (Hon. Mr. W'ood)
dîd not, appreciate the fact, that this would
o.nly apply in the case of a rnortga.ge in
whicli there i., a provision or covenant that
if the principal and initertst are flot paid at
the due date, tile mortgagor shall not be
entitled to pax that pirincipal and interest
until the fdllowing due date, which may be
three or six months distant. Non', if the
payment of the principal money and interest
is postponed until tlhat subsequent date, cani
it bie said that the mortgagor is suffering any
hardship by reason of that? He has been
paying his interest for years. He is not
called on to pay any penalty, because the
law as we have it to-day prohîbits a penalty
being imposed. He siniply continues the
normal conditions that have been going on
for the series of years in whichi the mortgage was current. Where is the hlardshipP
1 fail to see it; but if vou pass a rigorous
iaw and say, after default is made by the
remissness of the mortgagor himself, that
the right of the inortgagee shil not be
recognized, that notwithstanding the contract entered into between the parties the
mortgagee shahl fot have rights, but the
mortgagor must have ail the righits, and
may ignore the passage of the defauît date
and go on at any time afterwards to discharge his debt on thirty days' notice, whien
possibly hie should have giveni three înonthis'
notice, you are only going to induce the
mortgagee at the due date to take proceeding by way of legal action. Tlien again
there is the question of contract. Are we to
go on legislating for ail time t4o protect debtors fromt creditors? It seema te me that we
are going to create a spineless cominunity

who xviii consider themselves absoived froni
giving thouglit to contracts into whichi they
may enter, and rely upon the paternai solicitude of the goverinent to protect therm
under a statue when they ignore their obligations. l'do not think that is good po'Iicy.
Then there is the further consideratiofi, that
capital is always sensitive to restrictions of
this character. Money can always comnmand
a reasonable contract for its use, and if parliament. wiil step in and take from. the borrower and lender the riglit to enter into such
a contract as they themselves may in their
discretion choose to make, it seems to nie it
is going to place a clog o11 the free use an<l
emplovment of money, particuiarly in cases
of this kind. Furthermore, this matter, as
I see it, is peculiarly a matter of contract,
something for the provinces to deal witli.
If hon. gentlemen look through this Bill
they will see that it does not deai xvitl initerest «at ail, but simply with the elemient of
payment. It is conceded that the provinces
have the right to legîsiate on property and
civil rigahts. This Bill cornes in and says,
notwithstanding the fact, that two parties
may enter into a soiemn contract, dealing
'with the question as to the time and the
manner in which principal and interest
shail be paid, the Dominion parliament ca.n step in and make a manifest encroachment on the right of the provinces
and say, 'No, you shaîl not do that, we
under the evasion, or equivocation of deal
ing xvith the subject of interest, will interfere ini the contract! I submit this is not
a question of interest at ail but a matter of
contract in which the provinces are entitied to legislate and with which we

Hon. Mr. McMULLEN-I happened to

great hardship was suffered by borrowers
through societies lending money at long
dates and high rates of interest. The Canada Permanent, for instance, and several
other companies, loaned money for teni,
fifteen and twenty years at a fixed rate
of interest. A number of borrowers found,
after a few years, that they could get rnoney
at very rnuch lesa rates of interest thani
they had been paying if they only had an
opportunity of paying off the mortgage.

THE PENKALTY 0F PATRIOTISM.
To the Editor.
Sir,-The aoticle by Mr. F. D. bone in your
current issue of this week presents the case
for the ex-service -man who wishes to emi

admira:bly. I hope that it will be read by
sme Imperialist, wha has the generous heart
and the power of the purse, sa that the opportunities now offering ini our oversea statas
may be aveiled of in the interests of thoe
who have done co mnch ta preserve and
maintain the empire.
Your Teaders mnay ha interesed ta know
that in Canada a branch has been established
under the presidency of the Governor General,
the Right Hon. Barl Grey, with the lieutenant governors of the provinces of Ontario,
Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia as
vice-presîdents, and committees have been
formad in Quebec. Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Vancouver, Victoria and Vernon.
There are openings in Canada at the present
moment in the military farces at Halifax and
Québec, and there are a few excellent opportunities for civil emiploymënt offered by the
local committeps.
lu Âustralia. thse British Immigration
League has undertaken ta reprasent the league
and la prepared ta find openingr, for men of
the right stainp whos are willing ta take up

considenîng the inattar of granting facilities
ta ex-service men ta settie in thiat country.
The chief abject of the leagne is ta advance

aithar from their ivegîmental or other associations, or from their friands, or ta fur'nish a guarantee for tisa purpose. They will

been sent to tisa Royal Canadian Garrisoli
Artillery, Quebec, by arrangement iritis the'
Canadian military authorities and thea War
Office.
At thse presant moment apanings are being
found by aur Canadian comrnittees for lif tmen, &-., in Vancouver and other parts of

given a very fair explanation of the nature
oi the measure and of its abject and bas
fuhly, as far as I ean see, justified its introduction into this House. lie bas not
quoted ancient proceedings. lie bas quoted
recent proceedings. The vast majority of'
this Hause bave voted on one or two occasions, ta my knowledge, in favour of the
very same measure, and a proposition for
a six months' boist coming from, probably,
one of the gentlemen who voted for an
identical measure is not proper. As far as
the conztitutional question is concerned,
we have the statement from the right bon.
leader of this House that the Minister af
Justice was consulted, but I fail ta see any
answer given by the Minister ai Justice that
is a decisive one. He does nat state distinctly that it is unconstitutional an aur
part ta pass this Bihl. We have the etatement et the promater ai the Bill, who says

of this Bill has had an interview with the

House that the statement to hirn was not
s0 strong as the intimation given to the

statement is not decisive, it is a thought.
He is not prepared to say decisively that it
is against our rule. Another contention
raised by the promater of the Bill is that
it is nlot aur duty to restrict our rights.. I
find that in regard to public measures, and
any Ineasures coming before this House,
th.at our usefuiness is gone as soon as any

There is scarcely a Bill before us which
does not involve expenditure of money

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Very likely the hon. gentleman is right;
but as a matter of fact, the barrel is nowhere deflned. Bags are defined in the
province of Quebec, but no reference is
made to barrels.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I anm afraid it
will *be interpreted as applying only to the
province of Quebec.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The desire oi the prometers is simply to
provide that when the word barrel is used
in any agreement, the weighit shall be understood.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-It would be better to amend the Inspection Act without
any reference to the section.
Hon. 'Mr. P.OWER-Section 338 mentions
the province oi Quebec; but ilhere is no
heading, which ]imits the ncxt section to
the province of Quebec, and this will be
an independent section, 38-A, so that I do
no think the Bill is open te the objection
which the hon, gentleman bas takien. On
the other hand, as I understand the hon.
member who has charge of the Bill, he
proposes to say that the barrel shall mean
160 pounds of potatoes. The barrel does
flot mean potatoes.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-The first part of
the clause reads ' When potatoes are sold
or offered for sale ýby the barrel;' that is
the element that enters into the transaction, and my abject is to explain that
barrel ' means 160 pound of potatees.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I understand the
reasont for makzing- this changce is that in
some parts of the countrv it is the practice to seli potatoes in buik, at so much
per barrel. There are relvne barrels at
ail, and the object is to provide in a case
of.that sort that a barrel hall be dieemied
te contain 160 pounds. I dIo not think it
is quite accurate to say that a &barrel
shall nean 160 pounds, because the barrel
is what contains the potatoes. It would
be better to say the 'barrel shal
be
deemed to contain 160 .pounds.
Hon. M-\r. COMEAU-Wh 3 - net put it thie
other ivay and say 160 pounds of potatoes
shall be deemed to be a barrel?
Mr. LOUGHEED

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-What I should
like to have flxed by this legisiation is
not what the barrel is deemed to be, but
the absolute weig<bt. The o'bject of this
legisiat «ion, as lias been suggested by the
hon. memnber from Halifax, ia to meet the
condition of zelling potatoes in bulk, iii
carload lots under a barrel transaction.
To arrive at what a party purchasing in
that forrn shall have to pay for the potatoes, it is necessary to fix a standard
weiglit for a barrel. We have a standard
weight for a bushel, and a standard weighit
for a bag, and new 'we want ta establish
a standard 'weight for a quantity alihcn
3old by the barrel, and the term used here
seems te cenvey the exact weight which is
to be accepted as the weight of a barrel cf
petatees.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-In other werds. you
are giving a definition cf a 'barrel as
applied to potatoes,
and that is 160
pounds.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Supposing I werc
te buy 6,000 ponnds of potat-oes, and instead of the vendor delivering them in
bags he delivers them in barre.lq; under this
legislation each Larrel 'would be deenied
to contain 160 pounds. wfhen as a physical
fact it would not contain more than 150
pounds. The ordinar- fleur barrel, which
is the barrel used and meant, is a two
and a haif bushel barrel, and if I buy potstees by the barrel I will be defrauded cf
ten pounds on every 'barrel cf petatoes
delivered, because the law will give the
vendor the right te say that each -bairel
la deenied te be 160 pounds. Now it takes
a barrel ail ifs time te contain two and a
half bushels cf wheat, and wheat is messured on the dead level while potatees and
apples are heaped in the mieasure and
overflow according te the generositv of the
mani who is selling fhem. You cannot possibly put 2i bushels cf potafees into a
barrel, %vhicli will confain 2J busliels cf
grain. An lion. member "near me says. a

lion. Mr. BEIQUE-I thjnk the Bill is
quite proper for two reasons. First because it is well known tJiat there are ditferent sizes of barrels, and this will define what quantity a purchaser ibuying by
the harrel is entitled to receive. Then 1
think it is also appropriate and in keeping
with the Inspection Act to define the quantity wvhen sold by the 'barrel. I am quite
in accord with the amendments suggested
by the hion. member fromn Fredericton, that
the barrel shall mean 160 pouîîds when
potatoes are sold by the barrel. The purchaser buying potatoes by the barrel wiill

Hon. Mr. COSTIGAN-M-Ny lion. friend
frurm Victoria division (Hon. Mr. Cloran>
says if hie buys 6,000 pounds of pot atoes and
they are delivered in barrels lie wvill lose
10 pounds per barrel under this Bill. But
the Bill provides against that. It provides
that a barrel shall be 160 pounds. In Ontario and Quebec, potatoes are sold by the
bag, but in the maritime provinces by the
barrel, and the object of the Bill is to
define what a barrel shall mean. 1 should
be very sorry to interfere with the leavs
relating to other provinces, but no one has
pointed out that this would initerfere w'ith
any one, except one hon. meniber, who says
that if hie bought by the barrel hie would
lose 10 pounds to every barrel. If you huy

provinces a standard weight for potatoes

should like te cali attention to the wording of this motion, and also to the message
sent from the House of Gommons. It asks
for -the accounts and vouchers. I take that
to mean every account that has been presented to the Senate for payment during
the year, and aIse the vouchers, which
would be ithe reoeipts, I take it, for the
amounts paid. Have the Publie Accounts
Gommittee of the House of Gommons constituted themselves investigators, shail I
call it, or do they propose when, an account
paid, that they must have the voucher. laid
before them te establish the f act of the payment of one dollar or two dollars or half a
dollar, or -whatever it may be, because
really if the word. voucher means anything
it means that. -Every' item of expenditure
by the Senate can be found in the Auditor
General'a Report down te ten cents. Are
we te understafi by the wording of this
message that they want a receipt or voucher, te prove that the clerk, or whoever it
was paid that ten cents, did se or put it in
his own pocket, be-cause really fromn my way
of looking at ît, I can draw ne other conclusion than that te 'which I have given
expression in reference te this matter. Another point te which I would eall the attentien of the rig-ht hon, leader of the lieuse is,
whether it is net infringing to a very greatextent upon the dignity of this Mouse, for
the PublicAccounts Coxumittee ef theHliuse
ef Gommons te demand vouchers for every
cent expended by the Senate P Is it possible that the Senate has become a vassal
of the lieuse* of Gommons, or the Public
Accounts Committee of the Heuse ef Gemmons, in everything we do?

as they formerly existed in this lieuse as
welI as in the lieuse cf Lords in England,
bacause the administration of this lieuse is
suppesed, as far as possible, te be based,
under the constitution, upon the principle
which governs the lieuse of Lords, and 1
think our own ý,onstitution declares that
any cases net provided for in our rules are
te be gZoverned and guided by the practice
and usuages of the lieuse of Lords. I look
upen this demand net only as aninfringment of our righits, but as an indignity cast
upon thîs lieuse. I express xny opinion
very freely now, se that the right hon.
gentleman who leads this lieuse, a.nd bas
the honeur of this House in his custody,
will look into the matter well befora we
accede te the request of the Public Accounts Committee of the Hýouse of Gemnmions.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I amn by ne manner of means disposed te
find fault with the remarks cf the hon. gentleman from Hastings. This motion dees
appear te me te bave been passed by the
House of Gommons somewhat incensiderately; but I am quite sure the hon. gentleman
will agree with me in thinking that it should
be treated with care. We do net want te
appear te have anything te conceal in our
azcounts, etc.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-And it was partly on that account, and
for the reasens that lie mentioned, that I
proposed that the matter should be postponed, and considered on Thursday, that I
migzht be able te look inte it a little more
carefully than I have yet been able te do.
The motion wvas agzreed te, and the order

I inquired as Vo the cause of this

of transistors was over-loaded with work.
They had a great deal more work
than they could do. It may be claimed

FEBRUARY 1, 1911

with truth that at the beginning of the
session they are very well able to keep up
iwith their work, but as tihe work of the
Senate progresses and as the end conies
near they are completely overwhelmned. In
t.his conneçtjon I -will read to the House
a letter from Mr. Bouchard:-

'As three or four pages "of translation is a

be impossible tu have the work properly doue

It was deenicd advisable therefore by
the Committee to recommend that for the
session and for the session only, a coinpetent man might be employed to assîst
the present staff of transiators and we rccommended the appointment of Mr. Morrisette. I have here a letter from Mr. Trudel

rernarks I had quoted several documents,
such as the subscription list raised by the
priests of Quebec and others for the Up.
keep of the British niavy. I could not
get even an unrevised copy of the
speech as transiated, and had to go to
the expense of having it translated myseif.
That necessarily gave me oni 'v one copy,
and I was unable to supply copies to ail
the newspapers that asked for thern. 1
wrote to the transistors several tîrnes during the recess, and the st information I
had wvas that it was in the hands of the
Printing Bureau. I learned on investigation that the Printing Bureau liad kept it
about two or three monthis. I do nlot want
to find fault with our transiators but there
is sornething wrong. I w-as a transistor in
the House of Commons under the Mackenzie government. and the French translation carne out about the saine turne as the
English edition. Transistors were appointed by the day, and it did not cost any
more for getting the work done that way.
A sufficientiy large staff was employed to
keep up with the work of translation, s0
that the French edition was in the hands
of the French members airnost as smon as
the English edition. What is the use of
having a French edition of our ' Debates'
which can only be had twelve rnonths
afterwards? Very often, the matter contained in the speeches bas ceased to be
of interest by the tiîne the translation of the report is issued. Uniess we can
have some improvernent on the preserit
systern, it is rnerely a waste of rnoney. If
our newspapers want to publish any of our
speeches, they mnust fro to the expense and
trouble of translatinz thern for thernseives,
and that takes tîrne. That is why our
speeches so seldoin find their w-av into the

Quebec newspapers. English speeches are
sornetirnes pubiished in the Engilish papers,
but when it is necessary to make a translation thev seidorn appear in the French
press. Perbaps one more transiator wiIl be
able te bring up the work to date, but it
would not cost any more to ernploy men
as they are required. The work o! translations is difficuit and requires specialiy
trained men, but they can be found. During the Mackenzie regirne, this work was
lone very often as extra work by the page,

and if the work was nlot satisfactory, the
translator was nlot paid. The price, 1 believe was $1.25 per page, and a few days
after the delivery of the speech the French
edition was published. If -we had Borne
such systern here it would improve the position.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-How rnany pages of
our ' Debates ' would be a day's work for
a translator?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-W'hen they were
working on piece-work at $1.25 per page,
a very good transiator used to translate six
or seven pages, and seine have done as
nîuch as eight pages; but that was by working frorn eight in'the mnorning until eleven
or twelve at night. It was the work of
men well versed in the tw vü languages, who
could translate airnosi as fasýt as a man
couid write. On an average, four or fi ve
pages is a very fair day's work, and it requires men who are specially trained for
the work.
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-Four pages would
be a good day's work.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-The chairman of
the committee has told us that this appoint.
ment does flot corne under the juri.sdiction
Of the commission appointed under thc
Civil Service Amendinent Act. It is, therefore, a matter for the Senate to determine.
As th,? older members of the Senate know,
such maatters have always been deait with
by the Committee on Internai Econorny.
1 do not object to the ernpioyment of another translator, but I sbould like to be
azquainted with the wvork of translation to
be prepared to give an intelligent vote on
the subjeci before us. Apart from that,
however, it bas been the practice of the
Senate for years past to refer such matters
as this to the Committee on Internai
Economy to report to the Senate before
action could. be taken.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-I arn net opposed
to the aPDointment of another translator,
but I wish to point out that this motion
is contrary to our rules, and to our classification, and that the new appointee will
be put in a better position than our translators are to-day. It is proposed that this
new transistor be appointed for the present

FEBRUARY 1, 1911

session only, and that he be paid at the
same rate as like transiators are paid in
the Flouse of Commons. We are asked to
do two things; first, that the new translator-shall be paid at the sanie rate as the
translators -in the House of Commons,
wvhere the transiators are better paid than
our transiators are here.
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-It is flot proposed to
put Mr. Morrissette on the samne footing as
the regular transiators employed in the
House of Commons. During the session
extra men are employed there at $4 or $5
a day. This is not a new thing, because
on referring to the Jourals of the Senate
for 1908, 1 find that the Debates Comrnittee
recommended that the matter of supplying
assistant French transiators be left in the
hands of the chairman of that comrnittee.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-We are bound by
the law. The chairman of the Debates
Committee invokes chapter 15, seation 23.
Now, what does section 23 say? It says
that whenever, from a temporary pressure
of work, extra assistance in e;geess of those
'whose names are on the list of successfu]
competitors is required in the interest of
the service of any department, the governor
in counicil may, upon the recomrnendation
of the head of the department, based upon
'the report in writinz of the deputy head
*that such extra assistance is required,
.authorîze the ernployment of such niumber
of temporary clerks as are required to
carry on the work of the department.
Therefore, it is thýe deputy head that should
rnake a report to the head of the department, and the head of the department
makes bis report to the Flouse. For the
purposes of this Act, the Senate is considered the governor in council, and the
clerk deputyv head and his honour the
Speaker the head of the department.
That is the channel by which this sort of
motion shouid pass. If the Flouse is willing to take a new departure, well and good;
it is establishing a precedent which may
have its value in the very near future.
Then subsection 2 o! section 23 provides
that every sucli clerk proposed for temporary work shall, before appointmnent, obtain a certificate of qualification froni the
commission that he possesses the requisite

kno-%ledge and abîlity and is duly qualified
as to age, health, character and habits. I
do flot understand how, in the face of that
subsection, the commiszion could sav that
they have no authority in the matter. I
do not question for a moment the ability
o! the candidate; I think hie is quite'fit for
.the position and able to perform the duties
he is to undertake. But 1 think Nwe should
follow the practice, and in this particular instance the reconinandation should
come froni the clark of the Flouse t0
the Speaker and fromi the Speaker f0
the Flouse itself, and then the Flouse
would be in a position to do the work as
regularly as possible, according to the
proper procedure. I may be wronz, but I
amn giving you candidlv wvhat I think is the
proper method to pursue, so îiz to maka
that appointment according to the laws o!
the country.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-I should hike to

Hoiu. Mr. BEIQUE-And ini any event, if
they require assistance it is merely at the
close of the session. In the early part af
the session, they have not too rnuch work.
I looked over that matter for a nuruber of
years, when chairman of the Debates Comnmittee, and I think I know what I am
speaking- about. The expense of the Senate
lias been placed before the country, and we
should be careful as to our action in this
matter nat ta incur unnecessary expense. 1
take occasion to direct the attention of
hon. membera ta this fact: -our debates as
thty are printed, and as they are translated, are altogether taa voluminous. I
advocated two or three years ago-and,
aiter consulting a number of leadîng xnembers of this honourable House, I had their
approval in the suggestion which 1 thenl
made-to have an editor who would take
the trouble to revise aIl the manuscript
furnished by the reporters, and remove
frin the report all repetitions and unniecessary matter. I arn reliably informed
that that is done to a considerable extent
in the House of Commons by the reporters
themselves, and if it were done in this
Flouse by a competent editor who could
act also as a reporter, the consequence
would be that our debates would be shortened by haif, and they would. be mucli
more instructive, and the cost ai translation and printing would be reduced
by haif. Instead afi having 800 pages, we
would h-ave 300 or 400. It would be a great
saving-, and our report would be a credit
to the Senate. For the purpose ai ascertaiiig whether the translation was praper.
ly Jone, I have read a largue number ai the
Senate Debates, and found innumerable
repetitians in the reports of speeches,
and rnany things which should not go into

members ai this bouse, and if we are the
guardians af aur own interesta and of the
Senate, I think we should adopt a more
condensed form ai report as soan as passible. I understand an lion. member of
this House intends ta move in that dirction.
bon. Mr. DANDURAND-I have given

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-If the hion. gentleman lias given notice, surely we should

hesitate before proceeding with this report, until we decide wvhether we want a
report sucli as the hon, gentleman cave
notice ai. If we adopted such a plan, it
mighit do away with the necessity of a
third transiatar. I think the hion. geiitieman from Stadacona is quite correct,
that if the report was adopted as it is
presented, the consequence *would be that
this additional transiator, caming at -t
late date of the session, would be paid
more than the regular translators af this
House, because our own transiators,
Messrs. Bouchard and Chapman, are not
paid as mucli as the transiat-ors of the
bouse of Coamans receive. I understand
that the intention oi the chairman af the
Debates Committee is that the additional
translator be paid by the day. I do
not think that would be the effect, because the report states that hie shall be
paid as the transiators of the House of
Commons are paid.
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-No, as the
tional transiatars are paid.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-Does the
refer to additional transiators?

Hon. Mr. COFFEY-As like transiators
in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-He is to be paid
as a transiator for this session. Section
93 of the Act provides for the employment
of additional clerks, and states that no
such temporary clerks shall be employed
for more than four months in every year,
but there is no question as to salary, and
I arn not aware of any rule for fixing the
amount of the salary, except that the

The wording of the report says that
they are to be paid the same salary
as the like transiators in the other
House. They are 10o be paid by the
day.
There will be no trouble on
that score, as I apprehended it. As to the
observations made hy my hon. friend frorn
Halifax, dreading the veto of the Auditor
General because this appointment would
be irregular, I Ïbeg leave to differ from
him. What the Auditor General put bis
veto upon two years ago was our placing a
messenger in a clasm which he was forbidden to enter by the very words of the
Act, We were acting positively against the
law. In this case I cannot sec that we are.
We are acting regularly within the law I
think. The situation of the Senate in reference to such appointments is really awkward. I arn one of the members of the Debates Commîttee. We pass certain resolutions, and an hon. meniber ibelonging to another committee suggests that we rnakç. our
reporte to another co mmittee of equal standing. That is flot at ail iu accordance with
the practîce of the Senate. One committee
is on a par with another committee, and
the onlv action that can be taken by us is
to report to the House, flot to the clerk,
flot.to the chairman of the Internai Economy Committee, but to the Senate, as we
are doing now. We are proceeding regularly, and in the only becoming, decent and
rational way we can proceed, and, granting that we conflict with the wording of the
Act, there is no other way of making this
appointment except the mode adopted by
the chairman of our committee. I repeat
that when the question cornes up for remodelling and changing our method of reporting-barring absolute abolition of the
Senate Debates-I shail be found in favour
of it, both for the English and French. At
the rate we are going, a bundred years
hienee the volumes containing( the reports
of the two houses wîll require a building
as large as our present library, aud the reports will be so stupendously voluminous
that no one will go to thern ta ascertain
what is ta be found in the dusty volumes.
The sooner we change the mod.e of reporting the better, but in the meantime I hope
the House will see, if not the uecessity, at
least the advisability of adopting the report now before us, which will have the

Hou. Mr. CLORAN-I simply risc to
correct an impression from. the remarks
made by the hou, gentleman froma Acadie
(Hon. Mr. Poirier). He stated that the
translation of the Debates was not satisfactorîly aud properly doue.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER-If I convcycd that
illpression, I withdraw it. I mean. to refer
to the delay in the work of translation. 1
tliink, the work is. very* properly done. I
thank rny hon. friend for calling- attention
to it.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-There is no doubt
that our translators are probably the most
competeut mcn in the Dominion of Canada. They are merl of national reputation
as literateurs, pocts and writhrs, and I regret now, as I stated some two years ago
whcn this matter was up, that we do not
pay our transîsters sufficient for thé work
tîhey do. It was provcd here time aud again
that our transîstor.3 were doing hearly
twcuty-fivc to thirty-three per cent more
work than the regular trausîstors of the
House of Gommons who receive a aalary of
s2,500. An effort wvas made in this honourable House to put our transiators on
the same footing as the translators of the
House of Gommons, (but the effort faileI
on the ground of economy, not taking into
consideration the ability and talent the-st
men were placing at the service of th
country, ability aud talent that are not
surpassed by any of the transistors in the
House of Gommons. To-day -we have it
officially stated that these two tranisiators,
who are under'paîd ly this houourable body,
have too much work to do. It is admitted
that they caunot do the w'ork so as to
provide the French copy of the Senate
Debates promptly. They are not the only
ones who are cntitled to, and who want
the Frenchi edition of the Debates. All our
pu-pers, ail French citizens iii the province
of Québec, in New Brunswick, and iri
Manitoba, where the French language îs
spoken, and where it is written, require

FEBRUARY 1, 1911
these Debates, and should have them as
promptly as the Engli-sh newspapers snd
the English institutions of this country,
and any attempt made to rainimize the
absolute need of this report is flot fair. We
have-been -discussing the paltry sum of
about $200, because if the translator is
employed, he 'will have 40 or 50 days worlc
by the close of the session and at $4 or $5
a day it would amount to albout $200. It
was enough for the committee to report to
the House what they wanted, giving
proof that 'what they
wanteà
was
necesaary, ibut <we discuss the Auditor General, the Governor in Council, and this and
that in connection with this paltry matter.
The Civil Service Commission has put itself on record that the matter is too small
for them to deal wit.h, and does flot corne
within the 'purview of their powers and
jurisdiction. Why not accqpt the
statement of the chairman of the committee that
the services of the transiators are requiredl
The expenditure will flot ibe so great that
the country will ibe shocked at our extravagance.
Hon. Mr. McMULLEN-I niove an
axnendment, that the report be not now
adopted, but that it be referred to the
Committee on Internal Economy for their
consideration and report, and that further
consideration 'be leit over until we have
their written report.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWEL-Thi3
is a very simple question to diecide, and the
matter of t.he paltry amount referred to by
the hon, gentleman who has just spoken
has flot been under consideration. I arn
flot aware that any gentleman has spoken
to that portion of the report ; but, notwithstanding the conflict of opinion expressed
here, the letter f rom tlhe Civil Service
Commission declares that this appointment
did not corne under their consideration. My
hon. frienl frorn De *Salaberry came to a
different conclusion on reading the law.
In view of that conflict of opinion, and in
view of the notice given by the hon. gentleman frorn De Lorirniier, it does strike nie it
would be -well to defer the consideration o!
this question until the sense of the Senate
has lbeen tested on the motion proposed .by
rny hon. friend from De Lorimier. 1 might

isç5

add ,parenthetically that I arn fully in
accord with rny hou. friend who has given
notice of this motion. It ia the opinion I
expressed a numnber of years ago. Wfhen
in the House o! Commons I voted in favour
of aibolishing the ' Hansard'» altogether,
and I have not changed my mind on that
question yet. The hon, gentleman gives
notice that in the opinion o! this Hause the
reporting and printing of the debates of
this chamber at full length is a costly and
useleas expenditure ; t>hat the Standing
Commi'ttee on Debates and Reporting. be
instructed to arrange during the present
session for the reporting and printing of
debates of the House in a concise forn,
sud to report thereon.
That motion is of a somewhat drastic
character, but if it should be passed,
and
the Debates Cornmittee confine
themselves to the question referred. to
them under this notice, it seenis to,
me another transiator will not be required. I suggest that the report and
the amendment'should be allowed to stand
until this question is taken up. During
the two months we have heen in session,
there certainly has flot been work for an
additional transiator, and from what appears on the paper it does not appear that
we are to have a great deal of work fropi
the Hlouse o! Commons this session. 'The
governent has not deemed it advisable to
present any goverrument Bills of importance to this House, and the private Bills.
so far, have been simply to extend railway
charters or incorporate loan and insurance
companies. As I understand it, the Bills
which corne from the House of Commons
are translated hy the staff there, and not
by the transistors of- this House. If there
is a permanent staff, as I presume there is.
they could be employed to report the debates o! this House, and if they are too
busy during the latter part of the session
to do that work, they could proceed to
complete the translation of the Debates
after the prorogation o! parliament. Where
the delay has been I cannot say, but either
the translators have neglected to keeD UP
their work during the recess, or the Printing- Bureau has failed in its duty. The hon.

AMERICAN NXON-COMS. IN QUEBEC
CITADEL.
IMQUIRY POSTPONED.

The order of the day being called,
By the Hon. Mr. LANDRY:
Tliat lie will caîl tlie attention of the government ta tlie grave assertions cantained in

tlie following article publislied in the Montreal ' Star' ai the 25th January instant, af
whicli the following is the tenar:
ÂMERICAN NON-COM. IN QUEBEC
CITÂDEL.
No Special Spias needed ta copy the Plans ai

the Fort as the Citadel is an open Book.

Whether Senator

Landry

was

right that

copies of tlie plans of the Citadel et; Quebec

lied been made and sent ta the United States
authorities is true or flot, the iact remains
that tlie saine autharities cen have thein any
tine they wish.
No systein ai espionege carafully prepared
and carried oui by specially picked men will

have ta be employed. There is a simpler
method-get the plans froin the American

soldiers enlisted et the Citadel.
Sa long as United States citizens are allowed
ta enlist in tbe Canadien military service, so
long will Canada be open ta leakages in the
respect ta wliich Senator Landry hias called
the attention. ai a betrayed country.
At the Citadal in Quebec, according ta tlie
story told ta-day ta 'Thie Star» by an exmember of the farce there are several United
States citizens parading hanilie unifarin of
tlie Canadien militie.
One cf these men bas been a non-camissioned officar in the United States army and,
up te six monthe ega, et any rate, was a
non-commissioned officer in the Citadel at Quebec. Thxis man iras in a pasition whlere lie
naight easily 'obtain and copy ail the plans
pertaining ta the fortrese and its defences,
being in the service of ane of the officers wbo
had charge ai this brandi of thie service.
«ls it lhkely,' aclis the ' Star's ' informant,
thet tlie United States would enxploy outsiders ta do the work ai obtaining what details
and information thay desirad, whlen riglit in
the ragiment guarding the fortress thare irere
at least tiva of their citizans posing as Canadians soldiers? Hardly.'
'The last turne 1 sair the non-comxnissioned
officer I have told you af,' said the ex-militiamaxi to-day, 'hae ias talking of returnin g ta
his native country and bis cmn army. verhaps bis work et Quabec iras done and bis
chiefs irare calling him home.'
'But, is it possible for a citizen ai the

tian of the fortifications. 0f course, 1 could
flot Bey that this man actually did copy plans,
but there was nothing ta prevent his doing
so had hie fait inclined.
«The fort is an open book to any one who
wants ta see it in ail jts details.'
And that hie wvill ask:
Is it the intention of the governinent ta
verify or ta cause ta be verified, but in as
quiet a maner as possible, the exactness of
the facts related in the aboya mentioned article, and ta take the necessary stepe suggested or required under the circuinstances ta
remedy the evil if it has been committed or
ta prevent it, if it is yet turne?
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The department inform me that they
desire that this matter be allowed to stand,
as it bas been necessary to cail for a report
from the officer commandinR the Quebec
command, which report bas not yet been
received. Perhaps it ie snowed Up ai
Coteau.
The inquiryv was allowed ta stand until
Tliursday next.

lias the governinent fixed a date after which
Mr. Gustave Langelier, who lias sold his faim
ta, tlie government, would be at liberty ta dispose af his herd as lie sees fit?
Has this date expirad? What is this date!
Has the governinent been notified by Mr.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-The opinion of

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-There is no question
that this clause is nlot required, but the

of Bill in which this clause is to be found,
and its object is to caîl the attention of

THE SENATE DEBATES.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Before the orders of
the day are called, I should like to know
froim the ciairinan ai the Debates Coinmittee if lie lias any information by telephone or otherwise about the delay in issu-

ing the revised edition of aur Debates?
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-Yes, I can supply
the hon. gentleman with the information
lie requires. Perhaps from. nat knawing
better, the Printing Bureau may be saiewhat ta blame in tliis matter. They have
been delaying the wark ail alang waiting
for an English translation of tie speech

morning, and, at your request, 1 beg ta repart
thereon as followsThe translators of the Senate are appointed
as French translators, that is ta say, ta
translate Engliali into French, as may be seen
by the following schedule:
Trudel, J. Boutillier, 1-B, chief French
translator.
Boucliard, Josephi, 2-A, 2nd French translator.
Chapman, William, 2-A, Srd French translator.
DeMontigny, Louvigny, 2-A, 4th French
translator.
The Engliali translator is Mr. Creighton:
Creighton, J. G. Aylwin, 2-A, law clerk of
the Senate, parliamentary coutisel, master in
chancery, Englisli transiator.
His duýties are ta translate Frenchi into
Englisi.
Very few persans can do bath translations.
However, Mr. Lelièvre, 2nd clerk assistant,
who is also French translator: Lelièvre,
Simeon, 2-A, 2nd clerk assistant, Frenchi translator, lias been performîng the duties of Englisli transîstor, owing ta f requent pressure of
work in Mr. Creigliton's office.
To my knowledge, since my appointanient, we
have neyer been called upon ta translate frani
French into Englisi, except iii the case of
Mr. Lelièvre.
You rs respectfullxy.
J. BOUTILLIER TRUDEL,
Chief translater.
The Hon. T. Coffey,
Chairman Debates Committee.
The only thing that I can sce ta be done
under the circumastances is ta tell the
Printing Bureau ta go ahead, in case the
hon. gentleman fromn Ottawa does not want
lis speech translated froin French into
E-nglish.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Do 1 understand the
cliairman of the Debates Committee 10 say
that there is an EnglIish transiator in this
Flouse to translate Frenchi into English?
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-Yes, Mr. Creighton.
Hoin. Mr. CLORAN-Has lie the requisite knowledg-e to translate Frenchi into En-lish?
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-I do not know; but
1 understand lie lias been f ulfilling the
duties weii enougli.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I arn asking if hie
understands Frenchi well enough to translate it into EngIili?
Hon. Mr. ÇOFFEY-I believe lie doos.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Onr Frenchi Canadian friends have liad reason te comnplain in this matter; it is our turn now.
When we undertak-e to speak one of the
coustitutionai languages in this House, we
find there is nobody to translate it into
English. Our Frenchi Canadian friends do
their best to accommodate the convenience
of the House by speaking in the English
language, a thing they are flot obliged to
do. It may happen that an English speaking member of this House may undertake
to speak in Frenchi, and, from what we are
told to-day, there is nobody to translate
his speechlinto Engiish. The English menibers have a grievance. I wouid love 10
hear an Engilisli member deliver himself in
Frenchi. Some day or otiier I may do it
myself for the edification of this House and
our French members.
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-M\r. Creigliton, 1
understand, is quite a competent English
translator. If the hoin. inember from Ottawva (Hon. Mr. Beicoixrt) ivishces to have his
speech transiateci into Eneglish, I will delay
the issue of the reviscd edition for the purpose; if not I shall instruct the King's
Printer to procced at once t0 issue the revised edition witli tfiat speech in French

int
Engiish as well as English into
Frenchi. These gentlemen have flot been.
during the present session, overworked. 1
gabIer from what the chairman of the committee reported as liaving been said by Mr.
Boudh.ard, that four pages of the Debates
would be a fair average day's work for a
transiator. There are two or three translators, and our Debates since the beginning
of this session have not averaged more
than tliree pages a day, so that one of the
two miglit easily have overtaken ail the
translation from Engiish into Frenchi that
lias to be done. Surely eiîlier one of themù
could have found time 10 translate this one
speech from French int Eng-lisli. 1 do
not think we sliould lie calied upon to
appoint another translator for the purposo
of doing that work. Withi respect 10 Mr.
Creighton, lus duties as chief Englisli translator, I take il, are to inake any necessary
translations of Bis and officiai documents
of that kind. I amn no very particular friend
of Mr. Creighton's, as the House probably
knows, but I do not think lIat hie is expected to do the work, of transiatîng the
Debates. There are two regular ' Hansard '
transistors, and the second clerk, assistant.
Surely belween lhem ail they can turn out
a translation of this, flot very long, but
rallier interesting and important speech of
the hion, gentleman from Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. COFFEY-In answer to wliat
the hon, gentleman froin Halifax lias said,
I wish bo state that I made inquiry thin
miorning on that very point. It is a very
rare thing bo find a Frenchi transiator who
is competeat to translate Frenchlin
mbFng«iish. I inquired from Mr. J. K. Forari of
the House of Commons. He said lie couid
do il, and lie knew of only one other person
who wvas able to do il. That is Mr. Bouchette of the Parliamientary Library. Since
Ilion I have iearned thaI our second clerk's
assistant is quite capable of doing it aise.
So that I tluink tlie lion. gentleman
from Halifax is expectinig 100 mucli of the
present Frenchi transistors when lie asks
thîem 10 translate French into Eng-ii.
That is not their business. Tliey are appointed to translate Eng--ili int Frenchi.

bas given them thue riglit to locate their
station anywhere between Theodore and
Insinger, and so people are fooled and
deceived. That is not a condition of things
to be sanctioned by Act of parlianient, yet
it is what .we are doing by this Bull. The
Bill in itself amounts to very littie, but it
is an attack on the principle which I
advocate here to-day, the safeguarding of
the rights and interests of the people. I
arn not opposed to the company getting
their road as cheaply and favourably built
as possible. 1 understand the difficulties
under whiclî railway companies labour i
constructing their roads. 1 understand
their financial difficulties, but understanding them does not drive out of my mind
and conscience the fact that theirs is not
the only interest to. be considered; that
we must safeguard the interests of the peopie at large. We have found companies
that for no engineering reasons, for no difficulty of location, have given a village the
go-by, simply because that village or municipality did flot accede to the wishes or
requirernents of the company. I1nstead «~
building the lime into or bordering on the
village or town, the company build a mile
«or two outside the town, to the great inconvenience and expense of the population.
It costs as much to prepare a horse and
rig for a drive of a mile or a mile and a
hal! as for a drive o! ten miles. All that
lias been winked at by parliament. It la
time that when a railway company cornes
here for rights, parliament should indicate
those rights speoifically, so that the peoz
pIe would know what was to be done. The
present practice goes to show what legislation by cornmittee means. It is an invitation to the hon. members who do flot
belong to the different committees to beware of Buis which are brought in and the
titles simply read a second or third tirne
and passed, without further consideration.
There is a danger underlying such a system of legislation, to which the people of
this country should not be subjected. It
is now regarded as nothing short of a crime
for any hon. member to challenge the decision of a cornmittee. The committee
h as passed upon it and reported; therefore the House must accept it. 1 have
always felt in rny soul and -conscience
that the practice was wrong, and I feel

it my duty to protest against it, and
in the future I shaîl avail mysel! of
the right to protest when I feel that.
measures wbich have passed the coinmittee, very often by a single casting vote,
are hurried through the House %vîthout
due consideration. It is said that it is
against the orders and rifles of the House
to allude to what bias transpired in 'the
ornrittee. I could neyer understand the
necessity for it, ibut 1 arn now commencing
to understand the meaning o! iA and, for
sorne, the necessity of it. What transpires
in the comrnittee should be laid -before
tihis henourable House in aIl details ; ail
discussions of a Bil1 should be laid
on the table, so that every member
of the House would know whiat transpircd
in cornrittee ; where perhaps they could
scarcely get a quorum. Il it is tuie rule
of parliament not te allude to what transpires in the committee, I amn against suchi
a rule, and I hope I will live long enoughi
to see the rule changed. I know it
ia difficuit te alter conditions that have
existed in the Senate for the last
30 or 40 years. It is bard for old ideas
te give way te new ones; but I hope te see
the day wheu there will be sufficient fresb,
blood in thia honourable House to -give way
to the needs o! the present generation, and
net for ever base their judgrnent on what
hias been doue in the past. I feel keenly
on this rnatter, and take it seriously. I
know that I rnay mot have an echo at pre.sent in the minds cf the ma-jority of this
honourable House ; but I feel that what I
state here will find an echo general and
deep throughout the country.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I think tbe subject
matter cf the oration cf the hion. gentleman
is entirely eut of place. If there is one
place te discuss these matters, it is wbhere
the people Pan get some information. The
hion. gentleman is discussing the changes
in this Bill which give the right te the coinpany te run a loop-line in a few miles freni
their main line, starting freim Theodore or
Insinger. I think th-at is a proper previsien, because in that country there is great
difflculty in -building a road. That is practically Beaver Hills, and the company have
a latitude of three or four miles, te atart
that road either from Theodore or Insinger.

and seconded by either an hion. member of
the House of Commons or of the Senate,
calling for certain information regarding
mioneys voted by parliament for certain
purposes which would co.ncern the House
of Gommons and the Senate. That motion
was duly made and seconded, and unanirnously adopted by the committee, and
I amn surprised to find that it is flot ini

Hon. Mr. COFFEY-I will look into the

portions of the Inspection and Sale Act.
The portions whieh are new have been
carefully marked in the margin for the
information of lion. gentlemen, and the
more material alterations will be found in
part one, paragraphe 3 to 17, and also in
the part called «'Offences and penalties '
in the latter portion of it, marked 242, and
others. This being a Bill of great importance to *the Northwest, and indeed,
generally speaking, it wvill he desirable that
it should be in the hands of lion. gentlemen for some little time before it ie proceeded with, and therefore, while I amn
about to introduce if, althoul-h the important alterations are comparatively short,
I will be guided by the wish of hon. mcmbers of the House as to what day they
would like the second rcading« to taki,

fessional homesteaders-people who take up
land and live on it for three winters in
succession and then seli it. By doing so,
thev make more mo.ney than they could
earn in any other way. It is, therefore,
only reasonable to ask bomesteaders to do
a littie more in the way of improvement
than they are now required to do. Something should be done in the way of planting trees. Had we madle tree planting a
condition eighteen or twenty years ago,
the prairie country would now be well supplied with trees. The homesteader who
and a smaîl
simply builds a fence
house may lose them by prairie fires, and
if the land is not cultivated, it rapidly
goes back to its original condition. But
trees, when planted, will go on growing
whether the homesteader remains on his
land or not, and the country wilI get the
benefit. The government have experimentai farms and are supplying young- trees
to every one who wants them, and it
is not unreasonable to require, in certain
areas of the western country, where the
land is valuable, that in addition to other
improvements the homnesteader shall plant
a certain number of trees every year and
look after them. The homestead inspector
can see that the trees are properly planted
and attended to, and the right number
have been jilanted, before recommending
that the patent issue. If this policy is
adopted in the sections of the country
yet to be settled, in a few years we will
have trees throughout that prairie on every
quarter-section homestead. They will grow
rapidly, serve as windbreaks and help to
keep the soul moist. There 'will be no
trouble after that if they are protected
from the prairie fires. I do not know what
view the government will take of this measure, but I submit it for their consideration
as a step in the right direction. Perhaps
we might go further and ask for a littie
more improvement on the land. Another
feature of the measure is that when the
homesteader plants these trees and looks
after them, the trees belong to himi and
are increasing the value of the homestead.
and hie derives ail the benefit.

INTRODUCED.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS moved the second
reading of Bill <B) An Act ta amend the
Dominion Lands Act. He said: It i5
about time thut we exact a little more
work done from people who get free lands
from us in the way of homesteads than
they are doing at present. You wvil] see
by the provisions of the Bill, I ask that
the Act be amended to require a homesteader to plant a certain number of trees.
At the samne time, I propose to relieve hioe
<of some other duties hie bas ta perform in
the way o! cultivation. In the west, the
value of lands has been rapidly increasing,
yet the conditions on which those lands
are homesteaded remain practically unchanged. Those conditions were framed
eighteen or twenty years ago, when it was
almost impossible to induce settlement in
the west, and consequently the lands had
littie value. At thàt time a quarter section of land would hardly bring $50, and
maturally we made the conditions of settlement easy for the settler. We simply
asked him to erect a smaîl house Worth
say $300 or less, and break up and sow a
few acres of land, and then, after coInplying with the termi o! residence, we gave
him a patent. In those days nobody took
uP land unless hie wanted to live on it,
because hie could not borro,% money to
settle on it or. improve it. We had then
no boan companies doing business in the
West, and when a man homesteaded a
quarter section of land, we knew that hie
intended ta make it bis home, and so made
it easy for him. But thinga have changed
of late years, and band is'now worth from
$15 to $20 an acre, so that the homesteadRt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT

of our Debates, the work was done by contract at $1.50 per page. 1 find that the
Debates of 1907-8 contained, without the
index, 1740 pages, which cost, for translation $2,610. The Debates for the session
of 1908&9 contained 758 pages, and the translation cost $1,137. 1 arn also informed that
'when the work was done by contract the
contractor had a sufficient staff to do the
vork, sud it was well done. Since we have
undertaken to employ a translation staff
for the Debates, paying themn by salary, it
cost, last year, $4,100. This year the
salaries wiil reach $4,200, whereas if the
work had been doue by cont*ract, the cost
would be about $1,200, and the work, would
have been done in a prompt snd satisfactory manner. But it seems that it is now
necessar «v to employ a third translator,
whichi w-ill bring the expense up to soine
$6,000. If sucli a staff is considcred necessary, we had better go back to the oid systerr of having the work donc by contract.
We are informed that a translator's work
for a day runs fromn three to eight pages of
translation. Up to the present time our
Debates have not amounted to more than
185 pages, though we have been in session
for hetween two sud three nionths. Surely
there is no occasion for employing an sdditional trauslator to assist the two trarisiators we have at the preseut, time. But 1

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The hon. member
from Portage la Prairie held up two
volumes as the Debates for two years. Now,
I hold in my hand the Debates for 1907-8,
tmd 1 find that the translation of the
speeches cover 1844 pages, and the index 140
or 150 pages. 1 arn afraid that the hon.
gentleman knows so lîttie French that he
could not tell which was the first and 'which
was the second volume. I arn sonry that
hie is not here, but I .zannot let the Senate
remaîn under the impression that work of
this kind was done for the paltry sum and
the incorrect figures he mentioned. Now,
here is a volume which would have cost
under the old system over $3,000. Translators, at that time under salary, were paid
$1,800. The rate 'bas been increased since
then, and one translator gets $2,000 and the
other $2,050. and there will be an increase
this year, bringing the total up Vo $4,200.
There is quite a difference between the
su.iement of facts 'which I arn raking and

Houce. The Senate should Bîso bear in
mind that work which couldj be obtained
at a certain rate twelve or fifteen years ago
could not be had at the saine price to-day.
As the chairman of the Debates Committee
Ilas said, any one -who kniows anything of
literary business must know that the product of the brain is getting a little of its
due to-day, just as well as the product of
the factory. or any other manual labour,

Ten or fifteen years ago

labourers had Vo work longer hours and
for less pay than at the present time. The
Ilonse is asked to place brain work on s
lower level than ordinary manual labour.
This House is asked to fix an antidiluvian
valuc on intellectual work. It is not fair.
I quite agree with the hon. gentleman from
Acadia (Hon. Mr. Poirier) that the work
of translation -which vas donc by contract
,was noV in consonance with the literary
dignity of this parliament. Surely w.e ought
to have some respect for our iiterary reputation. At least we should noV have it go
out in black and white as one based on
ignorance. The French translation of the
past. %ve are told, was a disgrace. It
Hon. Mr. POWER.

is true that parliament gave the translation oi the Debates to a certain party
who might have been a coal dealer, a real
;ýstate agent or a dry g-oods merchant, so
far as t.he work was concerned. He receiv.l
$1.50 per page, and hired 'poor starvin.
students or poor starving newspaper menbecause in those days reporters got $7 u;ý
$8 a week, while to-day they are gettiniz
$15, $25 sud $30 a week-at 75 cents per
page, pocketing a profit on their work, just
the saine as manufacturers do who get
clothing made in sweat shops. This man,
eng-aged by parliament to do the work of
translation, having say a thousand -pages
to translate, would receive from parlianient
$1,500, and probably would gei the N¶'orlz
doue in a slip-shod manner for haif that
amount, rnaking a profit on the work oi
others. We are seniously asked by certaiin
hori, gentlemen to returii to the old stat.
of affairs. I protest, jointlv -with the hoii
gentleman from Acadia, who had his conivictions on this matter, and wîth.the hiot.
gentleman froan Stadacona, and I woul
like other senators to have the courage of
their convictions and demand of this flouse
full respect for their rights. The argument
put forward *by the hon. member froin
Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson) based
on the figures hie mentioned, cannot hold
waten. The session of 1907-8 was not the
longest in the history of this House. We
have had sessions extending to eighlt and
nine months, and t.he reports contained
noV in one volume, 'but in two very large
e
volumes, so the argument based on
statement that the work could be don'
under contract for one-third less is flot
in accordance with facts. At the old price,
the volumes of 1907-8 'would have cost over
$3,000 , and the last hundred pages is work
that cannot he donc by any ordinary wan).
The index involves noV weeks, but months
of labour. It is no small matter Vo go
through 2,000 .pages of 'this work, and index
it properly as it is indexed here to-day.
Why not give the men who do this literary,
work credit for thein labour? This hundred
pages at the end of the second volumne woulft
cost any hon. gentleman, who would give it
out to a professor of a university to do it
properly, anywhere from seven hundred Vo
a thousand dollars, and that has to be

FEBRUARY 8, 1911
added to the cost of the work itself. These
being the conditions under 'which ftie
present work is being done, I cannot for
the life of me sec why hon, gentlemen,
who are prepared to vote millions and millions for objecta which are of less benefit
to the commnnity, will object te the paltry
sum of $4,000 for the honour of this
Senate, and for the guarantee of the
French language wben the rights of t~he
French people have to be maintained.
1 can understand it from only one point
of view, that it is ignorance of a condition
o! things not ini symrpathy with the people
-%vhom this book represents. 1 hope it is
nft true. I hope it is due te a want o!
knowledge of facts, and I compieteiy endorse the attitude by the hon. senator from
Stadacona in regard to the question befor.: the House, that this amendment
thai the report be re!erred to the Inlernai Economy Oommittee, which would
only be a bai! decent burial, should
be voted down unanimously by this House
and the matter left ini the hands of the
proper committee. The committee may have
erred in proz-edure in flot presenting the
report through the proper channel to the
House, instead of iaying it on the table
and have it go to the Cierk, who would
reffr it to the Hon. Speaker, and then the
Hon. Speaker wouid refer it baek to the
House. which I tbink 'would be the proper
course under the Civil Service Act. It la
only an error in procedure; but for an error
of that kind, are we going te jeopardize the
rielhts of the French Canadian people and
of thE men on oui' staff? I say noa, and once
the~ arnendment is votcd down, if the Hon.
Chairman says that it la neceaaary for hlm
f0 take the other course and have the report
referred to the C]erk of tise House, to be
rextrr-d by hlm to the Speaker and then
the Svieaker to makie hîs report to this
Hous,-. let that be done; but, as a question
of prmniple, I hold, in the face of this honourable House, Rnd in the face of the country, ih.ere is no extravagance in this ma.tter
o! $2.'ýoù a year salary to the two French
transiators. As regards the necessity for
a third fransiaf or, I amrn ot in a position
to discuss that question, because I have
not had sufficient information from the
cominmftee as to the work the third man is

189

going to do. If the two transiators can do
the work, and do it weii, then. the third
is unnecessary; 'out I understand that this
additional translater is appointed temporarily, to be called in when there is a
iush o! work to be done, which is a different matter. The principle here is fo hold
what we have. If we were as careful in
curtailing expenses for other purposes we
would do better. I hope the chairman of
the zommittee will stand by the position
he has taken, and see that the rights of
members in regard te French translation
are maintaiiied in their integrity, and that
he will ba sustained by the House.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I had not proposed
to take any part in this discussion, but
realiy things have prog-reased to that point
that 1 think, it is only right that every
member who has an opinion on thia subject
shouid express it, that is, if some one else
bas not already expressed it. The hon.
gentleman from Victoria division (Hon. Mr.
Cloran) informed us at the close of a very
eloquent and somewhat prolonged speech,
that on the -matter which was before the
Houce-that ia, the report of this committee which recommended the appointmient o! an additional translator, he was
not informed, and lie did not know whetber
the additional transistor was required or
not. That was juat what was before the
Flouse; that was tise report of the comLnittee, and consequently ail the hon. gen.1
tleman's elaborate speech was not to the
purpose at ail.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Was the speech of
the hon. gentleman from Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson), not before the

Hon. Mr. POWER-No, I have the floor,
and I 'wiil not be interrupted. The bon.

on behaîf of the French language and of
the French members o! this Flouse. I
think too 1igbly of the French members

BILL.
SECOND READING MOVED.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill (I) An Act respecting the
pollution of navigable waters. He raid:
When about a year ago I introduced in
this House a measure similar to the one
now before us, I am sure neither inyself
nor the hon. gentlemen who did me the
honour to listen to me then thought we
would, within such a short time, have
ucider our immediate notice such a horrible
demonstration of the menace and evil ta
which I drew the attention of the House
at that time. It is fortunate in one Nway,
that the Bill which I arn bringing before
the bouse is not introduced as the result
of the present epidemic which is causing
so much suffering and so many deaths in
the city of Ottawa, and that it is not a
panic measure, but one, evidently, the
necessity for which can be shown for some
time past and for other reasons than those
caused hy a panic. It is not my intention
to-day to go over the ground which I
covered hast year, and which. I hope is stili
fresh in the memory of hon. gentlemen. I
entered as fully as I could into the reasons
for the hegislation. I pointed out its necessity. I tried to give the House an anahysis
of what had been done elsewhere on this
subject, and, I think, showed conclusively

FEBRUARY 10. 1911
at the time the necessity for putting an
end to the dumping of sewage into the
sources of our water supply. It is an evil
universally recognized, and one which the
whole civilized world to-day is striving to
remedy. I do not think there is any part
of the world at present where it is not
recognized that this is probably the only
aubject as to which humanity bas been
most negligent. Whilst in Canada and
elsewhere legisiation for the preservation
of the publie health has been resorted to
in varions ways, by protection to our food
snd by t.he adoption of hygienic laws, it
would aeem, not only in Canada, but ail
over the world, of ail animal creation man
has been the one most neglected. We have
laws to prevent the spreading of disease
among hogs, cattie and horses. On a recent
occasion we made it a subj ect of international treaty that fisb in internai -waters
should. receive protection. The governments of Canada and the United States
have devised mens -for the protection of
fish in these waters. If I might be permitted te paraphrase Mr. Kelso, *ho takes
such an interest in the welfare of children,
to-day it is better to be a horse, a hog, a
cow or a fish, than te be a man, because
more -protection bas been bestowed ý on
those various members of the animal creation titan upon. man. What would the
community say of a man that would shlow
his cattle te be fed ont of a slop pail? I
use strong expressions, because I think the
community at large must be aroused to
the evils of water pollution. If any one of
us would see our servants bringing us
water for drinkîng or cooking purposes in
a slop psul, whât wouid we do to those
servants, and yet that le what we are doing
every minute of the day. We are dumping
into the water which we are going to drink
the worst sort of contamination possible,
flot occasionally but constantly. If a smal
village of 50M or 1.000 population dumps its
sewage into the Ottawa river, the city of
Ottawa is up in arms, but we are doing a
thousand times worse ourselves than any
village is doing. I use strong language,
because I tbink the occasion requires it.

There has been on the part of humanity nt
large, and on the part of the people of
Canada ln particular, the greatest negligence in this -direction. The dumping of
sewage into our sources of water supply
causes a'dangerous menace to human life.
It la an unnecessary evil. There in no necessity whatever to dump sewage into oui
rivers. Take the most congested nation in
the world, Belgium, with a population of
about 400 te the square mile; tbey do not
dump their sewage into the streams. It
is disposed of by purification or used for
fertilizlng purposes. I have figures here
to show that in a city o! about 50,00(1
population lu Belgiurn, the cost per head
annually for turning sewage into perfectly
good drinking wvater is seven cents. Who,
for seven cents a head, would not insure
his lIfe against flot onlv typhoid fever, -but
against other diseases transmitted by pol.
lnted water? It is almost incredible nt
titis age, after so mucli progress bas
been made by the scientific world in
the advancement of comfort and progress, especially in the medical branch,
that we are still carrying on titis criminai
practice of pouring sewage into the sources
fromn which. we get our water supply. Since
the introduction of this measure a year
ago the matter has engaged the attention
of the Commission on Conservation. 1
should like to have the privilege of putting
in the Debates some o! the reflections contained in an address by Dr. Hodgetts on
pure water and the pollution of waterways.
Dr. Hodgetts aaya at page 8:
It is Renerally conceded that a large percentage of ail sickness happening in cities
and towns is (lue to impurîty of the water
supily. sewaze contaminated water beàng- an
important cause cf diarrhea, typhoid fêver,
choiera, and probably of a number of other
diseases of which at present we cannot speak
witit certainty.
It bas been se fer accepted, and is now
almost the oreneral ruie, to consider that a
continued typhoid deatit rate of over 20 ver
100.000 of population is an indication that
the public water supply is greatly at fanit.
With the obiect of ascertaininz how this
ruie wonid work ont for Canadian cities. information has been obtained as to the deaths
from typhoid fever reported in cities o! Canaadurinz the decade of 1900-1909. and this
hsbeen set forth ln table A.

FEBRUARY 10. 1911

For purposes of comparison of typhoid
statistics with some of the cities of the United
States. a compilation of the mortality figures of twelve cities of the United States
located on the chain of Great Lakes, has been
mnade in table B. These figures are for the
correspondinz Years of table A. ýwith the exception of 1909, for which the figures could
flot be obtained. The uiortality rates given
are zathered from the reports of the Washington Census Bureau. This table clearly
shows that if the oonditions of Canadian cities
borderinir on the Great Lakes is bad. those
of the cities of the United States referred
to are ecsually so. The possibilities of sewsge
pollution there are niany turnes zreater than
ini Canada. The people of the United States
havii fot learned the lessons of municipal
sanitation-the laws of common sense-and as
a conseauence the typhoid death rate in the
United States le 46 per -100,000.
To f urther empliasize the fact that Canada
has lessons t(, learn in respect to sanitation
generally, frorn the older countries of Europe.
where the population is and has been congested for ma.ny years, as well as froin the
nation to the south of us, table C has ben
prepared. A tYphoid index certainly goes far
to show what tlîcse countries are doing in
respect to water supplies and the protection
of the saine as well as to general measures
of sanitation which cannot be dwelt upon
here. The figures are the latest obtainable.

Hon. Mn. BELCOURT-Scientifie men

at a cost of seven cents per head cf the
population. That the present epidemic in
Ottawa le due to the pollution in the water
supply is absolutely demonstrated to-day.
It is as brutaily dlean as any arithmetical
problem le. We know where it cornes
from, how it got iuto aur mains, and exactly the occasion for it. Thene is a portion
cf the city at the west end, and a amail
village narned Mechaniceville adjaluing it
on the river front, where all the sewage is
emptied into a little stneam known as
Cave Creek. That creek empties into the
Ottawa about a mile above the watenwonks.
The corporation of the city of Ottawa
has gone ta the expense of building a large

SENATE
intake pipe and carrying it out several
hundred feet into the main channel of the
river ta avoid pumping the bad water
coming down along the banks of the river:
in this intake pipe are three different
valves, one near the outer end, one at the
centre, and another close to the shore.
The valve close to the shore is opened when
the water la low, in order to get sufficient
pressure in case of fire". This valve was
opened last fall on several occasions, and
through this valve has caine the polluted
water froin the sewage of Mechanicsville,
and the population along Cave Creek. The
sewage can be traced froin the creek right
ta that valve, and here we have been for
months feeding on the sewage carried into
the river by this creek.

T'aw?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-I cannot say as
ta that. 1 know I ar n ot drinking it. 1
arn not taking any chances. 1 have had a
severe experience in my own home, so I arn
wise. Coming down ta this Ineasure: the
key note of this Bill is that there shaîl be
no pollution of aur water supply.
Hon. Mr. WILSON-How would you prevent the pollution of the saaler streams
which run into navigable waters, and ta
whom would the legisi ation properly
belong-to the Dominion or ta the provinces? If the Dominion undertakes it, bas
the government the power, when water is
pahluted, ta punish the wrong-doers?
Hon. .Mr. BELCOURT-I wvas gaing ta
deal with ail those points. The Bill has
one principle, and one only, that is ta
prevent the pollution of navigable waters.
Ail the rest is merely incidentai, creating
the machinery for the purpose of enforcing
its provisions. My han. friend is worrîed
over the question of jurisdiction. Others
are, and I have been worried myseli on
that point. It is one as ta which many
opinions have been expressed, some by
eminent authorities. I hope I shall be.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

pardoned if I say that I cannot agree with
those who consider the question beyond
aur juriadiction. However great the respect
I entertain for those who express that view,
I cannot think it waa ever intended by the
British 'North America Act that questions
of this kind should be relegated ta the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. WILSON-Whether it was the
intention or not, does it?
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT-I amn coming *o
that. I tried laat year ta deal with the
question of jurisdiction. I istated it ta
establish the thesis that we have jurisdiction in matters of public health, not
merely in navigable waters, but generally; and where, for instance, a province
is doing something which is injurious ta
the health of another province, there la
absolutely no other tribunal but this to
deal with it, and if this parliainent cannot
deal with it there is no remedy. If, for
instance, the people living on the Ontario
side of the Ottawa river were ta commit
a nuisance which would endanger the
health of the people on the ather side, legislation by the Quebec legisiature would not
help it. To put a question of that sort
seems ta me ta show that it must have
been the intent of the frainers of the British
North America Act ta give ta this parliament jurisdiction where a questian of that
kind arase, and I take it, under the
British North America Act which gives
this parliament jurisdiction in matters of
public health generally, and which gives
the variaus provinces power ta deal exclusively with public health, but only with
reference ta certain subjects, that is hospitals, and eleemosynary institutions-lt
shows clearly that the general question of
health lias been left ta the federal parliament. I da not want ta weary the House
with going over the general argument,
whichi for the purpose of my Bill is not
necessary. Hon. gentlemen will see that
the Bill deals only with navigable waters.
I arn nat attempting ta deal with anythîng as ta which we clearly have no
jurisdictio.n. The title of the Bill and the
preamble show that it deals with the pollution of navigable waters only, sa that I
have not attempted in any way ta deal with

FEBRUARY 10, 1911
matters which have been leit ta the provinces. The question cf juriadiction la not
one which bas anything te do with this
Bill, and it is one therefore on which I
shaîl net spend any further time.
Chapter 115 cf the Revised Statutes of
Canada, which provides for the protection
of navigable waters, contained provisions
somewhat similar te this with xeferenoe,
for instance, te the pollution cf navigable
waters by sawdust a.nd other waste. If we
have juriadiction over these waters for
navigation purposes, surely we have jurisdiction te prevent the depositing of sewage. Sewage may affect navigation. However, I shaîl not discues the question cf
juriadiction any more. If we are going
te aplit hairs and allow the comniunity ta
die by hu.ndreds and theusands from preventable diseases such as typhoid fever,
simply because of the question of jurisdiction; if we are te go on as we are now
doing perpetually, the provinces and the
Dominion shirlhng their duty, and allow
the race te go ta the dogs, it is about time
the eominunity should know it and urge
parliament te provide some remedy, either
by changing the British North Axnerica Act,
or taking the law inte our own bands. Are
we goïmng te perpetually drink water polluted by sewageP Are we going te have
other epidemnics in a community like this
hecause of the question of jurisdiction? It
seems te me the thing la prepesterous.
Why question the jurisdiction of parliament? Ras it not been. exercised for ferty
years? Have we net made laws againat
the adulteratien of food and drugsP Ras
flot parliament decreed that ane of the officers of this government can go into my
stable and kill my horse if it bas the
glanders? If that is net interfering with
provincial juriadiction, what is? The
resor parliament bas se done is fer the
protection of the public health, and surely
the reasons for the legielation required by
this Bill are more important than the mere
question cf the life or death ef a horse.
As far as navigable rivera are eoncerned,
there can be no question whatever that
we have the jurisdiction. mat year, some
hon, gentlemen, for whom I have the greatest respect, objected te this Bill on the
ground that it was impracticable-because
it was going to prevent the saal towns

20

and villages from dumping their sewage
into rivers at their doors. That is the
very thing that we waUt to get at and
stop. If the people living along the smal
streams empty their sewage into those
streams 'which flow into the Ottawa river,
what ia the use of protecting the Ottawa
river? You must get at the source of the
pollution wherever you find it. You cannot stop it in one place and allow it to go
on at another. I should like to rend to the
House another portion of Dr. Hodgett's
report. At page 52, hie says:
A study of the map of the watersheds of

important watersheds of the Dominion. The

BETTER DISTRIBUTION 0F LEGISLATIVE WORK BETWEEN THE HOUSE
0F GOMMONS AND SENATE.
MOTION.
Hon. Mr. DAVID moved:
That a message be sent to, the House of
Gommons, requesting that bouse to unite
with the Senate in the formation of a Joint

Committee of both Houses for the purpose of
devising means and reporting thereon for a
more even distribution between the said

bouses, in future, of the legisiative work requiring to be done during the session of parliament; and that the muembers of said Joint
Committee to act on behiaif of the Senate be
composed of the Itight lionourable Sir Richard
Cartwright, G.C.M.G., the Honourable Sir

Mackenzie Bowell, K.C.M.G., and the Hon.

tion requires explanation ; it speaks for
itself. I intended to extend the scope of
the duties of this commlittee, but was
conscious that I ought to keep within the
limita of the motion, as it is worded, and
authorize the committee to consider only
the question of the best mneans to be
adopted in order to have a more equal
distribution of the %vork of the session of
parliament between hoth Houses. MY
object is very simple. 1 want to show that
this bouse is willing to do whiat is f air and
proper in the interests of the country, and
if the Senate is idie during the first weeks
of the session, and if Bis are crowded
on us at the close of the session en bloc,
it la not our fault. If there is not more
legisiative work donc hv the bouse during
the fiast half of the session it is not our
fault. I think Nve owe it to the dignity and
honour of this bouse, in view of the discussion which. has taken place lu the press
of the country, to show that we are willing
to do oui part in the legisiation that comes
before parliament. If a committee is appointed, it cannot but have a good effeet.
It will tend to promote harmony between
the two bouses. 1 am convinced that the

should not overlook the fact that the governiment bas more to do with this question than the House of Gommons. If the
government was favourably disposed towards making this body a factor of influence in the transaction o! public buslness, they 'would easily flnd a solution of
the prosent difflculty. It seema ta me that
through the goverument itself .and through
the flouse o! Gommons nothing is ieft undono to discredit the Senate of Canada-in
fact we have a combination of forces opposed to tbe usefulness and importance of
the Senate, namely, the government, the
flouse o! Gommons and tbe press o! the
country, and unless my hion. friend is
disposed ta present to this Chamber a
solution 'whoreby that difflculty may be

I amn not preparod in any way ta oppose it;
but it would certainly be humiliating, in
my judgmont, that a resolution of this
kind should be passed and a committee of
this Chamber sbould solomnly approach a
committeé of the Gommons and ask for a
division of tbe business before parliament
which, up te the present time, they are
flot at ail disposed to delegato to this
flouse or to divide witb this flouse. On
the otber hand, in avery possible way
they are disposed to discredit it, not only
by resolutions in the Commons, .session
after session, but by sentiments expressed
on the stump and on public piatforms in
the country, and in évery other conceivabie
way. It seems to me it is a much larger
question than the hon, gentleman from
Mille Isles is disposed to consider, and it
is pro-erninently a question for- the government to take up, and ta which they shouid
give their best consideration. This second
Ohamber is intorwoven inta our constitution, and probably for ail urne Canada will

If the Senate has not that influence to ivhich it is entitled, then it
is purely a problem for the government to
solve, and I arn satisfied that flot only this
Chmbrbut the country is prepared. in
fact is anxiously waiting from timie to
time, to know what the goverument is
going to do to place the Senate of Canada
in a position which it bas occupied in the
past, and which it should occupy to-day,
but which is being jeopardized more and
more every session of parliament.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The lion. leader of
the opposition just expressed the views I
hoid on this matter, and 1 amn glad to be
able to endorse what hie said, that the
solution of this question does not lie ini
any joint discussion between the members
of this House and the House'o! Commons.
For reasons. which we can understand,
any member in the House of Gommons
who has private legisiation to bring. before
parliament is flot going to confide it to the
bauds of any member of this honourabie,
flouse; so tbat as far as private legisiation
is concerned, no matter what it may be.
it will not corne voluntarily from the
flouse of Commons to the Senate. That
is a condition we must admit and one we
must accept. Therefore, the only solution
of this question of making the Senate usefuI wbile it sits, instead of saying prayers
and listeniug- to a series of questions and
answers, rests witb the goverument who
must take a hand in the matter. We are
not entitled to any private legisiation at
the hands of the members of the flouse o!'
Gommons, but we are entitied to logislation at the hands o! the governmént. and
the government of the day should see to
it that the Senato should partake in tbe
fuliest measure possible of the business
wbich is before parliament. I flnd on the
Order Paper t-o-day three moasures whicb
originatod in the House of Commons undeir
the sanction or control of the government.
The second order o! the day is an Act ta
prohibit the improper use of opium and
other drugs. That could have been well
introduced into the Senate. and could have
occupied our time when we were doing
nothing. I can quite undorstand that the
government cannot confide to this flouse

the study of questions whicii involve politý

issues are at stake. The minister is responsible and should control the original

tions which do flot involve political or party
issues should flot be submitted by ail the
departmnents to this Chamber. Then Nve
have another order of the day, 'An Act

The
Senate la quite competent to deal with that
question. Lt is* simply a departrnental
matter, and wvhy should we flot have it
introduced in this House se that we could
occupy our tirne with it. Thiere is another
order of the day, ' An Act to amend the

no political question. There max- possibly
be a iittio on the side, but. here we have

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWVRIGHT
-I would caîl the hion. gentlemnan's attention to the fact that the Chinese Act was
introduced into this House.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Then I stand corrected. That is so iuch, but it goes to
prove what I say, that if the government
can introduce one measure it can introduce three or four orý ten. Thie exception
in this case proves the rule, I amn advocating, and 1 can fairly understand why we
do flot hîave ail the~ legisiatioti in the initiative steps %%,len the House of Gommons
is entitled to it. On private grounds, individual members, should iniitiate private
legisiation entrusted to thern, and the governrnent itself should introduce great ineasures withi political effects and political
results reg«arding the political initerests of
the country. On the whole, I think the
solution of the question rests inainly iii
the hands of the governrnent, and I quite
agree with mny hion. friend in saying that
thîs House will receive very littie consideration at the hands of the House of Comnmons in asking for a reînedy.

ia high time that this Chamber should
cease calling attention to itself. I have a
different view entireiy as to the value of
the Sonate frorn a great many people wha
spend their time discussing it. I do not
mean in the House; but I mean outside of
it-perhaps in this House as well. It ii
flot in the nature of things possible for
this House to engage itself for the nriuber
of days or months that the other chamber
does in discussing questions that are before
the country. In s0 far as legisiation i5
concerned, no Bill passes the House of
Comnions that does flot corne under the
consideration of the Senate before it becornes iaw. I have liad a very considerable experience in the lower House, and 1
think have a very fair knowledge es to the
value of the consideration whicli the Bill,
receive in this Chamber and the other, and
I certainly -would flot put this Chamber
second to the Gommons in that respect.
Bis receive far better consideration in
the Senate than they do in the Gommons.
la that not after ail the practical legislation of parliament? If this House were
engaged in discussing want of confidence
motions, incurring prolonged debates with
political tactical objecta, as is the case in
the Commons, and not objects of legisiation at ail, we couid be empioyed in the
sarne way; but as a revising body, which.
it properly is, revising the legisiation which
cornes from the other House, and not engaging in party issues, this Chiamber must,
of course, be engaged for a much shorter
period of tirne. If there is a mistake at ail
it la sitting too many days. It is rny humble opinion perfect nonsense to endeavour
te pretend to the country that because wd
are sitting here we are doing something.
Ail the business w'hich the country offers to
bc done is deait with bx' the Senate, and
wlien this Chainher performs thiat duty well,
it performs its whioie duty; se thiat I think
this great probieni as to the value of this
Chiamber and what it lias to do to keep it
employed, is perfect nonsense. XVe perform
the duties that devolve upon us, and when
we have dene that, we have done our whoie,

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEEI-It seems idie

or narcotics af any kind, that those
who prepare them shall corne within
the pale of the law. The on]y efficient
way to deal with this subject is to
require that the authority of the gavernment shail first be o'btained before these
drugs are placed on -the mnarket, and I arn
very much disa.ppointed that is not the
policy of the government to-day. The law
relating ta this matter cannot be made too
restrictive, and the governmént should
reserve to itself authority ta sanction the

a condition precedent, and embodied in

be placed on the -market without the sanction of the gavernment.

lon. Mr. McHUGH-The Bill linits the
H
sale of these druga to physicians, veterinary
surgeons or dentists, and under certificate
they can seli. I hold that that should in.:iude the druggists in the country. The
ficensed drugiists hav'e to pass just as
rigid an examination as the doctoM -or
veterinary surgeon or dentist. I fully approve of the object the promoters have in
view; but I do flot think it would be very
hurtful to many in the country who are
dealing with domestic animais if this Bill,
as it now stands, became law. These peopie know just as well as a druggist what
remedy they want when an animal gets
sick, and they go to a druggist and asic
for certain medicine. In that medicine
there is very often laudanum, which is an
extract of opium. Perhaps there is not a
veterinary surgeon in the vicinity to whomn
they could apply. and if they were compelled to cali in a veterinary the animal
iight be dead by the time he arrived. I
hope the hon. gentleman will improva the
Bill by adding the word ' druggist' to the
list of those who will be able to seil without
having a written order fromn a veterinary
or doctor. In lumber camps, the horses
get eick, and the men go tn the nearest
drug store and obtain medicine. They take
with themn a supply of this medicine in the
fall o! the year for emergencies of this
kind, but if they have nothing on hand
they go to the nearest drug store. They
may not know where there is a veterinary
surzeon for miles and miles. They go to
the drug store and order the prescription
they want, and it very often contains
laudanum, or cocaine, or something of that
kind. Laudanum is one of the extracts of
opium, and for that reason the druggist
would be prohibited fromn selling it, unless
the druggist is included 'with the physician
and veterinary surzeon and dentist, who
are included in the Bill now.

*Hon. Mtr. BEIQUE-I should hike to
draw the hon. gentleman's attention to
some fMatures of the Bill, so that they mnay
be considered before the measure is taken
up again. There ia no question that part
of the Bill is within the jurisdiction of this
parliament. Take clause 3, which deals with
importations, and sections 5 and 6 deal with
exportations. Those provisions are within
the -province of thîs honourable House,
and section 5 makes it a crime by providing.
that an infraction of the law ia subject to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
year. But there are other provisions o! the
Bill as to which, I think, the point taken
by the hon. gentleman from Halifax is well
taken. For instance, section 4 merely deals
with certain -prescriptions, or certain ingredients, and xnakes it subject only to a
penalty. I doubt very mucli whetber these
matters would come within the jurisdiztion
of this parliament unless the phraseology
ie changed, and that braaches of the law
can be made a crime when they can be
reached. 1 think there is a good deal in
the suggestion made by the hon, leader of
the opposition, and, in fact, the policy to
which he has referred ha obtaining in

CANADIAN GRAIN BILL.
SECOND READING.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
moved the second reading of Bill (Q) An
Act respecting Grain. He said: This Bill
is one of rather unusual importance, and
at the same time it comprises some provisions of a somewhat unusual character.
The subject is one whicli lias been long
and very hotly contasted in the western
provinces. The farmers of that region have
been, for various reasons, under the impression that they have been unfairly
deait with from time to time by the parties
who have acted as middlemen between
them and the ultimate consurners, and
so strong was the feeling on the subject,
that a few yeara ago a royal commission
was appointed at considerabie expense f0
investigate and report upon the wvhoie
matter, and a very long and important Bill
called the Manitoba Grain Act, which is
being re-enacted in'the measure now in
my hands, was passed after a long discussion in both Houses. I may also add
that numerous and very important delegations have waited upon the two Houses,
and on the members of the governiment
on- many occasions, to press their views
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT.

on these questions. Under these circumstances, thec governme>nt, after giving v-ery
fuli consideration to this subject, and
after taking- ail pains in their power to
acquaint themselves with the facts of the
case, h ave thought it expedient to iay
before you certain proposais by which they
hope that the inatters in dispute niay be
better regulated, and that the very high
standard which the northwest grain has
attaîned in the markets of the world may
be maintained. I need hardly point out to
the House that that is an object of very
great importance indeed, in every possible
shape and way. Without committing myself to an v definite statement as to the
anîournt of loss whichi may have been suetained by our western farmers in the maniner charged, I think there is no doubt
%vhateverthat they have suffered considerabiv by reason of the manipulation to
whicli their grain has been subjected in
the terminal elevators, and. perhaps elsewhere; and it appeara to]erably clear that
the devices that I have mentioned have
had the effeet of more or less reducing- the
price which they wouid otherwise have obtained for the auperior qualities of their
grain. Nobody will dispute the desirability
not mereiy of preserving the standara of
our grain, but of aasuring the farmers that
thev wiii obtain the highest possible price
for what they produce. I need not point
out tt, the House that the very great prosperity which lias attended Canada for the
iast few years bas been to an enormous
degree due to the development of the northwest, and that nothing can conduce more
f0 the prosperity, not merely of the western provinces but of the reat of Canada,
than to do anything in our power to cause
the farmers of that region to be prosperous

Northern, nevertheless the practice of
mix;ng inferior with superior grain mnust
tend ultimately to deteriorate the general
quality, and when it cornes to such an
amount as 1 have just stated, there can
be very little doubt indeed that the general result in the miarkets of the 'world
was to degrade the apparent quality of
the Manitoba grain several degrees below
the point which it onght preperly to have
reached. The ýallegation is, 'that this inferior grain when sold, as it usually was,
in Liverpool ýr elsewhere, the price given
for it reflected, se to speak, on the price
paid hy the purchaser in Manitoba, Saskatchewan or elsewhere, to the manifest injury of the farniing community. Under
these circumastances, as I have observed,
the governrnent felt it thieir duty to look
into this matter with considerable care, and
they' have corne to the conclusions cmbodied in this measure without absolutely
and positively binding themselves to the
ipsissirna verba of the Bill. 0f course,
there may prove, on exarnînation by either
Flouse, to be some point on which a quéestion mnav be raised, and perhaps somne
modification rnay be introduced; neverthceless a case lias been made out calling- for

He said I have placed this motion on
the Order Paper owing to the tact that the
attention of the public has been directed,
through the press, to a certain statement of
facts, and that statement is signed by a
mnember et this House. It would appear
that the 78th regirnent, which practicaily
represented ivithin its raiiks the counties
of Colchester, Hants and Pictou, wa3
divided into two regiments. The commanding efficer of the 78th regiment was detailed
to the command of the 78th. The senior
officer o! the 78th was Major Barnhili, and
according to ail precedent and according te
justice which should have been meted out
in the case, should have received the comnmnand o! the 76th reginient, being a man
well qualified for the position. He had
served eeveral years in the 78th regiment,
and attached hîmself to the separated portion of it which represented -Colchester and
Hants. Be beld a certificate as -a field
officer, snd a certificate in equitation, and
h*ad ail the qualifications necessary to
assume the command of the new regiment.
The dlaims ci ýMajor Barnhill were abselutely overlooked. No reason was given
for the failure to appoint him te the ceinmand of the new regiment ; but a civilian,
who, I understand, had neyer been identified or associated with a military organizatien, and who had no knowledge of miiitary science, and no dlaim whatever to
receive a position o! such distinction, was
appcinted to the commrand of the new regiment. Almost twelve rnonths have elapsed
since bis appointinent to that commnand,
and I arn told that he lias net attempted
to assume anything like the responsibility
which attaches to the office. He .bas
assumed a certain amount of responsibility
in appointing officers to companies o! the
regiment, gentlemen who, I understand,
have no more knowledge o! military affaira.
and no more qualifications to discharge the
duties of a commission than he himself possesses. The question naturally arises, why
should a mn who had neyer be-en identi
fied with a mulitary organization have been
appointed over the hesd o! one possessing
every qualification, and respecting 'whom
every sense of justice should have induced
the governinent to place hum in command

for the special information ai my hon.
friend opposite, I may say that to iny
certain knowledge a very large proportion
indeed of the superior officers in the militia, iii the province of Ontario, at any
rate, are as rank Tories as even he himself
could desire. How it may be in other provinces I will not undertake ta say, but it
has been made a matter, to my certain
knowledge, of constant complaint against
the hion. Minister of Militia that xxobody

if my hion. friend will *cast a critical eyà

will see that Conservatives are very much
better represented than Liberals.

in liants, was, at the time of the reorganization, and stili is, a barrister living and
practising in Halifax city. Il he had any
dlaim at al], it was on the 78th regiment.
The gentlemen who have taken up the
organization of the new regiment (76th)
were unanimous in asking the department
to place at the head o! that regîment a
very prominent gentleman of Truro, Mr.
Martin Dickîe, who was, in (lue course,
seen by General Drury, O.C., maritime
provinces, Halifax, by whom aill-necessary
arrangements for the organization o! the
regiment were carried on. Both regirnents,
the 76th and the 78th, were fully organized
and t.ook part in the camp at Aldershot in
September last, where they gave an excellent account o! themnselves.. I have n,)
objection to the motion of my hon. friend;
but I would like to add some other correspondence in relation to the matter, which,
I presumne, he will have no objection to
being added. With the addition of this
further correspondence the motion can pass,
and when we get the full papers and my
bon. friend has examined and digested
them, if he wishes to renew the matter, I
shall be happy to indulge him, and I will
then be in fulil possession o! certain facts
as to the relative proportion o! Conserva;tives and Liberals in high command in the
militia force. I think he wrill find that the
claims of Conservatives in high command
have not been overlookzéd by the Militia
Department.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The militia o! Canada some few years ago used to cost the
country about a million and a quarter or a
million and a half dollars. oehat -%as before the Liberal party came into power.
As a member o! that party I find, and Ii
think the party as a whole found that that
amount was an extravagance. According
to the leader of the opposition, that amounit
has increased to seven millions. I think it
is much more, and I remember the statement of the righit hon. leader of this House
some years ago, made on the floor of this
House, that it was time to cali a haît in
the expenditure for the Militia Department.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT

1 then agreed wlth hlm, and I stili agrce
The expenditure is not only
with him.
seven million now, but is goîng up
to ten millions, and if the memibers o! this
House and the members of the Hou 3e o!
Commons would take into consideration the
vast amounts spent in connection with the
niilitia and naval service, they will find
that to-day one-fifth of the revenue, or
some twenty-two and a ball millions is
devoted to the militia and naval purposes.
As an old time Liberal, I think it is time
a haît should be called and called definitely. We are spending too much money
on brass buttons and gold braid. I quite
agree with the rigbt hon. leader of the
House when he speaks of the Tories having
had almost supreme control of the militia
in past years. I know -vlen ive had to
make the fight for the Liberai party through-'
out the country what the influence o! the
militia was, when scarcely a Lîberal
througbout the Dominion was in any position of command, and the right hon, leader
of this House raîsed an echo lu my heart
which I re-echo back and tell hlm he is
right, that in the Militia o! Canada
we Liberals bad very littie chance to secure any position o! command in the days
from 1878 to 1896. That is perfectly true.
I do not know that the Lîberal party bas
followed on the same lines as the Tory
party in regard to nomination. I arn afraid
they have not. If there is any element of
sncbbery coming into this country ît is
through the militia and I am afraid it is
also being introduced throughi the naval dev2lopment snd naval policy. What happened lu the past is being repeated on a lesser
scale to-day, and we must be on our guard
to see that the money o! the country is not
spent to an extraordinary amount on the
militia and naval objecta. That is the
stand I take as a Liberal working for the
wel!are of the country through Liheral administration, and I know I have the heart
of the people wîtb me, I know I voice
their feelings and sentiments 'as well as the
feelings o! the workingman, that the party
would do much better to curtail expenses.
This matter has brought to the attention
of the country a condition of things which
must not be allowed to enlarge itself, and
that it is the duty of the -Liberal party

FEBRUARY 22, 1911
to iinimize the growth of mnilitarism, and
prevent unnecessary expenditure. 1 arn
iiot afraid to advocate such a policy before
hon, gentlemen, soma of whom are no longer
in touch with the people. Many of us have
lost our usefuiness, but I arn still ini the
ranks, I arn stili in the breacli, and I arn
one of those that has to defend Liberal
principles and give reasons therefor. That
is the reason I talk so sincerely, and, if
you wvill, so heatedly; but in that heat there
is sense and §entiment and judgment. .I
hope the Liberal party will remain in
power, because et no tirne has this country
prospered so much as it bas under the
banner of Liberalism. It-has given to the
country peace, harrnony and prosperity.
and to-day our foes are asking for a new
deelaration of loyalty to the British Empire. Who are they? Thie Bordens, the
Fosters and others, asking the Liberal
party for a reaffirmation of its loyalty to
the British Ernpire--we who, during the
past 16 years, have given better, stronger
*and more solid proof of our loyalty, not
lip loyalty, but generous loyalty, abundant
loyalty to the British Empire than they
have, when, by our tariff we gave a preference to the British manufacturers. In the
old days of 1878, the Tory party who carried
the standard of loyalty said: *If protection is going to be a ourse to the British
manufacturer, if it is going to be an impediment to the British trade, so rnuch the
worse for the British manufacturer.' That
wvas the cry of the Tory party under Bit
Johin A. Macdonald. But since 1895, the
present government have given to the British Empire more solid proof of our loyalty,
and if the British Empire is broad and
deep as it is to-day. I say thanks to the
statesmen at the head of the governmentthanks to Sir Wilfrid, who is the one man

a real consolidation of the empire. Yet
to-day the Bourassa's and Foster's and
others ask for a new official declaration of
loyalty. If I had any voice in the counsels
of this government, I would say: 'RBend
not the knee to these men who through
these motions ask such thinga as this.'
We have not to prove our loyalty because
Mr. Champ Clark, or anybody else says
that behind the reciprocity treaty there is

loyalty to prove itself. The Senate is n0

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I
would like to oeil the attention o! the
Senate to the f act that the principal points
made by my hion. friend on my left was
not touched upon by the explanation given by the Minister of Milîtia. If I understand the motion before the Senate, or
rather the complaint made, it is that instead of appointing a qualified gentleman
to the position o! commander o! the regiment, a gentleman was selected who bas
no knowledge whatever of military Matters, who bas neyer ettended any military
sohool, 'who bas neyer belonged to the
force end bas flot acquired that informatioil which can only be gethered by study
and practice, and constant drill. That is
the complaint made by my hon. friend
who wrote the letter, and also by the hon.
gentleman wvho moved the resolution. It
must be apparent to every one who listened to that explanation that hie studiously avoided giving any explanation whatever as to the reasons wbich induced the

badinage, and it would be very pleasaut
te listen to him, as to the course hie pursued in the past, as well as the course I
pursued thirty or forty years age. But that
bas nothing to do 'with the question at
issue at the present moment. Whén the
right hion. gentleman referred to opinions
held by the leader of the opposition in the
Gommnons, and gratuitously made the remark that when he was in bis sounder

departed fromn that it was tantamount to

it would be just as poteut, were it flot that

succeeded in accomplishing, that he was
worthy of the position. I should no)t have
spoken of this matter had not my hon.

1 have no regrets to express for the course
that I pursued.
Now in reference te tihe Canadian militia,
the right hon. leader of the House mnade a
very sweeping charge, that under the Conservative goverrnent, Gonservatives occupied not only the most prominent positions on the militia force, but that scarcely
I

frankly admit that in the original organization of the force, from the time the Militia
Act was .placed on the statute-book by the
late Sir George Cartier, the vast rnajority of
the militia, so f ar as Ontario is concerned,
were Conservatives. When the force was
recorganized in'the locality froin which 1
corne, there was scarcely a Liberal iu Belleville that would volunteer at ail, and when
we put u our reginientals and walked
through the streets, we were the laughing
stock of the Liberal party. As time wore
on, however, and particular events took
plac e in the United States, especially the
Fenian raids, the Liberals rushed to the
front in every capacity. After those events,
the question of politics in the militia
neyer was heard of again. I had the honour and trouble and vexation of being Minister of Militia for about a year and a
quarter, and I know the pressure that is
brought to bear on a minister to do that
which, if hie has any stamina, hie will resist
at once. In Nova Scotia, certain things
were urged çn nme at that time. 'I was

H1e said:

In moving concurrence inmthis report, I
would like, if the House would permit me,
to make a few remarks on the subject of
divorce. I think hon. gentlemen xvill admit
that I do not often trespass at any great
length upon the patience -of the House, a.nd
I hope not to be too protract-ed to-day. But I
do nlot expect to hold your attention continuously, for one could hardly make a
speech on divorce that wvould be either
arnusing or entertaining; se I shall not consider my feelings oiitraged if I see any of
rny auditors aettling themselves down to a
comfortable anooze. All I a.sk is that they
do not enore. A sncre is so disconcerting.
As Harniet aaid te his father's ghost: ' Take
any shape but that, and my firm nerves
shall neyer tremble.'
And se, with the permission of the leaders of the House, I will proceed. I say
leaders, for, o! course, we ail know that
we have two. One able, urbane, courteous,
gent-lemanly, ever re-ady to try and uphold
the traditions -and dignity of the House,
But the other is really the one who rans
the House, se to speak-who dictates our
movements, and regulates when we ahail
be allowed te proceed. H1e reminds me
very much o! a picture in ' Punch.' A taîl
and pompons English bishop is Iecturing
a trembling page boy, about sorne trivial
offence, and shaking bis finger at him say.
ing: ' Wretched boy, wvho is it that sees

missus, my lord,' sobbed the boy. In this

member for Victoria division (Hon. M-r.

SENATE

There is fot much information to be
had regarding the early immorality of
Prince Edward Island, as there are no etatistics wherefrom euch could be derived.
But they must have bean and stili are
pretty good down there, for it is stated by
the Provincial Secretary's Office that there
je no record of any divorce ever having
been granted.
The earliest record to be found. oi divorce
proceedings in New Brunswick, seems to
point to a court having been conetituted
as early as 1787, for section 11, of 31 George
3. chap. 5, is as follows: 'And be it further enacted that an Act made and passed
in the 27th year of Hie Majesty's Reign.
entitled An Act for regulating Marriage
and Divorce and for preventing and punishing adultry and fornication, be hereby
repealed and declared Wo be utterly nuli
and void.'
To show the dîfficulty that meets one in
trs.cing up these records it may be mentioned that although the Bill on which the
Act of 1787 was founded was introduced in
the legielative assembly, paseed by the
legisiative counicil and aesented to by the
Governor General, as is shown. by the
journals cf the two Houses ; this Act is not
contained in, nor qeven alluded Woas being
repealed, in the volume entitled * Revieed
Statuies 1786 to 1836,' which was published
In 18M8. However, in 1791, an Act under the
saine caption was passed constituting a
court composed cf the Governor and His
Majesty's Council, which has donc duty to
this date.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Thc lion. gentlemnan's
information muet be correct, because thiey
have a court and judge in New Brunswick,
the saine as Nova Scotia.
Hon.
Mr. KIRCHHOFFER-That
is
exactly so.
We now havie to take a trip across the
continent. to the Pacifie coast, where we
find that the civil and criminal laws of England were established in the old province
of British Columbia (the mainland, whieh
ws a separate colony froin Vancouver
Island) by proclamation having the force
o! law, by the jovernor of the colony, on
l9th November, 1858. The Superior Court of
British Columbia was established by sîmilar

proclamation 8th June, 1859. By the linperial Act 29-30 Vic., chap. 67, the two
colonies were united into one under the
name cf British Columbia froin 17th November, 1866, by proclamation of the governor dated the saie day.
By the English Law Ordinance, 1867, the
proclamation of November,19, 1858, wae repealed, and iA was enacted that 'froin and
aiter the passing of thie ordinance the civil
and criminal laws ci England ae the saie
existed on the l9th day of Novemiber, 1858,
and so far as the samne are not from local
circuinstances inapplicable, are and shaîl
be in force in ahl parts cf the colony of
British Columbia. In 1877 this gave rise
to a long and interesting controversy as
to whether the English divorce le.w was
thereby imported. The question was flot
settled until 1908, when the Judicial C'ornmittee of the Privy Council, in the case of
Watts and the Attorney General of British
Columbia v. Watts <A.C. 1908, 573), held
that the effeet was to introduce the 'Divorce
and Matrimonial Çaue Act, 1857,' whichi
came into force in England on January 11,
1858, and the amending Act which came
into -force in Eugland on August 2, 1858,
and to give the Supreme Court of British
Columbia ' juriediction te entertain a petition for divorce between pereons domiciled
in that colony and in respect of matrimonial offences alleged to have been coinmitted therein.'
The resuît of the existence cf those provicial divorce courts is that in the Dominion of Canada, as at present constituted,
applications to Parliament for Acts of
Divorce are only muade lu cases arising in
the provinces o! Ontario, Quebec, 'Manitoba, 6askatchewan, Alberta, and in the
Northwest Territories. 1 know that statistics are dry matters, but I will ask you to
bear with me for a few minutes while 1
tell you the number of divorces that have
been granted by Parliament, compared with
those in the provinces that have divorce
courts.

I èouId get complete returns. It covers
froin 1897 te 1906, inclusive, and is chosen
for comparison because the statistics for

there were granted during the same period

of the population, while by Parliament

We neyer hear any outcry from moral
reformera about the divorces granted by

are being directed against thosc granted

rare occasion when a member of the committee has spoken against the report which
the majarity of themn have passed. 1 think
it has only occurred on one or two occaàions. 0f course we know-there is no
ase denying it-the Roman Oatholic church
is against divorce; they have their opinion
in regard to that and they stick to it, andi
when a divorce Bill is opposed, as
we have seen occasionally here, the
Roman Catholic inembers being joined
by the high church members 'who entertain similar opinions on the subject, we
have had 8trenuous fights -for
our
divorce cases; but, of course, the committee has no personal feeling in the matter.
They are merely there to administer justice according to their lights, and in obedience with the statute under which they
are acting. But it has always seemed ta
me to be a rather curious thing that there
should be a law in this land which entitled
a person to relief, and he cannot get that
relief because certain people have religions
convictions against it. .However I cannot
abject ta that. As a rule they enter
their protest by having it recorded as
'passed on division.'
There is no objection to that. When these members figaht
in that way we cen have no objection. Probably some members do flot recollect the fact that an one occasion there

The consideration of this report is now

on this report will have te be rendered in
the dark as far as several of us are concerned. This thing of rushing divorce
Bills through vithout the members of the
House having the evidence in their hands
is not to be tolerated. It looks like smuggling legislation through parliament. Why
was the evidenoe ini this particular case
hidden fromn us until the very last moment when judgrnent vas to be rendered

of this House why that evidence was kept

are charges of drunkenness and flon-support. If the committee had the power
jointly with parliament to grant divorces
on such grounds, a case is made out; but
our system prevents us taking action along
such lines, and we have no right to do so.
Any senator wbo votes to grant divorce
on the grounds stated here is violating his
oath of office. We bave establishied courts
to deal with these matters of abandonnment
and drunkenness on the part cf married
people, but parlianient bas no rigbt whatever to grant a divorce on sucb grounds.

widow for 26 long years. She lived -with

at the end of tbe first year. Be used to get
drunk then, but sbe lived witb him, and,
finally, by Inutual agreement, they separated, bis fatber taking charge of lier and
the child for a time. Tben for two years
she wvent to live witb bier sister, and the
question was put to lier :'«Did your busband ever eall on you to see, you? ' And
she answered :'No, hie did not.' I tbinl1ý
it was the lawyer for the respondent asked
why hie did flot cati, and she answered
'My sister, at whose bouse I was living,
would flot let him in,' and that is wbat the
committee cails abandonmient. He might
cali as often as be wisbed, but he bad no
riglit to -enter the bouse. Tbey bave tried
to leave the impression that this man was
in a state of perpetual drunkenness. I arn

witb the question of whetber the petitioner
in this case had miade any proof against
the respondent, and I was endeavouring to
point out that she bad made no proof
wbatever. Tbs bon. rnember from York
(Hon. .Mr. Campbell) put a very pointe-d
question to me, wbicb I was flot in a position at the moment to answer. The question was: 'Did the 'wife prove adultery on
"lie part of ber husband?' and my answer
wvas. ' Absolutely nonS from the wife, with
the exception of one question to which sbe

attorney. She had netbing to allege

and abandonment. Drunkenness, I -admit.
wvas proved, but not to the extent the cornrnittee would lead us to believe; but I contest the rigbt of the committee to submit to
parliament that the respondent had abandon3d bis wife voluntarily and against the
law. The wife berseif says: ' We separated
according to agreement alter two years of
married life.' Then the attorney for tbe
petitioner, not finding evidence to justify
a parliamentary separation, because it is
not judicial or legal in tbe ordinary sense
of the terni, put this improper and illegal
question: ' Have you condoned any o! these
offencss, adultery or otherwise?' That,'.i
any court, would have been ruled out peremptorily. That was putting a question
which bad no foundation in evidence up
to that time. Sbe biad coî,doined bis offence of abandonment and drunkenness for
26 years. 0f adultery sbe bad absolutely
no knowledge, and the lawyer, unfairly put
that question, and she said simply: ' No.
I bave iiot condoned theni.' The Divorce
Cormittee admitted that question and a]lowed it to go int-o the evidence.

Hon. Mr. POWER-Does not the bon.

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-The question is put

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I say no harin

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-No liarm legally, but
a lot of liarm from a public point of view.
It ie an admission of indirect meane. It
was an improper question to put, and
ehould neyer have been tolerated, At sliould
have been ruled out as soon as put. The
only question the lawyer sliould have put
was wlietlier she condoned the drunkennes
and abandonmient. 1 say she has done
both. She condoned the abandonment b'.
the fact of having entered into an agreement with lier husband to separate; therefore there was no abandoumient. The crime
of drunkennese is a common one. Surely
parliament ie not going to grant divorce
for drunkenness? Parliament lias no right
to deal with the question on that issue.
The issue at stake ie one of adultery.
Therefore, I charge the committee with admitting evidence that was abeolutely illegal
and unjust to the respondent. I stand by
my charge, and I know it cannot be refuted. Next the committee produced before
it a private detective of the Thiel Agency.
That detective had been sent from Toronto
to Peterborough on a special mission. He
wvas sent there at tlie demand of tlie petitioner to ferret out evidence-to secure evidence of Stapleton's adulterous relations

263

with other women which would justify the
committee in granting a divorce. 1 do not
happen to know the said detective, but I
should like to meet him, because in the
aecomplishment of his duty, and in thtf
giving o! his evidence, lie lias proved himself to be an honest man, mucli more honest, and I regret exceedingly to have tu
say it, than the committee thought he oughit
to be. That detective went to Peterboroughi
with the special direction, and for special
purpose of ascertaining whether the respondent, Stapleton, was living in open

a eeeker for the hand of the petitioner or
not, wliether the liUlte fortune she camne in
for was enough to temp.t hini to corne here
and give his evidence; but I know, in
reading the firat -part of bis evidence, that
this old man, rejected by society, was put

not be true, beeause if the proprietor knew
it lie would not allow sncb a state of thinge

rendezvous for the evil wornen of the town.

the evidence on wbich we are nsked to

if they are prepared to reverse ail the obligations which are incumbent upon us as the
safeguard of rnorality whicli the learned
chairman of the committae seemed to sneer
at this afternoon 'when he described us as
the self-constituted champions of morality
-that there were no protests from thé
moral reformers of this country against the
way divorces are granted by parliarnent.
If tlie House is prepared to reverse the
methods of investigation'and weigbing evidence, then I will be in a rninority. If the
hon. membars o! the House are prepared
to cast aside its obligations to family life
towards tlie recognition of Christian doc.
trine in this country, I should like to know
it. The chairman of the cornmittee to-night
said there were only two churches who

were opposed to divorce-tha Roman
Catholie Churcli and the High Cliurch of
England. Arn 1 justified in asking him
the question if their opinion is flot worth
considering? Why force tbem to do*'what in
their conscience they cannot do? I want
to tell the hon, gentleman here And now
that the Catholic Church and the High
Church of England believe in the principle
laid down by Christ, that whoma God lias
joined together no rnan can put asunder,
are not a nority in this country. But,
unfortunately, ini courts of justice. as well
as in parliarnent, thase issues are put

in line with the dignity of this House to
tell hon. members that tbey could sleep
througli a debate, and afterwards wake up
and cast a vote, so long as tbey did not
snore. That was one of bis touches of
humour. To rny mind it was tragic enougb
in view of the fact that rnany of us are
unable to spend three or four hoiqrs witliout taking a rest o! sorne kind; but that
is flot rny funeral. That is the funeral of
more exparienced and venerable members
o! tliis House. And then the hon. chairman of the cornrittee was wittv at the
expense of my farnily. My family, even
if thev lived in a cabin under the shadow

because my ancestors have found in one o!
their descendants a man able to rebuke aud
cast back at him the slur hie cast upon
them. We are Hibernians it is true-Hibernians who brook ne insuit either from one
at home or anybody abroad. 1 arn net a St.
Paul as the hon, gentleman depicted me,
but a folloer o! St. Paul, yes, and it is
bt. Paul's doctrine tfhat I amn trying to
inculcate here as a self constituted chamipion. The hon. chairman of the Divorce
(Jommittee made many references te things
offered for the consideration o! the divorce
of eue Lorne Forbes Robertson. He
brought us through a mire o! statistics,
and a regular labyrinth o! them with eut a.uy
practical result. He alluded to speeches
or remarks that I may have made in the
past in conjunction withi other honourab]e
senators, in trying te stem this ever increasiug flow of the tide o! divorce. He made
his iitmost endeavour to cast ridicule upon
these statements. The statements will remain, and his ridicule will be lest in oblivion. I can tolerate ridicule o! that kind
when I know that I amn exercisiug a sacred
duty towards mysel!, my family and my
country, and the hon. chairman o! the
ceMnmittee need not think that At is against
hlim pers.onally or against his committee
that I take the stand that I do. I tale
that stand in ceujunction with the most
moral, elevated and intellectual minds o!
christeudom against this evil o! divorce,
and I amn proud te know that many o! my
colleagues hold the saine views. But o!
what avail is this learned disquisition on
divorce? To what acceunit will it turn?
The committee will bring in reports o!
this kind and expect parliament te pass
them, because they have brought them i
in the past, anld we have had the solerni
declaration o! the chairman of cornmittee,
tnat the committee 'went on strike soute
years ago because parliament declined te
accept their report in a certain divorce
case. I ask titis honourable House if that
is flot a nice declaration to make, that the
cemmittee wvent ou strike and. would not

parliament, in its judgment,
Mon. Mr. CLORAN.

declined to accept the conclusions of that
cornrittee, and it was one of his strong
arguments in faveur o! the position which
hie has taken to-day. 1 hope parliarnent,
in the future, wilI be equally rnoved to
reject reports from the Divorce Cornmittee
such as the one now under consideration,
and if the Divorce Committee go on strike
again, that they will be barred out for
good for their utter disregard of what is
due to parliament. Why should a committee exact from parliament, a decisionc
along the lines o! th-eir finding? That is
a doctrine to my mind subversive cf parliamentary right and parliamentary privil.
ege. He might as well tell us that once the
cornrittee has given a decision in a certain
case, that it must be endorsed. We have
reports front that committee, and we neyer
know 'whether of the seven, eight or fine
members wvho sit on that cornmittee,
whether four have been in favour of th*>
divorce and five against it or vice versa.
I have on one or two occasions been a
sulent spectator of the proceedings of that
committee. I must say that there were
neither nine, nor seven, nor four cf the
members o! the committee present, and
why should a judgment even of a majority
of that committee compete with a judgment o! parliament? And why should they
go on strike and refuse to hear more cases,
if parliament would not yield to their view?
1 hope that position will flot he taken by
this committee or any comrnittee. I thought
it was a very weak argument to place before parliament. The hon, gentleman mentioned the Hadley divorce case as the oee
at issue for the purposes o! his argument.
1 amn not responsible for anything that was
done in that case. 1 leave that to the hon.
gentleman from Portage la Prairie. 1 ain
xîot prepared to discuss the nierits of that
case nor the Barthelmes case. These are
issues iu which 1 had no band; but I want
tne hon. chairmani and the cemmittee to
understand that wlicn a very serious case
is proved before the committee, and the
evidence is sutticient te justify members
who believe in the right o! people te separate, that I will be no constant obstacle;
but where a petitioner has made out ne
case then I shall consider it my duty to

hold good that when divorce is granted by
parliament, that the privileges in that
separation should only go ta the innocent
party, and that the guilty party, whether
man or woman, should nlot be given, privileges which. are accorded to the innocent
Party.
Hon. Mr. WILSON-I think the hon.
gentleman is out of order. Re is supposed
ta discuss the acceptance or rejection. ai
this present Bill. He says the man in
this case should not be granted a divorce.
If so, what right has he to declare that if
the divorce be granted, the guilty party
should not again marry? That has nothing
te do with the issue.
Hon. Mr. SPEAKER-I think the question unier discussion may well be confined to what is before the House, on the

ed, certainly give him no privileges. The
hon. senator from, Elgin feelsHon. Mr. WILSON-I have no objection
ta the hon. gentleman feeling for himseli.
but I do not want him ta feel for me.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I would have a
tough proposition if I did that, 1 arn not
interested in the Stapleton case, but I have
endeavoured, frorn a legal and judicial
point of view, to point out that the evidonce is quite insufficient to warrant any
affirmative action on the part ai this
Hanse. Many hon. members have made
up their mînds not to consider the hîgher
elements of the case, but I arn not gaing
to enter into that. Ail they wvant is that
the man went there witb this woman, or
that the woman went there with that man
and'the divorce must be granted. That is
evidently the inspiring motive. As soon
as that is proved, the divorce munst be
granted. We have listened ta many able
discourses on this question. I say that
we should put every legal and judicial
obstacle in the way ai granting these
divorces. Where tbey are sufflciently prov-

ed accarding ta the needs of aur constitution, then I have nothing ta say except
that I amn prepared, and always will be,
to refuse ta the guilty party in a divorce
case the same rights as are given ta the
innocent. There are three great evils
which. confront us, and which we corne in
conflîct with every day in the year, and
we have this.question ai divorce, the question ai race suicide, another evil, snd probably some day a measure may be necessary ta prevent that evil. But sufficient
for the day is the evil thereof, and I move,
seconded by the hon, gentleman fram Stadacona (Mr. Landry) that this repart be
considered this day six months.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK-I do not think the
remarks of the hon. gentleman who has
juat est down should be allowed ta go unquestioned. He bas taken great exception
ta the iact that the counsel for petitioner
put ta the petitianer the usual questions
which the committee were bound ta ask
under the rules ai the Senate in every
divorce case. The hon. gentleman lias
made such a stndy ai our divorce proceedings that he must knaw that in ail the
evidence brought before this Hanse, these
questions are always asked the petitianer,
and he takes particular cases and refera ta
those questions and tries tamake out that
something very shocking and wrang bas
been donc in asking the petitioner ta ans,%ver them, which under rule 145 ai the
standing orders we are bound ta do. The
rule states:
Connivance at, or condonation of the adul.
tery, or collusion in the praceedings for
divorce, is always a sufficient ground for rejecting a Bi of divorce, aud shail be inquired
into by the committee.
Then the hou. gentleman refera ta the
statement made by a member ai the firm
of solicitors who went down ta Peterborough
and saw the respoudeut in this case, and
in the course ai bis interview with the respondent he stated that he was quite satisfied ta supply sufficient evidence for this
divorce if the petitioner was prepared ta
pay him mouey. The hon. gentleman
seerna ta think that that is quite a proper
thing- ta do, and apparently, if I understood hlm right, he bas put bimself on
record as being in favour ai collusion. -

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-I think the Senate
Debates will show that what 1 have said
is very nearly correct.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Very nearly. but not
quite.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK-The general evidence went to show that the respondent was
a mani of had character, and in the very
first evidence that was given by the petitioner, his own father took her and the
child int-o the house, and practically told
her she had better flot have anything more
to do with his son, and the woman left her
husband.
Hon. Mr. OLORAN-Under agreement.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK-He did flot wa.nt to
say -any more to lier. It w&-~ proved that
during the two years she was living with
him, he was drinking heavily, and that he
neyer ahowed any aignis of reforming. He
made no attempt at supporting his wife
and child, and the woman naturally had
to make other provisions for support. The
evidence of Mr,. Hamilton,' dealer in oi],
went to show that he kept Mis horse and
buggy at the Iivery barni where thit maxn
Stapleton was the hostier, and that on account of the carryings on around that barn,
he took his horse and buggy from there,
and the evidence of the detective showed
that the general character of this man
around the town, was that of a reprobate,
and not the ki.nd of mnan that I think any
woman should be forced to be tied up to.
I therefore, think the committee wvas perfectly right in finding as it did in this case,
and 1 hope the hion. members will support
the finding. As a member of the committee,
I would Jike to &ay that this whoIe business is a most, objectionable duty for
anybody to have to do with, and I think
ail the members of the committee feel it to
be one with which they would very much
rather have nothing to do. The amount of
work this session has been great, the
duties arduous and tiresome, and we have
ahead of us a great deal o! work, and it
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

looks as if it would be carried on up to the
close of the session, when there is a great
deal of other business that the members o!
the committee would very much prefer to
be attending to rather than be listening to
a lot of evidence with feelings o! horror
and objection that such a thing should go
on. An hon, gentleman of this House has
spoken as if the decisions of the committee
were arrived at, when only two or thrce
members were present. The arrangenenit
was made at the beginning of the session,
in order to facilitate the business, that
three members of the committee should be
allowed to hear the evidence and that alterwards, when a sufficient number of the,
committee had had time to consider the
evidence, the decision should be given, but
in no case is a decision arrived at unless
the full quorum is present, which is five.
In as mucli as the full number o! the committee la rnne, the quorum is always five.
Therefore, the hon, gentleman waa not
right in his statements when he said that
the decisions were given when a amaller
number than fixe were present. T..-o bon.
gentleman has spent a great deal uf time
anxd has spent a great deal'o! eloquence and
energy in talking about divorce; but if he
would try and use that eloquence and
energy in having an amendment made to
the British North America Act, by which
divorce would bie taken out of th(i hands
o! the Senate, I think ail the members of
the committee would feel very mnuch indebted to hlm, and that probably he would
be doing better 'work than he does tzadkinJ
about it in this way. I trust the H )u.e
will support the coinmittee.

Q. When yen went there in the merning,
you found the women there P-A. Yes, and I
told the pr*oprietor 1 would flot keep my

because there was a pretty bad character
there.
Then as to the character of the wom.an:
Q.One that you new to be a noted character, and another one of whom you knew nothing P-A. I cannot say I knew nothing; lier
character was lightly looked upon. She was

Q. What did they do ?-A. I came in the

bedroom was off the office, and she went eut

1 accused him of it and said, ' This must

Q. That is the only occasion on which you

office P-A. She went out every time, she would
slide as soon as any one came.
Q. Was she in the office every tirne -A. I
saw her in the office two or three times.
In face of that evidence, how can the
hon. gentleman from Victoria division deliberately attack the capacity of this committee te weigh evidence of this nature,
and say deliberately: ' there is no evi1 woud net like for a moment

te think my hon. friend would deliberately
make that- statement, but I say he approaches these cases with such a degree of
prejudice as te dîvest him of the proper
exercise ef the necessary judgment to weigh
evidence. Here is the evidence of three
parties, and the admission of the man himself. If this Senate requires more than
that, the committee certainly would be un-

CASE.

Han. Mr. CLORAN-With regard to this
report, I have practically the same objection to its adoption as I took to that in
the case which has just been decided. In
the former case, notwithstanding what was
said, I have nothing to withdraw and no
reason to change any of the statements I
made. I hope in this case when the hon.
leader is giving his advice as to hlow evidence ought to be weighed, he will weigh
it fully and impartially. It requires a
certain amount of capacity ta weigh evidence. I think. I arn a good weigher, and,
therefore, I have capacity for it. The
question of endeavouring to get evidence
tram witnesses bas also been discussed in
this House, and I might inform the hon.
gentleman who raised the question, that
he is altogether astray as to the obligation
of the committee to put questions to a petitioner whether he or she has condoned
the offence for which divorce is sought.
The hon. gentleman who made the proposition, no doubt dîd so in good faith,
but in absolute ignorance of the method
of legal procedure. No attorney or persanl
has a right to put a suggestive question
to a witness. That is the foundation of
Britishi justice. When evidence is not
given on a certain point, nobody has. a
right to put a question of that kind. I
admit that the laws exact frorn the judicial
bench the duty of putting a question to
the petitioner if he or she condoned the
offence if the offence had heen proved,
but there is no question of that kind here.
I hope that that will be borne in mind,
and that in the discussion o! these matters we shall confine ourselves te the
stand I have taken in this matter. I bave
beebh accused of hounding the cammittee.
There is no ground for that statement. I
have only attacked the decisions of the
committee when I found, according ta my
knowledge o! law, that the evidence 'adduced in a case was insufficient ta justify
the conclusion arrived at. I have neyer

Hon. Mr. SPEAKER-Might I ask the

I arn talking on general lines a! what the
conduct of Senators, should be in discussing
such matters. I arn asking hon. iniembers
not ta im~pute ta mie motives which I amn
not infiuenced by. I will flot find fault
with the judgmen4t. of the committee that
are bascd on saund evidence; but for the
past three years I have undertaken ta show
ta the House and country how divorce is
becbrne easy, not anly in the courts o! the
country, hut even in parliament, and because I have donc Sa 1 do not want ta be
upbeaided and denounced as an unreasonable mian, led by religions convictions
which have no bearing an the subjeet. I
certainly shall not stand that. I all-ow my
religious convictions ta interfere in these
matters in no wise. Now, -in t.his case o!
Johustan, the principle vhich underlies the
decision of the commnittee is one calculatcd
ta destroy the confidence of t.he people in
aur decisions. In the previous case, it was
insufficiency of testimony, and every hon.
member heardthe senator from De Salaberry
state that although he had only glanced at
the ev'idence, he thougrht there wvas not sufficient ta justi!y the conclusion. Now tihat
was the former case. This case inaugurates
a new system under wvhieh divorce can be

ta quote evidence he quotes what supports
his case and leaves out the rest. The principle underlying this divorce case is that

Bill. I arn not minimizing the eviçlence; I.
amn giving ail the details. There ia, no evi denes2 of crime. If you are going to grant
divorces on such grounds, there will be few
married familles inr this cuuntry. Is parliament getting crazy? If the principle la te
be recognized, that insufficient tes.timony
may be accepted as proof cf an offence, and
if simple admissions without corroborative
proof of any description are to be taken,
then I say the sooner divorce is taken from

quite agree with the hon. member from
K.amloops that it is time for parliament to

he does.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I repeat what I have

Hon. Mr. WILSON-I wvant to knowý
whether you could change the manner of
granting divorces without first changing the

Hon. Mr. WILSON-You would not then

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-If divorces are to

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The lion, gentleman

chang-ing the mode of trial, sending it from

FEBRUARY 22, 1911

when they are at fault that 1 condemn, and
I must say to their credit that is very seldom. When 1 -came here, active as the
hon. member from British Columbia wanted mie to be, I found fault with some of
their judgments. Ail I arn trying to do
here is to protect the welfare of the peopie, and not to make divorce too easy. In
the case of a man living in open adultery,
1 have nothing to say against divorcing
hMm, but for sn accidentai, trivial fault why
destroy the marriage relation? Why mar
the record we have in Canada of being tho
whitest country on the face of the earth?
As the hon. member from Halifax pointed
out two or three weeks ago, our record in
regard to divorce is one of the cleanest in
the history of the human race, and why
should we allow even one case to pass
which would minimize that record? I hope
the members of the committee will not
think I am opposed to ail their proceedJ nga; but surely the leader of the opposition and the chairman of the committee
*will allow me the privilege of checking
over the doings of the committee. What
are we here for except to check the doings
of committees. 1 arn not here to destroy
their usefuineas, but when I find they are
at fault they should flot upbraid me with
trying to impede the public business because of my religious convictions.
The
leader of the opposition is astray; I arn as
broad as he is, or broader, in inatters of
this kind, and juat as true to the constitution as he is. 1 have no intcrest in Mr.
or Mrs. Johnston. I have an intereat in
the principle on which we are asked to
grant. divorce.
*Hon. Mr. POWER-The hon, gentleman
has describcd himself as approaching these
questions in a judicial spirit. It is wvonderful how one may misapprehend his own
mental attitude. He reminds me a good
deal of the Scot who said 'I amn opcn to
conviction, but 1 would like to sec the,
man th-at would convince me.' That is his
attitude. I looked over the evidence in
the two cases thiat have been- before us
to-day. 1 did not feel that, if I hiad been
a member of the commîttee dealing with
the Stapleton case, I was perfectly sure I
should have voted with the majority of the
committee, but I thought that the com181

mittee on the whôle were in a better position
to judge than I was. But with respect to the
present case, my feeling is different. 1 think
that there is no reasonable ground whatever for supposing that the cornmitt 'ee's decision was flot perfectly in accordance with
the evidence. I think the hon, gentleman
frorn Centre Victoria division labours urider
a serious misapprehension. He professes
te be a great enerny of divorce. Now it
is perfectly clear, and it has been made
clear on more than one occasion, and is a
matter of complaint with a good rnany
people in this country, that while divorce
is confined to parliament the number cf
divorces will be very much less than if
courts are created. Now the hon. gentleman is doing alI he can to bring about the
substitution of a court for parliamentary
divorce. He is apparently anxious to make
the lîves of the members of the divorce
comrnittee burdensome, to make them disgustcd with the reception their work receives. We cannot abolish divorce in thiq
country. Divorce will go on, and the question is whether we are to have divorces
granted by parliament or by courts. I
say that within five years, if you substitute
a court for parliament, you will have ten
tixues as many divorces as we have now.
It just shows how a lack of judgment will
often lead a well-meaning gentleman astray,
and that in the attacks the hon. gentleman has made on the committee and their
reports ha is doing the best work that
any one bas done to bring about the creation of a divorce court. 1 think he had
better sit down in the quietude of his own
chamber and consider this thing a bit,
and not attack the findings of the coinmittee unless the findings are evidently
contrary to the evidence. The leader of
the opposition ivas pcrfectly justified in
making the dlaim for the conimitt-ee that
they have placed the members of thîs
House under a very great obligation. In
old times there was no one committce of
divorce; a committee was struck for each
case, and the result was that the work was
distributed over the greater part of the
Huse. It was, to my mind, a great improvement on the procedure when the
present systcm was adopted of having a
standing committee on divorce. Take this
session-there are at least thirty cases, and

S EN AIE
as the leader of the opposition said, the
whole of the parliamentary turne of the
rnembers of that committee is practically
absorbed by this divorce committee, a
most disagreeable and objectionable work
to any one who is gifted with fine feelings,
or who is flot filled with prurient curiosity.
Instead of apparently making every effort
to pick some fiaw in the work of the cornmittee, unless it appears on the face o!
the evidence that the committee have been
clearly wrong, we should accept their findinga. We should show some courtesy to
the members of the committee. Every senator is entitled to reasonable courtesy
from bis fellow members, and the members
of the committee, who do so much and
such unpleasant work on behaif of the
whole House, are entitled to the utmost
courtesy and consideration from their fellow members. 1 hope that the hon. gentleman irom Victoria will not persist in
making at any rate rather extreme and not
well-founded attacks on the work of the
committee.

ed, and the frauds which are, 1 was going,
to say, usually incident to a large business
af this kind, suppressed. The system of inspection up to the present time has nat
been satisfactory. A revision of the present legiglation as embodied in the Bilh
before us, without the additional machinary which bas been introduced into this
Bull would probably be as inefficient as
hitherto. I was particularly struck by an
article which appeared in the 'Canadian
Magazine'» of January last, which voiced
ta some extent the opinions af the farmers
in the Northwest as ta the administration
of the inspection system in dealiug with
terminal elevators. This writer has said:
In the terminal elevatars the elevator companies which. operate them. have a system. bv
which they can still further manipulate the
grain ta their immense profit. 'Grain can be
mixed in the terminal elevators s0 that a
little high grade wheat xnixed With a lot of
low grade will raise the whole ta high grade
aud thus advauce the priée several cents a
bushel. This is strictly agalnst the law. and
the Dominion government have seventy ininspectors and other employees watching the
terminal elevators and checking their business
tu prevent such practices. But an army <if
inspectors could nlot stop it. Last spring the
irspectors weighed ail the grain in the eievMtors and discovered that the companies
had. been manipulating the wheat; so that they
had made about $40,0O0 in three months.
There is good reason ta -believe that the elevotor companies have made millions of dollars
by this means ln vears past. This time thev
were cauglit and fined $5,500. 0f course, afl
this plunder cornes out of the pockets of the
farmer and gives the Canadian wheat a black
eye on the Liverpool market, which is the
wcrld's ruling wheat market.
It is therefare a matter of regret that the
system of inspection which has been iii
operation up to the present time has apparently nat been as effective as lias been
the policy of the Act to make it. It is
therefore high time, if frauds of this kind
are being perîîetrated an the public at the
exp'inse of the i armers, snd to the prejudice
af the reputation of aur wheat iu the Liverpool market, that such frauds should be

would seem ta me that irauds of this kind
could scarcely be carrîed on as successfully
as reported, if there had been a proper administration of the law. I do nlot profess
ta be very f amiliar with'the aperation af
the Act, and ai the duties caýt upan the

that a large industry ai this kind, with an

dwell ta auy exteut upon the absolute necessity in the public interest ai Canada maintaining aur grain standards in the markets
ai the world.
Hon. Mr. KIRCHHOFFER-Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Cauada nat only
enjays a continental reputation, but I might
say, a reputation in the markets of the
entire world, with refereuce ta the superiarity ai its grain. The standardization of
that grain bas receivedl special attention
at the hands ai the governmeut. aud, of
course, the governmcnt ai the day is very
largely responsible for the maintenance ai
those standards. It does not matter what
legislation may be enacted for the purpose
ai maintaiuing standards, if there is not
a proper administration ai the law.-that
is ta say if the officers ai the Crown
charged with administering the law are lu
any way lax lu their duty, so as ta permit
gigantic frauds such as have been perpetrated. The Bull, I notice, is samewhat ai
a paternal character. That is ta say, the
sympathy ai the gavernment lias been enlisted on behaif ai the fermer, and it is
proposed that a commission ehould be appointed, that the terminal elevators should
practically be taken out ai the hands ai
the campanies who have been operatin.them, aud that the entire service should
pass into the bauds ai the goverume nt, and
under gaverumeut supervision. While that
is paternal, and while paternal legislation
does not entirely appeal ta my mind, yet
in view ai the facts which have been established, not only by the commission
which made a very lengthy inquiry aud
investigation juta this matter, but on account ai the public sentiment which largely exists against the present administration of the elevator system, I think onL
the whole the policy introduced by the goverument and incorporated into this Bill
is a salutary one, sud certainly should receive the support ai this Chamber. The
farmer, however, is not as helpless an in-

SIENATE
dividual as the press and the farmer himself would be disposed to make us believe.
Hon. Mr. DERBYSHIRE-Hear,

hear.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I was very much
interested in reading some statisties given
in a recent article in one of the Canadian
magazines respectîng the growth and successful development of a company consisting entirely of farmers, incorporated to
handie grain. In 1906, many of the farmers
of the Northwest, suffering from the difficulties to which. I have alluded, conceived the idea of forming 'what is to-day
known as the Grain Growers Grain Comnpany. In the summer of 1907 that coinpany, which then had a capital of about
$46,000, handled two and -a haîf million
bushels of grain. In the summer of 1908
they really got under way, -and they
handled five million bushels of grain.
They had a capitalization of about $73,000, and they cleared up in profits somewhat over $30,000, or made 40 per cent.
upon the investment into which they had
gone.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Coluinbia)-Is that company holding elevators P

the community. I point out this fact to
establish that the farxner bas reached that
stage when hie is very well qualified to
look after himself.
Mr. POWER-Hear,

hear.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-And possibly to
handle his resources as advantageously,
if not more so, than other companies, or
even the government itself could do. ITowever the sympathy of the government seems
to have been further evoked to protect the
farmer, with the result that we have this
Bill before us. I hope that the commission
for which this Bill makes provision will be
an efficient one. I would almost venture
to ask the government that the appoinitments to the commission should not be
made on political grounds or for politica]
considerations, that its personnel should
appeal to the entire commu.nity. It will
certainly bie vested with very large powers,
probably powers larger than those with
which the Railway Board is vested. It
gives to this commission power to acquire,
and in fact build terminal elevators. As I
understand the policy of the governinent
at the present time is not to enter upon
the construction of new terminal elevators,
but to take possession and control of the
present terminal elevators.1 If it be found
necessary at other points throughout the
Dominion to establish terminal elevators,
which must necessarily involve a very
large expenditure of money, this commission will be vested with power to enter
upon undertakings of that character. I
amn not aware what the policy o! the government is with reference to making this
commission self-supporting, but it seems

owing to the reciprocity arrangements which
are now being discussed in the House of
Commons, and on which the government
is about to enter with the neighbouring
republic. This Bill has undoubtedly been
framed with the view to the continuance
of the present conditions, and to make
those conditions as effective in the matter
of inspection and the atandardîzation of
grain as possible. But since this Bill was
frane d, it must be apparent to every hion.
gentleman in this Chamber that a new
condition of affaira has arisen which wil
disiocate the trade under our present elevatar system and our grain trade generally. As hon, gentlemen know, aur terminai elevators are at Canadian ports,
chiefly at Fort William and Port Arthur.
Free trade in wheat will certainly resuit
in the routeing of our grain from Canadian
ports to American parts. I venture to say
that a very large proportion ai our
Caadan
grain
will, if
reciprocity
goes into operatian, be routed from
Minpoints in Canada to
western
neapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and probably shipped from Duluth, to nat only
ports within aur own country, but to United States ports. Ail the efforts and energy ai the government at present are
directed towards reforming the Canadian
elevator system at Canadian parts. Up
ta the present time, ail aur grain, speaking generally, has gone througb those parIticular gateways fa which I have al]uded
and within aur own boundaries. But I
may ask the question, if we have free trade
in wheat haw will the government enforce the standardizatio.n ai aur wheat
passing into United States territary without gaing thraugh terminal elevators and
withaut in any way caming under the contrai or jurisdictîan of Dominion authorityP
There is no0 doubt in my mind that recipracity arrangements with the United
States will result in United States buyers
caming into our territary, purchasing wheat
and shipping it -direct ta United States
points. The Bill is therefore, in my judgment, premature until we decide what is
ta be the policy of Canada upon the question ai reciprocity. Until that la decided,
this Bill will certainly f ail ta deal with a
subject whch is ai vast importance, and

will assume larger magnitude than the
Bill anticipates. That is ta say we are ta.
day providing most elabarate machinery
for the inspection, standardization andl
elevatian of aur grain at Canadian ports.
If the rèsuit ai Iree trade should be ta divert aur wheat ta United States territary,
then we are pravidîng machinery for anly
a smaîl proportion ai aur grain, without
any provision as ta what attitude the government will take towards maintaining th-'
standardization of grain on the international boundary. Whether that can be done
or not, whether it would be wise ta estabhiali elevators on the boundary uine, I cannot say, but it is maniiest ta my mind
that the most ai aur wheat must pas:3
through United 6tates channels and bi
ground in the United States milis.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-Why?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Because ai the
facilities which exist in the United States
for the carrying an ai that industry. I remember flot later than two years ago my
hon. friend from Portage la Prairie made the
statement in one af aur committees that
the time would arrive when the United
States millers would grind ail the wheat
ai Canada, and when the milîs ai this
country would almost cease ta be in active
aperation.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I stated that in a
very iew years the United States would
take the duty aff wheat.
Han. Mr. LOUGHEED-And then the
hon. gentleman said United States mnillers
would have the manopoly of grinding aur
wheat.
Rt. Han. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-My han. iriend will notice that the commission will have power ta miake termina]
elevators at any point ai exit from Canada.
Han. Mr. LOUGItEED-I have already
alluded ta that. I have naticed the authority which is given ta the commission ta
enter upon undertakings ai that nature;
but the question which presents itself ta
my mmnd is whether the building ai terminal elevators on the baundary line wil
meet the difficulty I have pointed out.

S ENL;A T E
These ideas have occurred to me in going
casually over the Bill, and I mention them
now. I arn very mucli in sympathy with
the policy of the Bill, and hope that in
its operation it will give the greatest satisf action to the farmers and the public of the
West.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I
should like to ask those who are -better
acquainted with the subject than I arn.
how it is that the farmer caii bc a loser
ta the extent which bas been pointed
out? I can understand that a merchant
may purchase one hundred thousand
bushels of No. 1 hard and two bundred
thousand bushels of No. 2 for the purpose
of mixing; but lie would have to pay the
farmers from wham hie bought the grain
the market prices. I can understand that
the merchant might ship that grain to England or some other outside market and palm
it off as No. 1 and make a profit; but I
cannot see how the f armer could lose- My
hon. frienda from the Northwest who have
studied the question may be able to explain this point so that we can appreciate
this cry that the farmers are being rob-'
bed.
Hon. Mr. WATSON-I amn afraîd the question is much easier asked than answered.
The lion. gentleman irom Calgary bas just
pointed out that western farmers have
made an immense amount of money in the
short space of two or three years, and tbey
are ail honest. I do flot know if this is
the proper tirne or occasion for discussing
reciprocity with the United States. For
years past I heve thought that the United
States would take the duty off wheat to
biend our grain with their softer wheat.
For fear any person should think that I disagree with what is p2roposed in the other
House, and is now under discussion there,
I think the arrangement is one of the best
things ever proposed for the west, and the
fears expressed by the lion. gentleman from
Calgary are groundless. Thc United States
can take the duty off ivheat any time they
choose, and at the present our wheat can
be exported in bond through the United
States, so thase two features of the question can be taken out of the discussion altogaether.
Hon. 1%r. LOUGHIEED.

Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Who is the party
that expressed a fear that we would disagree with the parties on the other side?
Hon. Mr. WATSON-The leader of the
opposition said that I expressed the opinion that our wheat would go to the United
States.
Han. Mr. DOUGLAS-I have given some
time and chreful study to this Bill, and
have come to the conclusion that it is deserving of our confidence and is in the interests of ail parties concerned. The handling of grain seems to somes, ta be a mystery, and I do not wonder. It bas been
a vèry profitable business, and hence it bas
induced a number of people already in
good lines in which they were making
nioney, to gîve up their business and enter the grain trade with the prospect of
carrying it on as it bas been conducted for
nearly a quarter of a century. This buâiness of mixing grains is -at the bottom oi
the whole trouble. How the money is made
is easy to explain. A grain merchant who
has been long in the business told nie.
'There is no use arguing the matter, we
have too many grades to handle'. Througlh
the different grades, wlieat which. bas been
depreciated from dampness or smut or
other causes furnisbed the way to make
maney. A member af the grain exehange
in Montreal said two or three years ago
that whien grain is ail of fixst quality they
could not make money. 'But,' he said,
'when we hear that there lias been f ros't
in the west, or weather which damages the'
grain, then we throw our hats in the air
and can make money.' The money is made
by a process of manipulation. A merchant
may have a certain quantity of first quaIity grain, perhaps better quality than it
is reported to be. We do not hiear anyt.hing of this. It is aIl No. 1 bard, but
it is spoken of as No. 1 Northern. Th-3
Grain Exchange, whether by mutual agreement or otherwise I cannot 'say, tbrougIiout the country districts, make it a point
to buy the grain from the farmer at a
grade lower than it ought to receive. In
consequence, they make ten cents a bushe1
on the value of the wheat. They keep
that from the farmer as a margin ta make
it safe when they are handling it.

FEB1IUARY 23, 1911
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-That
wouid be the result of faise inspection.
Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS-Of lalse dealinga
with the peopie. It may flot have been
inspected by governmnent inspectors. We
have a government inspector who is above
reproach-I think we can say that witli
ail feeling-but 'there are people, and there
always wiil be people, who do flot look
sharply enough after thieir own business
and accept the grade offered them wlien
tliey Bell their ioads of grain. They Bell it
subject to the inspection made by the agent
et their own town, or subject to governrnent
inspection at Winnipeg, or at the head of
the lakes. In that way, 'the sanie agent
may buy other grades of grain rangîng perhaps away down to 35 cents a bushel, andJ
by the time lie lias done the mixing, and
the poiishing withjime and suiphur of th,3
lower grades, and dried that which is
damp, lie gets it into such a state that lie
can put so mucli of a grade tliat perliapa
lias oniy cost him 40 or 50 cents, with a
better grade and make a profit. He blends
thie wheat as men in the grocery business
blend tea, and if the biend cornes up7 to
the government standard the dealer thinkg
he lias done lis duty. and lie lias made prohabiy 50 per cent on lis work. The dufficulty is to correct this. Borne say it is
a legitimate business. 1 say it is a nefarious business. It is a fraud on the public.
But tbey argue it is good for the farmer.
He can seii grain for 35 cents in the market
which perliaps lie couid flot seil at any
price otherwise. It would have been better
ta feed it to his liogs, but lie selse it ta the
mercliant and in tliis way gives liim. an opportunity ta biend the wlieat and inake
monéy.
Tlie difficulty is tliat the grain
tliat is sent forward as No. 1 carrnes witli
it ahl the infirmities of the grades that liave
been mixed witli No. 1 liard, and if it is
eold as No. 1 liard when it is biended
witli inferior grain, there lias been too
little given for it in the country, and the
farmer suffers ta begin with. Then, agaiin,
every time liigli standard wheat is blended witli a iower grade lie is robbing the
public and tlie consuming public by introducing a iowqr grade that is wortli leas
money into the higlier grade, so thst it
cannot be cailed an honest business. You

cannot put in diseased grain witli pure,
perfect grain fit for the market and say
that it is wortli as mudli money as if it
had neyer been biended. This is tlie way
in whidli aur grain suffers in the ..Liverpool
markets,. or in any af tlie liome markets.
Wlien it gets into the hands of experienced merdhants, they know as well,
perliaps better on account af their knowledge of cliemistry, and the varions devices
tliey liave for examning into the nature
of the grain before tliey make an aller -as
ta the price, and tliey find out that it is
wartli so and 'so ta the milier. Then,
again, a blend of this wheat is wortli soand-so ta the baker. The baker knows the
amount of moisture it la capable of absorhing, and lie will give tnore money for
flour tliat ivili absorb a large amount af
moisture, because the moisture is sold at
the samne rate as flour, so that in this way
there is a wrong inflicted at home and
abroad. The fraud that is thus practiced
on the foreign buyer cornes back again ta
the farner, and tlie consumer wiil not
give tlie samie amount oi money for grain
if it lias thus been manipulated, as lie
would had the dlean, pure article as it
came from the farmers, been sold. Per.
laps there -are some wlio would flot quite
agree witli me in Borne af these particu.
lana, because they ssy tlie blended grain
looks just as good as the othen after it bas
been handled in tînt particulan way, and
why have they flot the riglit ta liandie
thein own grain as tliey please. I-understand that since tlie introduction of this
Bill, hints bave been tbrown out in Winnipeg and elsewhere tînt a move will be
mnade ta have tbis mixing of grain made s
legal business. It is possible that an attempt will be made in that direction? 1
do not think we ought ta modify the Bill

with the question as it is now before us in

city becomés a fact, changes may be necessany; but I arn satisfied thnt the powers
given ta tliis commission will iargely caver
the wliole ground for the time being. Wliether this measure îvill prove a great success or a failure will depend entirely upon
the integrity and ability of the men the
government may appoint ta office. It is

284

a very great responsibility for any govarnment to hand over such a large amount
of money to be handled and supervised,
and its sale and character maintained and
secured. I arn very solicitous about the
parties that may be appointed as commishioners. The government dlaims the riglit
to appoint the chief commissioner, which,
1 think, is only reasonable and fair, and
two others are still to be appointed. 1
would not like to see both of these, mien
who have been grain grewers or dealers
in grain. I would rather have good,
clear-headed business men, with integrity

the law, who could give wise counsel and
make a study of the whole matter, would
be useful. The new part of this Bill takes
good care to keep out of this commission

would be men of weight and respensibility,
and the penalties that wilI be iniposed -and
the oaths they wihl be required to take

excellent argument of the right hon.
leader of this House the other day, as to
whether there was need for such a commission and for such a chanee in the
whole management of the grain trade. It
is not at aIl necessary that I should present reasons why this Bill should be enacted. Cases have been proved against the
grain trade, beyond ail dispute.
It
has been proved that they made false
returns, deceiving the government, that
large amounts of grain had been pilfered
and lost and that the public were being
robbed. If the preamble of the Bill receives the support of parliarnent, I think
it will guard very efficiently against the
difficulties that have become apparent
under the late investigation by the gevernment. When this Bill is going through

bother about reciprocity until the whole
thing is settled, and we can meet any emergencies that may arise under reciprocity
when -the time comes. With reference te
our wheat going into the United States, I
rnay inform the House that four or five
years ago, when the Canadian Pacific railway buîlt their main branch te Saskatoon
and Edmonton, United States buyers appeared on the scene -as seon as the rails
were laid and began to put up their elevators, and at every railway station they
had their buildings and were ready te purclisse our wheat and give good prices.
They took the grain te, Minneapolis and
St. Paul and paid the duty that was then
imposed upon it. This lias been going on.
They have been treating the people well,
and we have no fault to find, so that in
this case there is no ground for alarm. Ever
since the Bill of 1900 became law, we have
shipped our own grain, not through the elevators, but over the grain platferrns provided
on ahi the different branches, and have
found it to be an advantage of anywhere
from 7 to 9 cents a bushel. That lias
been our profit by selling our grain in car
lots to commission merchants at the head
of the lakes. It seems, however, that this
way to the ordinary fariner is somewhat
complicated. Net being used to business
metliods, many go on in the old way seliing grain locally. We are ghad to see that
the. enterprising farmers wlio hoad their
own grain and send it forward to the bead
of the lakes and have it weighied by the
government weiglimasters and inspected by
the gevernment inspecter, have made a
very decided imprevement in the handling
of our products. I arn heartily in accord
witli the Bill as it now stands. Whoever
prepared the first part of the Bill did it
very carefully. It may be that certain
minor changes wilh be required in what
follows, but aIl this wilI corne up when
the Bill is in committee.

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-I have no desire, at
thia stage o! the Bill to enter into a discussion of its merits, but some remarks were
made thia afternoon wvbich require explanation to prevent a wrong impression beîng
made on the subject. It scems unfortunate that the grain handiing o! this country is supposed to be a target for anybody to fire charges at, and when we hear
a western man repeat some of those charges,
naturaliy those who are not familiar with
the subject feel that there -must be a great
deal in those various statements, or else
they would be answered by those who do
not sec eye to eye with the gentlemen wbo
inake these remarks. My hion. friend from

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-Judging from aome
o! the remarka of my hion. friend on thc
other aide they c annot not only take care
of themacivea but tbey eau take care of a
great many others as weli. The opportunitics that are given to those who are producing grain arc so varied and s0 extensive that it appears to me to be s very
difficult task to put an unf air price on
grain when the producer bas so many
avenues of escape. It would not be very
good immigration literature to say, as My
hon. friend bas suggested just now, that a
farmer in the wcst has to contribute a ten
cent margin to the dealer in the handling
of bis whcat, and lic draws a picture of the
method of handiing by ssndpapering and
sulphuring and brimstonc, and one thing
and another, and then passing the inferior
grades of wvheat into the markets of the
worid, and disposing of it at a high price.
1 want to tell him that no grain treated
in that wsy can get a grade from auy of
our inspectors. It is de!amed at once, and

SENATE
sonable man, because if there was a ten
cent margin on any market in the west,
the farmer has nothing to do but to take
bis grain to Fort William. The door is
open to hlm to do it. The law is that, in
shipping grain, the farmer *stands on a
parity with even the big elevator companies. He gets car for car with them. He
is flot handicapped in the obtaining of the
cars. He loads his grain and ships it to the
terminal elevator, and whatever the inspeetor grades it, gives him ils standard in the
markets of the world, and lie can seli 011
that certificate and bill of lading whereever he likes, so that it is impossible to
corner a man in the Northwest provinces
any more than in the'east, and compel him
to take an unfaîr price for his grain.
Leaving aside the competition that exists in
the~market, of buyers with different interests-I arn speaking more particularly of
the milling a nd export industries, the Ogîlvies, the Lake of the Woods and other
large concerna, buying practically in every
market of the world and country place in
the Northwest, exportera also have their
buyers there, and are collecting the grain,
and I think the time bas gone by when
that statement can be made successfully
that an undue advantage is taken of the
f armer when he bas aIl those facilities to
handie and seil bis own grain and get the
highest price, less, a commission for the
handling to the people, shipping, and the
law protccts him in this. The law gives
bim the same privileges as the elevator
company and there is no use in picturing
to the world that if a farmer lives in thc
Northwest country he bas to pay trîbute
to the iniddleman or dealer when the door
is wide open te him. My hon. friend ahso
mentions that wheat was shipped to the
United States years ago and the duty paid
on it, and that there would be a still further shipment when the duty was removed.
My recollection is that at the time he referred te a privilege was allowed to the
millers to grind and mill their wheat in
bond at diflerent parts o! the States. At
that time a certain amount of wlieat went
over, but what the effect will be with the
bars down I arn not in a position to say
and do not propose to discuss at the present moment. The appointment of a commission, for which this Bill provides, and

which is practicallY the new feature o! the
Bill, the old inspection Act and the former
Manitoba -Grain Act being merely re-enacted, seems to me to be a necessity from the
extraordinary growtli o! the grain business
whici lias taken place within the last few
years. My hon. friend the Minister of
Trade and Commerce may be so vigilant
sud ever so attentive te bis duties, as no
doubt he is, yet we' can readily see with
this enormous business growing, as it is,
and so many other matters te attend to,
that it is wise in the interest flot only of
the producer, but of the business man connected wi*th the trade, that there shouid be
a board liaving powers, something similar
te those of our Railway Commission, to
govern and arrange ail matters in connection with the grain trade, and be nearer
to the business than the department lieriŽ
at Ottawa. In the appointment of the~
board, 1 agree witb the lion. gentlemen wha
have spoken, that the very highest class of
men should be selected for the position.
and that extraordinary powers cau safely
be given .provided we bave a good board to
deal promptly with ail matters and disputes that may arise in connection with the
handling of the grain in the ý west.
lu so far as the elevators are concerned, my hon. friend the Minister o!
Trade and Commerce bas at all times
met the suggestions of the producers, eapecially in regard to the regulations and governrnent of the terminal elevators; in fact
the powers taken under the Act practically
makes the government the -owners of ail the
terminal elevators at Fort William, and the
board whicli will step in, if this Act isQ
pase d, will take their place. Fort William
is but one link in the chain of transportation, and it strikes me that if it is necessary and important that supervision of
the grain trade should be had at Fort William and Port Arthur, it is equally important and necessary that that same supervision should follow tlie grain clean through
to the seaboard.

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-It is not impossible, I arn sorry ta say.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-It is illegai. At Fort
William, the government inspector inspects
in, and the government inspector inspects
out, and no elevatar can turn its spout
into a vessel without the permission of a
gavernment officiai, and there must be an
inspector standing there to see that the
grain is coming out, and he takes samples
continuously. If the sample, is below grade,
it is the governxnent inspector's officiai duty
to iminediately order the elevator ta cease
working, because they would be delivering
stuff fot of the proper grade, and he would
refuse a certificate out for No. 1. It is illegal ta do otherwise, but not impossible.

been done, or that it has been done.

fixed princîples of hionesty of the gentleinan who had been handling grain in the
west for the last few years that the hon.
gentleman from Killarney has. I fancy that
if these gentlemen who have been a.lluded to
by the hon. gentleman from Ta.ntallon (Hon.
Mr. Douglas) have not been manipulating grades ta the extent of about half a million busheis, switching from No. 2 to No.
1, for which thiey were fined in the court
of iaw, there would have been no necessity
for the introduction of this Bm. If there
bas been an agitation going on for years
amongst the farmera of the Northwest for
amendments ta the Grain Act, which appears ta be strange ta people down here,
these gentlemen are responsible, because
as soon as the farmers get legislation ta
protect themselves against grain dealers,
they find after that, af ter the law is put in
operation, there is a loophole in it which
these men take advantage of, and the f armers have ta came back ta parliament for
more legisiation. Any persan who knows
anything about the grain trade, knows that
it is not a very good thing alter inspection ta be found manipulating the grades.
When you put a certain number of bushels
of No. 1 wheat into an elevatar, the record
shows that, and if! about half as much
more goes out o! it of that particular grade.
and you find a shortage in the lower grade,
I do not think it can. be considered very
honest. The greatest manipulation is in the
iower grades. Take a grade of wheat that the
inspectar 'wii nat grade No. 1. It is just
as good as Na. 1 Northern if it were not
for a few smut bails in it. These gentlemen have nat alluded ta the hospital they
have at Port Arthur where they treat this
class of grain. It is put down in a lower
grade where the depreciation is 20 cents,
and 'the man who owns that grain loses
20 cents; but after it is put through thîs
hospital, they make it as good as it was
before it was damaged. With regard to
aur wheat going acrass the boundary uine,
as the hon. gentleman states, I do not
think there is much in that. We have
nat seen any great difference in the amount
that has gone that way.

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-The United States export grain theinselves. I do flot think they
are goîng to pay us four or five cents more
for oui wheat to take it out -and then sefl
it in the saine market we seli ours. There
is one class of wheat that may go south,
and that ie the off grade my hion. friend
froin Tantallon <Hon. Mr. Douglas) speaks
of. That is the grade of wheat that gets
a little off colour wvith raim, which would
be graded as No. 2 Northern if the rain
had flot injured it and made it a littie
tough. When it dries it wil be graded diff erently, r.nd as a matter of f act it has juct
as great a commercial value for making
flour as the high grade wheat, and that is
one branch of the business in which these
men have been making money. Our men
have been confined to the Canadian market for that class of wheat. It is just a
question whether that grain wiil not go
down to Minneapolis or come this way. 1
am inclined. to think if this Bill provides
for special binning privileges at the head
of the lakes, ail that class of wheat will
go down there, and it will be a sample ma£ket, and the United States dealers can
corne in and bid on that class of wheat,
which is flot now exported out of the country. If that be the case, it may flot be

then talk about it, and when you ask thein
what they will pay for off grade wheat
they will say: 'Whatever imy pocket will

of it, and it ail disappears. It is not
thrown into the lake at Port Arthur. It is
worth. just as much as No. 1 hard and you
get it for 2-0 cents iess. I wouid suggest
that steps be taken, if the îeciprocity
treaty is adopted, to establish a sample
market at Port Aithur of 50,1000 bins, and
have this rejected wheat sold by sample
there and the United States dealers can

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-Yes, thxe grain is
inspected in Winnipeg and goes to Port
Arthur and Fort William, and is put ini the
elevators there. It is weighed in by a governinent weigher, and out by a governxnenit
weigher, but during the turne it is in th-at
elevator, we find Mr. Elevator man is simply elevating No. 2 -noithern into No. 1 bin,
and lie sends it out under bis original certificate as No. 1 northein. There is no
disputing the fact that that has been going
on, because the records o! the court show
that there was a good deal of manipulation
in that way, and, theref oie, as a miller
froin the province o! Ontario, I arn very
beartiiy in favour o! the Bill. I believe
it is a wise thing for the goverument to

S ENA TE
pt t-cnt men, to manage t.he elevators ut
Port Arthur and the terminal elevators et
the lake porIts, and ail the machinery for
handfing, inspecting and grading this grain,
it will mnure greatly to the benefit of the
farmers of the northwest as well as th!1
dealers and millers in Ontario tand those
who handie grain. It is a very imuportant
Bill, and one which, in my opinion, should
be passed. I do flot take so mush stock
in the alleged abuses suffered by the farmers of the Northwest. I have no doubt
that in the earlier years unscrupulous buyers very often, as I kinow
they have in somne cases in Ontario, have
taken a little more than they should, but
as a rule the great competition that exists
now wlll compel the dealers to puy about
what the market can afford. In îny long
experience in handling grain I have scarcelv ever known a man who was buying and
sdhling grain rnaking very much money.
Some years he would make a great deal,
and other years hie would lose. The mnarket fluctuates so much that hie does flot
make much profit in the long run. The Bill
will help the farmers in the northwest, and
will be a great protection to the dealers in
the east, and it wilI insure oui grain going
to -the markets of the world as it should go,
on its merits as No. 1 or No. 2
Northern, or whatever it may be. 1
believe with the hion. gentleman from
Saskatchewan (Mr. Douglas), that the
farmers of the northwest will not get
very much advantage on their higher grades
of grain if the proposed reciprocity goes
into effeet, but I do t.hink that when they
are unfortunate with their harvest by reason of a hail storm or frost, and have a
]arge proportion of rejected or frozen wheat,
they will get considerably more under the
proposed reciprocal arrangement, if it goes
thirough, than they do now, because they
wvill undoubtedly have another and competing mnarket for their grain. They cannot send it to the British market. The
cost o! carniage is too much, and heretofore they have only had the dealers in
Ontario, wvho bought such grain for feed
at a very low price. The higher grades
are regulated by the markets of the world,
and 1 do not anticipate the Bill will make
any difference in them.

Hon. Mr. CA'MPBELL.

United States whien dealers will pay a littie
more; but ail the lower grades of grain
that will go south to the milîs unider the
reciprocal arrangements, will be only a
drop in the bucket. Last year some 2,000,000 bushels went south. Supposing there
were ten, twenty or thirty million bushels
went south to the mills at Minneapolis or
to any other parts of the States, what is
that compared wîth the enormous output o!
the Northwest which in five years 'will be
three hundred million bushels at ail events?
1 do flot thin< we need fear that the grain
which will go south will seîiously injure us.
Any man who studies the mnap of Canada
and the United States cannot corne to, the
conclusion that any considerable proportion
o! our grain is going to be diverted south.
There is no reason why, in the last 10 years,
they could not slip millions o! bushels
through the United States in bond, but
they did not do it, and they could not do
it, because they could not fight against
nature. Montreal is bound to be the output for grain during the season of navigation, especially so when we have through
facilities, the Grand Trunk railway and
Canadian Pacific railway are now spending
enormous sums of znoney at Victoria Harbour and Midlands to handle grain and
other products. They have their lines from
the lake ports to Montreal, and when the
treaty goes into effect a large quantity of
grain grown in the west will find its way
down the St. Lawrence by Port Coîborne or
Midland, and Montreal wîll be a greater exporter of grain in the future than it has been
-in the past. There are very many details
,in this Bill which have to be worked out
.in comrnittee. We can discuss them there'
clause by clause in a fuller manner. It
may be that some clauses will require
amendment, but in the meantîme 1 think
the Departmnent of Trade and Commerce
deserve great credit for bringing this mes6ure before the House, which I arn sure
,will be a benefit to the people o! Canada.

SENATE

A QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Columbia)-I wish to caîl the attention of the
hon, leader of the House to an article
touching immigration whîch. is very misleading .and cruel. The article states that
young women coming out to Canada, -after
they have served in a bouse for a certain
length of time, can rise at six o'clock in
the morning, perhaps prepare breakfast
and dinner, and when they have washed
up the dishes they can go out lawn tennis
playing, riding, swimming or bathing. I
do not think any hon. gentleman in this
House will say that thiat is the condition
in farm houses in Canada. The worst o!
it is that the parties referred to in this
article as offering such inducements to
young girls to emigrate are people in responsible and high positions. This is an
English paper, the ' Daily Miller,' and refera to the opening for young women in
Canada and states that the remuneration
is £36 a year. There are hundreds o! women applying for positions in Canada under
those conditions. I should like to ask
where would the swimming, lawn tennis
and bathing corne in in winter finie? If
the government could do anything to couinteract the effect o! such an article it would
be a creditable thing.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-If the hon, gentleman sends me the
paper I will call the attention of the Minister of the Interior to the matter.

Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-May I be permitted to point out that this Bill is a very

large and a very. important one, and one
such as this House has very seldoni lad
to deal with. In considering such a Bill
it is moat desirable that expert evidence, or
expert information should be obtained from
aIl sides. It involves questions of very
great importance to many interests, and
it appears to me that, as was the case with
the Insurance Bill, it would be desirable
to refer it either to the Banking and Coimerce Committee, or to a special coinmittee. It is even more important ini connection with this Bill than with the Iisu rance Bill, and as it would'be absolutely
impossible for that expert evidence or expert information to be given in the Coinmittec of the Whole, I would suggest te
the right hion. the leader of the Housef that
the Bill be deait withi as has been suggested.

they do not collect money, nothîng is said
in this Bill which would caîl for furnishing
security.

-These parties would be appointed by the

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-That is true; but I think thie government
will have to ask for the power.

Hon. Mr. POWEll-I think the objection
to this clause 16 is somewhat diminished
by clause 17, which reads as follows:

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Before subsection 2 passes, 1 want to put myself on record as -against the' principle o!
govemnment ownership o! any o! these
utilities. Experience has taught us that
government ownership of railways or any
other utility, almost, bas result-ed in extravagance and varions other evils that
'wonld net arise if the qindertaking were left
ini the handq o! private enterprise. That.
the government shonld take power to punish for the infringement of any larw 1
readily concede; bult I amn opposed to governinent ownership for the reasons I have
advanced. In case this clause passes, and
should the governeiiet decide upon the
purchase or the building of elevators, would
they be run by a commission or by government officials?

17. UJpon the conetruction, acquisition, leasing or expropriation by His Majesty of any
terminal elevator, the board shall be charged
with its, operation and management, and the
board may, with the approval cf the Governor in Council, make regulatbions for its management and operation and prescribe a tarif[
of fees and charges for the use thereof.

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The lion. gentleman will see by the section that, in ail probability, if the govemnment wil] acquire them they will have to
run them.

That tends 4to minimize the objection. The
elevator is not to be rua by the govern.ment apparently, but by the board.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-With
the approval of the Governor in Council.
The board cannot move, unless they obtain
the approval of the Governor in Council.

An Act respecting Grain.

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-I arn very glad to
hear tQhat, beécause as the House very
well knows, our wheat growing ares, is
extending rapidly in the west. LIn the
new districts some varieties are thoughit
to bring better resuits than others and it
is very desirable that the fullest value
they are entitled to should be given under
the Inspection Act. The Inspection Act
should include them so that the advantages may accrue to the >producer as soon
as possible, thereby encouraging new
settiers.

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-My hon. friend is right, and that is

to this board.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-I suppose they will
be supplied with proper means of making tests?

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-There is another
feature about this wheat growing in the
west which is worthy of notice. Oid settiers say that they have grown wheat
year in and year out on the same soul,
and find that it improves the grain, increasing its hardness, owing to climatic
conditions. That is particularly noticeable in our Fyfe wbeat; therefore a test
which is good for one year might flot be
a fair one for the next year. The tests
should be made yearly so that any improvement in quality would be noted.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I take it for granted

House says, that the board will be appointed before this year's crop is marketed. We can do nothing with the crop

Hon. Mr. YOUNG-The question to be
decided by the board under subclause 4 is
a question of law. Under the Act providing
for the appointment of our Railway Commission, an appeal is allowed on question3
of law. Would it not be well te, consider
whether such a provision should be mnade
here, because it mighit be a very serious
matter te take away a license, for instance
from the Canadian Pacifie raîlway terminal
elevator, or the Canadian Northern railway,
or the Grand Trrunk Pacific, which are very
costly constructions. In the nature of
things, the board would be experts in the
matter of handling grain, but they might
not be so expert on deciding a question of
law.

MARCH 9, 1911
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
I- will look into the question, and if xny
lion. friend thinks it would be desirabie to
niake any aiteration there, would he kindly
put it in writing, so that I may have At
considered by the proper officers. I arn not
quite clear as to what the words 'violation
of law ' mean. A good many interpretations inight be given to them. I do not
think it would be deciding a disputed point
of ]aw.
Hon. Mr. YOUNGi-It might be worth
while considering whether we shouid not
incorporate in this particular clause a provision similar to that enacted with re-ference
Io. the Railway Commission, because there
is a great deal involved in it.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The hon, gentleman lias used the illustration with reference to the possibility of
ýhutting up of one or more elevators, which
brings up an important question.
The
board are to be invýested with very large
discretionary powers, invoiving and including, as hon, gentlemen wilI see at a later
stage, the power of shutting up an elevator il they find just cause. These very richi
corporations, as my hon. friend weiI knows,
have enormous powers of delay, and one of
the reasons for clothing the board with this
summiary power is to prevent their taking
the case from pillar to post and froîn court
of appeai to court of appeal, thus, perhaps,
delaying the judgment ol the board for
four or five years.

board; but in order to meet the objection
made by the hon. leader of the House, if
an appeal is granted toD
the court, it ehouid
be provided that th-ere shall be only one
appeai;' and that the decision of the court
to which the appeal was -made shahl be
final.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-The provision of the
Railway Act would hardly apply to the case
s'uggested, because the chief railway commissioner is. a Iawyer, and of course is possessed. of a knowledge of the iaw, and he
la given power to allow an appeal, or to
refuse leave to appeal. In this case, what
the grain commissioner is called upon ta
decide under the Bill je merely whether the
prcvisions of the Act are respected in operating the elevator.. It is a question of fact
rather than a question of law, and I doubt
tl-e advisability of providing for an appeal.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I have taken a note of it. What the

Hon. Mr. KERR-The plan adopted on
a previous occasion in this Chamber in
dealing witlî the Co-operative Bill could be
followed with advantage in a case iike the
present one. There were large deputations,
and a number o! person)s appeared here,
to discuss that measure. Instead of the
Bill going to a special committee, the House
dealt with it in Committee of the Whole;
but instead of hiearing Ille parties interested
in Committee of the Whoie, a time was
namned for part o! the day, about the sanie
time as a special conimittee sat, and the
delegations were ail heard, so to speakf, at
the Bar, but really on the floor of the
House. Every interest connected withi thiat
measure pro and con was Iîeard. The whoie
Huse was practically sitting in committee
and listening.

Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-ihis House is responsible for its. own acts in so far as legislation 'is concernied, -and eaclh iîîdividual
inember is responsible.
We are dealing
with this <auestiS~, and we do flot want Lo,
transfer our responsibility te anly other
body.
It appears to nie that there are
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
uiatters of very special interest to be deait
w'ith. It would, therefore, be liighly desir- -That was not a government Bill.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTW-RTGHIT.

MARCH 9, 1911

Hon. Mr. KERR-But it was a Bill of
very large public interest, and it was found
to be a very advantage-ous way of obtaini.ng the evidence which the Benate desired.
If that plan could be adopted with the
present. measure, the delegakns oould be
heard; we could have the stenographers
present to report proceedinge and every
senator could be in his place, or as convenient as he could be -to the table.
n~t. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I think: my hon. friend ie confounding
the case of new Bills with Bills that
have been thoroughly threshed out and
considered. No Bill lias ever passed par
liament which. bas been so thoroughly
considered or longer debated, and on which
both sides have heen more fully heard than
the saine Manitoba Grain Act. As I have
already observed, there are but two clauses
which are really contenticus. They involve an important question of public
policy and not very minute details. The
government are reeponsible for that policy,
and they will have to bear the brunt if
they make any mistake about it. In any
case, we ha 'd better have a full discussion in committee of the whole on this
question. If it should then appear that
there je sucli dispute about matters of
tact that inembers have difflculty in cerning te a conclusion, I will con!fer with my
colleagues in regard to the suggestion
made as to hearing people at the bar of
the House. But we cannot delay too long.
I think we should have* our own debate
here. I have more confidence in the ability of my colleagues to discuss this measure than my hon. friende opposite appea-r to have. I do not think -we shall
find any great difficulty in discussing the
clauses 123 and 242. But if there were
questions of fact which required the hearing of evidence we could consider thern;
but let us have our debate firet.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Did
I undereta.nd hie honour the Speaker to
auggeet bringing experts te the bar o! the
House to give us information? That strikes
me as something unprecedented. The only
instance within my recollection o! bringing people to the bar ef the House was
when some charge wvas made against

them. It seeme to me it would be highily
improper to open this Chember te outsiders on discussions of this kind. We should
fully diecuse the menite and demerite of
the Bill and the principles involved in
it, and nlot bring outsiders to the bar of
the House to tell us what the practice je.
It is very easy for any member to seek
information, and it is equally neceesary
that those who are not acquainted with
the actual working of the Bill should seek
information from those who have expenience in carrying on the business of grain
warehouees under the termes o! the Grain
Act; but it seeme to me it would be highly
objectionable to bring outsiders to the bar
of the House to discuss questions cf this
kind. I do not desire my remarks te app]y to the appointment o! a epecial comnmittee, if the government thinks proper to
appoint a committee, and to meet in the
committee roomn and discuse the principles involved in the Bill in the same
manner as they would have done in reference to the Life Iusurance Bill.
discussion
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-The
linges upon two clauses, 123 and 242,
which involve a new pninciple in the
handling of grain, and, no doubt, will provoke a good deal of discussion, and there
may be a great difference of opinion.
There ie another phase o! the matter
which has net been touched upon, and
wich msy be 'worthy of consideration,
~ar& that je the nlew conditions which may
arise under our new trade arrangements
in both countries, when they come into
force. Whîle it is true that the great
majority o! the clauses which we have
passed have beeu in oui statute-book for
years, and have been ,grgued and discussed time and again on former occasions,
yet there is a matter that we shaîl have
to consider very seriously, and that, ie its
relation to the new conditions which arise
should these trade arrangements come into
effect. I have in view the preservation o!
as mucli of our trade as possible to the
Canadian routes, and it would be, to xny
mmnd, the plain duty o! parliament te see
that the Canadian route was not h-andicapped ini any way, shape or form, in
the handling of grain in favour of the
southern route.- That ie one important

feature.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-Yes, and whether
we agree or disagree on many things, I
think we ail agree on this principle, that
there should be no0 handicap whatever in
the handling of grain by those who desire
to ship and prefer to ship by the Canadian route. I amn not going to discuas
the effect of the reciprocity agreement; 1
amn rerely calling attention to that feature
of it which will be an important one,
and which will have te be deait with very
carefully with a view that no0 such handicap should exist against our Canadian
route and Canadian dealers.

Hon. Mr. KERR-Then it is for the gevernment te say whether, as they will have
te take the responsibility of the Bill finally here, they will take it now without
hearing anything further, or whether they
will go* on with it in the way that has
been suggested.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK, from the committee reported that they had made seme
progress with the Bill, and asked leave

It is quite true that that measure
was intreduced as a private Bill, although
a public Bill of great importance. It is
quite true that Bill had passed the House
of Gemmons, and it was here that the
evidence was received and heard, and
the matter was deait with. The Bill wns
rejected, although it had passed the House
ef Gommons after having been considered
by a committee there. I see no reasoli,
therefore, why such a plan of inferming
the members of this House should net be
adopted in this case, if it is necessary te

the necessary information new, and the

-Not in the case of substantial merchants.
We do not want to interfere, and I do not

with legitimate trading on the part of

merchants are aiten wealthy. The current
opinion is that their word is really as good
as their bond. We have to admit the
genuline merchant and his family. We
want to exciude ail other parties who,
under the guise of being merchants, are
coming in and who are realiy nothing better*
than coolies or ordinary servants. We
propose to regulate that by strict regulations made by the Governor in Council.

they are not entîtled to any refund.
Hon. Mr. LOIJGHEED-May I ask my

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-At the tîme of

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-If my memory serves

was this: If a Chinaman having been in

very clearly, and was very distinctly answered by the right hon. leader in the
afflîmative.
Hon. Mr. LOUGIfEED-That would be
a mistake, becauee he would not have that
right.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHTI may say te the hon. gentleman that my
reply had reference te the case of Chinamen born in Canada getting *ives in their
own country; but it waa limited te that.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I accept the explan.
ation of the right hon. leader of the House,
but if he would refer to the record he would
find that bis answer was more general. I
put >the case in this way: A Chinaman
comes to Canada and resides in the country
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 years. Hie sole object
is ta make money, go home and marry. and
raise a family, and my question was: if instead of forcing that Chinaman te remain
here for years te amass a fortune that.
would enable him te go home and take a
wife, in the meantime he could send for
one, and I distinctly remember the answer
was, yes, that the Chinaman could bring
over a woman as hie mate or 'wife. However, I may be mistaken. If the hon, leader
did not go as far as that, as he states now,
I say he should go that far. We 'have a
vast number of Chinamen in Montreal, and
they are as honeet and moral as men of any
other nationality.
We should give, the
Chinaman every opportunity te lead a
moral life. It is not a question of increasing Chinese immigration. Canada bas no
right to prevent a Chinese r*sident froni
living a moral domnestia hife. He owes it
te society, and if the abject of this law is
to prevent hiru frani doing so, then I shah
be against it, because it would be contrary
te aur moral law. Chinamen have been
coming here for the past 30) oir 40 years and
are not able to inarry white women, except
in a few cases, their abject being ta eamn
eniougb ta take them home to China and
secure a wife there. Why nat give theni
the opportunity in Canada? Why put a
tax on the heade of those who are going
to be their mates for the remnainder af their

view, because, alter ail, the Chinamen are

ened, and the men walked out, and in the
end their request was gra-nted and they are
now paid every two weeks. There are some
railways in this country that now pay their
men every two weeks, one of these being
the Quebec, Atlantic and Lake Superior.
When the bondholders took hold of that
railway the creditors had neyer been paid,
but ever since the employees have been
paid regularly every two weeks.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-What is the mileage
of the road?
Hon.. Mr. GASGRAIN-Exactly one hundred miles. When the bondholders took
possession of the road, the people were
supposed to get so ranch a week but did
flot get it, and the bondholders told them
they would give them twenty per cent less,
but they would get paid every two 'weeks.
Borne said they would rather work for more
even though they did not get it; but the
great majority agreed to take the smaller
wages end get paid every two weeks. That
arrangement will have been in force il
years on the first of July next, and the
men have got their pay regularly during al
that time. I dlaim that this arrangement
will be good for the railways, and 1 will
show how the wage earniers will benefit by
it. Hon, gentlemen in this Hlouse can
hardly realize what it means to work for a
corporation that only pays monthly. Supposing a man commences to work on the
first of April next, hie will work al
through the month of April wîthout getting a cent. You would naturally think
that on the first or second of May hie
would get his money. Not *at all. The
first of May goes by, and no money is

the baker, the grocer or the landlord?

The first week and the second week of May

of the second week, when he expects to

house, and he is told that if he cannot pay

Nothing else but pledge the f ew things
he may have brouglit from the aid
country with him until he earns the
money. I think it would be a reform
in the riglit 'direction if we could by
some means remedy this state of affairs.
I do not want to be too drastic with the
railways; but if we can induce tliem to
pay every two weeks, and make twentysix pay days in a year. then their employees would have ready money, and
would make better use of their pay, which
would be a good thThg for the railway
companies. 1 arn not against this Bill
going bef are the committee. I will be
very glad ta have the railway companies
corne and tell us what the extra expense
would be of their pay car going from one
end of the country ta the other more frequently than naw. After this ineasure bas
been in operation some time the railway
companies will see that it is ta their advantage. If you increase the value of the wages,
by fortnightly instead of monthly payments,
men will be less dissatisfied, and if it does
flot cost the railway companies very much
more, I think i wlll certainly pay themn.
Of course they will lose the interest upon
the money they now hold back. If a man
works from the beginning of the month ta
the end, and is only paid on the third
week of the following month, the total
amount of bis wages is for a littie over a
month held back in the hands of the railway compariy and if that money is drawin,- bank interest, the railway company
gets the benefit, and if that is repeated
twelve times in the year the company get
exactly one year's interest, and the men
are oui that mucli.

for the twelve montha, and lie lias had pay
for the last monîli in 15 or 20 days after the
lasi month is completed, bas lie loat a

Hon. Mr. -CASGRAIN-He lias lost tlie
interest of one month, and supposing a
railway company pays a million dollars in
wages per month, then the railway company will lase the interesi on anc million
dollars during the f ull year, and they aiways keep back thc million dollars. The
hon, gentleman from Prince Albert seems
ta think the draftîng of the Bill ha a11
patchwork, and sa an; but I will tell' hlm
for his information tlat the amended Bill
is the handiwork of a very particular friend
of lis, the Prime Minister of the country, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and he did the
patchwork, if there la any patchwork in At.
To sum up, there is no objection fram thase
promoting the Bill ta a certain amount
being kept back. That must of neces3ity
happen. No railway company can pay a
man on Saturday night after he has worked
two weeks. The working people have no
objection ta two weeks being kept back, but
they abject ta working ail ane month and
being paid tle third week of tbe next month.

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-My hon. friend made

an answer to my question. The hon, gentleman is supporting the Bill, and 1 asked

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-I amn telling the

Tlie Grand Trunk railway received aid in

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-No'
simply a loan, which lias neyer been returned. It stands now as an asset of the
Dominion, and a debt owed bythe Grand
Trunk railway. What it is worth perhaps
the hon. gentleman can tell us.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-I can only repeat
what I read in the 'Hansard,' that Sir Wilfrid knev ai no road to which it waui.i
apply; that ail the roads have subsidies,
and therefore it vould apply, and I take
it that, vitli regard ta a road which lias had

operated.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-We can have a full
discussion on the Bill in tlie Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I amn in accord
viti*tle principie ai the Bill, but I do not
think it is draited just as it should be. The
meaning of the clauses vould be that any
employee of the railway, at the expiration
of 15 days, would be entitled ta lis f1ull pay
if lie left them, but the railway vould have
ta take three, four, five or six days ta prepare the psy-rail. It vould compel tli
ta give the pay every veek instead af
every two veeka; therefare, ai necessity, a
provision should be added ta the Bibl providing for the keeping back ai s0 inany
days' psy, say nat exceeding eight days
anyway, the delay vhicli is necessary ta
prepare the psy-rail. 0f necessity psy for
that periad af time must be kept back. It
seems ta me that if this rule Ehould be sp-'
plied ta railways which. have been subsidized, or have received aid by vay of guarantee, it sliouid be applied ta ail railways,
with this provisa, that it miglit be permitted by order ini cauncil, on cause breing
shown, ta relieve a railwsy or a section
of a railway from the operation of the Bill,
and in tliat vay ta provide for the cases

too long a period. It would be a great
advantage te the men, and I do not believe
the railways will seriously suifer if the
period of pay is shorter. So far as I arn at
present advised, I am in favour of the principle of the Bill, provided that it be amended in the line 1 have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY-In answer to
th i remnark made by the hon, gentleman
fromr Toronto, that if, would be impossible
te make up the pay-rolls on a long line of
railway for fortnightiy payment, we have
tried it on the Intercolonial, though it is
not under this Act, 1 amn sorry te aay,
and if worked ail right in the month
of December.
The men have been paid
for some years up te the 20th December just before Christmas, and the ballance eleven days after that. They found
rio difficulty at ail ini doing it, and I think
they have some ten thousaüd men iii the
employrnent of the Intercolonial. The hon.
gentleman from Toronto is at the head of
an industry that employa some thousand
men who are paid fortnightly. The E. B.
Eddy Company, at Ottawa, pay fortnigbtiy;
the Dominion Textile, and the varions factories employing ten thousand people find
no difficulty in fortnightly payrnent. The
Canada Car Works, the Steel and Goal
Corporation in Sydney, pay ten thousand
people that way and find no difficulty, and
in the United States the railways are comIt
pelled by iaw te pay every fortnight.
requires a little larger clerical force, but
it would be a great accommodation to ernployees, and I trust before this Bill passes,
-and I hope it will pass-that it wilh include the Intercolonial.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-Ailow me to ask the
hon. gentleman promoting the Bill how la
it that the ernphoyees of great raihway corporations, which are so progressive in our
days, and have done so rnuch to better
their condition, neyer thought of bringing
in this important reforrn? We ail know
for a fact that if there is a well organized
body of men it is the raiiway ernpioyees.
From engineers down to brakemen they
have their own brotherhood which takes
good care of their men, and they lay down
a set of rules. This organization bas neyer
asked a raihway corporation to pay thern
fortnighthy.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY-I think the hon.
gentleman wili find that they have.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-I have neyer known
a single instance of that kind. 1 have no
objection to their being paid once a fortnight if possible; but there is no comparison between the Dominion Bridge Company and the Grand Trunk Railway. The
bridge company employ about 800 men.
They -re all under one foreman. Every
day, at six o'clock, the pay-roil can be
paid; but the men who are at work for
the Dominion Bridge Company ont in the
country only get their wages when they
corne back. They find it impossible to reach
the men ont in the country. They may be
in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. Their
wives are allorwed te go once a fortnight to
tbe paymaster and ask an account; but they'
cannot reach the workmen. I would like
to inquire if the railway ernployees organization ever asked for a measure providing
for fortnightly psy.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-I am very glad
te be asked the question. 1 have here a
petition from. the workingmen throughout
the length and breadth of the land.
Hon. Mr. OWENS-How many signatures
on the petitions?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-These were banded me by the member for St. Mary's division, Mr. -Martin. There are a great number of employees in bis division. For the
last four years this Bill bas been before
the Gommons, and passed this year unanimously with an amendment drawn by the
Prime Minister bimoself. As to the Dominion Bridge Company not paying their
men fortnigbtly, I bappen to know tbat the
Dominion Bridge Company are working al

fore parliament until it has inaugurated
the same principle in connection with its
own similar line of business. It must appeal to everybody here that if we want to
show the people of Canada what can be
done on the railway systems of the country we should start with the Intercolonial
railway. In that way we can teach a lesson ta the railway companies of what can
be accomplished in the interest of their
men. If we, as owners of the Intercolonial
railway, are not prepared to adopt this
principle on our own railways, why should
we ask other roads ta adopt it simply because we have helped themn to build roads
through sections of the country where they
could not have constructed them without
aid? It is absolutely absurd.
Hon. Mr. BOYER-As far as the petition
is concerned, it simp]y says that the men
working in the car shops want to be paid
once a fortnight. .There is no heading
to it.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
bon. member from, De Salaberry has announced his approval of the principle of
the Bill. I amn opposed to it in its entirety.
It is an- interference between the employer
and the employee and it is a question
whether it does flot corne within that class
of subjects assigned exclusively ta the
local authorities. What right has the Dominion government ta declare wvhat contracts shall be entered into between labourers and their employers? It is a question of civil rights. If the parliament of
Canada assume the right to say how men
shall be employed and how often they
shall be paid, we will soon go a littie further and declare what they shall or shall
pot eat. We have as good a right to declare that a man shall not eat beef more
than once a week, or more than once a
day, as to declare how otten he shail bé
paid in a month. Any man who is not
paid for the work he performs can collect
his wages in the usual way. This parental
legislation is an interference with the
ordinary rights of the individual and
should not be placed on aur statute-book.
I can understand very well how the members of the House of Commons, who perhaps are catering to the votes they expect
Hon. Mr. JONES.

to get at the next election, would support a
mieasure o! this kind; but this House is so
constituted as to be enabled to judge of the
merits of any question, when it comes before them, without regard to any clamour
which. may be raised out of doors or inside
of parliament. If there is any reason in
the argument advanced by my hon. friend
who spokie so feelingly, then we should
rakle the railway comapanies pay at Ieast
once a week so as to prevent their men
running into debt, and protect the butcher
and the baker from. las. We might even
make them pay every day. My hon. frîend
failed ta answer my question when I asked him how it could be cheaper ta pay the
ien once a fortnight instead of monthly. If
it is economical to double the work why
not carry it a littie further and have th-ý
ien paid every day? I suppose they would
then arrive at the point where the work
of preparing- the pay-lists would be done fcýr
nothing. I leave the matter of interest with
the hon. gentleman himself, and he can
solve the problem when he gets quietly in
his room. with his pendi and his arithmetic., This question has been discussed from
every practical standpoint by the hon. gentleman from Toronto, and I do not propose
to go into it. First of ail, the Bill interferes
with private matters of railway companies.
It might just as well apply to individuals
as to railway companies, and the question
is how f ar it is to be carried. How is it
going to affect the Grand Trunk railway?
On the main line that company received no
subsidy or guarantee. It is true that in
the commencement of the work they received a loan o! money that is stili owing. How
is it going to affect the National Transcontinental bine which the government is building from Winnipeg eastward? I can understand how it is going to affect the
prairie section of the Grand Trunk Pacifie,
because there the government is granting a
subsidy and guaranteeing the bonds. They
guarantee the bonds, but the Grand Trunk
Pacifie woiild s0 far as it affects portions of its line corne within the meaning of
this law, but from Winnipeg to Moncton
railway
the National Transcontinental
would not. The road from Winnipeg to
Moncton is being buibt out of money raised
and spent by the government, and is to be

MARCH 14, 1911

afterwards rented ta the Grand Trunk Pacific at a certain percentage of the cost. That
la neither a guarantee nor a subsidy, and
the Bill would only affect certain roads
which had been subsidized by the goverfiment, and if the principle is good it should
go fnrther and apply to the Grand Trunk
railway and every corporation that la carrying on business in the country. If I understand the constitution of the local legislatines, this interferes with civil rights
and contracta which are within their exclusive power. My own impression is that
thia Bill ought flot to receive its second
reading. To my mind the principle is
vicions in itself. Corporations should be
allowed to carry on their business as they
deem. most advantageous to themselves.
There is a remedy provided by law by
which the men can collect their wages if
they are not paid. If we are to enact legishation of this kind, we ouglit to go a
littie further and declare when men shafl
go ta bed, when they ehail get up, and
what they shahl drink, on the ground that
it is dangerous ta the health flot to go ta
béd early, and that they ahould go to bed
eober. We had better go the 'whole length
while we are at it. I would be villing to
vote to throw this Bill ont, but if the Senate thinir it better to send it to the Railway
Committee in order to have it threshed
ont there, then I have no objection. The
sooner the Senate puts its foot on legisia
lion of this kind the better, and the.more
credit will redound to the Senate among
sensible people.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I quite agree with
what the hion. gentleman bas said. If the
promoter of this Bill is prepared to shlow
it to go to the Railway Committee where al
interests can be heard, I have no objection,
but I wonld not hike to see the Bill thrown
ont on the second reading in a slim House
For my part I do not know very mucb
about the Bill. My hion. friend has prodnced a lot of petitions; I amn in close touch
with a great many of the railway people in
the west, and I have neyer heard this question mentioned. Where the lion. gentleman

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I should like to
say if I can reconcile the statement which.
1 arn about to make, that 1 amn opposed
to the principle of the Bill on account of
its absence of principie. I cannot understand the assumption of the principle in
the Bill upon which parliament seeka authority to legisiate along this particular
line. I aek my hon. friand if it is by reason, of. parliament having authority ta deal
with Dominion railwaya. If that is the
principle which. is being invoked it certainly does not reveal itself ini the Bill.
The government seema to presuppose-because I arn assuming that the Prime Minister takes more or leas responsibiiity for this
BiHon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Made the amendment to it.
Hon. Mr.. LOUGHEED-The princîple
that is being invoked ia this: That wherever the parliament of Canada has granted
a subsidy or guarantee, then this ah-al
apply. May I point out to rny hion. friend,
it ia to take effect on ail Dominion aided
railways. Therefore, we maire the assuinption that the principle upon which the Bfi
is based is practically ex post f acto legislation. The parliamenft of Canada proposes to add to the snbsidy, or guarantee,
another condition, namely: That the railway company shall psy their men fortnightly. Parliament should do that. The
contract has been psed. That contrâct
giving a snbsidy or guarantee to the railway embraces an agreement between the
railway company and parliament. Parliament steps in and undertakes, entirely
apart fromn the subsidy or the guarantee,
to impose a condition caming within the
domain of property and civil rights, which
is only within the competence or authority
of the provinces of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-The hion, gentleman
is not serious in that.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I am. Could
the parliament of Canada step in and say
that the Canadian Pacific railway should
psy a fixed wage to its men? I submit
not. That is purely a matter o! contract,
and, therefore, can be only deait with by

SENATE
the provinces of Canada. I arn also opposed to the introduction of this kind of
legisiation. interfering manifestly with the
domestie economy of railways. They ahould
be free to administer their own internai
manageme nt as to the manner of payment.
As my hon. friend from Montreal has said,
there are no organizations superior to the
organized labour associations employed on
railways, end yet there is not a tittie of
evidence before parliament that any of the
organizations has asked for an amendment
of this character. We know perfectly well,
from keeping in close touch with public
affairs, and particularly with affairs touching the administration àf railways, that
immediately there is a grievance on the
part of railway employees, that grievance
is remedied as soon as it arises, and if
this is working out the injury that my hon.
friend has pointed out, and which hie has
so pathetically described, surely they would
have asked for rcdress long ago.
As has been pointed out by my hon.
friend £rom Belleville. this la not susceptible of practical application. Takc the
case of the Grand Trunk Pacifie, on its
eastcrn section this amendment would not
apply, because it does not re¶ccive a subuidy or guarantee. Part of the prairie
section would corne within the Bill, but
on.the branches, which have flot received
aid from the Dominion government but
from the provincial legisiatures, it would
not apply. The men ta whom it is intended to apply work on ail three. IIow
are we going to dissociate one from the
other? How are we going to dissociate
those portions of the road where it wili
apply from those portions where it will not
apply? The samne thing may be said o!
the Canadian Northern raiiway, which is
a trunk systt'm and being rapidly constructed from the Atlantic to the Pacifie.
On the main line running through British
Columbia this Act would flot apply. That
portion o! the road bas flot received
assistance from the Dominion govern.
ment; but it bas received assistance froin
the provincial government. Borne o! the
employees will Tun from one end o! the
road to the other and will work on sections
of the road on which it 'would not apply
and ether sections on which it would
apply.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. JONES-The province
Manitoba is in the sarne position.

of

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-The saine thing
would apply on the subsidiary roads which
work in- conjunction with the trunk systems.
This is the most ill-suggested piece o! legislation I have seen introduced into parliament. And it seems to me the sponsor o!
this Bill bas flot considered it. I do flot
refer to my hon. friend in this House; it
bas corne to us from the House of Commons, and I say the sponsor of this Bill
bas not considered many of 'the ramifications int whieh this legisistion must seek
to enter. I think, under the circurnstances,
that this Chamber should flot approve o!
the principle o! the Bill and it shouid not
have a second reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I do flot agree
with'my hion. friend when hie affirms that
we have no jurisdiction to deal with such
a matter. My conviction is that ail railways which are the creation of this parliament and under its control can be regulated, even in such details as these, by us if
we choose to do so; but I agree with him
when hie thinks that this Bill wii be quite
unworkable. Before reading it I thought
it covered -ail railways under the jurisdiction o! Canada, excepting the Intercolonial railway, an exception which, for
my part, I would not favour. I have no
objection to sending this Bill to the Railway Committec in order to ascertain if
there is reaily a grievance which could be
rernedied. I would not be bound by the
semblance of principle that may be found
underiying this Bill.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I had flot the
opportnnity cf being prefent when this
Bill was in Cornrittee, but rny attention
having been dire cted te clause 123, and
having given sorne little consideration to
it, particularly in view of, the interests
involved, I feel that I arn warranted in.
making some observations upon the drastic
nature cf the legislatîen which it contemplates.
One has te consider, in the first place,
the origin cf this legislatioia. I arn warranted in sayin'g that At is the outcorne of
public agitation which bas prevailed over
the northwest for some few years. Concession after concession has been wrung
from the government and chrystallized into
law. I arn not criticising that legislation.
I think it is of a salutary character in
rnost'respects; but experience and observation teach us that legisiation resulting
frorn public agitation is alrnost invariably
of a drastic and revolutienary character.
A public agitation of the kind te which
I bave alluded usually results in gross injustice being done to rnany interests xvhich
have net the opportunity of presenting
their case before parliament, and impressing a careful consideration cf such legislation. 1 flnd this to be the case in connection with two sections of the Bill under
discussion. For rnany yrars the gove'rn-

ment lias given its authority te private corporations te do a particular class
et work throughout that western country.
The developrnent cf that country has been
of a most extraordinary dharacter. It mnust
net only pass through the experimental
stages of business, but it mnust gain its
experience by reason cf the business which
izso5 largely done, and done more or less
inl a very crude way. As I have said, the
governrnent has placed its sanction upon
many companies doing a very large business in that country. We have at least
between Lake Superior and the base af the
Rocky Mountains sorne eighteen hiundred
country elevators, and about a dezen terminaI elevaters situated at Port Arthur
and Fort William. Owing te the very rapid
developrnent et the prairie country, hon.
gentlemen can appreciate the tact that the
developrnent of the elevator business necessarily became a very important factor,
marching parallel se toe peak, with
the development cf the country; and
in the development et the elevator systemn
the country elevator and the terminal elevator went hand in hand. Persons interested in country elevators found it necessary in the course et their business to
build terminal elevaters, as a railway cernpany finds it necessary te have terminal
facilities, without which it would be impossible te give proper. attention te transportation. There is really ne distinction
between a raiiway having terminal tacilities and a line of country elevators having
its terminal tacilities. We 'find it alleged
that certain trauds were committed in the
terminal elevators. From the inquiry which
I have been able te make, those trauds
were net investigated te the extent cf oi.,r
being able te determine wherein the
trouble lies. For the purpose et facilitating the working et the commission, and the
duty cast upon certain officiais, I understand some terminal elevaters pleaded
guilty, tancying that the resuit would bc

which are involved in this business. This
clause 1M,. I pronounce to be of the most
revolutionary character which 1 have ohserved in any statute passed by the parliament of Canada. For instance, At proposes to entirely divorce the company
owning the terminal elevator from ownerslip of or interest in the country elevator.
It proposes te entirely disqualify the man

statute-book is a most abundant measure
in the way of permitting a goverument to
appoint officiais te eniorce the policy of
the Act and, in my judgment, without
casting any refiections, or to be personal
in the matter, it surely must be the fault
of the gevernment officiais, if with the
abundant miachinery which we to-day have
upon the atatute-book, the grain trade cannet be properly protected. But I go further
than that; I arn in hasmony and approve
cf the policy cf the Bill except as to the
very drastic measure represented by these
two sections.
Let me instance another case. Here is
a large industry in the town cf Peterborough, known as the Quaker Oats industry.
The gentlemen who own that large industry, whi ch is a very important factor
in the building up cf the town cf Peterborough, and I cite this as an instance
because there a-re similar cases, have invested a large amount cf capital for the
development cf that industry, and that bas
inured te the profit cf the farmers cf the
country. -These gentlemen would be called
upon either te seli their interests in that
large industry and attach themselves exclusively te their terminal eleva-tors, or te
continue Wo hold that profitable industry
in Peterborough and sacrifice their interests
in the terminal elevators. Now, is it in the
public interest that that should be done?
It would be a refiection upon the intelligence of the people cf Canada. It would
be a refiection upon our legal machinery,
upon the officers charged with the carrying ont cf the statute law cf the country

SENATE
authority to carry on and conduct the
business of a terminal eltevator in accordance with the law.' I do flot think this
clause gaes far enough. It should be pot
only in accordance with the law, but in
accordance with the regulations made by
the commission and approved by the Gavernor in coundil. The subjects upan which
rules and regulations may be made by the
Board should be better defined. That
should be made a distinct and separate
clause, and, if properly drafted, power will
be given the Board ta make regulations
covering the whole subject. This would
do away with the necessity for clause 123.
For clause 242 1 would substitute a clause
less drastic, but which would go far enough
and impose a high penalty, or even provide
for imprisonment for disregarding either
the provisions of the law or any rules or
regulations adopted by the Board. If the
Bill were amended in that way, it would
fully carry ont the object the government
has in view and would reasonably protect
ail vested interests. This clause 123,' as
the hon, leader of the opposition said,
taken in conjunction with clause M4, really goes too iar. It is confiscating, so
ta
speak, praperties of very large value and
without any evidence that it is necessary
for the purpose of attaining the abject
which the government has in view in this
Bill. On gaing over the Bill, I find there
are diff erent provisions which confiict with
one another. I am referring -now to some
clauses which we have passed. lIn one
clause one thing is provided, and in another another provision is made for the
same subject. The attention of the law
clerk should be called ta these different
clauses so that they may be harmonized,
and I think also that the Bill would gain
a great deal by different arrangement.
The classifications are not what they
should be.
I perfectly understand that
this is re-enacting laws which have been
on the statute-book, and which may not
have been sufficiently matured in the
past, and the party who drafted the Bill
followed these clauses and added other
clauses which were intended ta improve
the Bill, but which really makze it less
clear than it should be. I hope the right

Hanse will see his way ta accept the su-Hon. Mr BEIQIUE.

gestion which has just been made by the
hon. leader of the opposition, and refer
the Bill ta a special committee. I have no
doubt that such a committee wiil do what
is necessary ta clothe the commission intended ta be created with ail necesaary
powers, sa that the abject the goverument
has in view may be attained without oppressing anybody.
Hon. Mr. McHTJGH-I desire to put myself on record as being opposed ta what I
consider the very draatic legialation in the
two clauses 123 and 242. I do flot often
rise ta thrust my views on thia honourable Hanse, but in looking over this question I have come ta the conclusion that it
is legislation which is nat in the interesta
of the people of Canada. I am fully satisfied that it is not ini the interest of the
farrning conimunity of the northwest,
althoug-h it is the farmer that the government have taken under their paternal care
in the legislation they have introduced
here. Probably their principal object is
ta maintain a high standard of grades for
aur Canadian wheat, but they already have
standards for many varieties of grain. Sa
long as the grain la inspected by their
officers and kept up ta that standard, I
cannot see why the owner of grain should
be prohibited from mixing his wheat as he
pleases. Speaking of country elevators and
terminal elevatars, the one man or the one
campany may own several country elevators
where they buy grain, and from which
they send it ta their own terminal elevatar. They are allowed ta mix it in the
country elevators as they please, but not
at the terminal elevator where they *have
better facilities for mixng. Grain bas ta
be classified by the government, and why
the government should say: 'We wi]l not
allaw yau to use the terminal elevators ta
mix your grain,' I cannot understand.
I hope this BlIl will go ta a special committee where it can be amended, and where
probably I might have an opportunity of
stating my views better than I feel I cati
do iL in this Chamber. Another effect 1
thînk iL will have, is, it will divert the

allowing it ta came east and west through

was alIl threshed out in the Housa
o! Gommons. The men who were in control o! those companies had to admit that
they had no legal right to proceed on any
such principle; that tbey were violating
the Dominion Act when they did Bo, and
that was the first thing that broke up the
elevator monopoly .and allowed the producers to seil their grain on the track at
what they thouglit was a juat price. Thiese
things bave changed; but hiere are difficuItics o! another kind arising, and you have
mnen ahipping out hal! a million bushels
o! grain o! a certain quality more than
they have bought in o! that quality. If the
trade enables a man to do that as a merchant or an exporter, lie lias defrauded
somebody. I stand by that point. He
eitber did not give proper value for the
lower grades, or hie failed to do justice
when hie sold. One of them was bonest
enough to say to me that lie had bought in
seven or aiglit grades, and sent out only
tbree or four.
Hon. Mr. BAIRD-Than the government
inspection is no good.
Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS--This Bill aims at
making sucli practice a criminal act, and
80 there will ha a restraint put on the
exporter or dealer to compel honest and
straightforward dealing. I like the Bill
very mucb, but if anything can be done
to iake it more lenaient or more free and
at the same time pr.otect vested rights of
the large number of gentlemen engaged in
the business, I amn not an iconocst. I
do not wisb to destroy men's business. I
want to build it up, and I should be very
glad to spend a week in listening to the
different parties giving their 'views, in order that all riglits may be protected ar*d
the business of our country conserved and
establisbad. I read the Bill, before the
last recess, with a good deal of care, and
I feit tbat while it was somewhat drastic,
nothing but drastic measures were like]y
to secure tbe justice for which wve are
looking.
Hon. Sir MACKENýZIE, BOWELL-Considering the magnitude o! the interests involved in this Bill, it would be well to
sulimit it to a small committea for careful

SENATE
tonsideratjon as to how it would effeet
trade and transportation if put in opéra'tien. The government has but one abject
in view i n the introduction of this measure, and that is ta protect flot anly the
farmer and the dealer, but the interest of
the country itself. The question is one of
great importance in connection with the
grain trade of the country. The rapidity
with which the northwest has been settled,
.Lnd the immense production of grain in so
short a period, demand ail the attention
and consideration that the government
tan bestow upon it. I may mention a precedent; the right hion, gentleman knows
thst when we had the important measure
affecting banks brought before us for
tonsideration ten years ago, the government submitted the nieasure to a
committee
for considération, and
al
interested in the subject were -iven
un opportunity to bc heard. 1 do flot know
that 1 could give you a better illustration
of the effect of referring a government
measure to a committee than that of the
Life Assurance Bill. The government came
to the conclusion that wrongs were being
tommitted constantly under the then existing law. The matter was reïferred Vo
judges and ta a special commission. After
they had made their-report, it was then
brought before the flouse of Gommons. A
governinent measure was introduced, and
it received the consideration of the House
of Commens foi oiîe. wlole fflsion. Thýý
flouse did not came Vo a final decîsion on
thé measure that session, and it was postponed for further consideration until the
following session. Thon it ýwas re-introduoed, but not in the House of Gommonsit was introduced in the Senate and referred ta a' com.mittee.
That committee
,devoted over a month's time and consideraVion Vo the different clauses of that Bill.
The committee met sorno 30 or 35 ines.
Every clause was fullv. considorod, and,
after it had been reported back to this
flouse, the amended Bill w-as adopted
with only one or two slight axùiendments
IV was then sent to the Hou-se of Gommons,
where it was adopted, wviVh, I think, only
one mînor amendment. The Bill now before us involvos an interest almost equal
ta that of the Insurance Bill. I hiesitate
xioV ta say that if the Insurance Bill as
Hlon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL.

introduced origînally, coming from the
legal cammittee that reported upan it, had
been placed en the statute-book, you would
have found few lufe ixisurance campanies
in existence to-day, because the provisions
cf the *Bill were of such a drastic character
that no man would have sat upon the
Board of an insurance company as hie b,came responsible for the acta of every
agent, fia matter who hie was or where lie
was located. Every one knows that in the
introduction cf a measure of this kind.
the government can have but one desire,
and that is to protect the investor in the
lands, the producer of the wheat, and those
who have invested in elevatars. 1 ani surprised ta learn that there are in the provinces west cf Ontario fia leas than 1,866
elevators. Add Vo that fitteen in Ontario
and four belonging ta the milling coinpanies and elevators in the ather provinces, and you have a total number cf
elevators in the Dominion at the present
time cf 1,909. When 1 consider the number
of elevatars bufit by private capital, I
must conclude that millions af dollars are
involved in the passing cf this Bill. Being
convinced that the right hion. Minister cf .
Trade and Commerce has in view the protection ai the different interests, without
confiscating the properties of those who
have made investments, I -arn satisfied
that hie will accede to the request ta send
this Bill Vo a committee where. it can be
caluily and deliberately considered. If that
committee malces a recommendation which
the government think is too drastic or not
drastic enoug-h, or net in the interest of
those who have monoy invested, or that
it does not provide proper protection for
the farmers, then Vhey can either reject
that recommendation or thcy con 'so amend
the Bill as to effect the abject they have
in vieiv. I am noV preparod myself Vo ondorse all the ag-itation that has beon made.
We know how easy it is for a community
or for a class of mon Vo raise objections to
the enforceinent of any mesure, and we
know how apt Vhey are Vo complain if these
measures are not enforced Vo such a degree
as Vo meet their particular ideas and iiitoreats. 1 arn very much impressed wvith
wvhaV bas heen said in this discussion, and
I trust that the right lion. leader af the
government in this flouse will accept the

MARCH 15, 1911
suggestion which hes been made, to refer
the Bull to a committee of legal and practical men engeged in the carrying trade of
this country, and in the production of the
grain itself. I venture this opinion Without discussing the merits of the Bull in
detail, and whether the governiment will
accept the suggestions which. have been
made 1 do not know, but I was very much
impressed with the practicai observations
of the hon. gentleman from Lindsay (Hon.
Mr. McHugh), upon this question, aithough it was more on a matter of detail
than the point which. bas been so strongiy
urged upon the House by my hon. friend
on my leit <Hon. Mr. Lougheed).
Hon. Mr. WATSON-This matter bas
been fairly threshed out iii a general way.
1 agree with the hon. gentleman who has
just resumed his seat that we should refer
this matter to a speciel commiittee. Otherwise the members of this House cen hardly
becomne possessed of the intricate working
of the handling of grain in order to deel
with this subject intelligently. I believe
we ought to have expert evidence not only
from. the gentlemen interested in terminel
elevators, but from the producers of grain,
who have an organization, and no doubt
cen be heerd before that committee. One
or two statements have been made here
which I tbink are rather misleeding. The
hion. gentlemen from. Saskaethewan (Mir'
Douglas) referred to the fact that our high
grade wheat was dameged by the mixing
of impure wheat with it. According to the
Inspection Act-and I have neyer heard
that it hec been ebused-no smutty wheet,
no matter how treated, cen be put in eny
higher grade than No. 3, Northern, so that
it does flot go into any higher grade, and'
I do not think any charge that it bas been
placed in a higher grade has been substantieted. The saine remark applies to
sulphured and bleeched wheat. There is
e system pursued et the present time-end
I do not know how you will prevent it in
future if this legisiation is passed-by
which our wheat is degreded between Winnipeg and Fort William. By being degrad.
ed I meen that the best samples o! certain
grades are picked out by the milling coinpenies of the west, after the wheat is inspected et Winnipeg and before it arrives

357

at Fort William, and the resuit is that the
average grade of wheat that cornes out of
the bins in Fort William cannot possibiy
be as good as the average grade of wheat
inspected at Winnipeg. There is probably
a difference of two or three cents a. bushel
spread between No. 1 and No. 2 Northern,
and about the saine between No. 2 and
No. 3. The miller hec the opportunity of
seeing the sampies thjat are drawn from
the cars et Winnipeg and probably he
wouild pick out a sample of wheat out of
No. 2 Northern and that is worth a cent
and a hall! or two cents a bushel more thian
the average of that bin; it is almost up to
No. 1. It wiIl not grade No. 1, but it wvill
grade an extra good No. 2. H1e picks thet
car-load out and in this way the millers
go ail along- the line, and select the best
samples of the giades of wheat alter inspection et Winnipeg, and those cars are
turned bis' way by the time they gct t(
Fort William. Thet practice preveils now
and will prevail as long as that systemi is
adopted and it cen only be prevented by
one mea*ns, and that is by establisbinz a
sample market.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-Does the hion.
gentleman say that the sampie taken et
Winnipeg is always higher than the cernpie taken et the terminal?
Hon. Mr. WATSON-The wheat is graded
No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3, Northern, and thiese
samples are ehl selected there from the
cars. They ere open for inspection. 1
go in and pick out the best of No. 2. .I
let the rest go on to Fort William. I buy
the best semple and divert it to my oiva
elevator or miii, and it does flot go into the
average of the grain et Fort William. The
result is that the average of a train load
et Fort William is not as good as the average et Winnipeg. Aniother class of wheat
wve have in the western country, in wvhicb
the inillers above ail others are interested
ini having a monoply of purchasing and
grinding, is the off-grades, and I believe,
the west is iosing more money in the offgrades of wheat on account of not having
competition in the sale of the(se grades
than they lose in the higher grades. In
the high grades there may be a littie. mixin,-, and 1 must say from some practical

SENATE
knowledge of the grain and milling business of the west, that I amn not very much
opposed to the mixing. If a farmer wants
to mix his grain, and makes more money
in that -way than lie could otherwise,
then he mixes it. If a farmer has one car
of extra bard No. 1 and two cars of not very
good, or of extra good No. 3 hard* wheat.
or No. 3, Northern, he can mix those cars
together, and make it ail grade No. 2
Northern, and wlien he does that he gets
for it the price of No. 2 Northern. I arn

same thing, because the .inspector inspects
the wheat as ag-ainst an unwilling purchaser. He must inspect the wheat into
the bin, so that an unwilling purchaser
wilI have to take that grade on the inspection out of the bin. H1e keeps the
grade pretty well up. If a man is buying
No. 2, Nortbern, worth 80 cents a bushel,
why should he gc't wheat that is worth 82
cents? As long as he gets the grade No.
2, Nortbern, that is what he bas paid for,
and that is wbat be gets, and I amn not so
sure that it would not be better for the
west if the elevators were allowed to mix
the grain and make the best grades tbey
can, just the samne -as any farmer or anybody else selling bis goods. However, thiinspection outward is maintaining the
grade there. One of the reasons w'hy
w-e bave the 'legisiation 'before us is
that tbe elevators at Fort William did
admit some wrong-doing and infringement of the Inspection Act. Tbey paid a
fine of some $5,000. It is claimed by those
gentlemen that they shoulâ flot have paid
it. Prohably if the Bill is referred to a
special cornmittee we shall get some evidence on that point. They claim there wvas
a shortage of certain grades in their bins.
We must remember that at the tirne there
vas a supposed shortage, it was on estimales of measuring the bins. It is claimed
by those gentlemen that when they took
stock and the grain was actually weighed
that there wua not that shortage, and that
the charge could not bave been proved if
the stock had been taken. Tbey could not
take stock, and they measured the bins and
averaged up and estimated their shortage.
We may bear something about that as
we]l. While we are prepared to say that
Hon. 1Mr. WATSON.

the reports made by the farmers should
have every weight and consideration-and
I arn in full sympathy with that side of
do flot believe any elethe case ;I
vator company could handie a terminal
elevator, that is, ini the ordinarv marýket, competitors should not' have a terminal elevator. If I arn buying wheat
in the open market for export., and I want
to ship that wheat, 1 do flot think it is
fair that I should ship it to a competitor
on the market. It would not be expected
that I should get a square deal if my competitor is going to ha.ndle my grain at the
terminal, beeause we know he has opportunities for doing things which should flot
be done. I wîll flot charge those men with
doing it, but that is the principle the government is working on. They are going to
try -and make those elevator people independent of the men who are buying
grain in the open market.
1 trust that the hon. gentleman who has
charge of the Bill, will let it go to a subcommittee, where not only the elevator
interests but the farming interests and the
grain interest generally can be heard. It
is one of the most difficuit Bis to frame
that we could possibly have before us.
For years we have thought that we were
perfecting legiÉiation -to do away with
ail the wro.ngs that were complained
of in the west. 1 remember during ni%
very first eession in parliam ent, away backý
in 1883, that we had to do with this grain
business and it bas been deait with ever
since, with regard to making grades, the
înethod of unloading on the platforms and
at elevators. Two years ago uve passed legisiation to appoint government inspectors
at the terminais, and we then thought we
liad solved the problem. We find now that
evefl government inspectors cannot control
the situation, and something else is being
suggested. Sometimes I arn inclined Io
think that we have too much special legislation, and that we should leave thesc
things open to free competition. I believe
the systemn that should prevail is that t1i
railway companies sbould own and control the terminal elevators at Fort Williamn
and Port Arthur, and if they did we would
have none of this trouble. It was suggesteA1 by my hon. friend from Saskatchewan (Mr. Douglas) that the railway com-

MAfRCH 15, 1911

panies in their terminal elevators started
the mixing cf grain. I muet eay that 1
neyer heard of it, and it is entirely nevv
te me. I do net believe that the railwav
cempanies 'aire interested in mixing grain
at the terminals. I believe that if the terminais were owned, controlled and operated by »the railway cempanies, we %vould
have none cf this trouble about mixing at
the terminals, for the reason that the
amount cf money that they could make by
it would be of no consequence te a railway corporation. Even if they went inte
the system cf mixing, they would net get
much eut of it. In the western country
we have a few colonization roads. Ther
we have the Grand Trunk Pacific, the Canadian Northern and the Canadian Pacifie
railway, ail ceming te Fort WVilliani and
Port Arthur, sud the resuit is that thý
average fermer or grain dealer in the west
The

railway companies get from ten te fifteer.
cents freight per bushel, and they are muc'i
more interested in getting the grain routed
by their road than in manipulating the
grain at the terminale. The délégation that
came down f rom the west a few monthago actually went eut cf their way te pay
the Canadiari Pacifie Railway terminal
elevator a'-compliment. It îs the on1ç
terminal elevator owned and controlled by
a railway corporation, and they were paid
* compliment by that delegatien; they selected it as one cf the elevators-where
they got a square deal. The Grand Trunk
Pacifie has net handled much grain yet.
The large terminal elevator belonging
te the Canadian Northern railwav is leased te a grain company. A gentleman will
be before the cemmittee who represents
that interest. I thiuk it was a mistake fothe raiiway cempanies te shlow these terminais te get eut of their hauds. I de not
think the governmeut liad anything te do
with it. Probably they could nlot prevent
it. Op~e cf the troubles is that the elevatorz
have gai into the hands cf the grain ceinpanies. If they hsd got into the hands of
the transportation companies, there would
have been no complaints lu the iiorthwest
as far as handling grain at the terminais
la concerned. I trust that an able committee will be appeinted before whom net euhthe very large interests handling grain et

the terminais will be able to appear, but

getting a square deal..
Hon. Mr. -CAMPBELL-I désire to add
my views te the reasons that have been

great deal has been said as te the drastic
nature of clauses 123 andl 949. Rnd te se
extent 1 agree with the sentiment that
these clauses are very severe. I have bef ore me a letter from the secretary of the
Dominion Millers' Association, in Toronto.
He wrote me yesterday about this, and
says: 'I sincerely hope that yen wil
strongly oppose any amendment being made
to the two clauses you have mentioned,
Nos. 123 and 242, till euch time as those in
faveur of these clauses have an opportunity of presentîng their viewvs before the
members of the committee. It is hardly
fair that the Senate should act on representatiens from one side only.' They are
a very important body in the province of
Ontario, handling enormous quantities cf
What
Manitoba and Northwest grain.
their objections are te any amendment te
these two clauses 1 do net know. It seems
te me that the clauses are very drastic,
and 1 would be i faveur of amending them
in the line suggested by the hon. member
from Montreal (Hon. Mr. Béique) or in
some 'other way; but it is only fair that
these men on the «opposite side should be
heard and have an eppertunity cf presenting their views te the committee. I give
the governnient a great deal of credit for
this Bill. We have been legislating now
for 20 or 30 years in reference te the handling and transportation and marekting the
grain of the Northwest. 'Year by year we
find some weak spots and we impreve them.
Two years age we thought we had reachcd
the end; but we find more weak spots have
developed, and now this Bill has been
brought in, the purnose of which is te still
more _perfect the system that we have. Pnssibly this measure will net be the end cf
it. After we have established this commission, we may find that there will be further amendments required; and they will
have te be made. That la what we are here
for. I have very strong views on this, questien, and 1 mnust say that I differ very

SENATE
much from the hon. member from Marquette <Hon. Mr. Watson) in reference
te mixing grains. I do flot believe the government should ailow he mixing of inspected grain. If I have 40 or 50 elevators and buy
wheat from the farmers, I can mix that
grain just as I please. I paid for it; it is
nobody's business what I do with it. I
can throw it ail in one bin or keep it
separate and nobody has a right te say
anything to me? But when I send that
grain forward and ask the governinent to
put their officiai atamp upon that grain
as No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3 Northern, my
right ceases and I have no right tQ
mix the grain afterwards and shouid
flot be aflowed te do so. Let the grain
be inspected as No. 1 Northern, and go
into the terminal elevator as No. 1 Northern
and go to the markets of the world under
that grade; but once you open the door and
allow men te manipulate the grain that
has been inspected and try to raise iower
grades up to higher grades then you open
the door for ail kinds of rascality, and it
would be impossible for one thousand
inspectors te prevent the wheat from being
deteriorated. The great cry we fiave now
is, as a gentleman toid me, if you get a
sample of No. 1 Northern soid in Europe
and compare it with No. 1 Northern as soid
in Winnipeg, you would hardly know il,
there is so much difference. We have. instances on record where grain has been
mixed improperiy in terminal- elevators,
and that should not be ailowed under any
circumstances. It is better for the farmers
and for everybody that it should be
stopped.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-What about transfer
elevaters P
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-Mix nowhere,
either at transfers or terminai elevators.
If you allow a dealer to mix grain in a ter?ninal elevator and slip it out, theni I
vould like te know how it is possible to
înspect it where the grain is in bins 70 feet
deep, and where it goes into the boat at the
rate of 40,000 busheis an ihour, at a speed
of a mile a minute. It can be inspected in
the cars. The inspector goes into the car,
puts his spear away down in a hall a dozen
places and brîngs up samples, and he can
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

inspect it; but how can he inspeet it when
it is being loaded into a boat at 40,000
bushels an hour, and a mile a minute?
The object and aim of this Bill, and I entirely approve of it, is that there shall be
no mixing cf that grain once the government has placed their stamp upon it, and
made it No. 1, 2, 3 or 4 Northern. It-shouid
go to the markets of the world under that
înspector's certificate, and no tampering
should be allowed, no mixing, -and no manipuiating whatever. I hope that the leader
of the government wiil aiiow this Bill to
go to the committee, where the various interests can be heard, and I arn sure we will
arrive at a solution cf the question much
more effectually, and ln a much better way
for ail concerned, than we can by discussion in the flouse.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS-I have aiready
expressed my views, and it is flot necessary
for me to reiterate themn further. I have
hieard 'within a day or two that the great
raihwaya are very much interested in this
question and desire to be heard, and I understand that outside the Bar of the House
at this very moment, another interest has
appeared, the mihiers cf the eastern part of
the country. I think there is the strongest
reason to suggest that this Bihl should go
to a select committee.
lit. Hon.. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Nobody las a better rigÈt to speak tsan
niy hon. friend from Ottawa, because he,
in the first instance, strongly advocated
sending this Bill to a speciai committee. I
have listened with very great interest to the
varions remarks. I regret that my hon.
friend the leader of the opposition was not
present while the other clauses of this
Bill were being put through committee.
I expresshy reserved these two clauses 123
and 242, because of the great importance of
the question he raised. It was new legislation. The rest of the Bill, with the exception of the first part, is mereiy a reenactmcent of the existing iaw. There are
no materiai alterations. In most cases, the
changes are merehy verbal alterations, substituting board and commission for the
terms heretofore used. I was not disposed
to refer the whoie Bill to a special committ.ee, chiefly by reason of the immense nurn

MARCH 15, 1911
ber of clauses and the apparent fact that
there was ne need of discussing the legislation already in force. It was the new
legislation we were to put in force. I arn
disposed to meet the views of rny hion.
friends, having fully considered the matter,
and hearing the requests preferred by various important interests to be heard before
the comrnittee, I am disposed to meet it
as far as they themselves really can desire,
by referring these clauses whîch. have been
kept over, and whîch if you examine the
Bill minutely you wül see are really th
only clauses which can be fairly calle
contentions, because I believe there was a
unanimous concurrence on the part of the
House that the other clauses establishing
a commission should pass without any alteration. No hion. gentleman on either aide
has raised any objection to what is known
as part first. Now, ail I wouid suggest to
the House is this: in view of lI these circumstances, and in view of the fact expressed by se many hon. members, a
desire that ail parties concerned should
have an opportunity of stating their
views, I would not object to, referring the
clauses 123 and 242, to a special committee who ceuld sit, I presume de die in diem,
and I preaume they 'would not object to
report to this House within a reasonable
time and let themn give every opportunity
to, aIl parties to state their views in full.
The commjttee, cf course, would be open
to every member of the Senate who takes
an intereat in this matter to be present,
and I thinki the rules of our committees

please.
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-They have the samne

as te voting.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-That I understood te be the rule of our
lieuse. If that will mneet the views cf mv
hon. friends opposite, I amn disposed te
concur, and shail move for the placing ei
these twe clauses in the hands cf a special committee; but Ithink it would be as
welI that the cemmittee should confine itself, chiefly at any rate, te the taking of
evidence and reperting the evidence te the
lieuse. With respect te any arnendments
that they or any hon. gentleman here may

desire to make to the Bill, 1 suggest, as 1
have suggested on other occasions, that the
best way to deal with that is to place the
amendments which they desire to move on
the Order Paper se that we rnay have a
'fuil opportunity of examining them, and
then when we corne to the stage of the third.
reading of the Bill, the House canl be
moved back inte committee and any amendments that are agreed to can be inserted.
Wil that meet my hon. friend's views?
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Yes, it is quite
satisfactory.
Rt. Hon. Sir RLICHARD LARTWRIGWI
-Then I shahl meve that these clauses,
which I may say are rea]ly the onlly disputatious clauses-that is 123 and 242 be
referred to a special cemmittee composecl
of Hon. Messrs. Loug-heed, Young, Davis,
Douglas, Xirchhoffer, Talbot, Power and
B&xque.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I woul suggest that
clause 122 should go with 123, because At
might render it easier to deal with 123 if
122 were considered at the samne time.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-If the hion. gentleman thinks it is interwoven with it I have no objection. I desire to limit it te the clauses I have mentioned because there are an immense number of clauses in the Bill which are working very we]l, and I do not want to disturb those. Moreover, it mnight lead to a

question raised by my lion. friend goes to
the root of the principle. This is an exceedingly cemplicated question, and. the
steps which have been taken have only
been taken after very long and careful
examinatien, and after finding that the
modes of inspection heretofore in use werv
insufficient to cope with the reseurces of
the gentlemen who have been engag-ed in
eperating the terminal elevators. No one
is better qualified to speak on that subject
than the hion. member from York (Mr.

experience and knows how those things
are done.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Do I understand
that the hon. gentlemen from North York~
had been engaged in those manipulations?

SENATE
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-No, but hie knows how they are doue.
At any rate, 1 think the House will agree
with me that my hon. friend's point was
well taken, that while prior to government
inspection any man is f ree to do what he
pleases, after government inspection it is
quite a different thing, whether lie shou!d
be allowed to mix government inspected
wheat of -1, 2 and 3 grades at his own sole
pleasure. However, we desire particularly

he said the amount really imparted into the

insidious poisons of this kind to be imported into a country it is absolutely imipossible to check it. In Quebcc, they originally passed a very stringent Act, but
they have modified it to -suit soine wholesale druggists. You cannat surround a law
of this kind with sufficient safeguards ta
completely enforce it.
The government
ought to take power to &top the importation into the country. So long as you import two tons into the country, where
drachms and grains are sufficient, it will
be put to an improper use. I draw attention -ta the futility of this class of leisiation unless you prohibit it.

I suggest that words ahould be introduced
making it clear to the ordlinary reader that
this is a crime, and consequently will corne
under the Criminal Code.
I think it is
desirable because the province of Ontario
bas legislated on some five different occasions li connection with the subject matter
of this Bill. There is a chapter on the subject in the last edition of the Revised Statutes, and that chapter has been amended
about four times. It is well, therefore, that
we should. instead of undertaking to interfere with their legislation, strengthen and
back them up. Similar legishation has just
been passed by the legishature af Quebec,
and we shouhd make this offence a crime.
I trust the right hon. gentleman vrilh allow

aware that the hon. member from Halifax
had brought this matter up. If he did, it
has escaped my recollection. If he gave
notice ai it, of course that is another matter. That is one of the reasons why it 15 s0
very desirable tha.t notice should be given
in writing. I have observed a great deal of
legisiation introduced, flot in this House,
but in other places, in the Committee of the
Whole, which was put in and which sornetimes confused the other clauses of the Bill
ta an extraordinary extent, and I remember
very well seeing a report ai a very eminent
judge in England in whieh, in reviewing
certain legisîstion, he observed that clause
which had been introduced ln this way,
appeared to have dropped in from Heaven
or some other place into the Act, without
the slightest reference ta any of the other
clauscs thereof. I do not at all pretend ta
say that my hon. friend would introduce
any such clause. He is a lawyer ai high
degree and would see that they harmonized;
but what 1 ask-and 1 think it is a reasonable request-is that in a government
Bill, when any important alteration is desired, (I arn not speaking ai verbal ones),
we should have a littie notice ai them.

THE SENATE DEBATES.
Hon. Mr. POWER-flefore the Orders of
the~ Day are gone into, I wish to cali the
attention of the House to the very unsatisfactory condition that exisa with respect
to the debates of the Senate. We are supposed to get the revised version of our
Debates within some three or four days o!
the delivery o! the unrevised version. We
did not get until about ten days ago any
of the revised version. The.,reason given
for that was that a speech delivered in
French by an hon, gentleman in moving
the address to His Excellency had not been
translated into English. That difficulty was'
removed some considerable time ago, and
ehortly after the removal of that obstacle
wve wvere favoured with two formes-32 pages
-of the revised debates, bringing the revised version down to the 24th of November. A very considerable time bas elapsed,
ten days or a fortnight, since these two
formes were delivered, and we have received nothing further. Now this is the
16th of March. Instead of 32 pages, I understand some 400 pages have been sent to
the printers, but we have nothing furtber
from the Bureau than the two formes. It
should be the duty of His Hon. the Speaker to instruct the Clerk to cail upon the
Printing Bureau to furnish what we have
a right to; and I think that is more important, because a -committee bas been
appointed to tonsider the Grain Bill and to
take evidence and have that evidence

The SPEAKER-I have always understood that the supervision of the printing
of the ' Debates was entrusted toa s pecial committee of this House, and I supposed, therefore, that it would be impertinence on the part o! the Speaker to interf ere. If the chairman of the committee is
here, I suppose hie can give un explanation. If not, perhaps sonme member of the

Hon. Mr. POWER-The committee canriot do anything with it. The committee
have seen that the reports have gone
promptly to the Printing Bureau and when
they have gone to the Printing Bureau, they
are really out of the juriadiction of the
committee. The Clerk probably is the proper officer to ascertain why this unaccountable delay bas taken place.

at present, for various reasons. to extend
the scope of the Bill beyond the provisions

it stands.

the investigation which has taken place in
British Columbia of late, that most of the

through bogus passports. What I intended to suggest, had I been here-and perhaps my hon. friend wvould flot have acceptcd it-was that it should be eonflned to
one person in Hong Kong or such port
from which Chinese immigrants might sail,
the consul general or minister, whoever it
might be, who represented The empire
there, as the only person with power to
issue these passports. By that means we
would avoid a great deal of the difficulties

years; but the question has only progressed
appreciably within the last quarter of a
century. I have no data as to the result
of the experiments which have been made
in the 'United States; but I know that in
a number of cities in England, among them
Hampton, Sutton, Exeter, Yeovil, Accrington, Leeds and more especially at Manchester, whieh las about the population
of Montreal to-day, large plants have been
put up for the biological treatment of sewage. I amn informed that those plants are not
costly nor is their maintenance. They have
in Manchester a large basin that recelves
the sewage, wlere it is brought to, a high
degree of fermentation, through the agency
of certain microbes, which bring about the
dissolution of orgatic matter. Those waters
are then transferred into filters, which are
covered by a bed of scoria or coke, peopled
with another different werld of microbes,
which rapidly turn the residuary organic
matter inte soluble nitrates or minerai
matter. Sewage so treated becomes fairly
harmless, and can be returned to the
streams or rivers. Manchester was thus
treating, eigbt or ten years ago, some three
hundred thousand cubic feet of sewage per
day. The plant put up in that city was
found to work satisfact-orily. I haveý no
data up to the present year. I arn quite
sure that it would be most interesting. to
know what has been the result of the experiments made up te date by the citici,
which have been working on this problem.
1 know that the sewage cf Paris has been
treated up te a few years ago, by being
sedimented on a very large area cf land,
and quite successfully, although an effort
has been made recently te purify the sewage cf that large city by biological treatment. Sorne few years ago the city of Lille
in France, wvhich is a very prosperous industrial northern town, was simply infected
with its own sewage, te the extent that
typhoid fever was threatening the whole
comrnunity. Although the saying is truc
that individual action is generally ineffectuaI as against the inertia of the masses,
and of the public bodies, yet there are exceptions te aIl rules and in Lille a citizen
was found with enough public spirit and
energy to undertake a campaign for the
purification of the streama which *were
being polluted above and through the city.

to cornply with the enactrnents containied
in this Bill.
Hon. Mi POWER-Every one must sympathize withl the hion. gentleman from, Ottawa in the efforts which hie ie making to
secure greater purity in the waters of our
rivers. At the saine time, I wish to preserve an open mind wîth respect to this
Bill. There are many difficulties standing
in the way of anything like an immediate
carrying into effect of a measure as drastic in its provisions as this. I think thio
committee to whomn this Bill will be referred
should be careful to hear evidence on both
sides of the question. Take for instance
the city which has been used as an illustration by the hion, gentleman frorn De
Lanaudière (Mr. Dandurand). In the first
place, the hion. gentleman referred to Rome.
Now, old Rome dîd flot get its water for
drinking- purposes from the River Tiber,
but brought it to a great extent, from lakes
in the Alban His; consequently the Romans did not suifer frorn typhoid as they
would have, had they drunk the polluted
waters of the River Tiber. The hion, gentleman referred at some ]ength to the city
of Manchester, and the impression made
upon the minds of his hearers would be that
the drinking water was taken from the*
rivera Irwell and Mersey whicn tiow by it.
That, hon. gentlemen, is net the case. The
drinkingu water which thE, people of Marichester use is brought from Thirîmere lake,

as the Ottawa, and every one of these littie
rivulets is liable to be polluted by the
soakage frorn stables and other sources of
corruption. These little rivuits which
run through a f arm. carry the contamination into a creek or larger strearn, and
it is thus carried on juta a river like the
Ottawa. It is not an effective remedy to,
put an end to the pollution at a city like
Ottawa. Unleas you secure the purity o!
the water before it cornes to the city, it
will not be effective. I think it is a work
that will take a great deal of time and
involve a very great expense, and wili
very considerably upset ail the arrangements which prevail among the farmers
and other people living in the neighbourhood of these rivera. I make these remarks, not because I arn unfriendly to the

no damage to any one. It is possible that
at this moment Ottawa may be suffering
from ita own sewage, but not from the sew;age of the towns above. The conditions of
the Ottawa. river are ideal. In a great
many places enorinous expense is gone to
in order to create just such an admirable
condition as exista at Ottawa for the ob.
taining of the very best character of water.
The ra'pids in the Ottawa river constitute
one of the very beat conditions. WVe have
several rapida a short distance above Ottawa, and the water goes into a large bay.
I arn quite sure that if any pollution exista that la doing damage to-day in the
city o! Ottawa, it ia by the city of Ottawa
itself, and not by the towna -above Ottawa.
The Ottawa river water is a splendid
water, and if the people are suffering today it is from their own f ault rallher than
the fault of others. Ottawa discharges its
own sewage into the river, and -immediately below the city the inhabitants are.
uaing the Ottawa river water and nothing
else for drinking purposes, and up to
date there has been no suffering below the
city, simply because of the large size o!
the stream, and because of its possibilitie6
of disposing of the aewage. But with the
larger population which Ottawa will contain in a few years, there may be danger
of pollution in seasons of very low water.
and it ia highly desirable that such a la"'
ahould be placed upon the statute-book
now. The Canadian people should wake
up to the danger that will exist when the
country is very rnuch more populous than
it is to-day. Therefore, I amn in syrnpathy
%vith the proposed law.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-How can the
sewage of the city of Ottawa get into the

was largely due, possibly, to the condition
of the season, when the river was extremely
iow, and decomposition of dead vegetable
matter asffected the drinking water; but we
have succeeded in entirely eiiminating typhoid in Fredericton by the introduction of
a filtration system, costing $5,000 or $6,000, and since that time typhoid fever lias
seldom, if ever, been known in the city. 1
amn satisfied that each city can proteet itself
by proper filtration of its water supply;

for a city the size o! Fredericton to have

Ottawa is thinking of doing the same thing.
A great misapprehension exists in s0 far

answer ta the problem, because it is not
only the inhabita.nts of cities that are

country around these cities. Suppose Montreal or Ottawa were ta get their supply
from the lakes, that would not help the
inhabitants in the neighbourhod of those

desire it to be; but it does not help Ottawa
ta blacken the character of Toronto or
Montreal. Therefore, I think the lion. gentleman, in pressing his argument, should
have confined himself to the citv of Ottawa and not try to cast a stone at the adjoining cities of Toronto and Montreal.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-i rise to
correct the opinion of the hion. gentleman
from Rideau division (Mr. Edwards) that
the rapids will remove the danger of pollution or reduce it. My reading on the
subject leads me to a very different conclusion. My attention wvas first drawn to
the bacillus of typhoid twenty-five years
ago, whenl an epidemic occurred on the
Schuylkiil river somne distance north ai
An outbreak- oî typhoid
Philadeiphia.
took place, and an extensive inquiry was
made, but they could not discover the
cause. Subsequently, some distance up the
river, it was found that a mnan had hiad
typhoid fever, and the excrement from the
patient was thrown on the bank of the
river in the spring of the year and it drifted down into the water supply and from
that single case this distribution of typhoid arase. It was quite recognized by
the bacteriologists that colon bacilli multiply, not by millions, but by billions.
Philadeiphia hias been spending more
money than any other city to secure a pure
water supply. Upon the Schuylkill, where
the population is dense, an effort lias been
made to discover the people who throw
excreta into the water. The evidence of
the extraordinary distribution of the bacilli came under my attention a short time
ago in an address delivered by Dr. Wyley,
who is recognized as one of the foremost
authorities on the subject in the United
States. He is at the head of the department in connection with health at Washington. He first referred to a case in Kentucky, where typhoid spread rapidly.
Efforts were made to discover the cause,
and for same time they were obliged to
give it up. Finally they thought of a well
some fifteen miles away that might possiblv be the guilty source. They decîded ta
i colour the waters of the well, and, some

MARCH 16, 1911

days after, waters slightly discoloured
from the tinting o! this well were found
on the surface of the earth. Lt had percolateq for fifteen miles through the earth.
They found out that the typhoid had corne
f rom that wefl. That is un instance showing the extraordinary dissemination of this
disease. There is abundance o! evidence
to the samne effect if hon. gentlemen choose
to look it up. Therefore, it is quite impossible for one city to protect itself unles
you make a general law, as is proposed in
this Bill. The pollution of the waters of
our towris and cities can be stopped; it is
a matter of money. They do it in
rey
many countries. The evidence given by
the hon. gentleman who introduced this
Bihl of wha-t has been done in Belgium
and other countries, where they have
not got the wealth or opportunities that
w-e have to carry out these reforms, goes
to show that it can be done here by the
adoption of the same simple methode. I
do not hesitate to say that a case o! typhoid
occurring one hundred miles up the Ottawa
river might distributre the disease in this
city. You cannot see the bacilli with a
powerful glass. Water might appear to be
'absolutely clear and yet contain millions;
therefore the effect of the bacilli once
getting into the water is most alarming.
Everybody admits that typhoid la a preventable disease. My own theory is perhaps.a littia too much advanced for most
people to appreciate. In a letter I sent to
the press yesterday I gave it gs my opinion, after many years of experience, that
we are immune to, bacihhi, if the condition of our system is normal.

bacilli will take effect. However, that is
a larger subject than I intend to speak of
just now. We are ail indebted to my hon.
friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) for introducing
this Bill. It is of the greatest importance
that somne solution should be .reached
through the federal and provincial goverfiments, so that in the future we shahl avoid
the pollution of our waters and streams.
The Ottawa river is one of the purest and
most wholesome bodies of water that we
have anywhere. I was sorry to notice that
Mr. Hazen is advising the people of Ottawa
to apply chemical treatment.to the Ottawa
i iver water. That, in my judgment, would
destroy its value as a watoer. The softer
the water the better it is for our bowels.
In the water cure systemn of treating diseases, you can bring about results with
rainwater that you could flot bring about
with waters of the St. Lawrence or the
upper lakes, because there is so mucu
minerai substances in thema. Under the influence of nure rainwater that cornes from,
heaven, the systema will act much better
than with any other water.

some time, when there was a great discussion among the s'cientific people o! that

amn very much afraid, however, that there
will be war between each village and small
town. Each one of them will want the

Hon. Mr. De VEBER-I have no serious
intention af speaking at any great length
upon this subject, 1 amn not gaing to touch
upon it from. a scientific point of view.
It was thoroughly discussed last session,
sa much sa that I think every member of
the House mnust be convinced that some
such legislation is not only absolutely
necessary, but. imperative. Just a few
words ta show what led up to the introduction of thîs Bill. Hon. gentlemen may
remember that some few years aga. on the
motion of the Han. Sir George Ross, several new committees were added ta this
Huse, one was known as the Committee
on Public Health and Inspection of Food.
The comimittee met and organized, and
being fully sensible of their duties, cast
about for some subject ta investigate. The
disposaI of sewoge by cities, tow.ns and
villages, and the pollution of streanis
seemed ta be a very burning question, and
it appealed to the comrnittee, and they decided to investîgate. They applied ta the
House for the power ta cite persaons. and
they asked for a small grant of money.
Bath of these were granted and they proceeded %viththe investigation. A number
of men prominent in their profession, who

MAPCH 16, 1911
had studied this subject ail their lives, appeared before the conmmittee. This evidence was considered of such a high character, and of such importance, that it was
erdered, by the House, to be printed, between the end of that session and the beginning of the next, when it was handed
in ini printed form. The hon. member for

plenty of time te take action. Our report
passed the House and was sent to the Conservatien Commission, and the hon. gentleman's Bill was sent with it. The commission were asked te take action, which
they immediately did, by calling a meeting
cf the. representatives cf the different provinces in Octeber last, at which I was
present. In ail conventions cf this kind
they divide tbemselves up inte sub-committees. One sub-cemmittee was on the pollution cf waters, and this is the report of the

health efficer of the province of Ontario,
and also by Mr. Wood, the representative
of Manitoba at that convention. So that
by the meeting of this convention held by
the Conservation Commission, you have
the opinion voiced by ail the provinces
that the Dominion government should pass
such legisiation as this in order that the
legilation shouid be uniform from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Without uniformity,
legislation cannot be effective. Before the
passage cf this Bill how do we stand in
regard to laws upen the subject? This Act
is nothing new. It is sisnply new as a
Dominion Act. If you look back in any
one of the Acts passed in regard to this
subject by the different provinces you will
find Iaws to prevent pollution. The Nova
Scotia Act provides:
No person shahl put in any place, on land
or wa'ter, any offensive matter or thing likely

to endanger the public health, under a penalty
flot exceeding twenty dollars for each offence,
and if atny person suifera any Guch matter or
thing to remain upon hie premises after notice
in writing requiring hlm to remove the sne,
the sanî'tary inspector may remove the samne,
under the direction of the local board and at
the charge of 'the owner or occupant of sucb
place.
The western provinces have ail made
similar provisions. The Alberta Act provides that:
When the construction, alteration6 or extension o! a common sewer or systemn of public
sewerage shall be contemplated by the, municipal councîl of any municipality, village, or
by any person or body corporate, such council,
person, or body corporate shall aubmit te the

in connection with the construction, alteration
or extension cf such common sewer or systemn
cf sewerage and in connection with the
purification and disposaI of the sewage.
Section 6 of the Ontario Act provides:
6. Noc sewage, domiestie or factory refuse.

Yen cannot empty anything into any cf

in the hands cf thse provincial healts
authorities power te prevent the pollution
cf rivers. But in ail these provincial Acts
there is some difference, and tise consensus
cf opinion of tise representatives of the
provinces that met here was that the laçw
should be made uniform, and the onhy way
it conhd be made uniform was by Dominion
legislation. Without any Act at ail, I preaume, under thse common law, the Dominion cf Canada, which practically controls
ail navigable streams, would have recourse
against the provinces whîch poli ute stieams
by allowing sewage te flow into navigable
waters. I think it is the iaw cf eminent
demain they caîl it, that wonld gîve them

which they could obtain damages for the
pollution cf navigable waters. But if we
have one uniform law enferced by the
Dominion I think we wili have iittle or no
trouble. It is ne use if one province iegisiates while the nieighbouring province
doca net. For instance, there is ne use in
Saskatchewan legislating in regard te thse
pollution of streams unless we in Alberta
have thse samne law, becanse every drop of

In the samne way what would be thse use

unless Quebec on the other side cf the
Ottawa had a law identical wîth it? Or
what would be thse good cf the Dominion

dlaims that it has neyer doue any harni to

about the people below-probably it xniglit
be a lumbering village. I have aeen quite
a few lumbering jacks, and they are quite
willing to have ail the water outside, al
they can get and live on it. but they do
not absorb much internaliy, and in order
to get typhoid fever thev have to swallow
it. I figured out about -what arnount of
sewage Ottawa is putting into the river
every twenty-four houra. Each man, Nvornaui
snd child in the city 'will pass on an average about two snd one-haîf ounces of excrement. and 40 to 50 ounces of urine. This
zoes into the sewers. That amounts to a
littie over 200,000 pounda of actual solid
waste frorn the hurnan being that is going
into the sewers daily. Besides that, there
is ail the waste motter that is thrown out,
horse manure and ail thia material in the
city goinR into these sewers. This is diluted by about from eight to ten million
gallons of water. The loweat suppiy that is

Hon. Mr. DE VEBER-Hirarn Walker.
If an Act like this were passed, every
town and village would have to dispose of
their sewage and they would take means
ta do it. In Lethbridge, we have had the
money voted for six years, and it is only
put off by the provincial authorities who
want to experimnit in order to find th-,
best means to do it. We got a little bit
angry, because the pe'ople below Lethbridge in several of the villages hiad a
number of cases of typhoid and were blaming our sewage whichi rau into the water,
and we determined to take action. We
got Mr. Aird Murry, an erninent engineer
ini Toronto, to corne up and look over the
land, and give us what he'considered thé
hast and most feasible scheme for our
district, because there is no one spécial
system. that will do for every part o! the
country. Yau must have it agree with existing conditions. For instance, take a
place like Regina, you could not have an
open aprinkling systern there in winter.
You might were it covered in and heated.
He bas given us a systern of a sedimentation basin aud then the percolation system, which does not, however,
remove the bacilli. Then it cornes oui

INSPECTION AND SALE ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
REPORTED FROM COMMITTEE.
The House resolved itself into a Cernniittee of the Whole on Bill (Q-1) An Act.
to amend the Inspection and Sale Act, as
regards the weights of a bushel and a bar
of certain articles.

MAI{CH 17, 1911
(In the Committee.)
On clause 1,
1. Section 337 of the Inspection and Sale
Aot, chapter 85 of the Revised Statutes, 1900,
i: hereby repealed and the following section
i s ubstituted therefor:
337. A bushel of any article mentioned in
this subeection shall mean, unless a bushel
greed upan, that
%pcal
by measure is
number of dominion stan'dard pounds of snch
article whieh ie showxi ini this subsection opposite the name of such article.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Could
my hon. friend explain whet the changes
are and why this Bill. ia introduced'
Et. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHTThe abject of this Bill is to fix a standard
weight. In a great many places they have
been sellmng by bags of varions sorts, some
bags weigh 60, sorne 70 and some 80 lbs.
They varied a great deai and the vegetable
growers, who are largely concerned, have
been sehding deputatians ta the gaverfiment asking that a fixed standard be provided. I think in moat of these case-,
where standards have ben fixed the
change is very slight, or none at ail, but
the main abject is that every mani who
buys by bag should know that he gets a
certain. weigbt, unless be has chosen expressly ta agree to buy by measuie, which
tbey may do under a special agreement.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWVELL-The
practice lias been that a bushel is deflned
ta be 60 pounds. in the case of potatops.
You can scarcely go into the markets now
and buy by the bushel. If yau ask the
price of a.bag of potatoes they will te]]
you sa much, and if you ask how u'ni is
in it they will say a bagini, and they dedîine ta sel] by the bushel. I do flot sec
that this defines what the weight of a bag
of potatoes will be.

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
*-Yes, they have asked for it.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Then
a bag of patatoca must weigh 80 pounds.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Yes, unlesB otherwise agreed upon.
Han. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I do
not abject to that.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The changes are very few and not materia]. Beans are 60 pounds and remain
60. Beeta have been changed froni 60 ta 50.
Bituminous coal and blue grass are the
saine. Carrots are ciit down from 60 ta 50.
Castor beans,' claver seed, hemp seed, and
lime are the sanie. Malt 36 pounds, anions
50. Parsnips reduced froni 50 ta 45. Patataes, timathy seed and turnips remain
the sanie.
The clause was adopted.
On clause 2,
2. The Act pasaed during the present session
respecting the sale of potatoes by the barrel
and intitule an Act te &=end the Inspection
and Sale Act, is hereby repealed..
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Across the border they have adopted
the weight of 65 pounds, and it is fou.nd
a canvenience when the United States potatoes and Canadian potatoca are being
sold an the sanie market that the weight
should be the sanie.
Hon. Mr. POWER-This Act will not be
iii force until it bas been assented ta by

His Excellency. I do noV know af any instance where we have undertaken ta repeal
an Act which bas neyver been asaented ta.
This Act has neyer been assented ta by the
Governor. Consequently it is not an Act.
WVe have, in variaus cases wbere the deputy
[has came down and assented ta a Bill, repealed tbat Bill at a subsequent date in
the session, but I do flot know af any instance o! a Bill wbicb bas. nat been assented ta that bas been repealed.

moved the third reading cf Bill (Q-1) An
Act to amend the Inspection and Sale Act
as regards the weights of a bushel and a
bag of certain articles.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I called attention te
the fact that the second clause of the Bill
was unneoesssry and I understood the
right hon. member ini chsarge of the Bill
to intiniate that he would consult the Justice Department with respect te it. That
clause is to the effect that an Act passed
during the present session entitled an Act
te amend the Inspection and Sale Act is
hereby repealed. No such Act has been
passed. It does not become an Act until it
is assented te by His Exrcellency. This
is a very round-about .way te deal with it.
The natural course is that it should not be
assented to by His Excellency.

before, that a Bill was not assented fa by
the Governor, but I think th -e hon. leader
of the opposition mnust be labouring under
a misapprehiension when he speaks of having known variaus occasions where a Bill
in the position that this Bill occupies,
was repealed by a Bill passing throughl
this House at a later stage of the session.
1 have hp-ez here for a good rnany years
and paid attention te the legisiation going
through, and this is the first case I remember where this course has been adopted. It is not an unusual thing where
a Bill has beexi passed in the early part
of the session, and has been assented ta
either by the Governor General or bis
deputy, that if is found desirable afferisards ta repeal if, and a repealing e]auseý

the point here is that we speak of an Act

such Act has been passed; it is not an Act
until it bas been assented to by the Governor General, and therefore this procedure
is incorrect.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Has my hon.
friend considered this phase of if? What.
authority has the Governor ta withbold a
Bill that has been passed by parliament?
Hon. Mr. POWER-It is a very simple
thing ta represent to His Exoelhency that
circumastances have arisen that make it
desirable that this Bill should not be assented ta.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I think
if is laid down very cleaily by May that
once bath brancheq of parliament have
passed an Act you cannot interfere with
it. If must go ta the Crown for sanction,
but I have a distinct recollection of cases
wvhere an Acf has been passed by both
Houses and afterwards repealed in the
sanie session ihat enacfed it. I arn not
prepared to say whether the Governor had
in any such case sanctioned the mensure.
If is very easy ta make this correct provided the original Act was passed and
sancfianed by the Governor and thaf flic

That arepeaing Act may be passed by parliament is wifhouf a doubt. In this case

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-1 amn inclined to think, althougli it is a
knotty question, on which. I have flot bestowed a great deal of study, that the proper thing to do when an Act has passed
both branches is to present it ta His Excellency who miay or may nat assent ta
if, but that it should be presented f0 him
appears a proper thing ta do. I think we

stage and produced considerable mnconvenience. I do not think any harmi can corne
frorn folloving the present practice and
letting this go forward. It will be assented
to before this Bill becomes law, and tfien
this will repeal the measure. It seems ta
me this is the safer course, and if thiQre is
no constitutional point involved in if, 1
think the point is that the Bis pased by

Excellency.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Does flot the hon.

We have iipon the statute-book many

il almost impossible to do without them,
and yet if lound with them in hie possession he is liable to this penalty. We medical men know how lbard it is te break off
some of these habite. There are many men,
as well as women, who would find it almost
an impossibiliiy to lay acide the tobacco

and if they have the sa-me habit with regard 10 these drugs, and the drug should
be forund in their possession, they would be
found guilty end fined. The indiscriminate
use of opium is a very delelerioue habit, yet
that is no justification for xnaking the use
of it a criminal offence. This habit is principally among the Chi-nese. Have we a

they have learned the habit in their younger

Hon. Mr. BAIRD-I have read that

my point.
Hon. Mr. McMILLAN-The reason why
I gave the schedule ie thie, that cocaine
and opium are two entirely different medicines, even different in their action, and
cooaine is very littie nsed by medical men
except as an aniesthetie. The way it -read
in the echedule was cocaine, morphia 'and
opium. Morphia came first, whiie morphia
is simply derived frein opium. There are
s0 many preparations af opium used by
people who are addicted ta the internai use
of opium, that I 'thought it would* be 'eli
ta mention more than -morphia or the -preparations -of the sal-ta of cnarphia. There
-are three saits of morphia that I cau. remember at -the present time. Ail these preparations are used instead ad morphia.
Tincture of opium, which. is laudanum, is
another medicine which is used. by opium
eaters, as they are caiied, and so is the
wîne of opium. Yo'u can carry these in
your pocket. Only a few draps are required.
Black drap is strong-er atili than either of
the others. Opium iozenges are a very nice
preparation to carry if you want to use
opium, and wvorse than ail is paregoria,
which ia used by mothera and nuises wlith

mruch of the opinion that when those childreîi grom- up they are inciined ta be morphia

who has just spoken, whether he has any
amendinents to propose that would change
the nature of the Bill as suggested by
the hon. gentleman from Halifax. He conveyed the impression that there would be
amendinents moved, and the hon, gentleman froin Glenga*rry gave notice of some
amendinents which would materiafly change
the nature of the Bill. If any hon, gentleman has any such sinendinents and
would be kind enough to intimate how they
would affect the Bill, I would be in a
position to appreciate the remarks made
by the hon. gentleman irom Halifax; but
without that we have te consider the clause
as it is presented to us. I have no sympathy with the reniarks of the hon. gentleman from Perth Centre <Hon. Mr. Baird)
who taWks about mothers. giving paregoric
to their children I believe there are more
children kllled by paregoric than in any
other way. A mother ta<es her child's life
in her hands if she give-s it paregorie. When
a phyqsician is called te see a child in convulsions, the first question asked is «What
have you been giving the child? However, I
may not be a good authority on t.his subject,
because I neyer had sny children to take
paregorie, but people flot acquainted with
the nature o! the drug shou¶d always avoid
using it. There are more children destroyed ini convulsions than from any other
cause. But while this is the case, does
the hon. promoter o! the Bill pretend that
this is more injurieus than other things?
The smoking o! cigarettes by the rising generatien destroys more lives and
does a greater amount cf injury than the
use of opiatea. Even a cigarette may or
may flot contain some cf the Chinese preparations of opium, and, therefore, the intention and desire cf the government te
carry into effect the beneficial resuits cf
their legislation, should impel them te see
that the law on the statute-book at, the
present time is enforced. Why enact a

exportation.

The hon. gentleman thinks this law etringent. It is not as etringent as many Acta
passed in other co'untries. It is borrowed
from- an Act passed in the state -of New
York, but it has been cut down and modified. To show the necessity feor legielation
of this kind, the governnient in the province
of Quebec has introduced a Bill, Bome
clauses of which are far more stringent than
the one we have under conuideration. Now
the .necessity for that arose because in the
province of Quebec the mort.ality fimong
children has been something appalling, particularly in the city of Montreal, where
soothing syrup has been given to childiren.
I have in my hand a list of a dozen prescriptions and I have no, doubt some of

by the Trade and Navigation returns that
we import a very large quantity of these
patent medicines.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Before my hon.

asked for is information as to the exportation. WVhat lie is referring to doesn't touch

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I inày say to miy hon. friend that I, believe the real cause for introducing that
was because of a good deal of trouble that
hias arisen on the .Pacifie steamers from
Chinamen 'attempting to import opium into
China.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-If there is -a condition existing requiring legiýsiation of this
character, I can undcrstand it I was unaware that we exported drugs of that kind.
I would cail my right hon. friend's attention to the fact that clause 3 should meet
the requirements lie lias in view. It is a
contravention of the Act for any one to
have in his possession such a drug as we are
attempting to legialate upon. And if he
has it in his possession for any other purpose than a scientifie purpose he comes
within the Act.

Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-No country

Hon. Mr. POWER-I should nlot think
su. The clause provides that if a drug is naw in the custody of the tourt it shail be
destroyed unlese such drug is claimed
within three months after the passing of
this Act. If no offence is comxnitôted, then
the party who owns the drug is expected
to dlaim it within three monthe after the

the case may be. That does not seem an
unreasonable provision. Then if the case

That ever sine I vas appointed immigration ohaplain I have obuerved with admiration the oourtesy, kindss and tact with
'shich Dr. Lavoie discliarges hie onerous and
trying duties as superintendent of immigration at Quebec. Of all these quefities, I could
furnish yon with endiess illustrations.
When it is eaid that Dr. Lavai. has manifested a general antipatliy toward the Protestant chailains, I venture to affirm it to b.
absolutely false. Personally, I could not desire greater kindness and aliability than 1
have experienced at hie hande, and to, ask a
special favour has always bean to have it
'rgtregard ta the specific case at the S8.

me ta say that Dr. Lavole bad ample reason
for his action on that occasion, and the re,fully deserved.

SECOND READING.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL moved the second
reading cf Bill (No. 3) An Act respecting
the Heurs of Labour on Public WVcrks.
He said: This Bill respecting the Hours
cf Labour on Public Works, is a very important measure, and one that lias created
censiderable discussion througliout the
co'untry and in the House of Commons.
After ahI, it ie a very simple Bill. It practically embraces only eue clause, which -prevides that:
3. Every contract hereafter made for the
erection, re-modelling, construction or repair
of any public building to ivhich the goverpment of Canada if, -a party, whicli xnay involve the employ.ment cf labourers, workmen

by the contract, shalli be required, except iii

great modification of the Bill as it was firit
introduced. As et first introduced in the
House of Gommons, it was a very drastie
meas-ure, and provided that any contrastor who allowed, or permitted, under any
consideration, a labourer or mechanie to
work for more tlian eighit houirs a day was
subject to a very heavy penalty. This Bill
provides only that a contractor shal. no-t
compel hie ivorkingmen to work more than
eight hours a day, and if they do lie muet
pay them time and a haîf for the extra
hours. The Billlias received a good deal

as it ought te be, and requires ne protection of this kind.
Hon. Mr. MeMULLEN-I entirely dissent
from the principle centained in this Bijl.
I do not see any good reason why the
country should be called upon to pay more
'fer public 'works than these public works
woyuld cost if 4hey were erected by a prirate individual. Why is it that the gevernment 'whieh erects a building in any
town or city should have to pay mien 'who,
worked upon the building 20 or 25 per
cent more than if they were working on a
building adjoining for a private individual?
I think it is most objectionable legislation.
It is crippling the country te secure the
accommodation we require in every county,
city, town and village ut a price in exceas oef its intrinsie value. Why should
that be done? I have heard ne good ground
advanced, either by the bon. gentleman
who has introduced the Bill, or in anythlng I have read, te juatify legislation of
this kind. I admit that a great many petitions have been sent in, in lavour of the
Bill. By whom? By labour organizations
who are everlastingly petitiening for advantages cf one kind or another. I do not
say that the labour organizations have net
rights as well as others; but I do say that
the country aise has a right, and we, as
representatives. cf the people, have a right
te look after the interests cf the country
in matters cf this kind. We are net here
merely te meet the request cf the labour
organizations. or .any other organization. We
are here te legislate in the direction of wliat
we believe te be equity and justice, and
te guard the best interests of the country
for which we are legislating. I have ne
personal animosity againat the labour organizations, net at ail. But when they
ask *us te pass a law te enable them to
force out of centractors pay for the per.
formance et work in exceas cf what it
would cost if it were net directed by the
country, is unreasonable and unfair. 1
can well remember the time cf the first

Hon. '. MACDONALD,

and were to put it through and have the
building finished by a certain time; but,
owing to the fact that it was a public
building, and that the labour organizations
would net agree to permit the bricklayers
to lay. more than 750 bricks a day, and
their instructions being te stretch eut their
work se as not to exceed that, the result
was that the contractor could not get on
with the work-it was utterly impossible te
finish it in time, and they had to take the
work out of .his hands. What did they do?
They wired at once te New York and had
200 bricklayers cross the Atlantic to finish
the work, which they did.
The New York bricklayers laid from oe
thousand to twelve hundred and fifty bricks
a day, and they finished the building in
time and the organized bricklayers ot the
city ot London stood idie, having nothing
to do, looking at their American cousins
doing the work that they should have doue
and would have done but for the rules and
regulations of their orders that prevented
thern f roi laying more than 750 bricks a
day. What are we going to reach in this
country if we legislate in the direction of
Iimitimg the amount cf work te be done
by *mechanics and artisans? We .are going
te largely increase the cost cf buildings
and structures of every kind. It is objectionable legislation. However. 1 shall defer
anything further thet 1 qmay have to say
upon the subject until such time as my
esteemed. friend brings this mnatter betore
his special committee. I arn willing, under the proposition that hie makes, that it
does not commit us to the principle of
the Bill, that it shall get the second rending now and go to a special eomrnittee;
but as far as I am concerned, I may say
te him, and I say te this lieuse. that I
cannot be persuaded to support it. I do
flot know 'whence or hew an argument

this alters the position, because while the
principal subject may belong under the
British North America Act to this parliament, various interests may belong to a
local jurisdiction. In order to show that
that view lias solid foundation, 1 wishi to
refer to a couple of decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The
first case to which I shiail refer is a very
uveli known case, that of the Citizens' Insurance Company of'Canada and WVm. Parsons, and the Queen Insurance Company
and Wm. Parsons. That case was decided
in 1881. The report begins on page 96 of
volume 7 of Appeal Cases. 1 do not wish to
read -more than is deairable. My first extract begins at the lower part of page 108.
With regard to certain classes of subjeets,
therefore, generally described in section 91,

trs falling wîthin the general
these .. bje,,ts in the legislatures of the provinces. In these cases it is the dutv of the
courts, however diffienît it may be, to ascertain in what degree, and to what extent, authority to deal with matters falling within
these classes of subjec4s exists in each legislature, and to define in the partîcular case
before them the limite of their respective
powers.
To this point I caîl the attention of the
House.
It could not have been the intention tliat
a conflict ehould exist; and, in order to prevent such a result, the two sections must be
read together, and the langnage of one interpreted, and, when necessary, modified by that
of the other. In this way it may, in most
cases, be found possible to arrive at a reasonable and practical construction of the language of the sections, so as to reconcile the
respective powers they contain and give effect
to ahl of them.

ing with contracts for insurance. Speaking-of
the terni 'civil riglits,' at the bottonu of
the page, the (1ecision says:
These contracts and the riglits arising from
them, it was argued, came legitimately within the >class of subjects, property and civil
rîghts. The appellants. on the other hand,
contended that civil rights meant only sucb
rights as flowed f rom the law, and gave as an
instance the statue of persons. Their lordships cannot think that the latter construction is the correct one. They find no sufficient reason in the language itself, nor ini the
other parts of the Act, for giving s0 narrow
an interpretation to the words 'civil riglits.'
The words are sufficiently large ta embrace,
in their fair and ordinary meaning. rights
srising from contract, and such rights are
Rot included in express tarmns in any of the
enumerated classes or subjects in section 91.
It becomes obvions, as soon as an attempt
is muade ta construe the general termes in

which the classes of subjects in sections 91
and 92 are described, that both sections and
the other parts of the Act muet bie looked at
ta ascertain 'whether language of a general
nature muet not by necessary implication or

reasonable intendment be modified and limited.
At page 113, near the top, it says:

abstain on the present occasion f rom any attempt ta define the limite of the authority
of the Dominion parliament in this direction. It is enough for the decision of the
preseut case ta say that, in their view. its
authority ta legislate for the regulation of

trade and commerce dos not comprehiend the
power to regulate by legisiation the contracts of a particular business or trade, sucli
as the business of fire insurance in a sinigle

province.

On pege 117, near the top, the decision
says:
But it by no means follows, unless indeed

shaîl give the citation. It carnies eut the
saine principle. The case is the Canadian
Pacifie railway versus the corporation 'of

page 367, Appeal Cases, 1899.
1 know that a legal argument of this kind
is a little tedieus, but the question is important, and 1 thinç we should have al
the light we can on il. I think it is clear
f rom the two cases that 1 have cited, that
if this question were te corne before the
judicial Committee of the Privy Council
they would hold that these contracta between building contractera and workîmen
came within the juriadiction o! the prov-

ince and not of the parliament of Canada.
So far for the constitutional standpoint.
That is nîy first objection to this Bill.
I think it is only riglit that we should
consider 'what the probable effects of this
measure wiII be. In the firat place, iA will
reduce the amounit of work done on public
buildings in the course of a eeason. In a
country like Canada, where at any rate
in most places the' work of 'building does
not go on for more than about seven montha
in the year, that is a very serious matter.
Promptitude in building, 'where a country
is growing as rapidly in population and ini
business requirements as Canada is grewîng, is of great importance, and it is desirable that buildings should be erected withi
the least possible delay. Perhaps the lion.
Wellington (Mr. Megentleman from
Mullen) went too- far in saying that the
mien will be paid the same wages for the
eight-hour day that they are now paid for
the nine or ten-hour da.y. That may or
may not be the case; but if they are paid
as much for the eight-hour day as 'Lhey are
for the nine or ten-hour day, then it <usons

buildings which are erected after this Act
bas been assented to, if it ever is assented
to, either one-nmnth or one-fifth more, secording as the day is, fine or ten hours, and
when you deat with probably ten or eleven
million dollars worth cf work, that is a
very serious consideration.
Hon. Mr. ELLIS-That is on the item of
labour?
Hon. Mr. POWER-My hion. friend f rom
St. John very properly says that that is on
the item of labour; and the item of labour
is the mort important item in the cost o! a
building. Suppose that the rate of wages
is not increased, and that the workmen are
paid enly the saine amouint per hour for a
day of eight hours as they now are for a
day of nine or ten liours, it will stili increase the çost of the buildings, because
ihe contractors will realize that the ivork
must take considerably longer to complete
it than under the present conditions. and
that their plant will be tied up for a longer
period; and it will rnean-and this is an
idea which perhiaps ha& not presented itself

more remote effeets are that confusion
will be involved in the building trade.
I know that great confusion vwas caused
in the city of Halifax a couple of
years ago, because the local government,
very injudicious]y, as I think they realized
themselves afterwards, inserted in a contract a provision that the men employed
should not work more than eight hours a
day, and it upset the conditions in the
building trade alover the city; and, naturaily in the long rua, this enactment would
probably lead to the adoption of the eight
hour day generally--at any rate in the
building trade. lb would mean this, that
the supply of labour, which is already too
smail for a country growing as rapidly as
Canada is, would be largely reduced. These
are considerations that probably did not
present themselves to the gentleman *who
int-roduced the Bill. Owing to the diminution of the supply of labour, the progress of
the whole Dominion would be impeded, and
the cost of building would be largely increased, for private building as werl as to
the governinent. When a measure whose
effeets are likely to be as far reaching as
are those of this measure which is proposed, those who ask us to disturb the existing condition of things should give some
substantial reason why the change is
sought. I have not heard any reason
whatever given in this House. 1 have read
the greater part of the discussion which
took place in the other Chamber, and did
not find any substantial resson vas given
there. In fact, the gentlemen who advocated this measure in the Commons were

an unhealthy trade. I can undersband
that the government might introduce
printers,
that
providing
a measure
minera, tailors and other people empleyed
in unhealthy indoor occupations should'not
work at these occupations for more than
eight hours a day. A measure for that
purpose might be defended on the ground
that it was intended to hinder the physique
of the people of this country from deteriorating. That is not the case here. The
trades with which this measure deals are
just thoqe trades to which no such argument can app]y. The trade of the mason'
and the brick]ayer, and the carpenter.' and
the painter are tradps that pire liealhful:
reaTly the work done undler these tiades is
simply a healthiful exercise. It is no laughing matter. How many bouts wou]d a carpenter need to %vork,on a fine day in this
country hefore bis health would suffer, orhours would a mason or a brickhow wman %
layer have to work before his health would

where a change is least needed and undertakes ta treat them differentiy from. the
other trades. It la therefore an inequitable
enactmcnt. This parliament has paaaed
the Lemieux Act, which is an Act for the
settiement of disputes between employers
and workmen. It is recugnized, I think,
not o.nly in Canada, but in ether cauntries, as being the best existing law for
the preventian ef strikes and the settiement
of labour disputes; and. parliament, in
passing that Act, did its duty bath by the
employer and empleyee, and, in my humble
judgxnent, having done that, parliament has
done ail that it could reasonably be expected te de, and it la the duty cf paruinent now te simply rest and be thankfui and te allow this conflict tai be fought
out bet-ween the parties. Why sheuid parliament interfere in a quarrel between capital and labeur? I do not see. Parliament
providea a method cf settling disputes between capital and labour, an admirable
methed of deing that, and why ahould parliament interpose directly on behaif of
one cf the parties? Whatever niay have
been the case in former times, to-day labeur is perfectly able ta take care cf itseilf,
and, indeed, the wishes cf the trades
unions,. which are not always guided by
supreme wisdom, are hiable te secure support, in elective bodies at any rate, even
from those who feel that the unions are in
the wrong. This is net the firat time that
this question cf shortening of day labour
has been considered. The length o! the
working day has been much shortened in
the past. If any hon, gentleman wiIl take
the trouble te read that report ef the Nova
Scotia Commission he wvili find that, at a
net very remote period, the length cf the
warking day was twelve heurs, and that
has been cut down in most places te nine
hours, as a resuit ef discussion and agreement between employers and employeca.
My view is that the unions can always,
by judicieus and persistent effort, succeed
in getting any concession which la at ail
I may add further, that in

of the workingmen *are not in favour of the

it was my duty, hon. gentlemen, ta express the opinions wbich I have long
entertained.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I quite agree with
almoat every word that has been said by
the hon. gentleman f rom. Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Power). It is quite plain that under
the British North America Act, the question cf contract is under the exclusive jurisdiction cf the provinces, and there cannot be a clearer case ef contract found
than in this Bill. It does not require the
quoting cf any authority P It is governed by
the clear text of the constitution. But apart
from the absence cf jurisdiction, I desire
ta cail the attention cf this honourable
Heuse te this further cansideratien. It ia
well known that it has been the practice
on the part of the governinent ini ail contracts on public work, te insert what is
called the Fair Wage Clause. This lu for
the purpose cf compelling the contracter
ta pay net lesa thèn a minimum price ta
ail men employed on the work.
Hon. Mr. DERBYSHIRE-In the locality where the building is going on.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-! beg the hon.
gentleman's pardon; the clause determines
the minimum wage which shall be paid ta
ail employees. The attempt made by this
Bill te compel the government te interfere
with the liberty of contract in matters of this kind is, I think, unbecoining.
If employees are entitled te a further pretection on the part of the government, they
should receive it by an amendment te those
clauses te ivhich 1 have referred. On the
other hand, I arn of opinion that unless parliament is disposed, or, rather, the several
provinces cf this Dominion are dispesed, te
limit the heurs of working te' eight, hours
per day, ne preference sheuld be given te

other employees. I wvill net take the time

to refer at any length to that chapter af

Hon. Mr. LANDRY-What is the titie?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-It is in connectian

That question as to the hours of labour
should be lef t to the provinces, and as to
any preference which is ta be given, or
ought to be given to employees on publie
works it should be lef t with the goverfi.
ment itself. When dealing with the contractors, it is the duty of the gavernment
ta see that employees are protected ta a
reasonable extent, and it has been and is
the practice ai the government to protect
the interests of the employees, but the
government has flot seen its way yet to
go as far as now proposed, and it seems to
me it would be interfering .with the free
action of the gavernment in placing on the
statute a Bill of this kind. It is not s
government measure; it is introduced by
a private member. The governinent may
flot have taken exception ta the measure;
at any rate if the governent deems it advisable ta do so, they have the means of
inserting the Fair Wage Clause, irnposing
that obligation on the contractor. But parliarnent shouId flot interfere in this way
ta compel the government ta do what apparently the goverrnent is flot disposed
to do. I arn always disposed to treat with
a great deal of consideration any Bill that
has passed the House ai Commons, and,
as a general rule, I think it is aur duty ta
give it the fullest cansideration and hear
the parties who are interested, and refer
the Bill ta a special committee; but I lai!

that, because I arn clearly ai the opinion
thst this is a Bill which is not within the

nothing could be stated in committee whichi

Hon. Mr. POWVER-It is a question whether the hion, gentleman can move just as

RESTIGOUCHE RIVER RIPARIAN
OWNERSHIP BILL.

Bill (A-1) An Act to incorporate thIuýLstigouche Riparian Association.
He said: I desire to read tjis. petîtion
to the Huse.
The SPEAKER-lt should be laid oni the
table before it ia read.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-I desîre te get
it on the record. I took advice, and was
told 1 could read it.
The petition reads
as follows:
To the Honourable the Senate,- in parliament
assembled:
Whereas it has corne to the knowledge of
your petitioners that a Bill lias been introduoed
into the Senate intituled 'An Act te incorporate the Restigouche Riparian Association':
your petitioners respectfully beg te protest
against tbe passage of the said Bill in its
present shape, and te subrnit the following
facts, and reasons why the proposed Act, in
its present shape should not becoine law.
1. The unincorporated association mentioned
in th
reamble of the Bill, and who are now
seekin.g incorporation, have £rom the time
of its organization and commencement of
operations ini the Restigouche and Matapedia
rivers and their branches, manifested a disposition to interfere with the local riparian
owners along eaid rivers, who during very
man3' years had fiehed for salmon in the
waters with nets as an industry, and whose
flshing stands were in many cases thse princi-pal means of a livelihood, and which as-

sociation, by influence, have been able in a
large meais-ure to bring a-bout the suppression

of flany sueli fishing stands ostensibly
for the purpose of the preservation of the

salmon fisheries, but with the real purpose of
încreasing the value of their pools for fly

fishing thus 6acrificing rhie welfare and the
ve'ry living of the lo-al riparians to the
pleasuré- fishing of these wealthy applicants
for still greater powere.
2. The -phraseology of the said Bill implies a
diýregard of law by the people of the locality
affected, or to be affected by the Bill should
it become law, and that it lias become necesisary that thse proposed corporation ehould
be given power to aid the authorities in
this suppress.ion of thp lawlessnies.s existing
in that locahty as regards fish and game laws.
Your petitiofl5rs protest against any such
imputation anîd Most emphatically declare
that sucli imputation is unwarranted.
3. The proposed Act also imp'ies thse inability
of the proper authorities to Plifnîce thse IRw
as regards fish and game. Y<iur petitioners
submit that the Dominion and provincial
goveruments are quite competent te enforce
tise lawv and we desire to urge as forcibly aq
possible tisat if any aid is required or deaired
bv sucis governments in tisat regard, the power
sisould not be delegated to tise proposed corporation, whoee interests are se mucli at
variance with those of thse said local ripar-

proposed iucarporators is ta subserve their
,owni intere6ts, sucli purpose and intent being
also expressly declared ini the section hieaded
'Objects' iïn tue sciieduJle ta tbe Bill.
5. Your petitioners believe thuat the working
out cf the proposed legislation in its present
shape will resuit in the local riparians being
6till more brouglit under the power of these
fishermen, and in the further curtailment of
their fishing rights and privileges in the said
waters. Your petitioners have no objection ta
the applicalits becomiuig incorporated and exercising itheir rights as an incorporated body
but they do most emphatically object ta the
proposed co-partnership, so ta speak, between
them and tihe Dominion and provincial governmete.
6. Ycur petitioners do flot ask for local
rîparians that they do exempt froin reasonable regulations the guarding the fishing of
said waters, madle and ordained by rightful
authority, bat they îretest against any corporation or set cf men being
tion by legislation sc that it placed in may i.i
or they a posla measare farunulate, or even suggest ta the
department in charge of such inatters, the
poiicy -ta be acted upon in that 'behalf, and
your petitioners contend that tihe proposed
legislation, if passed, will naturally have the
efféet cf giving ta the' views ansd purposes of
the proposed co roaton a greater weighit
and influence with and upon the department
than would -he the case in thse absence cf snch
législation, and yoar petitioners urge upon
the consideration cf parliament that in view
of the fact that the interests of the applicants
fer euch legislation are in conflict with these
of thé said local riparians, sncb legislation as
ie now asked for should not pass in its present shape.
Your petitioners, being electors in the
coaxrty cf Bonaventure, in the province of
Qnebec, humbly pray that the said Bill as
now constructed may net now hecome law.
And as in daty bound will ever pray.

-I arn giving the answer as the post ai.
fice authorities have framed it. The answers te the remaining questions are:
The post office at Çandiac ia not a regular post office, but is what ia known as a
sub-office, beiug under the control cf the
Qnebec post office. A large part cf the
district i which the office is situate is
aise served by letter carrier, but a limited
quantity of mail matter is delivered from.
Candiac sub-office tei persons living outside cf the territery in which. a free dclivery service exista. It bas neyer been the
practice cf the department te have sucli
sub-offices kept open on Suxidays, and there
appears te bie ne sufficient reasan cf a
public nature why exceptional treatment
should be extended to the office at Candiac.
3 and 4. Under present arrangements,
correspondence reaching Candiac is delivered at 8.30 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. and any
correspondence reaching the office aiter
3.30 p.m. is delivered by the first delivery
ai the following week day.
As regards free delivery by letter carrier,
this wvas granted ta thse people af Candîne
as a special concession, made la viewv af
the urgency ai their application, and with
a full knawlIedge on the part cf tihe applicants ai what wauld follow, viz.: the reduction of thse office at that point ta a

as ta a possible means of avercaming this

matters on internai eco.nomy, I think 1
should be permitted ta say a few words,
even though I should be penalized for an
infraction of the rule. 1 desire ta caîl attention ta, saine remarks reported in the
Commons ' Hansard' at page 6292. In the
Committee of Supply, the question of the
contingent expenditure of thse other branch
was under consideration, and a discussion
took place on the subject «of thse distribution of statianery and trunks te members.
The question was asked if the saine thinghad been done in the case of the Senateth'at is if thse samé poiicy of economy had
been practised in the Sexiste. To this the
Speaker replied that the Senate being an
independent Chamber, the Commons bnci
no control over thein. The report is as
follows:
Mr. DANIEL. Has thse ane thing been
done in the case of the senators? I understand they are snpplied with a certain amount
of maney, and that they provide these things
for themseIves. Ras thse same poiicy of econamy been extended ta the senators ?
Mr. SPEAKER. Thse Senate being an independent chamber, they distribute their
funda as they think best. They continue the
practice in thse Senate. I understand it is
taken ont of the vote for contingencies. We
have no contrai over them.
Mr. DANIEL. I see no reason why the
saine mile should not be extended to the
Senate as -ta the Hanse of Comnians. The
money is voted by this Hanse, and it shoulci
be made clear that in future there wiii be
noamoney for that purpase.
Another member, the gentleman from
Halton, made the foilowing remaris:

We have ta vote the money, tise Senate can-

neot get five cents uniesa we give it ta themn,
and if the item of Senate contingencies bas
nlot passed, 1 will be glad ta move ta strike
it ont.

It is ta the kno.wledge of this Hanse, and
I presume it was ta the knowledge of thse
other branch of parliament, that the Senate
ariginated the very econamy whichi they
charge we have flot practised. Last year.
the Contingent Accaunts Committee of this
Hanse, or the members appointed for tise
purpose of îuaking the sciectian, did away
withi the trunk of stationery, &c., and it
was understood that the same course would
be fol]awed in the other brancis of parliament. Later an, it came ta aur knowledge
that the other Hanse hnd nlot iived up ta

gentlemen who have prof aned the dignity
of the Senate, I think, on the whole, we

Hon. Mr. POIRIER-My hon. friend is expecting too much from certain members of
the other House,- if he thinks that they wilI
treat us with the respect and consideration

Heretofore we have been assailed by certain inembers of the other House in a mnanner that certainly does not reflect favourably upon them. Some of them, for reasons
that inay be good or not good, desire ta
abolish this Senate; some desire to amend
.us, and that is quite proper. The language
that is used by some members of the other
House would not be tolerated in the Senate
if used towards them or towards any o! us
individualUy. It is true that we should not
expect Irom them, or some o! them, a very
higli standard of discretion. They do not
seem to treat one another witli mucli more

of daily occurrence, but o! frequent occurrence, to threaten to take off their coats
and go outdoors and fight, or distribute such
epithets as 'liar ' and other words sucli as

relation between gentlemen, and that their

by adding those words
Hon. Mr. McMILLAN-Çocaine is an extract from the cocoa les!, and the saits that

Hon. Sir RICHARD. ÉOOTT-Usually

Hon. Mr. McMILLAN-Yes, we have derivatives from opium. They are the assential medicinal quality in opium; but
saits of cocaine or saîts of morphia are
simply preparations of these. Morphia is
the essential preparation o! opium, and
the saflt o! that are the acetate of morphia and the sulphate of morphia, and
mýur!ate o! morphia. Those are the principal saits. What is necessary is to
say, 'the salts of morphia and the extract of opium.' As far as eucaine is concerned, that is a similar preparation ta

many members really understand what the
amendment introduced by the hion. senator
is really intended to mean. The Bill is a
very harsh one, and should be carefu1ly
considered, because it may resuit in hardship to the public. I endeavoured the
other day to ascertain why the measure
was introduced at the present time, if there
was just cause for it, and if the use of
opium was causing injury. We should be
placed in possession of the <acts, to judge
whether the Bil1l was reasonable or whether it was intended to prevent the use
cf opium in the varions dens of the country, whicli we aIl admit is doing a great
injury. It ia questionable whether the effect o! the Bill wilI not be to produce more
hardship and do more wiong than the use

British Columbia they ivili be using opium;
but we know that opiates are also used by
physicians for purposes other than smoking, and if we are going to restrain the use
of opium we should strike at the source.
I lelieve that the physicians are, to a
great extent, responsible for much 'o! the
ding habit which prevails in the country.
A physician ie called to prescribe for some
pereon who is suffering more or less pain.
He cannot always tell at first what is the
matter with the patient, and he gives
him a drug to soothe the pain for the time
being and waits tili the next day before lie
becomes fulIy aware of what really is the
inatter withi the patient. One dose oi
opium may lead some people to the habit
of using the opiste. Persons who are uncomfortable or unhappy may resort to the
drug to make them sleep. If this habit
exisa it sbould be stamped ont; but I do
not think this Bill will remedy the evil
but will be rather injurions in many ways.
Who is to make the complaint that -a certain person is using druge.? Opium is not
the only drug that is injurions. The continued use of bromide of potash produces
almost as serions a result as the opium
habit. It destroys a person's physique,
and if we are going to protect the public
from any o! -the drug, habits, we should
adopt a method which would entirely
stamp out the evil. The third clause provides that every person who imports, manufactures, sells, offers for sale, has in his
possession, or takes or carnies, or causes
to be taken or carried, any of these*drugs,
is guilty of an offence, and so on. If I
were not a physician. and corne one met
me on the street and asked me to carry
some powder or morphine to some place,
and I put it in my pocket, and it should
be found in rny possession, I would be responsible, if if were not being used for
medicinal or scientific purposes, and I
would be heavily fined. If an old lady
takes a little paregoric, or a dover powder.
she le hiable f0 a $500 fine. Are we legislating iu the iuterest of the public, so that
they shahl be happier and enjoy life better
than they are now doing, or are we adopting

-MARCH 28, 1911
legisiation that will cause suffering in the
country? I do not tbînk that the amendment proposed by the hon. gentleman from.
Glengarry (Hon. Mr. McMillan) wil afford
the necessary protection, although it may
satisfy the right hon. leader of the House.
I have not heard either of them say whether
the amendment w'as satiBfactory or net;
but I know they were eonsulting une anailier, and perhaps they thought it was a
very doubtful case, and they would not let
the Senate know what they ivere talking
about. That .may be ail right, but we vwant
ta know how the Bill in its present ahape
would affect the public. If the object is tu
abolish the opium dens, let t.hem commence
with the physician first, because, I believe
that niedical men are to as great an extent
as any other class responsible for the habit
prevailing more or less in the country. A
doctor is called to see a patient, and the
first thing the patient says is: ' Doctor,
give me .sojmething to stop this pain.' A
phyaician lias no desire ta see a patient
suffering, and he meorts to a dover powder,
morphine, hypodermic syringe or something
to relieve the patient. The patient feels
benefited by it, and ten chances to one he
will try to keep in the bouse some preparation of a similar kind to use in an emergency and obviate the necessity of calling
in a physician. One hon. senator states
that it is necessary to use these druga in
the treatment of animais. Are you going
to campei farmers to keep these drugs out
of their houses? When an animal gets sick,
what course will the owner pursueP Wil
he get the veterinary to give him a certificate and go te a drug store? Is there any
necessity for su.ch a stringent measureP Il
they can ehow seriaus injury from the common use of the drug, then perhaps it would
be necessary to pass this measure. Under
the circumÉtances, I cannot support the
third reading.
The amendment -%vas agreed te.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
moved the third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MoMILLAN -moved in amendment that the said Bill be not naw read a
third time but that it be further amended
by adding the following as subsection 3 of
section 4:

7
437

3. Any persan who takes internally any
extracts, derivatives or preparations of
opium, shall be liable on a summary conviction to a fine flot exceeding fi! ty dollars and
costs, or te imprisonment for a term not
exceeding one month, or to both fine and imprisonmout.
Ha said: That la exactly the same penalty that is -attached ta the infraction of the
law with regard to opium amoking in the
section. The reason I make this motion is
because section 4 applies only to opium.
Subsaction 2 of section 4 refera ta the place
o! resort where the opium is smoked, and
opium being found there without reasanable excuse; but thare is a class o! the
community who are opium fiends. They use
morphine, laudanum and many extracts of
opium whieh are e.qually as bad, and uponl
whichi they are sure to f ail back il the
stringent lairs we are enacting here with
regard te cocaine and i s extracts are carried out. Therefore, I think it is necessary,
in order to make this law 'useful, to add
that subsection with regard ta the preparations that will be used by the opium
eaters, as they are called, or opium fiends,
or those who 'are in the habit of using it
in that 'way.
The SPEAKER-This proposed amendment does not even excuse it being taken
under prescription, or by doctor's advice.
Hon. Mr. MoMILLK&-There is another
section following.
The SPEAKER-I was simply calling attention te the fact that this section might
apply, aven though the drug was taken
under prescription !rom *a doctor.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I have nlot any very
strong feeling with respect ta the proposed
arnendment. The bon. gentleman froni
Glengarry wvill notice that clause 4 of the
Bill is intended ta put an end ta the smoking of opium, and te resortîng ta opium
joints where opium is smoked. The amendment which ha proposes is nôt altogether
germane ta the clause. The hon. gentleman from St. John (Mr. Ellis) called attention ta this fact the other day when we
were in committee on the Bill. I myself
doubt the wisdom of tacking that amendment on ta clause 4. If the hon, gentleman
will look at clause 3, it says: «Every person, who 'without lawvful reason or excuse

that viii caver the case te which lie refers,
and clause 5 prevents the sale ai the drug

not think this amendment is absoluteiy

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I do not think
the hon. gentleman needs that clause at

by the lion. gentleman from Halifax (Hon.

th

Hon. Mr. McMILLAN-I wiii certainly
not divide the House on it; I wiii vithdraw it. *I hope the reading ta the amendment ai the other clause is expiicit enough,
Hon. Mr. POWER.

Nýothing hierein contained shall affect a physician or veterinary surgeon who may grant
a certificate to any druggist ta seil or supply
any such drugs to a person to be kept for
medioinal use as a home remedy where a supply is necessary in case of 6ickness and emergency, or where the owner of horses, cattie
and ather domestio animais, is of necessity
obliged ta keep on hand a supply of sucli
drugs for medicinal application and use.
Provided. suai certificate is fiied with the
druggist and a duplicate thereof is furnished
to the purchaser, and such certificate shall be
vaiid as against any prosecution under this
Act.
The abject of that is, section 5 provides
that no druggist ehall give, seli, or furnish
any drug, eicept upon prescription from a
practical physician, veterinary surgeon or
dentist. That prevents the seiling af any
drug except upon such an occurrence as
this. Th-en again, subsection 2 prevents a
physician from giving any prescription or
order for the filling of which any drug is
required uniess such drug is required for
a patient under his care at the time. That
prevents clearly the druggist fram muppiying men vho may go back to shanties in
ods, or people vho may require to
the
have a supply of medicines for an emergency at home, unless a subsection Iike
this is added. These were the reasons
why I gave that notice. I viii not press

in my. humble way, ta make the Bill as
workable as possible, and particulariy for
those who are obliged ta keep a supply af
medicines such as are mentio.ned here, on

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
I had hesitation in opposing
my individuai opinion to the hon. gentleman's, I consulted vith the Department ai
Labour, vho introduced this Bill as ta that
amendment, and they were af opinion in
the first place that ail reasonable cases in
which drugs were kept would be sufficientiy
protected by the yards ' Persans vho vere
iawfuily or reasonably excused,' from being
liable te the penalties. They thought that
would protect where there vas9 necessity
for using these drugs for human or animal
subjects; but they aiea thought, and th-at
was a mare serious question, that if the
clause were introduced it vould open the
door so wide that the Bill wouid be useleas
I amn therefore under the necessity af op
posing the amendment of my hon. friend

MARCH 28, 1911
Hon. Mr. WILSON-If, for instance, a
man cornes to me and wants. me to give
him an order for a pound or a quarter of
a pound of opium, explaining ta -me that
the object of procuring it is to treat cattie
or someth ing of that kind, I give him the
order. He goes to the drug store, gets the
opium and takes it home, and uses a
drachm of it, and he has the balance on
his hands. If that opium is found in hie
house afterwards, and ha cannot explain
why it was kept there, what happens?
That is what I was trying to have my hon.
friand let me know what ha was going to
do with the residue, 'whether it would havé
to be deetroyed or sent back to the drug
store, because if he kept it in the house
and it was found there, some evil-minded
persan wishing ta annay him. might have
him proeecuted. He could not plead the
fact that ha originally got it for a legitimate
purpose; the question *would be, is there
any reason why that opim was in the
bouse? It was not needed; they could flot
say that it was required there. Would that
person be liable to prosecution and fine and
imprisonmentP I see na escape eut of it.
He oertainly would be held to have kept
opium in bis house witheut just cause.

Hon. «Mr. POWER, in the absence of the
H-on. Mr. Béique, moved that the amendmente be conc'urred in. He said: Thea first
amendment is to change the route o! the
railway. It was found that a difflculty occurred on account of a very steep grade,
and this very slight change has been made
in the description in order ta get rid o! that
difficulty. There was no différence o! opinion in the committee. The other amendmente, though long, are really amendmente which go as a. matter of course. One
je ta insert the usual clauses where railwavs
go through passes in the mountains, to provide that if there is any difficulty in flnding
room for two railways, this company shall
be obliged to grant running powers te any
other railway. The only other amendment
is te substîtute the standard clause with
respect ta securities issued on the propèrties and assets of the company other than
the railway. The clause as it came up ta
us was net the standard clause, and this is
simply to substitute the standard clause
for that in the Bihl.

The emendment was declared lost on a
-division.

hon. gentlIeman was immediately approved
by the hon. gentleman from De Salaberry.
<Hon. Mr. Béique), and the hon. member
f rom De Lorimier <Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
rose and contradicted them almost absolutely, politely of course, as lawyers always
do. The hon. member from De Lorimier
claiined that we had a perfect right to
legisiate in this manner, and to pass this
eill. It is a question for laymen to de.ide for themselves; the lawyers do not
agree. However, the hon. member from
Halifax lias said that we have not
the right to legisiate to regulate matters of
contract, but he said it might be right and
froper for the government to undertake to
ix the length of a day's work in an unheaithy trade. To my mind that appeart
to be somewhat a contradiction of the first
contention that we have no right to legislate in this matter.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Will my hon. friend
permit me to interrupt him. The Canada
Temperance Act, generally known as the
Scott Act, was held to be valid by the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
just on that ground. that it was intended
for the benefit of the whole country; the
peace, order and good government of Canada and that intemperance was deait with,
substantially as 51l-health would be.
Hon. Mr. CASRGAIN-I do flot think
that is quite germane to this Bill; however,
it is a matter of opinion, and lawyers may
differ on that. The hon, gentleman said
that having read the discussions that had
taken place in another place, he did
flot find a substantial reason given for the
passing of the Bill there. I have also read
the discussions in the other House, and I
find that the opinion of several very prominant members of that House was that
parliament had the right. and the very
point which was brought up by the hon.
member from Halifax' was deait with extensively, and after reading the discussion
I came to the conclusion that parliament
hiad the right to legisiate in this matter.
However, 1 take it that the hon. member

strip this Bill Of its legal verbage it rneans
sirnply that: ' Every government contract
for the erection of buildings, shall contain
a clause stipiilating that no labourer shahl
work more than 48 hours a week, or eight
hours a day.' Hon, gentlemen 'will see that
that is a matter of contract as between the
Sub-secgovernmneft and the contractor.
tion 2 of clause 3 says: 'The provisions
of this section shail, as respects the hours
of labour, apply to work on government
work, undertaken by the government by
day labour. That is, the government in
employing people shaîl not ask them, to
work more than eight hours a day. There
is a penalty of $200 for non-compliance witli
the Bill, or eix months, or both. If this
Bill had beeii read carefully and considered in viewv of the cases cited in the Privy
nembers of this
Council, a guod niany
House wouhd have come to the conclusion
that parliament has the right te pass this
legisiation. Of course we ahl know that the
provincial legishature has the right to legislate as to the number of bours any clasa
of the community may work, in any
of the provinces. This Bill applies simply
to the works on which. the government ih
the contracting party and sure]y, in making a contract with any one, the goverlment has the same power as I have. If I
make a contract with any one to build a
bouse foir me, I can put a clause in the
contract that the men employed on that
work shahl work eight hours a day. Surely the government should have as much
power as any individual in this country.
Unless one is opposed to the measure and
brings forward arguments to defeat it,
I do not think this constitutional question should be raised as against its passage. Another remark of the hon. gentie.
inan fromn Halifax was that the occupation
of bouse building was a healthy exercise.

obliged ta carry heavy burdens to a considerable height during ten consecutive hours in
many cases. I find on reading the debate
ini the other House that the Minister of
Labour was entirely favourable ta the measure, and he said during the discussion
that hie would have introduced it as a government measure only he. did not deaire ta
detract from the glory pertaining ta the
member front Maisonneuve, as labour representative in the House of Commons,
and lie thought 'it was only f air ta let him
enjoy whatever credit there was in introdueing this measure.
Hon. Mr. POWER-There is a question
of order involved here. It is forbidden ta
refer ta the debates in the other Hlouse of
parliament during the current session. I
neyer insist very rigorously on that. but
the hion. gentleman is rather abusing what
one7 would cail a privilege of referring ta
these debates. He bas undertaken to point
out what the minister thinks and what lie
said. The hion. gentleman will mee that it
is flot proper ta cite in this House what a
minister said on the subject in the other
Hause.
Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN-I amn very sorry
indeed that 1 have transgressed the rule,
and I shaîl try to avoid doing so ag-ain; but
I was given a bad example. My hon.
friend '
whose speech 1 arn trying to answer the
best way I can, stated that hie liad read
very carefully the discussion in the other
Hause, and as the hion. member is an old
parliamentarian, 1 thought I was safe in
following hlm, and probably 1 followed
himt too closely.
Hon. Mr. POWER-I did not reler to
what they said. I referred to what they
did not say.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Then we will depart altogether from opinions expressed
ini the other House snd proceed on
broader lines. IL was neyer intended by
Providence that men should toil continually; it was intended rather that there
should be some leisure even ta the labouring man, and that a man should have at

least a few hours each day to speud with
his wife and chuldrcn. I have myself
worked ten consecutîve hours in a day, and
have found the time very long. Yau have
to édd to that the time it takes ta reacli
work in the morning, and the time consumed in returning home. It is a strange
thing that men who enter this Chamber and
breathe this atmaosphere, seem ta forget that few of us .were born with
silver spoons in our mouths. On the
Canadian
Paciflc
railway
survey, I
had ta commence work at daylight
very often, in the fail, and finish sbout
dark, and reacli camp after dark. I have
also been connected with the lumber business. My hon.. friend from Russell <Hon.
Mr. Edwards) lias also been engaged in the
lumber business for a long time, and 1 venture to gay lie lias -sometimes worked ten
liours a day.. Mill time used to be eleven
hiours, and if we can in any way decrease
the number of haurs these people 'work,
especially if they are working by the hour,
no une is put to any extra cost except tliemselves. If workingmen can have a little
lelsure time, tliey will have an opportunity af reading. improving their *ninds.
and developing their intelligence, and
I believe I arn on]y pleading the cause of
hurnanîty in assuming that the government
of this country should be a model employer
and sliould, in giving contracts, require that
eîght hours shall be a day's work. Very
few of us now work more than' eight hours
a day, not even at the liard work that I
have described just now. If any leisure
moments were left to the working man, they
could develop those other faculties whicli
they
have been
endowed
with by
Divine Providence. When a man goes
to work at seven lie must rise about
five o'clock.
He may have

that hie may have to chop the 'wood and
liglit the fire-and in the dark winter, rising at five o'clock, hie leaves for his work
at a quarter or half-past six, because lie
must be at lis work some time befare seven
o'clock, and at the appointed hour if hie
does not punch a certain machine lie loses
his day. In large cities there -may be obstructions in the street car service, and a
man may be delayied on his way to work,

and if he is not at his post at the appointed
hour the door is closed and the day's -work
is lost, and he possibly rnay find that lus
job is lest also. He toils ail day from seven
u.ntil noon., At noon he is very seldon
able to return to bis home. He rnust take
his dinner, a cold dinner, out of the ordinary workingman's dinner pail. Thank God,
since the Liberal party came into power he
lias had a full dinner pail.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-May I ask the
hon. member who is this gentleman who is
auffering ail these disabilities?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-I-am not surprised that the hon, gentleman does not know
anything about the full dinner pail. When
the Conservative party was in power the
workingman had no full dinner pail.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I arn asking who
is the gentleman wbo is suffering ahl these
wrongs?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-The labouring

should work, but I also believe that work,
especially for a governinent, shall be made
as easy as possible. I du nlot believe the
conditions should be the same here as in
the neighbouring republic. Take, for instance, Gary, wbich I visited the other day.

walking about the streets absolutely lest.
These men working day la aad day out

not live long at that kind of work. I do
nlot believe in such drudgery. They sbould
h-ave, as we have in this country, the Suaday for rest, and if the eigh t-hour day
should be adopted, they miglit have some
time for study. The goverameat of Canada is endeavouring in every way to foster
true citizenship, and how can that be better accomplisbed than by educating the
people. How can tbey get any 'education

time. If parliament adopts this measure
the government w ill become a model employer, and will be doing good throughout
the country by setting a proper example.
This principle has been acknowledged ln
British Columbia for years, and British
Columbia is going ahead. When I was in
Britisb Columbia last summer, I saw men
%vorking there under the eight hour systein,
and I really believed that during that time
they accornplished as rnuch work as workmnen usually do 'who work ten hours. They
could keep up the effort for eight hours at
a rate whlcb they could not possibly attempt la a ten hour day. The principle of
the eight hour day is a live issue in England, Gerrnany and Australia. If it is to
be adopted in Canada, we sbould accept
the principle bere. We have been told
that ln Toronto a great many of the build-

MNAR4DH 28, 1911
ing trades have already adopted the eight
hour day. This Bill has been before the
House oft Commons for four or five years.
An inquiry took place lasting 19 days last
session, and a mass oft evidence was collected. That evidence went to establish
that the eight hour aystem was preferable
te ten hours per day, and a Bill based on
the information elicited by that committee
was introduced in the House. This is not
such a drastic measure a-, some suppose,
neit-her is it very costly. Evidently, if
the men are working by the hour, the cost
of a day's work is no greater. Then again,
even if they are working by the day, the two
hours are not absolutely lost. I have often
secn men who were working on a survey
assigned a certain amount of work which
was considered a fair day's vork, and toldk
«when you get through this, job you will
ha through for the day.' These men worked
with a will, and accomplished as much in
a few hours as they would have sccomplished in ten houràs under ordinary conditions. Therefore, the time would not afl
be leat., because it is evident that a man
cannot keep up the same strain for ten
hours as he can when 'working for eight
heure only. Then there are trades, for instance, like that iu which the hon, gentleman from Rideau (Hon. Mr. Edwards>
is engaged-the lumber business. In a sawmill a man bas to work at a certain rate.
He cannot stop, because ha is driven by
the machinery. He is working in front of

it le the long hour system that wrenches
thec heart and quenches hope, for without
strength and health hope fades away. In
other days, the ten and even the twelve
hour struggle at commercial activity did
notcail for as much wear and tear of manhood and womanhood as the eight hour
grind of our times.*
The fever of couipetition is greater with
us than it was with our fathers. -They were
terrned slow. We move along at a more
rapid stride. Thieir demand upon labour
was moderate. Our demand upon labour
is,
in too xnany cases, furious, and thought for
the physical welfare of our workers is in
too many cases entirely ignored. The pro-

visions of this Bill, be it remembered, but
asks us to crystallize into law what already
Lxists to a very great extent in practice.
While it may be claimed that in certain
lines of activity the ten-hour day ie none
too seve.re, not at ail unreasonable, in the
g-reat majority of trades iL calîs for too great
a strain upon physical energy, the capital
stock of manhood. In a discussion o! this
nature we are toc, often reminded of the excesses- of the labour unions. I will not
deny that occasions have arisen when a
blot was attached to certain labour organisations because of causelees strike and
scenes of violence. I hold no brief for
those who organize -a etrike when such a
course was unjustiflable. I hold no brief
for the workers who will ignore the Lemieux
Act, and enter upon a seriaus disturbance
of existing conditions without just cause.
I hold no brief for the atone thrower who
sets law and order at deflance. I hold no
brief for the mnan who will not give lieed
to reason, and who is ready to enter upon
a rnaddened conflict with hs employer to
attain that te which hie is not juàtly entitled. I hold no brief for the man who has
not even a bowing acquaintance with the
golden rule, and whose motto is te get ail

But these are only incidents in unionismi,

will be matters of history-when the employer and employed will understand each

To hasten that day, let us put this Bill
upon the statute-book. It will opèn a new
era for those to whom Canada owes not a

spent themselves in putting etone upon
atone to rear this great nation in which. we
ail take sucli a glory. Many elemente have
contrived to erect this great edifice-the

Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-Hea.r, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-We do flot
print the evidence in the Senate Debates.
The discussion has no special importance
once we have reached a conclusion, and
those lengthy discussions which sometimes
take place on certain Bills of divire
couid be well eliminated fromn our printed
report. I have also been of the opinion
that the discussions which take place in
the Committee of the Whole should be considerably curtailed. I have looked over the
reports ýof the House of Lords, and I find
that the debates are reported in fuUl. in
the House; but when questions are submitted to the Committee of the Whoie there
is merely a synopsis of the remarks of
members, just sufficient to explain the
reason for an amendment, and giving
practicaily the essence of the argument
made by the parties moving or opposing
the arnendment. I arn convinced that if
we worked on the saine lines, we would
have considerable of a savîng, and that
we wouid thus dispose of those occasional
complaints as to the French edition of the
report being late, hecause if our transiat,
ors had so much less to do, I am convinced our present staff would be ample.
even for the last two or three weeks of
the session, when the work is heavier. 01
course, this has nothing ta do with the
important question of limiting our debates
or saving time to members of thia House.

MARCH 29, 1911
We are obiiged so often to mark time
while waiting for the other Chamber to get
through its work, that my motion has not
for its principal object the saving of time.
But, as 1 arn on that subjeet. and as we are
obliged to -mark time whi-le work is being
expedited in the other Chambér, I think it
is perbaps proper that I ehould give rny
opinion as to what should be done to expedite the business of parliarnent, which
concerne, us as 'well as it dos the other
Chaznber. I have not yet been reconciled
to the idea of the closure being adopted in
our Coinmons, but it seems ta -me that,
with more tban 200 members in the lower
hanse and the expectation of an increase,
somethîng should be done to limit the time
devoted to certain discussion&, eeipecially
when public interest lias been more than
served by the discussion that has gone on
up to a certain point. As a muatter of fact,
we are expediting the affairs of -the country,
exclusively from a public point af view.
When the public interest hais been thoroughly satisfied, and when a question has
been sifted, and laid bare before the people
and befdrYe parliament, it seems ta me that
at that mo<ment we -shou.ld take means ta
limit the discussion in- the House ai Comnions. I have wondered, if before resarting
to the closure, as they have it in the House
of Gommons in England, same scheme aucb
as the iollowing could mot be adopted-I
mention it bc-cause there bas been a question of bath Houses ai parliarnent jaining
in a committee ta suggest some means ta
better expedite public business in the two
branches of parlianient. For the disposai
of important questions could not a rule be
made by which the six first speakers would
be given au unlimited tume ta fully exhaust
the question, and the six speakers following
them be restricted ta an hour each, aiter
whi-ch every speaker would be limited ta
ans-hall hour? Under such conditions a
debate could flot go mucb beyond two
weeks. I know that in the American Congrese it is graduaily limîted by a sliding
scals ta five-minute speeches, anid et a certain -point the closure is adopted. But,
without resorting ta -the closurs, is it not
time that the parliament of Canada should
ses te placing a limit ta speeches that are

delivered in parliainent for outside consumptionP In a long, important debate,
many members w-ant ta go on record, and
instesd of addressing themsedves ta the
question before the Hanse they address
tbemselves ta their constituents. They viii
not lirnit themselves ta arguments that are
new, they want to maks a set speech cavering thie whole question, for distribution ta
their sîsetors. That is a great evil vhich
should be cured, and the suggestion I nov
maks %wauld tend ta remedy it. We are as
interssted in limiting the length of the
session as is the other branch af parlusment, and I arn convinced that if some
scheme were adopted by 'which a certain
number af speeches were allowed ta be
freely made and those which follawed vere
limited ta a decent length, there wauld be
a decided improvement. It seems ta me
that the law ai decency itseilf should bring
home ta members the fact that alter a certain number ai speeches have been delivered on a subjeot, a speech langer than an
hour is unwarranted, and that aiter a dozen
speeches have been made on any question
tbe member who vanta ta throw soins new
liglit an it might weil be limited ta haîf an

joint committee, and it seems ta me that
a resolutian should be edopted by this
House, asking the other brandi ai parliament ta jain in sucli a wark ta disouss the
better exnedition ai the busine*ss oi parliament. I may be ansiered by some members of the House of Commons that if sucb
regulations were made hall an hour would
be insufficienLt for a niember who would
like ta set fuilv bis views before his electors. This objection cauld be met by silowing the member ta gîve ta parliament a
summary ai bis speech and ta send bis
manuscript ta ' Hansard ' ta be printed for
the benefit ai bis constituents. These are
ideas which passed thraugh rny mind when
I was examîning the question as ta what
miglit be donc in the way oi limiting tbe
reports of aur debates. It seems ta -me ws
should, at aIl events, adapt the motion
which I have moved ta investigats the question cd limiting aur debates by eliminating
discussions an divorce and reducing the reporting af aur discussions in committes.

purpose. It surely could flot have been intended that the time of parliament should
be oocupied by demagogic speeches, made
only to infiame the public niind of the
country. There is the cfurth'er consideration
of the expense involved in thus making use
of H-ansard ' as a parliamentary institution. A measure, or a criterien that we
have o~f the value which is pdaced upon
speeches -made from time to time by <nembers of parliament is the synopsis which we
fInd in thse public press from day to day
as to what takes place in this Chamber.
We in this Chamber have appropriated a
very s'ubstantieal sum. for the purpose of
disseminating te the press*cf this country
a synopsis cf the deliberations that take
place from Lime te time. And what do we
find! We find that the value placed by
the press upon these deliberatiens is indicated in about a quarter of a column in
the ordinary newspaper cf the day, and
somnetimies not even that. It bas always
been a maLter cf regret Le me that the gevernrent is net sufficiently courageous te
take, up the subject cf revising our parliamentary system. Our parliamentary system sl breaking down. Our parliaxnentary
system is net carrying out the object for
which iL was designed.
When we go
back te its enigin, we can very well
conceive the necessity of long speeches having been made in the early history of
parliament. They were made nt à Lime
%Yhen the liberties of the people Nv'ere at
stake. Long speeches were made in the
way cf wrestîng these liberties from the aggression and oppression cf the Crown. In
the evolution cf the parliamentary system.
we find that ' Hansard ' bas become an
established institution.
Parliament, now,
instead of promptly disposing of its business, the same as a business corporation,
or an aggregaticn cf business men with
similar cbjects before them, will takie from
six months te a longer period, and then
very unsatisfactonily dispose of the business that parliament was summoned te censider. Without casting any reflectiens upon
the parliament cf Canada, let us look back
and review within our minds the length
of time occupied in dealing with subjects
which are really cf ne very great importance, se far as the deliberations which take

place upon them are concerned. Those discussions are net designed te produce conviction in the minds cf members, or te assist them in coming te a conclusion. The
twe sides. cf the House are arr ayed one
against the other, and it seema te beceme a
ccntest as to which side shall occupy thse
greater portion cf time in discussing a subject, and upon thse conclusion cf which you
wif find both parties at thse same point as
when they began. Take for instance thse
disposai cf thse vast expenditures cf this
country; we are disposing of one hundred
millions annually. How are they disposed
cf? Can you conceive cf any business corporation dispesing cf one hundred million
dollars annually in the same way as we discuss thse supplies voted by parliament? IL
wculd be a burlesque if thse directorate or
representatives cf a great financial corporation st around a large table and made
such speeches upon thse expenditure cf
mnney, as representatives of parliament are
doing to-day. Is there any geod reason
why thse expenditure of Lthe Dominion of
Canada should not be considered mn the
same way as an undertaking in which
a financial aggregation of capitalists might
be interestedp Take for instance our Public Accounts Committee in thse House cf
Commons.
If any hon, gentleman weuld
attend that very important committee,
in which investigations are made at
to expenditures of public mcney, he would
find both political parties arrayed against
each other. TIse economies which should
be practised in making public'expenditures
are net being considered fer a moment by
the dominant party.
Thse expenditure cf
the people's money is net thus the consideratien ivhich is in view. But the consideraLlen in view seems Le, be on ene side the
suppression cf information, and on other
side as to 'which can extract mest informatien touching any public expendi 'ture. Fancy
any business cerporation disposing of their
business ini that way. I say iL is high time
that the gevernment cf thse day-I de netý
care what government it may be-shouldl beý
sufficiently courageous te appoint a cemmittee composed ef representatives cf bothsides cf the House te take up in a patriotiemanner, and consider.how thse business oe

SENA TE
the country can be best disposed of. So far
as ' Hansard ' is concerned, I can see
uothing profitable to be gained by its continuance. Is there any gentleman posseased of se much anxiety as to suppose that
the public.will turn over the pages of ' Hansard' to see whiat he has been saying.

DOMVILLE-Nobody

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-If anybody did
read it, I venture to say hie would neyer
regard it as the well considered opinions
of even thofle who speak upon a eubject.
1 therefore would suggest to my hion. friend
that his resolution should be of a more
comprehensive character than it is. I
should like to see a resolution adopted to
consider the whole subject flot only touching the limitation of the officiai reports,
but the continuance of ' Hansard,' and
the further subject of dealing with a more
desirable practice in parliament for the
better administration of public affairs.
Hon. Mr. ROSS-I had the honour of
being associated with the committee of the
House of Commons when the ' Hansard '
of that Chamber wss first instituted. The
leader of the House will remember that.
after serious discussion, it was determined
that the speeches of the day should be
perpetuated in that form. That was in
1875. ' Hansard ' was then comparatively
small. I think its early publications consisted of one or two volumes, small
cempared 'with what they are to-day.,
extending ovýer four or five large volumes.
I do not agree with the hon. gentleman
from Calgary that the «Hansard ' of either
House should be discontinued. I would
vote for its continuance for a variety of
reasons. There is some force in the objection that it may be an incentive to
some members te extend their remarks
beyond a reasonable lirnit. Sometimes hion.
members will extend thieir remarks beyond reasenable limits when there is no
' Hansard,' but that incentive, if withdrawn, might lirait the length of the session. It must be remembered, however,
that there is much more business done in
Canada now than there was thirty years
ago. We have to deal with ¶Iarger questions, and a greater variety of them, and
lion. Mr. R~OSS (Middlesex).

it is only reasonable to suppose that our
sessions will be more extended now than
they were thirty years ago, although I
believe ,the extension of the session is
beyond reison and beyond the limaits necessary for efficient service either of members of the government or members of the
House of Commons. Still I do flot see
how we are going to save se much of the
time of the House by abolishing the officiai reporting as we would save if the
other branch cf parliament would adopt
some system of closure.
It must corne
some time. They have reached that point
in every large representative body in thé
wox'Id. In the United States they reachied
it many years age. The House cf Representatives now consista of 400 members.
and when it was much smaller they ad-.
opted a system of curtailing the debates.
It la agreed by the committee which manages the debates that. so much time shall
be given for the discussion of a certain
question. That time may be taken up by
one, two or three members, or it may be
divided among as many members as the
leaders of the opposite Bides agree upon.
One may speak for an hour and a
hialf, another for an hour, and another for ten minutes, but they must
keep within the limait,
dividing the
time as they see fit. In that way, when
the hour or two hours Iimit elapses, a
vote is taken. In the English Heuse of
Commons a certain number cf hours areallotted to a certain debate. and when that
time elapses a vote is taken under the
closure system. A method cf that kind in
the other Chamber would no doubt lirait
discussion, and the suggestion of my hion.
friend who opened the debate is very appropriate. Turning to this Chamber, if I
may be allowed te say, as a new
member, I have neyer seen a single
occasion in which it appeared to be necessary to adept the closure. Not in my experience has a -single speech exceeded an
heur or an hour snd a quarter since I
have had the honour of eccupyîng a seat
here. Net in a single case has a debate
been extended until it was completely exhauated or until the members were exhausted by a prolonged debate. Take the
debate on Naval Defence. I took the
trouble te compare the time devoted te the

MARCH 29, 1911

debate in the two Houses, and, speaking irom memory, without having the
figures exactly before me, this is the
result: In the. session of 1910 there
were 8,892 calumns af the Gommons
' Hansard.'. 0f that nearly 2,000 were
devoted to the discussion of public
B'ills -and legisiation, 2,000 to the debate
on the naval question, and the other
4,000 to debates on strategical questions.
sncb as motions by members to bring certain questions before the House, or motions
on which ta base political platforms in the
future. One-fourth of the time of the
flouse of Gommons was taken up with the
discussion of public Bis and necessary
legisiation, and three-fourths af the timè
in the discussion of motions of a political
character, leaving out the question of naval
defence as one. Putting it la another
form: on the question of naval defence
ninety-four members spake on the subject of the motion, thirty-one in cammittee
and seventeen speeches at different times.
Goming to the Senate what do we find?
The Debates contained 970 pages, of wbich
479 were devoted to the discussion of pub.'
lie Bi!lls that came before the House, and
the other four hnndred odd pages were
devoted to the discussion of motions, ruies
of order, divorce Bills and other niatters
of no public importance. Putting it in
another form, one-fourth of the time of the
House af Gommons was given-ieeving out
the naval defence Bill-to questions of a
purely political or strategical character.
One half the time of the Senate was given.
to public Bis and private legislation, s0
that practically we d(evoted twice as much
time ta the real work of -parliament, that
is legisiation, as was devoted by the Hlouse
of Gommons. 1 do not quite agree witb
the remark: which bas been made that
members of another Chamber are censurable because they speak to the electors
from the House of Gommons. The Hanse
of Gommons is the grand parade of the
politiciein. If he is flot able to give vent
ta his feelings there, where can hie; and
if hie bas a message, where can hie deliver
it more effectually than in the other Chamber if it is reported? If. he prep ares a
speech that le af value for bis electars it
is valua-ble for the members af the House
af Gommons. I agree with wbat bas been
said, that after a certain time a debate is

practically exhausted, but every member
of the House ai Gommons bas equal rigbts.
Why should one, unless it be in the public
interest, be closed before hie delivers himself, rather than another? Nevertheless, I
believe there is an educational value in
those speeches, and if a member does d*eliver a speech with a view ta its subsequerit publication for the use of bis electors, tbe charge is not a very beavy one
on the treasury, and the electors are benefited ta that extent. The House ai Gommons bias other purposes ta serve besides
legisiatian. At ail events ever since there
was a Hanse of Gommons, it bas been
used as a platform ta educate the canstituencies witb wbicb it is particularly
charged; and in educating tbem, speeches
have ta be delivered How are tbey ta be
educated if the speeches are not delivered?
And if tbey are flot reparted the education
does not go on. If tbey are reported, even
in 'HRansard,' the work ai education does
go on. There are great public issues that
are nlot brougbt before tbe country in any
other way. The rigbt hion, leader of the
Honse wili remember wben the National
Policy was before ns lin 1876, witb what
fulinees the speeches o! that time were reported, and how voluminous and how extensive was the circulation' cf those

course, ta aur view cf the question, these
speeches were circulated ta the detriment
o! the Liberal party. Tbey were largely af,
an educational character. Tbey were valuable then, and they are valuable even ta
this day. I do not agree eitber with tbe
remark made by the hion, leader of the
opposition, that 'Hlansard,' as a matter of
record, is nat valuable. I say it is invaluable. 1 had occasion more than once ta
consuit the debates af the bTuse of Lards
during the iast two years, and fromn those
debates one gets information wbich cennet be got in any ather way. For instance,
in ten -or fifteen years bence, bow valuable

way. This country must remember that
we are making history in parliament, and
that history should be recorded, and in no
other way can it. be more fully recorded
than by speeches delivered by hion. gentle*men in another place and in this Chainber.
We know trom experience, we know from
*the speeches we hear in this House, we
know from speeches we read that have been
delivered in the other House, that these
speeches ha've cost infinite labour on the
part o! the speakers. Why shoiild that
labour be wastedP Take this discussion un
reciprocity; how valuable that discussion
will be twenty or thirty years hence. I had
the pleasure of reading the discussion on
the reciprocity agreement in the United
States House of ]Representatives and the
Senate, when the Act of 1854 was repealed.
I read that within the last few dsys. It is
a most illuminating discussion. I neyer understood the question as well before as I
'do now, from reading that debate. I thought
-the Act of 1854 was repudiated as a mnatter
,of pique on the part -of the Americans.
.Surely there was pique, but any person
who reads the debate by the members of
the Senate and House o! Representatives
will see tliat there were other things that
weighed on their minds, and reasons that
were neyer known to -me until I read the
reports ot that debate. It is important for
us as Canadians that our deliberations and
judgment, in the samne way, should be put
on record, so that those who corne after us
will know the methods by which we m-oved
and the tacts that înifuenced our judgment,
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Middlesex).

and the evidence by which we came to certain conclusions.
Having learned these
tacts, they will be better able to shape their
policy and draw their conclusions. I do
not think we should. discontinue the Senate
Debates.' The Senate is flot very prominent in the publie mmnd, not more so than
it ought to be.
Abolish our officiaý
' Debates~' nd we lose another step forward. We shall be driven back a sItep or
two into the obscurity which they say we
are suifering frein at the present moment.
With the Senate 'Debates ' obliterated and
the official reporting of the House o! Comnmons running at the rate of several volumes
per annuin, their importance will be stili
greater than ours, end to that extent -we
shall suifer. If there is to be abolition in
one House, let there be abolition in the
other. 1 would say, let us not abolish our
own. I agree with my hon. friend wbi;cl
opened this debate, that we rnight eliminate
the debates on divorce. They ought to bt
eliminated. I agree with my hon. lriend
that we rnight condense our report of debats in Committee of the Whole, although
it is not very lengthy. However, it .might
be compressed somewhat. We might compress sometimes the prolonged discussions
we have on points of order, froin which ne
great good can arise. Our rules of debate
and the parliainentary manual guide us
sufficiently in regard to' points of order
without eeveral pages being taken up by
need-less discussion in that regard. With
the exception of these three items, our
officiai report I think is a f air compilation
of the debates of this House. I think it is
very instructive. I have read back numbers of our ' Debates ' since I came to this
Chamber, in order to ascertain the views
of the Senate in days gone by on public
questions. I have found thein very valuable. I think we would be eliminating trom
the records of the parliament cd Canada a
source of information for which posterity
will not thank us. The cost is not very
large. We are not worrying people unnecessarily with prolonged speeches. As
a mule, our speeches are to the purpose, and

subject, and on the properties of parliamentary usage, and goes against the endurance

they neédlessly prelong the session. Perhaps al ter this voie irom us, their ways
may be anended and the proprieties of debate, and the endurance of parliament, will
be considered. I believe that a meeting oi
the joint committee of this House on the
question 'would serve a useful purpose; but,
in the -meantime, I am content that this
notice should go ta the Debates Committee,
and some repart be produced that might
help ta relieve the situation ta a certain exLent, if any relief is required..
Han.- Mr. MACDONALD (British Columbia>-The hon. gentleman who -noved the
resolution.for the shortening af speeches
and eliminating some of the debates from
the official report, omitted. the thing which
I think is deserving cf consideration. If
any member of this House, month alter
month, and week alter week, and day alter
day, brîngs in an avalanche ai questions
which. may be relevant or irrelevant, the
House or the Debates Committee ought ta
consider whether they should eliminate auch
questions from the ' Debates.' When the
committee are considering this matter, they
ought ta take this point into oonsideratian.
When questions are put without any debate, and withaut the House being told what
they are for, or what use they are ta the
country or ta anybody, then I think the
cammittee could iairly blot them from the
records ai the House.
Han. Mr. ROCHE-Very many excellent
sermons do not eifect their abject completely or ta the extent designed by the
preacher, because the audience is nat there.
That is the condition of the present discussion. The affenders are in the Hause
af Commons. We do nat reach them, they
do not hear us. Sa fax as I have observed,
there are no transgressions in this House.
The discussions are concise. They are net
more expansive than is requiaite ta carry
out public business. We are not sinners.
I have observed in the House of Caanmons

ýa

when questions of this character are
brought up, ithat the gentlemen who speak
most frequently and -who speak the longest
are those who are prone to, advocate and
propose measures ta curtail our debates,
and to close out those who may have made
a rather long speech, but who may have
probably epoken but once in the session.
6ome speakers are more prolix than others.
Some have the happy faculty of being able
to condense their remarks. It would not
be sale ta leave that matter ta the judgment
of a reporter, becau-se, naturally, the leading members would occupy almost the
whole of the space bec-ause of their position
and from their riatural -weight, and the
reflex of the debate would be, perhaps, onie
hundred pages of the sentiments of the
prominent rnembers of the House and a
line or two might be given ta a *mexnber
not sa- prominent, but whose sentiments
might be worthy of record -and ought ta be
maintained. There is another consideration
of this question that might present itseli
ta us, that the reporters af the press arei
not gentlemen of the highest judgment, and,
perhaps, have not been selected for their
knowledge, skili or experience, because
some of the papers have reporters in parliament who are chosen for the amallxiess
of their salary and the urgency with which
they press their services. The value that
the press sets upon political discussion may.
be estimated from the papers in this city.
They may devote a space af three or four
lines ta the prafaund deliberations ai the
Senate, and three or four pages ta the very
salemn subject of hockey matches and basebail contests, and the portraits of some
particularly athletic individual in some
obscure city in the United States with4 a
full description af his misses and catches.
We ought ta aiford every cppartunity for
members of the House af Conimons ta address their constituents. As has been remarked, that is the Medium through 'which
they canvey their sentiments. Frequently
the press garbies a member's remarks.
Everybody is entitiled ta have his sentiments properly recarded either ini this
House or in the House cf Commons. If the
remarks are candensed, then they do nat
represent the sentiments and, deliverance

456

t£ENATE

of the speaker. A great many people iný
the .country miglit flot agree with the sentiments of any speaker, and the press is
sometimes atixieus to pervert the remarks
of certain speakers and present observations whîch they did not make, or place an
interpretation upon them which they neyer
intended. Therefere, Ait l for their protection that the remarks cd public men shouid
be recorded at length, se that they mayl
appear before their constituencies in a
proper light and not as represented by
garbled or perverted reports by penny-aliners in the press. A representative of
the people lias had a very onerous election
to run. He lias had vigorous opponents.
AiU that he bas done or said mnay be misrepresented, and lie lias the gratification,
after lie reaclies the Gommons, of making
a deliverance before parliament and befere
lis constituents. How are we te know.
that lie has turned out to be an impressive
orator unless lis sentiments are recorded,
and iow are tliey te be recorded if the
reports of tlie debates are to be confined te tlie utterances of three or four prominent menP Some litman beinga are lazy,
tliey will net take the trouble te make a
speecli, and the remarks cf tlie leading
men must be general. Tliey go over the
surface of the subject at large, but tlie real
valuabie information is contained in the
remarks cf tlie members who take up
apecial poihts and present tlie ibearing of
these points upen -local special interest.
Tliat is the valuable part of the debate,
and it aise fits men for positions in parliament. If tlie man had net the incentive
that lie would seme day rise te a higher
position, lie wouid be a disgrace te bis
constituency and parliament. -It is ambition tliat brings eut tlie good there xnay

with mani that develops the best qualities
of intellectual oratory, and therefore let
net the arguments of the leading men

leader of the opposition, and a 'ew gentlemen wlio monopelize the time of parliament te a certain extent, be recorded, but

Hon., Mr. BEIQUE-I quite agree with
Most cf the remarks made by the hon.
gentleman from Middlesex (Hon. Mr.
Rosa), especiaily this, that the House cf
Gommons la the natural platform fer the
members to a.ddress themselves te the
country at large, and I am net dispcsed te
quarrel with them, as far as a reasonable
latitude is concerned. But, I quite agree
that the debates in parliament are becoming altogether tee long, and that tliey wvil
entail failure of our parliamentary institutions. If the present waste cf time is te
be continued, ne meti o! substance wiil be
found ready to devote tlieir tume te parliamentary lufe. It will be left almost entirely te peliticians who make it a profession, and it will bring f ailure te parliamentary institutions. We have, under
the British constitution, whidh we consider
te be, a.nd whidl isl the best forni cf constitution wliere parties divided by politics
are recognized as being necessary, and* a
good thing; but party spirit must be tempered, te a certain extent, by members cf
parlianient wlio have always in view the
interest of the country at large ratlier than
party intereat, and if we arrive at a condition cf things wien both parties are coniposed exclusively, or almost exclusivelY,
cf politiciane, and only politiciaris, I say
it will be the werst condition for the country. It la perfectly well known that in
years gene by, and one has nef te go furtlier back than ten years, the proceedinga
cf pasqiament were published by almost
ail the daily papers in the country. Now
tliey are net published, and why? Because the community at large do net take
any intereat in proceedings in parliament,
owing te the way the reports are extended.
It would take the whele of one's Lime te
peruse the parliamentary- debates. We
find thst tIe best cf those papers give
a column or haîf a coluin te the reporting cf speeches which. are made in parlisment, instead of reporting the speeches
extensively as tîey used te do. Public
opinion demanda that, and tIe public opinion cf botli parties on the question is that
the'lengili cf the'sessien sîeu'id be limited

MARCH 29, 1911

as much as possible, and that the speeches
in parliament be limited as much as passible. I quite agree with the suggestion.
that the best way is the clasure, that sa
many days or so many hours be given ta
discussing one question, according to the
importance of that question, and that
when the time has elapsed, the vote be
taken. I hope the Canadian parliainent
will adopt the closure as an impravement
on the existing system. In this House we
have not suffered, and the country bas not
muffered from long speeches. I arn quite
in accord with the motion made by the
hon. gentleman from De Lorimier. In
iact, as eariy, as 1898, 1 was moving in
that direction. A great deal of expense
would be saved if the reporting af aur
debates was curtaiied to a reasonable extent; not by way ai ieaving ont the substance of a, speech, but by eliminating
what is ùnnecessary and that shou]d neot

THE USE 0F OIL FUEL-PRODUCTION
AN]D DEMAN]).
The empicyment cf ail as fuel on a commercial scale had. its beginning over 40 years
ago in the steamer services af the Caspian
Sea, but it is only vithin comparatively recent years that any considerable extension cf
the applications cf liquid fuel has been reported. This slow growth in the use of oil as a
heating agent has been primarily due ta the
unoertainty cf obtaining regular supplies,
and i.n apite of ail assertions ta the oantrary

that fear is not yet entirely
It is true that many new sources of
supply are being exploîted, that the supplies available are steadily increasing. and
that,~ awing ta the war of rates between
involved, the price
the great interests
of liquid fuel je coxnparatively low. These
conditions explain the growing favour with
which ail fuel is nov regarded, but in
any attempt ta forecast the future regard
muet be had to many other considerations.
It vill be appropriate in the first place to
discue the question cf supply. The United
States is still by far the largest single iproducer. her percentage of the total production

put in 1909, the increase in 1910 ie from
54,433,000 barrels in the previous year to
75,000,000 barrels, which more than counterbalanced the falling-off in the output from
other states. The figures for other countries
show that the Ruesian output ie steadily increasing. and there is a ruse in the production
of Sumatra, Java, and Bornea which is very
satisfactory. In other respects the table
may be ieft to tell its own story.
British Sources of Supply.
It is impossible flot to be impreeeed by the
amali sources of eupply in British territory,
and thie je a factor of supreme importance in
connection with the use of liquil fuel in warships. The reason, given for the apathy hitherto displayed in opening up the oil supplies
of the British colonies is that the restrictions
eought to be imposed have forced capitaliste
to turn to other fields of cil investment. That
stringent precautions are necessary at the
present timue, when some attempts are being
made ta obtain capital for worthless enterprises, will be readily acknowledged, but any
attempt ta check the legitimate exploitation
of oil lande in British territory would be a
matter of regret, and where necessary the
bonds of red tape should be relaxed. Attempts
are naw being made to develop the ail resaurces of British North Barneo, follawing the
success attained in Dutch Borneo, and further
wcrk within the limita of the empire, an
sound financial lines, would be an excellent
mave. The importance which je being attached by*European powers ta securing sources of ail eupply within their own bordprs je
emphasised by the decision of the Italian gev.
ernment ta subeidize the industry, and this
leade ta a consideration of the special uses for
ail fuel which are attracting attention at the
present time.
For Warships and Merchant VessaIs.
The employment of ail fuel in ehips of war
goes back for many years. The famaus report
of Rear Admirai Melville, dealing with experimenta carried out for the United States
Navy, was issued as long since as 1902. Once the
teohnical difficulties had been overcome, the advantages following the use of ail fuel for warship propulsion were so abvions-there is no
need ta reiterate them here--that its extended
empioyment was bound ta follow, ana all the
recently buiît American destroyers have beau
designed ta burn cil fuel exclusively, while
the newer battleships use ail fuel as an auxiliary ta coal. The axperimants carried ont
by the British Admiralty were also conclusive
as ta the advantage of ail fuel, and the hesitancy in mare generally adopting it, as in
the case of ather Enropean countries, bas
been due ta the fact that reliance wauld have
ta be placed on supplies fram averseas. The
difficulty could be, end* indeed has been, partially overcome by the provision of large cil
storage. but the position je still vastly different from that which obtains in the Uinited
States, where the native sources of cil are sa
large. In Germany, toc, although the production of ail at the present time je comparatively small, it is ettadily increasing, and the
gavernment is watching this developmnent with
the keeneet intereat. France, Austria. Italy
and Ruesia are alsa mavngc in the direction
of an extended use cf ail for warship propulsion.

More recent develapments in the maritime
field relata ta the use of ail fuel in marchant
shipp bath for staam-raising purpases and
also in internai combustion enginas, %Yhich,
as already rainted out in 'The Times,' are
naw baing buiît in larger units for marine
requirements. Several of the large passenger
vessels sailing from American western ports
make regular use of ail fuel, and a special
correspandent cf «The Times,' lately on the
west coast of South America,- noted a considarable development in the use of ail fuel in
connection nat cnly with steamer services, but
British shipowners

are now giving special attention* ta the arnploymant cf cil engines for marine propulsion,
snd once tha initial difficulties are surmaounted, the field opened would be a vat ana.
Russia alane je said ta use over 1,500,000 tans
of cil in steamehips.
Railway and other Requirementa.
On railways the employment af liquid fuel
in preferance ta coal je makinz rapid strides.
In this field, as in others, by reasan of the
geographical position of the railroads in relation ta cil supply, the United States has
taken the lead. In the year 1909, the latest
date for which accurate records are available,
the consumptian of ail fuel on United States
raiîroads was nearly 20 million barrels. The
cil generally used is crude petraleum. In
Russia the railways are said ta be using aver
8,000,000 tans cf ail annually for railway purposes, and in Austria and Roumania its employmant in locomotives ie being extended. In
Great Britain, owing ta the existence cf
abundant supplies cf cheap coal, the burning
of ail in locomotives has hardly got beyand
the experimental stage. There are, of course,
many other applications cf liquid fuel, cf
which canspicuous examnples may be cited in
electrîc-power stations in foundries, in glassworks, for emelting operations; and, indead,
a case for ita employment may be mnade ont
in connection with almast any type of statianary baller. The resulting aconomies as
campared with the use af coal for such purposes have not bean touchad, but while the
saviug varies with different classes af coal and
other factors. it may be said to range fram
30 per cent upwards, and in a majority of
cases axceede this percentaga.

of course, internai combustion engiues have
beeu used for seine time for propelling vessels, nothiug lias yet been attempted iu the
way of installing ail engines in so large a

gross, and of about 7,000 tons dead-weighit
carryilg capacity, and will have accommodation for a number of passengers. Shle will
have a épeed of twelve knots.
The advantage af the clase of engine
adopted is said to lie in the f act that it can
be worked with the cheapest kind of oil,
which can be bouglit at present at from $6
ta $8 a ton. No magneto or spark ie required
to ignite the charge, this being done by compression, and the engines can be started in
five minutes, compared to the fifteen hours
required to raise eteami with boilers. There
are to be no boilers, no funnels, and no coal
bunkers, the oil being carried iii specially
constructed tanks.
Two sets of combustion cylinder engines of
the Diesel type <with improvements) will provide the propellîng power, and a smaller engifle of the same type is to be installed to
generate eljectric power ta drive the wmnches,
windlass and steering gear, as well as ta provide for lighting the vessel. As a resuit of
extensive experiments the firm estimate that
100 tons of cil will carry the vessel as far as
300 tons of coal carry a steamer of the same
size. Only about one-fourth of 1the space
usually occupied by coal bunkers will be required for the oul tanks.
The change now introduced is considered
to be of mucli greater importance than even
the introduction of the steam turbine a feiw
vears ago, which made comDRratively littie
alteration in thie space which shirhuilderg

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of (Bill No. 15) An Act ta amend the
Canada Medical Act.
He said: This Bill cornes from -the House
of Commans, without opposition. The Bill
*was reierred ta a committee oft médical gentlemen, who are members of the House of
Camrnons, and lias received practically the
unanimous report of the Canadian Medical
Association, I understand; in fact, it was
pxepared by the Canadian Medical Association, and it has been strangly advocated
by them. The committet of the Huse of
Commons wiiich dealt with the Bill was
composed et fourteen p'hysicians and one
lawyer. Tlie various provinces af the
Dominion were asked ta send delegates
before the committee, and representatives
of all except Nova Scotia appeared before
the committee, and were heard. Tlie coinmittee approved aif ail the sections et the
Bill with the exception o! subsection a
of clause 3, ta whicii slight abjection was
madeý by the province of Sasaktchewan.
That provision determined the composition

SENATE
of the ne-w Medical Council for Canada.
The provision in question was to the eflect
that representatives fromi the various provincial universities havmng achools of
physies and chemistry should have representatives on the board. As Saskatchewan
hald no medical school, they would be
without a representative, and their objection -vas met by the appointment of a
representative by the Governor in Council.
The object of the Bill is ta enable practitioners ini varjous provinces, upon obtaining the certificate of registration of the
Canadian Medical Association to, practise,
without any f urther examination or formaiity, in the variaus provinces of Canada. A
gentleman who is o.dmitted by the College
of Physicians and Surgeons in the province
of Ontario, upon presenting his certificate
to the Canadian Medical Association, can
receive a certîficate of registration which
will qentitle him to practise in the other
provinces of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-Are these representatives of the variaus provinces appointed by the government, or by the
medical association ai each provinceP
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-The Bill provides
for the council as followHon. Mr. CAMPBELL-The hon. gentheinan mentioned that they were delegates
from tach province; were they appointed
by the government of each provinceP
Hon. Mr. BEDCOURT-I understand it
was by the medical councils of the provinces.
The invitation ivas addressed to ahl the
medical councils of the provinces, and they
were asked ta attend this cammittee. Al
the provinces, except Nova Scotia, sent
representatives, who were heard before the
committee, and the Bill wvas the combined
Nvisdom af the gentlemen of the House of
Commons and the members of this *committee, after consultation with the various
medical gentlemen of these provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I approve of
the principhe of the Bill, and would be

of the medical profession who stili have
some objections to it, to be heard. I suggest that before the second reading- we
should see if those objections are sufficiently important ta render it advisable to
refer the Bill to a special committee. I
would therefore suggest that the second
reading be postponed until Tuesday next, in
arder that ve may see whether we should
accede ta the request made by some virtside;

Hon. -Mr. McMLLLAN-There is really no
no necessity to postpone the second reading. The objet of the Bill is plain. On
the face of it, you can sec what it is designed -to accamplish. We have heard no0
objection to the measure framn aiIy quarter.
If the medical men of any province objected, we would have heard the objection
before now. The hon. gentleman who introduced the Bill, 1 tb.ink, did not mean
what he said when he stated that examinations were to take place before the Medical
Board of Canada. Those who are already
qualified, and have medical certificates, frorn
the provinces are not to be examined. It
applies only to new members.

that it cannot go into forc 'e until the provinces pass legisiation accepting it. Without their consent, therefore, it cannot becorne law.

the suggestion made by the hon. gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
that it should go to the Committee of the
Whole, like other public Bills, is a good

one. I notice that the hion, gentleman ini
charge ai the Bill referred ta the fact that
all the provinces had been heard tram. except Nova Scotia. I think this is one af
the cases where silence may be assumed ta
give assent.- Nova Scotia is in this condition: We have a large number of good doctors there, and any doctor who came there
ta practise 'would have very littie chance
of making a living; and the doctars there
are so good that when 'Lhey go abroad their

it in that way when the population of
municipalities, tow.ns, and villages, farmers and poor people, living on the shores
of rivera, would be at the mercy of any
informer, who, in view ef a share of the
fine would do everything to take advantage
of a chance offered to him t o make money.
We have had exainples of this in Montreal,
and 1 suppose hon. gentlemen must have
had sucli examples in other cities; of associations heing formed and combines
made, in erder to take action se as to
share in the fines. These thinga have been
published in the newspapers. I think the
Iaw wfll be aevere enough without anything of that kind. I accept the principle
of the Bill, I think it will do a great deal
of good. The reason why 1 say that the
whole of the fine collected shahl go to the
consolidated revenue fund, to be employed
in premoting due administration of the
law, is that I think it will do more good
by being applied in that way. Laws of
the same kind have been enacted by the
provinces cf Ontario a.nd Quebec, and
none cf these Acta give any share of the
informer or complainthe
fine te
ant. The whoe fine is given to the
Board of Health te be employed in
1
promoting the intereats cf health.
de net see why parliament should not do
the same thing, and take measures te prevent abuses which would be very disastrous
and make the law unpopular. 1 have no
hesitatiori in s.aying that'if the Bill is passed
in its. present shape wîth that clause giving
a ahare cf -the fine to the informer, yeu wilýl
cover the country with an army cf mnen who
will try to make a living on the fines they
will be enabled to collect under 'this Act.
The Bill provides that the Governor in
Connci-1 shail make regulations and appoint officers, and a clause has been added
to the original Bill, under which officers
are rto be appointed te enforce the law.
That is right. Why not give those officers
power te take necessary action? It wilI be
a more effective guarantee, if the actions
are taken by officers more or leas under the
control cf the Governor in Council, that the
law will net be used as a means uf persecution and blackmailing. I think I have
said enough te convince the House that it
would be very dangerous te leave that
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

clause as it is. I shall not, refer te the other
amendment now, but 'will wait until this is
disposed of.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT-My hon. friend
seema 'te think there is very great danger
in allowing a portien cf the penalty te go
te -the persan on 'whose information the
prosecutien is cemmenced. I cannet see
where the danger is. The party who laýys
the information will, have te prove his case.
If he t ails te prove it, he cannet get snything, -and he will have given his time and
labour for nothing.
My hon. friend says that in Montreal associations have been fermed fer the purpose cf laying information, and if this
clause is preserved in the Bill we shail
have ail over Canada an army ef informera.,
constituting themselves a society for the
purpose cf enforcing this Act. I do net
know that that weuld be very objectionable. I should think it, would be desirable.
If associations were formed in Ottawa,
Montreal and ether places te enferce the
Act, I think it would be proper. If we
are agreed upon the principle of the Bill,
that the dumping cf raw sewage in the
river must stop, then the best means
available should be adopted. My hon.
friend says that in provincial legisiation
there is ne provision cf this sert; that
Ontario and Quebec do net give a portion
of the fine te the informer. I will net undertake te contradiet hlm; he may be
quite right, but assuxning that te be the
case, it is no argument why we ehould do
the same thing. There is ne doubt that
this Bill is in advance of the legishation,
net only cf the provinces, but of that cf a
great many portions cf the United States
and Europe. We are trying te take a step
in advance; we are net simply trying te
mark time, and we miust surronnd the Bill
with ail the provisions necessary te secure
its enforcement. Instead cf seeing a danger in the tact that this Bill la going te
be enforced if this provision is inserted,
I think that La a reason why it should be
adopted. The measure will be difficult cf
enforcement, and will net be enforced unheas knowledge which will came te some cf
us privately is nsed fer the purpose cf
having it enforced. It has been disclosed
in Ottawa in the ]ast few days that for

MARCH 30, 1911

years the grossest violations af the provisions of the Health Act of the province
have occurred in tlie very heart of tlie
city, on Sparks etreet, where out-doar privles have been allowed ta exist. If induce.
ments are offered ta peaple ta assiat ini
enfarcing the law by receiving a share ai
the penalty, we shail have nathing of this
kind. It must be adxnltted that the Board
o! Health cannot kuow everything that is
going on. It 'would require an army of
officers ta aecertain the conditions af every
one'is back-yard, but ail are interested in
the enfarcement of the Iaw, and every one
must take -a hand in having it enforced,
if it le going ta be ai any value. I do not
think the danger my hon. friend refera ta
exista, because under. the section of the
Act the Minister of Agriculture, who shall
have charge ai the measure, le authorized
ta prepare regulations. These regulations
may be, as the Act says, eitlier ai a general or special charactar. Ile may grant
exemptions or permits; he may make regulations which will ha applicable ta cities,
and other regulatians applicable to villages, and so on. 1 cannot eee where the
danger exies tain ecuring every possible
means that we can secure ta have thie
Bill properly enfarced. I -am afraid that
if a provision of this kind is not included
in the Bill, if same encouragement je not
given ta the people te see that it lseanforcad, it is going te be very difficuit ai
a.nforcajnant, il not altogethar a dead latter. My hon. friandes amendment would
datract from the elfficiancy of the Bill.
Hon. -Mr. -McMILLAN-I agrea with my
han. friend who moved this amendmnent,
and do so upon, these grounds: that the
Bill smacks a good deal ai oppression and
tyranny. I can und-eratand appointing informera whare infringement o! an Act takes
place in a secret way; but the infringament
oi the Act and the wrongdoing which. la
aimed at is done publicly before the eyea
ai the cammunity and before the eyes ai
the inspectors. The inspectors are supposed
to ha the guardians o! health i cities
and tawns; they are the peid servants a!
these inunicîpalities, and it is their duty
ta see that the law is carried ont. It is

stance, under the license law of the province of Ontario, something is7given to the
informer, because the iniringement o!i that
Act is carried on secretly; but if my nextdoor neiglibour has b-een in«fringing the
law by keeping uneanitary premises, and
is a menace to the community, it ie the
duty of the healtli officer to -look after it;
it is not the duty of a neiglibour who mnay
be induced to prosecute because of jealouay
or a misunderstanding. For many reasons
cd that kind lie may get his neiglibours
into trouble through spite or a desire forrevenge, while the inspectar would take
action. at the expense of the Crown. The
poor man who may be the neighbour of
the informer, and 'who may flot be guilty
at ail, has to de! end himsell and lias to pay
his own. expenses. The suit znay end in
has aoquittal, yet he ie put to ail that
*trouble. I think it la wrong on the face of
it. This law le intended to preserve .the
public health o! municipalities, cities and
towns along navigable rivers. The cities
and towns, in their own interest, should
enforce this law. Why tlien. transfer the
duty that is impoaed upon tliem and ixpon
the liealth inspectors of the municipalities,
to private individuals, who may througl i llvJill and jealousy bring tlieir neiglibours
into court? The priaciple is wrong; it
looks to me like providing a means for oppression. There is not a man wlio lives on
the banks of the St. Lawrence or the Ottawa
who would feel safe from being prosecuted
by his neiglibour under tliat clause. Therefore, the clause sliould be struck out and
the one proposed by mny lion. friend (Hon.
Mr. David) substituted.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-When this
Bill came up for coneideration in the first
instance, one hlf of the penalty was to
go to the informer. It passed the House
witli that provision and was referred to
the Health Committee. Tliey substituted
one-third instead of one-hali, the balance
going to the consolidated ,revenue. The
main question is whetlier this legisiation
is necessary. Anybody 'wlo will look at

SENATE

the mortality etatietice of the lest ten or
fifteen years wiIl be struck with the number ef lives, many o! them valuable, that
have been lost through the pollution of
our water supply. Only the other day, a
leading citizen of Ottawa was carried off
by dieease contracted through the pollution of the river. Now is it right or proper that parliament should permit such a
condition of affairs te continue? The pollution of the river can be carried on se
secretly that only the one who commits
the offence may know et it. Therefore,
if you want the Act enforced Borne inducement muet be offered te people te furnish
information. Take this city as an illustration. They have had two committees
appointed te discover who was et fault for
the typhoid epîdemic which hes prevailed
in the city te such an extent that neerly
e t.housa.nd persens in the last three
menthe have been suffering, and hemi the
fault et somebody. Atter an investigation
cerried on by two committees the cause
,bas yet to be discovered. Now they have
applied te the provincial government for
a commission headed by a judge, and agree
te pay the coes of the investigation, and
ail that, beeuse in the first instance the law
was net enforced, and ne off er was made
te an informer te state how this pollution
et the water occin'red. There is ne doubt
as te the cause et typhoid in this country;
it arises from the pollution et the rivere.
It has gene on every *year for the lest ten
or fifteen years. It happens te be wvorse
this year than usual. Look at the history
ef other countries and you -will find thet
the mortality from these causes is greater
than from any other source. We are now
acked te rernove the inducernent that would
prompt men to informi the authorities of
the existence ef the pollution. The mere
tact et the informer laying the charge does
net convict the parties. The courts are
extrernely careful, and our duty is te effer
corne inducernent te put this law in force.
If you do net offer 'an inducement to prosecute, I do net hesitate te say that the law
wiIl be a dead-letter. We have pacsed laws
in this -Chamber over and over again te prevent -sawdust being thrown into the streamns
and lakes. No one was. authorized te put
the law into force, and ne premniumwmas

offered to punish the guilty party, and -what
was the resuit? The law was absolutely
useless. During the last thirty years we
have had laws passed to prevent the Ottawa
river .from being polluted, and yet they
have been absolutely waste paper, because
there was no inducement provided to bring
the guilty parties to justice.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I presume that
the disposition of the Bouse would be to
enact such a law as would, in a measure,
meet conditions that exist. The provisions
of this Bill are very drastic, se much se
that I arn entirely in sympathy with the
amendment that je being rneved. The law
would be so very drastic that its application on the River St. John, from source to
rneuth, 'would make every individual çwho
has a tarmi on its banks, guilty. The seepage fromn the drains and barnyarde go-es into
the river, and a man can be prosecuted by
his neighbour and have him fined. I do
not think a clause of this kind will tend
to make the Act popular. Although the
people of Ottawa have suffered, and we ail
sympathize with them, 1 ar n ot satiefied
that every man should look into hie
neighbour'e backyard te find out whether
hie is deing eomething that is subject te a
fine. The health officers appointed by the
municipalities ought te be able to carry

to understand what there is behind an Act
of this kind, and the fines and liabilities,
and thev wviIl know it through the press,
and probably in time frern 'the courts, they
wvi11 take care te avoid becorning liable
under the law. To induce every mri by
the prospect of reward, to watch over his
neiglibour, is doing something that I do
not approve of.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBEL-Is it not a fact
that many people in Ottawa who have net
drunk the water have been taken down
with typhoid?
Hon. Mr THOMPSON-I weuld net be
able to answer a question ef that kind.
It looks as if they had been indulging in
a good deel of water when they have so
much disease. I think this House wifl

-MARCU 30, 1911
be doing an injustice if we de net accept
the amendment.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-I arn firmly cf the
opinion that the hion. member from Mille
les <Hon. Mr. David) has rendered valuable service net only te the public but te
parliament by raising in the very mild
way hie did, an objection against the creation cf a class of people that Canada has
ne need of. It has been attempted in the
past, under provincial laws, te secure convictions through informera. My experience
in the courts in the past thirty-five years
is that the judges will net believe an informer, and we have very great difflculty
in obtaining convictions on such evidence
unless we have it corroborated. The judges
will believe an officer ef the law who is
especially appointed te see te the administration of a certain Act. No later than
hast week, an officer of the Revenue Departmnent was on his oath. lie vas ahane.
He was testifying te the violation cf the
Revenue Act. There were ten respectable
witnesses, -and yet their word was put aside
in favour cf the one witness, although these
witnesses had the backing cf the High Constable cf Montreal as te *their credibility
and honour. From the fact that this man
was an offhcer of the law, and net an ordinary informer, under the imputation of
getting part cf the fine, the judgnient went
against the defendant. In certain parts of
this empire we have had enough cf that
class cf men called informers. A certain
portion cf this empire in the past was
under the heel of the informer, therefore,
I say that the hon. senater from Mille
Iles, in raising this objection, has done
a service te parliament and te the country. Net that hie is opposed te the ebject
of this Bill, or its mest adequate -administration. We knew that the abject cf the
Bill is for the benefit of the people of Canada, but parliament should net put a
clause in a Bill o! this kind, or in any
Bill, te induce men te give free rein, as
the hon. senater from Glengarry has said,
te the passions cf jealousy or ill-will
against their neighbonr. 'Under this clause,
ail an informer has te de is te give. information, and hie can do it quietly. The
presecution is begun against the individual
and simply by inforxning, the complainant

gets a third of the fine. If the case is
lost, hie leses nothing. In other cases of
this kind, the Crown is not even allowed
to give the name of the informer. In the
administration of the Revenue Act in the
province of Quebec, the Crown is debarred by law from giving the naine
of the informer, but the arguments madle
by -the senators who are in favour of the Bill
informer, but the arguments made by the
senators who are in favour of the Bill
but against this clause, are weIl grounded
and based on experience, of what will happen in the luture if it becomes law. Every

therefore,
this clause is one that should nlot be put
on the etatute-book, and should net be approved cl. Let the administration cf this
la-w, like other laws, be placed in the hands
cf the public officers. They are the proper
parties to deal *with it. I contend that
the senator fromn Mille les is in harmony
with justice and a proper condition o!
things.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-I am thoroughly
in accord with this Bill. 1 do not know
what the amendment is. As regards what
my hon. friend has said about informers, I
do net think*you can caîl it informing if a*
man in the country is conducting the sewage from his place in a way that his nextdoor neighbeur is injured thereby, and is
a detriment te the 'whole country. It is
perfectly right that hie should lay informatien without being called a common informer. 'To my mi, this is a very proper
Bill. Sewage can be easily disinlected and

Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

IIARCU 30, 1911
notwithstanding that .fact, it is necessary
that informers shall exist if you expect
measures of this kind to have any effect.
My reasons lfor my position are based upon
long experience. This law la a very drastie
one, as pointed out by the hion. gentleman
from Fredericton, but the very fact of its
being drastie, and the fact of its operations
being extended over a vast extent of country, makes it necessary to have such provision in order to make it effective. If it
is not necessary to enforce it, abolish or
repeal it.
Hlon. Mr. EDWARDS-As far as the application of this law is concerned, I understand it is only operative by authority
of the Governor in Couni;, and under the
administration and regulation of the Minister of Agriculture. I have no doubt that
it will b'e administered in varioua parts of
the country in accordance with the conditions that exist, ànd so far as the amendment suggeste)d by the hon. gentleman fromn Mille les is concernied, the
suggestion la just as good as saying that
there ahail be no law at ail, except in so
far as individuals, of their own accord,
may inform upon their neighbours. To
police this country as the hon. gentleman
suggests, would take an army, and would
be a very great expense to the community. With regard te one neighbour informing upon another for gain, the resuit wil
be that if there la that dread of the action
of your neighbour the law will be far more
effective. We have evidence ali over Canada of the deairability of such a law, and
if you want to make it effective, it may be,
perhaps, necessary in general termis, to
have informera. I think it la better to
take that risk in order that the law shall
be made really effective.
Hoin. Mr. BEIQU-I have heaitated a
good deal on this question, and at firat
sight I was inclined to be againat the amnendment of the hon. member fromn Mille
les. I should atate for the information
of hon, gentlemen of this House, and in
order that they may better understand
the effect of the amendment which ia proposed, that the hon, gentleman from Mille
Iles intends to follow this amendment
with another, 'which would corne in as a

471

subsection to section 4 of the Bill, to this
effect: that the minister may appoint such
officers as hie deema necessary to carry
out and enforce the provisions of the Act,
and may. also by regulations, &c., designate au existing Board of Health, sanitary
authority or other persons for such purposes.
I have just heard a remark
which is a pretty severe qualification;
but if the hion, gentleman were yet open
to conviction, I stiil hope that I will be
able to carry conviction to his mind. 1 shall
firat cail the attention of the hon, gentleman to the considerations which weigh
in my mind in favour of the amendment:
What would be the effect of ieaving the enforcement of this law to informera in the
ordinary sense of the wordP Do hon. gentlemen be]ieve that a mnn who constitutea
himself an informer wi]l flot subject himself to such hatred that hie will not dare
to inform unless hie is actuated by motives
of vengeance againat a neighbour? I amn
afraid it wi]h not have the object which
the hon. gentleman who la in charge o!
this Bill, and who has given a great deal
of attention to the matter, desires. It
seems to me iA would be much better to
give to officers or persons, a mandate in
order that they shan feel that they are
discharging their duty in xnaking complaint, instead of making money at the
expense of a neighbour by lodging a comnplaint. It seema to me'that the minister
can find machinery already in existence
that can be set in motion without much
cxpense, and it will be the duty of these
lofflcers to lodge a complaint when the
occasion arises.
Take for instance the fisheries law. Overseers are appointed to see that it is not violated. Suppose that ins.tead of appointing
overseers, the matter were left in the handa
of informera, can you imagine that any
neighbour would ever lodge a complaint,
even if hie is to receive a part of the fine?
He would do it only fromn revenge. It is by
appointing overseers of fisheries we have
somne guarantee that the law will be enfoeed, because the overseers have the protection of the law. They are simphy doing
their duty and are in a position to say: 'I
do this because it is *my duty,' but if it is
ieft merely to the individual action of an

SJENATE

informer, 1 arn afraid the lawv would flot be
enforced as we expect it to be. I propose
at a later stage to move an amrendment to
the Bill for the purpose of giving it further
elasticity and of ensuring that the Governor in Council may bring it into operation

work properly or is flot being enforced, we
may amend the Act and have recourse to
the systemn of informers.

MARCH 30, 1911
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I did
flot call attention to this procedure with
the object of blocking the arnendrnent, but
for the purpose of ascertaining 'what was
really the practice of parliarnent in a case
of this ki*nd. I differ from the Speaker in
his view.
Hawever, I ar n ot going to
press it. but would like very rnuch to have
the Speaker rnake a record of bis ruling, in
order that it rnay be a guide for t~he future.
The SPEAKER-Arn I nat right. in saying
that bas been tbe practice? I confesa I
know of no rule which applies except the
priactice 1 have adopted, I think more than
once. A Bill bas corne here from the cornmittee. which was amended by substituting
a clause. The hon, gentleman will rernernber a Bill in which that was donc, the Insurance Bill. I think that was amended
in rnore than one clause.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL - The
hon. gentlernan is quite correct i rnaking
the staternent that the insurence Bill was
arnended bere; but not in this manner.
Hon. Mr. WILSON-Beforc this motion
is put, 1 desire te express rny views i
regard to it. 'We sbould all feel very
grateful indeed to the hon. senator for
bringinz up) this discussion. It is tbe case
ail over the country tbat strearns have been
more or less polluted by sewage. If by
adopting any rnetbod which rnay be brought
forward by this Senate the lives and health
of the people can be protected, it is aur
bounden duty ta do so. While I arn not
tonvinced that thia mesure will accornplish as rnuch perhaps as rnany irnagine it
wvill, yet, if it accornplishes tbe saving of
a few livea it is certainly aur duty to do
our very utrnost, and be tbankful that the
matter wvas brought before us. I quite agree
witb tbe point raised by the bon. senator
from Hastings (Hon. Sir Mackenzie Bowell); I tbink this arnendrncnt sbould bave
been subrnitted in such a way tbat every
member of this House would bave an opportunity of cxamining carefully into it.
It is ail very wel for those who are on
the cornrittcc to know 'what the arnendmnent is, but that is not the case with al
of us. Wc have flot had au opportunity
of examining this clause, and of knowing
what the abject of the arnendmcnt is. 1

do nat think At is* fair that any senatosbould proclaim that those who may lay
comnplaintes ail over the country are rnen
wha will inform for the sake of the paltry
surn that they will get for their ahare of
the fine. It is certainly a very lIow estimate
ta put on buman nature. We feel tbat
every. man will do bis utmost for the protection of life and health of burnan beings.
That bcing so, are we to suppose that
any man, let hlm be an agent of .the
government or not, would infarm on another persan for the sake of getting the
$2 that be rnight reccive as bis share of
the fine? I have a higher estirnate of the
hurnan race than that. I believe that we
should have as rnany informations as we
possibly can in the enfarcing of a law of
thia description. Witb ail tbe efforts that
we rnay make we shall ind that the law
will nat be fully carried out. It will ta
a certain extent rernain a dead letter on
the statute-baak ; but if it la enforced,
even ta a arnall extent, we are justified in
passing this Bill. I tbink it is absolutely
impossible, under existing laws, te thoroughly protcct the livea and hcalth of tbe
people. Look at the burniliating position
we are now in in the city of Ottawa? Why
sbould so rnany lives be sacrificed> Why
shauld there be s0 rnuch sickness, aorrow

nat be in tbe position in which wc are now
placcd, and would have avoidcd the extrerne suffcring of the people af the city
of Ottawa. I believe that we can, ta a
certain extent, eradicate same of the disesses ariaing frorn impure water, and, that
beiiig the case. it is our duty to make
an effort of thia kind. Every thanka abould
be rendered ta the junior rnernber frarn
the city af Ottawa <Hon. Mr. Belcourt),
for bringing this matter before parliarnent.
Speaking of the arnendrncnt introduced by
the hon. member froin Milles les (Hon.
Mr. David), I tbink it is unfortunate that
there ahould be any neceaaity for rnaking
citizena public informera. We should avaid

point out to the prornoter of the Bill, that
unless hie adopts sorne rnethod to purify
the water that is used for dornestie purposes, I arn afraid we shall have more or
less trouble with it. Drainage and oewage
will always exist. Water will always find
its level, and it will mun into, streams;
farmers will fertilize their farine with manure. The rains corne and wash it juta
the rivulets which feed the creeks and the
creeks ta the river and the river ta the
navigable waters.
We know that impure water affects
hurnan beings who drink it, and that
a great deal of the infant rnortality which
prevails in this country is due te that
cause. The impure water that the cattie
drink certainly bas the effeet of spreadingdisease through the milk. It is appalling.
Stati.stic.s show that infantile choiera, a
preventable disease, causes (the death of
half the human race. Providence neyer

this shouid 'be on our staturteibook,
though I arn not too sanguine that it will

I shall feel it rny duty and rny pleasure to
vote for the measure. Even though it
fails ta accaxnplish ail that he anticipates,
I hope he will continue hie efforts, and
that on sorne future occasion we may be

The SPEAKER-The question is now on
the adoption of the report as arnended.
Hon. Mr. DAVID-I move that the report be nlot now concurred in, but that it be
further arnended by striking out subsection
3 of section 4, as arnended by the comrnittee, and substituting therefor the f ollowing:
The minister may appoint such officer as he
deems necessary ta carry out and enfarce the
Act, and may also by regupravisions of thisdesignate any existing board
lations in force
of health, sanitary authority, or other person,
for such purpose.
This is the consequence of the other
arnendrnent. The abject is ta give the
minister and the Governor in Council the
right ta appoint officers. In'certain cases it
would be special officers, but the Governor
in Council would be authorized ta designate
existing sanitary authorities, or other persons ta take action in order ta enforco the
law. I think that the arnendrnent is sufficient ta give ta the governrnent and ta the
Minister of Agriculture aIl the pawers which
they require in order ta enforce the present law.

that the Bill deals exclusively with rivera,

through the discussion of this Bill objection has been taken to it 1)n the
ground that we have no right to legislate

* Han. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-When
I asked ta have the adoption of the arnendment postponed until to-day, I thought
I would be able to understand either the

on my part to express an opinion contrary
to the opinion given by a legal gentleman.

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
Senate will remember that the great objection urged against the measure was its
unoonstitutionality, and had it not been
restricted exclusively ta navigable strea
and rivers, the objection, I think, would
have held good. That is the objection
taken by some eminent legal authoriMes, and also by laymen. The amendment proposed by the hon. gentleman

It says that the word « hot'1 be inserted before the word 'now,' and that it
be 'further amended by adding the following to section 2 ' and such proclamation
rnay be issued from time ta time, and as
regards only the territory of cities, and
towns, or of cities, towns and villages, or
other territories, and subject to such permits or restrictions as may be embodied in
the resolution.' My hon. friend from, Ottawa, in order ta bring the measure within the purview of this parliament, restricted its operations to navigable waters which
are under the control of this goverrument.
This aim ndment gives power to enforce its
provisions in cities, towns, territories, and
in localities in any of the provinces. Whether I arn correct in the view I take of it.
that it is an infringement on provincial
rights, and ultra vires, is a question for
thore more learned in the law than I am;
but ta rny mind the moment the proclamation is made giving effect to this Act, which
affects the different localities referred ta
in the Bill, At will be found that they have
assurned an authority and powers to which
they have no right.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I think it is an important matter, and
it us scarcely possible to discuss it now. I
therefore suggest that it be postponed until

friend to drop his amndment. It is not
at ail necessary, in my humble judgment,
and it may seriously jeopardize the passage o! the Bill. I think my hon. friend
ought to seriousl"y consider dropping the
amendment altogether. To my mind it la
absolutely covered by clauses 4 and 9 of
the Bill, and is merely adding something
which, unfortunately, may contain ini itself

Bill, because if we legisiate for territory
outside of navigable rivers, we immediately

ask my hon. friend if he would not conaider the advisability of dropping the amnendment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-It is my mistoîtune
to be unable to agree with the hon, gentleman. I have cousidered the matter
seriously, and, rightly or wrongly, I arn
convinced that the clause is necessary and
is not covered by the Bill ais drafted. I
have as much at heart as the hon. gentleman the working o'! the Bill, and if he
takes the ground that f arming territories
cainnot be excepted, I arn afraid he will
not succeed in having the Bill passed in
the other House. I have no objection to
add to the amendment the woîds «'The
parts of rivers opposite cities and towns.'
The Bill clearly deals with rivera opposite
towns, and with navigable waters, and
the exception would exelude ail but such
parts of rivers.
The motion to adjourn the order until

I find it is the

concerning thjs case, upon which we are
asked to vote at the present moment. I
understand that this report only reached
the other hon. members at the same time
as it reached me-about two minutes ago.
I took the precaution during the week to
ask every day at the post office for the report. The postmaster's answer was that
there was none delivered to hini, and be
could flot deliver any to me. In view of
these facts, and in face of our protestHon. Mr. KIECHHOFFER-I do not
think it is necessary for the hon. gentleman to finish his speech on the subject.
Hon. Mr. CLORÂN-Allow me to complete my statement. Unless a point of
order is to be raised, I will not be interrupted.
Hon. Mr. KIRCHIIOFFER-*Ail right.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-The hon, gentleman
bas no point of order. I understand it je
a delîcate subject with the hon, gentleman, and it is with us too. We want to
have the evidence in our hands before the
committee or the hon. chairman et thé
committee asks us to cast a vote on iL. I
arn not fighting here to-day against the
merits of this case at ail. I arn simply
vindicating the rights of hon. inembers to
have before them the evidence upon whicb
they are asked to give a verdict. That has
been refused in the past, and even last
week evidence was. placed in our hands
in 'regard to certain divoroe cases, and the
hon. chairman of the committee asked
for the adoption of bis report before that
evidence could be read. Bis have been
read the third time to-day without the'
evidence being in our possession. I contend that it is a violation of the rights of
individual members of this House, and in
future I wvill insist tbat when the chairmuan of the Divorce Cornrittee presents
a report for consideration with the evidence, that that evidence shaîl be in our
hands, and not in the Printing Bureau.
I amn not prepared to oppose every demand
for divorce, but I shail certainly be antagonistic in cases wbere the evidence is
weak, and does not justify a dissolution or
marriage. One o! the worst crimes society
can commit a.-ainst itisel! is to dissolve

family ties, even on grounds o! adultery.
and to-day parliament grants divorce on
evidence tbat is absolutely weak, and on
admissions of one party to the other
without any proof whatever
of the
so-called statutory oflence being committed. That is in the record of our Debates,
and 1 contend that the Senate sbould not
lend itself te such transactions. Ail tbe
beet spiritual power in the world, aIl the
best social force in this world under
Christ's rule demands that divorce be abollished, and we bere, hon. members, men of
age, men of honour, men of virtue, think
nothing - o! violating the will o! the
greatest
moral
force in tbe world.
They wiIl adopt a report without having
read the evidence, and grant a divorce on
the most flîmsy grounds. I stand here as
an exportent of the views of people outside
this Chamber. I know that tbe majority in
this bonourable House allow these Bills to
go through as if tbey were simply pastime
in legislation, forgetting the duty that we
owe to eociety and t-o the law of God. I ami
serious, as far as I arn concern:ed, in this
matter. Hon, gentlemen have insinuated,
not openly in this House, but outside,
that I amn under the direction or influence o! tbe church in this matter. I
speak as a man under the influence of
the Christian law, guided by my own conscience and directed
solely
by
the
public interest. I understand and can
comprehend the differences of consciences,
the differences o! estimation of God's teaching and arn willing to bow to that as far
my neighhours are concerned; I hope this
wili be the last tirne I shall be called upon
to explain rny attitude in regard to this
question of divorce. I dlaim that divorce,
instead o! being made easy, should be made
difflcult. Yet right on inv own side of the
House, last year, hon. members declined to
vote with nie with regard to a Bill which
would have been carried if they had supported mne, a Bill which provided that when

ruined his family the right to go into another respectable family and perpetrate
further evil. That 'was the object of My
Bill, yet Catholic senators declined to vote
'with me, on the ground that I was sanetioning divorce indirectly or directly. I
was doing nothing of the kind; I was simply asking that parliament, in granting a
separation, should flot give a brutal man
the right to duplicate his evil. I think 1

see our young country maintain its bright
name in the records of morality of the
civilized world, and not brought down to
the level oyf other countries, such as that
of our neighbour, or of France or other
European countries. I 'want to avoid the
path o! degradation. If it fahîs upon the
individual alone it may not amount to
much in the annals of this country, but
when children are brought to the witness
stand to swear against the virtue of their
mother, and when witnesses are called
upon to establish the evil habits of men
and women, and parliament says: ' We
separate you and you can go and repeat
your offence under our sanction;' it is time
to call a hait. If I were to stand alone here
day after day, I should insist in the naine
o! decent fatherhood and decent motherhood, that the granting o! divorce shahl be
mnade more difficult. I arn prepared to admit that, under the constitution, -we have
the power ta grant divorce; but there is
nothing to say that we shail grant it. The
constitution merely gives us the privilege
to do right or to do wvrong, as the Creator
gives freedom o.! will to men. W~e have the
right o! free judgment, and-I appeal ta parliament ta guide this country a]ong- the

THIIRD READING.
The order o! the day being called:
Rtesuming the adjourned debate on the motion for the adoption of the report, as
further amen.ded, made by the Standing Coinmittee on Public Health and the Inspection
of Foode to (Bill 1), 'An Act respecting the
Pollution of Navigable Waters.'
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-It will
be remembered that when this question
was last before the Senate I took objection
ta the proceedings as being unusual and
unprecedented. My objection was overruled, and I was met by the statement
that there were precedents for the course
being pursued hy the hon.,gentleman !rom
Mille Iles <Hon. Mr. David) and the hon.
gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique), and the Insurance Bill was given
as an illustration, or rather as a reason
for ruling the question in order. I tookc
exception to the statement made acknowledging that a number o! amendments had
been made ta the Insurance Bill at the
third reading, but not upon the motion
for the adoption o! the report which had
been made *by the chairman, but rather
that these amendments had been made on
the third reading o! the Bill. I have since
taken the trouble ta examine the record
upon that question, and I find that on the

APRIL 4. 1911

Sth March, 1910 page 233 of the 'Minutes
and Proceedinga,' that Senator Gibson re
ported the Bill from the comxnittee which
had been considering the measure, with
amendments, which were read, and the
motion was made for the consideration o!
the amendments on the neit day. On
the 9th of March, 1910, the amendinents
were concurred in by the Senate. Then,
on the motion o! Sir Richard Cartwright,
the Bill was ordered to be read a third
time to-morrow. That was on the 1Oth of
March, and on that day Sir Richard moved
the third reading of the Bill. Upon that
motion being made, Senator Béique moved
in amendment that the Bill be not now
read the third time, but that it be
amended in certain particulars. Several
amendments were then concurred in, before the Bill was read the third tinie. I
took the trouble to look up this matter.
because I was confident in my own mind
o! the course pursued on that occasion,
and for that reason I objected to the proeeeding which had taken place, in moving
a substantive amendment to the Bill upon
the motion for the adoption o! the report.
Not only was that irregularly introduced,
but the hion. member from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) actually made another
motion materialiy ail ecting and changing
the Bill, without giving any notice whatever, whiie éâe notice that was given for
the amendment by the hon. gentleman
from Mille les (Hon. MT. David), was on
the third reading of the Bill. To point out
the importance of adhering te the usuai
proceeding and practice of parliament, ahl
1 have to do is to refer to the amendment
which was proposed by the hon. gentleman fromn De Saiaberry. Had that amnendment been adopted at the time-an.d
it would have been adopted had I not
taken exception to it, and asked for a
delay-it wouid have introduced an element in the Bill which would have rendered it unconstitutional and utterly useless. Those who have paid any attention
to proceedinga o! parliament know that it
has been the practice of centuries to give
every opportunity to members, who are expected te cast an intelligent vote upon' any
question, to consider the question before
the House. First a Bill is introduced. It
314

is referred to a committee, and the committee'report. Aimendments are proposed
and are considered some days afterwards,
and, after their adoption, the third reading is moved, and at the third reading another opportunity is given for any member to take exception to the measure or to
suggest such aznendments qas he thinks
necessary. These are precautions to prevent as far as possible the membera of
either House being taken by surprise, as
the Senate was upon the last day of the
consideration o! thia Bill, and which
would have resulted, es I have already
pointed out, in adopting an. amendment
that would have destroyed the Bill completely and rendered it useless. With
these facts before us, I now take the point
of order, that the motion for the adoption
of the report is out o! order, and must
appeal to the Chair for a decision on this
question. While I arn confident that the
Chair muat, alter consideration, rule it
out of order, under these circumstances I
shall withdraw the requeat I made when
the question was last under consideration
to place his ruling on record. I withdraw
that request, awaiting the decision that
his hon. the Speaker may give upon this
point. I can only add that if it is to be
established as a precedent, we are adopting
an exceeding'ly dangerous practice, and
there is no telling what may occur in
future by taking advantage of a ruling
that could be used to place upon the statute-bcok highly objectionable amendments
to any Bill that might be presented to the
House.

HOURS 0F LABOUR ON PUBLIC
WORKS BILL.
DEBÂTE CONTINUED.
The order of the day being calied:
Resuming the further adjourned debate on
the motion for the second readin (Bill 3),
* An Act respecting the Hours of Labour on
Public Works.'
Hon. Mr. ELLIS-When the debate on
this question was introduced in the Senate, I made the observation that there was
no nccessity to send the Bill to a special
committec to be examined, inasmucli as
there was ample evidence, as to whether
thc measure was desirable or flot desirable,
in the book cf evidence upon thc questions submitted to the House of Commons.
The year before last, or the latter part of
Iast year, I think the year before at,
when the matter was before thc House of
Commons, a committee was appointed with
power to take evidence. They took the
evidence of actual workingmen, and of men
who had given the subject study, and it is
ahl embodîed in the report submitted to
parliament, making a book of several hundred pages, and there are statements in it,
which according to the opinion or feelings
of any hon, gentleman, would sustain
whatever view he might take. Hon. gentlemen have ail received from the different
labouring societies throughout the country
letters setting forth the views of these Organizations upon the principle contained
in the measure. The greater portion o!
them view the mensure with satisfaction;
some o! themn are opposed to it, but the opposition is rather from the point o! viev
that it does not go far enough and" therefore is not a perfect measure. The labour
'people in the country are divided into
many sections, and they have various
views as to how far we should regulate the
matter o! the number of hours of employment for working men. While some have
Rt. Hon. 5-ir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT.

very drastie resolutions, others are more
moderate and take more reasonable views
of the situation. Ail these views are reprcsented iu the testimoney before the comxnittec, and any hon, gentleman who is
opposcd to the Bill will no doubt find some
;statements in this' book bo sustain his
view. The work has been very thoroughly
donc, and it will afford some satisfaction
to peruse it. The hon. gentleman fr,)m De
Lanaudiere <Hon. Mr. Casgrain) rcferred
to Uic fact that there appeared to be some
feeling in the Senate agsainst this measure,
and perhaps there is such a feeling against
measuree of this kind, which seek to
change the ordinary course of business. My hon. friend from Halif ax <Hon.
Mr. Power) is perhaps not cf that mind,
but argued the legal aide of the question,
and found that according to judgments
already delivered the measure was nconstitutional, and for that reason we
should oppose it. The hon. gentleman
from De Lorimier <Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
was able to quote an opinion on the other
aide, a.nd at any rate to point out that the
argument of my hon. friend from Halifax
could be questioncd if not refuted. For
these reasons, a layman like myself, is le! t
in some doubt upon that point. It may
be said that we have 10 meet the case -of
men coming to parliament and demanding
the passage of an Act which will regulate
the hours o! labour so f ar as these are in
the control of the goverument in the work
which it dives out, either to a person acting for the government directly, or for
the contractor. I would not be surprised
if generally the feeling o! the Senate were
against any such legislation, because since
time began, roughly 'speaking, the civilized
and uncivilized world could be divided
into two great bodies, the men who work,
and those who do flot; but the great body
of the men who work usually work for the
men who do not work. Ing-enuity and
astuteness have enabled some men to.capture for themselves the benefit o! the
greater portion of the labour employed in
the world. That has gone on frorn time
immemorial. It is ingenious and effective.
In the course of the observations which

MIMullen) interjected into the remnarkçs

minda, upon their happiness, is that it
soon becomes apparent to them. that they
want something more, that the hours o!

shorten them. Can they be shortened?
A great many hon, gentlemen will say off

that bal! a century ago the workingman
was expected to work twelve hours a
day,
and did as a rule. 'fhere are places in the
country yet, I presume, wbere the workinginan works twelve hours. A man canflot be expected to do as good work in the
twelfth hour as he could in the earlier part
of the day. It seems to me that eight
hours should be the limit for a man to
work, and more than that is too much. It

If any bon. gentleman will take the record

would be surprised at the number of lives
sacrificed in occupations of that kind. Peopie are*working on a structure in a city
and an accident happens, and more lives
are destroyed in one night than in a Mexican revolution lasting three months. There
are mauy things which enter into the
thought of a workingman as he deals with
this question in his own mind. We have
introduced women in the working field. 1
can remember when the employaient ci
women was principally confined to nursing,
and home work, and millinery stores perhapa. Now they compete with men in
many occupations, and men do not object
to that at ail. One resuit is that tbe.
amount of work done by women adds consi.derably to the capital which is created,
and to the wealth which is earned, and
while they are better off to a considerable
extent I trust and believe, yet the effeet
of their labour adding to the -riches of the
world, is a matter which. must strike every
person as having an influence in givimg
men the idea that they should not be expected to work the long houre that
are now required of them for a day's pay.
I want to quoite an observation as to the
moral effect of the shorter day-the natural
effect upon the working people and I trust
upon others as weIl. A Mr. Francq appeared before the committee of the House of
Commxons who considered this Bill and was
a&ked some questions by Mr. Verville. His
statement was as follows:

most fatal kind. The welfare of the people
of the upper classer., if 1 may use the word,
the welfare of the whole people of Canada, ie
dependent upon having -the very best conditions, industrially, educationally, and in every
other way amonget the working classes, and
if we could imaprove their position to any extent whatever, by shortenng the working day,
it je the bounden duty of every loyal citizen
of this country to support that legislation ind
the sooner it je enacted the better.
But My pot je this: The worst thing in
the whole discussion of labour matters je the
tendency to meke general statements... We
mnuet in this matter distinguish between industry and industries. .. Long hours are bad,
ver y bed, the progrese of civilization means
a e ortening of hours. There ie no country
civilized where the hours are very long,
speaking for the mass of the workers. We
must shorten the hours but we muet recognise
that it je g mstter of industriel evolution.
Legielation muet ewait thet evolution. If we
cen hesten it here and there we ought to
hasten ît but if we go ahead of that industriel evolution, we will merely rush to disester for ourselves and for the working classes
too.
It will etrike one at once that if that
view was a fair one as to the general condition of the working man, hie might fairly
and reasonably demand shorter hours
than he gets; but if bringmng that into
effect would so disarrange the whole system
of the varions industries, it might be unwise to put it in force all et once. But
the Bihl before parliament does not do that
It merely epplies to certain work which is
to be done under government contract, or
under persons selected by the government
to superintend work, and that is a very
short step along the way. My own idea,
and I have passed through various stages in
mv mind as I have endeavoured to wrest le
with this question, was against that view
as it passed the lower House, because I
thought it did flot go far enough, but on
the suggestion made by Professor Magill,
of Halifax, and as agreed upon among
other writers on the subject, it is perhaps
better to take the smallest step firet and
g-o along as best we can, giving such advantages to the men as we can give them
without xnaterially interfering wvith the
ordinary course of business. I know very
weIl the argument that is used, that in
doing this you disarrange other industries,
or you may disarrange a particular industry. For instance in the case of a man who

troubles in whatever we do in this hi! e,
and it 'would nat do that parliament should
hesitate to take a etep in the right direction, simply because somebody might
be injuriously affected. It seeme to me
that one of the practical troubles which
beset a question of this kind is that the
change taking place ini the cerrying on of
an impartallt work, particularly in e large
work where a veet amount of money le invested, in fectories, developing ail sorts
o! industries, has the effect of removing
the employer from hie workmen, and the
workmen fraim their employer; that je to
say the mn who is furnishing the money
to build a bouse je not the man who cmiploys the labour. Labour je now fleshi
and blood, but the men who are engaged in
a great part u! the great worke which are
going on, are men who put their money
into the enterprise, they buy bonds, they
lend capital to organizations of various
kinde, and no longer does the man wh-j
bas furnished the means for building, employ the workmen at all. My hon. friend
from Hastings (Hon. Sir Mackenzie Bowell)
is engaged in the samie business as I am.
We meet oui employees every day, and are
interested in the condition 'o! their lives
and families, and there is a relationship
in that way between the employer and
employee which no longer reaches the vast
number o! men who are engaged in working. and building great enterprises. Therefore, the sympathy which once existed between the employer and employed has very
largely cessed ta be of the effective character which it wae years ago; and that, I
think, must considerably prevent the free
and full understanding between the parties of ail the differences. I notice a constant ý,endency ýamongst w-orking- people
towards socialismn in various forme, and 1
sometimes think the capitaliet himself, the
man of mieans, je to a great extent responcible for it. 1 do not know whether it
would be a good parallel to refer to the
case of Ireland, where the owner of the
soul lived abroad, and ail hie cared as 'regards his tenants wss to get as mucli

APRIL 19, 1911
money as he conld ojut of the land, and
the agent had to extoît ail hie could from the
tenants, and'pay it to the landiord on time.
That is thoe way now with those who own
a large portion of the money employed in
great undertakinga, and we cannot always
understand the feelings of the workingman as to that, nor can we fully appreciste the motives which induce him to rebel
against bis existing conditions. 1 think
therefore that capital shonld make some
effort, I scarcely know in what direction,
to meet the growing demanda of the wèrkingman; but one thing that can be done in
that direction is for the Senate to pass this
Bill. It is a very simple Bill-almost too
simple for me to occupy so much tixne
talking to the House about it; but it is
merely to require the goverrament to do certain things with regard to public buildings, and to fix the bours *of work on
snch buildings. Now, the House of Gommons bas passed the Bill. I will not inquire deeply into the question whether it
is a government measure or not, although
niy own constitutional view, se f ar as I
have a constîtutional view on the question, is that it is really -a government Bill.
It passed the Honse of Gommons by consent of the government, guided right
through its various labyrintha by a member of the government, and at any rate
passed by a Honse of Gommons which supports the government. That may, or may
not affect the minds of hon, gentlemen
here, but it is a ressont, I think, why the
Senate should not hastily reject a measure
intended to help the working man in the
strng-gle which is going on, and which
îeally does nlot affect at any rate a great
body of people who employ men for eight
hours a day, or for ten bonis a day, except that it may in time lead you to look
with a more moderate view upon the demanda of labour. I rest my case for the
passage of the Bill, fiast, on the ground
that it la a comparatively simple measure,
and a step in the direction of maklng for
the eight bonis a day. I amn sure we
sîl ought to be glad to think that the
works of the country that are to be doue
can be carried ont by an eight hours a
day system. I observe that under this
Bill ail woik over eight bouris lato be paid
for by one sud one-haîf rate per extra

hour over the rate paid for the full day.
I do not think that is a good plan. 1 arn
sorry the working man put that in, for
the reason that when a man works eight
hours he is nlot as good a man dnring the
ninth or tenth hour. Why shonld he ha
paid one and a half the rate he la paid
for the eight hour day work? That does
nlot seem logical, and I do not think the
men would themselves contend that it is.
But that does not affect the main question
as to whiether the eight hour day should
prevail.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-Would you deprive
hlm of his right to work more than eighlt
bours?
Hon. Mr. ELLIS-No, 1 think hie should
work as long as he pleases. If ail my
men work eight hours a day, and if.we
have to employ them for extra time, they

obligation to the honourable member from
St. John (Mr. Ellis>. I have listened to
his exposition of this subject wlth heaxtfeit appreciation. This question bas been
before the Senate for some time, and .it
has been discussed from different points
of view. Some points of view did net
appeal to my senee of justice, nor to the
sense of the vast majority of the country.
To-day we have had nlot only a sympathetic
explanation of the measure so far as its

of the whole question, one that appeals

the conisequences may lie in individual
cases, and I amrn ot prepared to admit wlth
the hon. gentleman from Halifax, that it is
going to disturli the econornic conditions
to sunli an exten t as is dreaded by Cthers.
I understand tliat this law cannot be made
applicable to ail classes of work or to al
classes of workers. It cannot be made applicable to the class called farmers. Tliey
are sornetimes obliged to work from hall
past three or four in the morning until eight
or nine p.m., but there is compensation in
that. They have to work mighty little in
the winter months, and tliey have five or six
montlis of a vacation. This law could not
apply to tliem. It could not apply to milîs
that are mun 24 hours a day, but in that
case I may say this-do as you do now, but
do it on a larger scale. Whlen an iron
factory or sugar refinery lias* to run 24
hours a day without -atopping, what do
they do? Tliey have two shifts, day and
niglit shifts of twelve hours ecdl. Let tleie
make it tliree shifts. There la no principle
btoken by this Bill whatever. The lumbermen run niglit and day witli shifts that go
off at i.30 a.m. until 6.30 p.m., make it
three shifts of eiglit hours eadli. Tlie result
will be that you will have room for more
labourera. It will flot cost more, and supposing it did, the business sliould provide
the extra cost. There is no interfering with
the riglits of capital in sudh a provision as
that. They are doing it in aIl the large
refineries wliere. they are rLsnning 24 hours
a day. Tliey are doing it on the ralroads,
the biggest institutions in the country.
What president would ask lis railroad engineer to run lis engine 12 hours a day P
They have to do it sometimes under stress
of circumstances, in a storm or for the want
of another engineer, but as a general rule,
rio railwav president wouild compel an en2ineer to run 12 hours conseeutively. He
would not lie apt to do it. Tliey probably
have four shifts.
Wrhat captain of a sea
vessel would ask his mariner to stand at
.the mast liead for elght, ten or twelve hours
a day? H1e would not think of it. H1e -vould
savy four hours, and that is ail lie would
ask him to work. The principle is already

That is' ail he 'works in any event, six
months in the year, in Canada. They canflot work before eight in the morning by
daylight, and very often in the -six months
they have to stop work at four or fourthirty p.m. on account of darkness. Then,
if tliey wanted to work they could.not,
so there is no obligation or change of
principle there.
It is ,the sanie with
masons, paintera and the vaat major'ity of trades. We want to have the
principle consummated.
The government
will not, through this Bill, force any class
of contractor, or employer of labour, to
adopt thes-e hours, but as far as the
government of Canada is concernied, they
feel it their duty, and they -are ready to
perform it and set an examfple to ot.hera.
1 fail to *ee where any injustice can be
done. Tlie lion, gentleman from De
Salaberry put the question to the hon.
gentleman from St. John: 'Would you
prevent the labourer workmng an extra
hour if lie wanted to.' And the lion.
minister replied 'no, this Bill does not
prevent a nman working more than eight
hours.' If I f eel competent to work ten
or twelve hours I ca.n do so. That is my
business and flot the business of -thie
employer. But if the State found that a
man was doing harm to'himself and lits
f amiiy by working over tirne, tliey would
have a riglit to step in and say no, just the
saine as they could say to a man wlio lost
lis wits 'You must be confined' but as
longc as the individual has the physical
capacity witliout injurin1g his moral stamina, lie can dispose of his labour as hie
pleases, and hie lias *a right to stipulate
for extra wages if lie works overtime. Thiat
does flot affect the principle of tlie Bill.
This measure appeals to-day under modern
conditions to the necessities of human lîfe,
and it would lie ail thue better for the
working man to have the 24 liours day
divided into three shifts where it will take
tliree men to do the work perforrned by
one slave in the past.

2. On the 24th February last, in reply te
an inquiry made by the Honourabie Mr.
Landry, t he Right Honourabie Sir Richard
Cartwright gave, in the naine of the Department Of Public Works, the iollowing figures
for the valuation cf the properties hereinabove and hereinhelow enumerated:
131,000
Land...........$
52.000
Buildings.. ............
Machines...........18,000
or a total of $201,000 for the part cf the Carrier-Lain4 property situated. te the south of
the railway, as against a value of $250,000
officialiy established by the engineer of the
departinent residing at Quebec.
And that he wili inquire:
(a) Why this difference of $40,000 in the
valuation of the same property and given by
the same department P
(b) Is there any justification whatsoever
for the change which has corne about P
(c) What is Jt?
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The
explanation that the department
give is simpiy this: they, sny that the difference between the $250,000 and the $201,000 which the hen. gentleman has ailudel
to, is simply made up by the $33,000 deducted against the railway strip, and the
matter of some $ 14,000 on account of the
maichmnery and buildings, which appear
net te have been taken over. Those two
sums appear te make the difference between $250,000 and $201,000.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Perhaps that may
be correct, but if it is correct, the answer
given te a previeus inquiry is wrong.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-That may possibiy be. I think the present explanation, however,

is correct.

The inquiry was dropped.

THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE.
INQUIRY.
Hon. Mr. COSTIGAN rose te:

ernment to provide the sane conveniences
for members of the Senate in the iSenate post
officeP
And aise to make some changes in the franiking privilege for the convenience of members
of (che Commons. as well as members of the
SenateF
He said: The first part of my -inquiry
relates to the convenience afforded the
members of the House of Commons by
post office boxes. I see no reason why t.he
same convenience should flot be supplied
to members of the Senate. The other part
of the inquiry relates to the convenience
I suggested some years ago with regard to
the frankmng privfilege. While I had the
honour of a seat in the House of Cernmous, I consulted a good many members
there on the subjeet. It will be recoilectel
when the franktng privilege was originally granted, ail members had a right te
frank their letters in their boarding houses
and drop themn in the hotel boxes or city
post office boxes.
That led te abuses.
Where the fra.nk was initialled by a muema
ber of either House it was easy to iniitate
it and the boxes were centinueusiy filled
with letters which hal flot been franked
by members. One can understand, therefore, why the priviiege was curtaiied, and
members were required to mail their
franked letters in the post office of either
Huse of Pariament.
That inveives a
good deal of inconvenience to members, especialiy those who have their quarters at
a distance from the post office. They are
obliged te bring their letters here, or 1,0
purchase stamps, and therefore the frank.
ing privîlege is of no us-- te them at ail.
In view cf the abuse thut grew out of the
custom cf dropping frunked letters *in the
city letter boxes, some members cf the
House cf Gommons, cf whom I was one,
waited on the Postmaster General, who
was then Sir William Mulock, and laid
before him a proposition that if we were
aliowed te frank our letters at our quarters
by writing our full names on the letters we
maiied, they mîght be received at any of
the post office bexes in the city.
That would have been a great convenience, and the suggestion made a favourable
impression upen the Postmaster General,
and the deputy recommended it very
strongly, and the Postmaster General
thought we should go further and appiy

APRIL 20, 1911
the same system to these offices here. It
would involve a great deal of alditional
labour to the members of both Houses if
they were obliged to write their full namnes
every time they franked a newspaper or
letter. Nothing came of our suggestion,
but I stili think that in a matter of this
kiud the convenience oi the members might
be suitably met by allowing thein to frank
the letters nlot only in their own quarters
and drop them in any post office box with
instructions that the frank might be sufficient if the full naine were written. There
would be no danger of counterfeiting a full
namne. Who would run the risk of counterfeiting a namne to save two cents? I do
flot think there would be auy danger nt
all. The revenue would nlot suffer in the
slightest, and the convenience of members
would be greatly served.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The Post Office Department have forwarded me the following reply to the lion. gentleman's questions:
(a) Such accommodation is provided by
the Public Works Department. The Post
Office Department has no jurisdiction whatsoever as regards the post offices in the
House of Commons and the Senate.
(b) Until Mr. Costigan announces the
changes hie proposes, the departmnent is unable to discuss the matter.
If the hon, gentleman would state in his
question the exact nature of the changes
to be made the departmnent wouli ha able
to answer, but they cannot send an official
answer, until they know what the changes
are. I will ca'l their attention to the remarks the hon, gentleman has made.

I do nlot see why we should be content
wîth an answer coming fromn the Post Office Department saying that it is none of

Public Works Department. I do not see
why the Post Office Departnxent take
upon themselves te give an answer. I think
the answer should be returned te them,

SENATE
the people of this continent and the wor'ld
at large tha.t the Senate Divorce Committee
has been extinguished and has been replacel1 by what they cali a ' Kirchhoffer
Committee.' The letter to which I allude
appears in the 'Boston Transcript,' one of
the most noted, and one of the best authorities in the United States as an exponent of publie opinion. The letter is written by one E. W. Thompson, correspondent,
of the 'Transcript,' probably one of the
ableat public writers on this continent.
He has helped to build up the reputation
of many a public man flot oniy in the United States but in Canada. He is now endeavouring to buil-1 up the reputation of
,one of oup honoured cdlleagues, and to give
to one of the most important of the cornmittees of this House, the hon. gentleman's
naine. His effort is flot of bis own initiative; his effort has been hatched by outside influences, for he neyer could in the
preparation of this document have quoted
word for word a debate of this honourable
House and practically made it his own. correspondence. I have read this document
carefully and have shown it to people who
are able to, judge what it means, and where
it came from, and the resuit of my observation and study is that it has practically
come from one of our honoured colleagues.
The heading of the article in very large
type is 'As to Divorce in Canada.' The
second line of the heading is 'The good
work of the Kîrchhofier Committee.' The
third heading is 'Record o! the Course of
the Dominion Senate,' and the fourth and
last, but flot the least important line is,
«Despite peculiar religious difllculty.' In
the face of these declarations, I asked myself what was the object of putting this
before the public in such a substantial
journal as the 'Boston Transcript,' and by
the pen of one of the most accomplished
writers in journalisin. I have corne to the
conclusion that the object in view was flot
one to command any un-due respect or admiration for the person aimed at, but to
cast aspersions and create a littie ridicule
on some members o! the Senate. That ohject would be scarcely worthy the consideration of this House, but being more or
less allied with that object, practically its
entire entity, I feel called upon to give
Hon. Mr. CLORAN.

this public accusation a reasonable denial.
In the firat place, the Divorce Committee
of the Senate is flot known as the
Kirchhoffer Cominittee but as the Divorce
Committee. In the second place, there is
no religious difflculty to impede the efficiency o! the conunittee.
We aUl know
that religious differences do not interfere
with such legislation. The difficulty lies
in this fact, that objection has been found
and will be found so long as the committee
make reports to, this House on the evidance that they do. We of the Catholic
church, of the Anglican and Preabyterian
church, who wish to remain true to the
oath that ia administered at the marriage
altar, are opposed on principle and according to conscience to divorce. I have
heard that oath pronounced by minister,
bride and groom-those whom God bath
joinel together let no man put asunderand that doctrine obtains, I believe, in ail
Christian churches. So it is flot a question of religious difflculty, and when the
attempt is made to place the difficulty on
the shz>ulders o! those who belong to the
ancient Roman Catholic Church the effort
is not fair. We are not the only ones who
oppose divorce on principle, and according to the teachings of the church. And
we who -are opposed in thîs 'House, have
neyer made any pretense that our opposition is based on any such ground. In
the eight years that I have been a member
of the Senate I have neyer made any pretense of opposing a divorce on the ground
of rÉligion. I may have challenged the
principle of granting divorce by parliamentary legislation, but 1 have neyer opposed a divorce on religions grounds.
What I did oppose was the recommendation
to disunite a married couple on evidence
which, asMr. ThomPson puts it, would not
be taken as sufficient to hang a dog. These
are the -rounds upon which I and those
who feel like me, oppose the granting of
divorces, and 'why should it be set forth
to the world that 1 oppose the' granting of
divorces because the churcli authorities dietate that course to me? I alluded to this
matter on a former occasion, when I stated
that I received no dictation from any
church. I went further, probably too farin stating that I declined to accept the

APRIL 20, 1911
direction of the church in regard to these
matters. That statement I withdraw here,
publicly and fearlessly. I accept the doctrine -of the Catholie Church on divorce, the
same as I -accept it ini the case of any ather
violation af the cornmandments. I made
a mistake when I said, under influences
which few of you hon, gentlemen will understand, that I was under the dictation
of no church. Neither arn 1 naw, but I
arn prepared to accept and do accept the
teaching of the Catholic Chnrch in regard
ta the sacrament of marriage, and I know
that my colleagues, of the Anglican -and
Presbyterian Churches, who accept the
doctrines of their reliaious- teachers, agree
with me, so that 'when I made the st-atement that 1 was under neý influence, that
no direction shauld be given to my conduct.
I made a mistake which I hereby publicly
wîthdraw. But that does not prevent me
from repeating what I then said, that with
regard to legisiation on this question, I receive and accept noa direction irom any

directed by the influence af the church's
doctrines, and by its iniallible exponents,
s0 that when an insidious atternpt la made
through the press to show that the Catholic members ai parliament are guided by
undue influence and prejudice, that attempt will faau ta accomplish what was
designed. That attempt wvas nlot fair or
honourable as applied ta any member -who
belieyes iii thie absulute union ai marrîed
peaple. The marriage tie cannot be broken
by the decree af mani, be it that ai a
Senate or any other legislative body. This
Chamber, as I stated yesterday, in regard
ta anather question, regards the weliare ai
the people and lias a noble duty to periarm.
Let it periorm that duty icarlessly and raise
itself ta the higher plane ai Christlike doctrine, Christian truth and philosophie reason, and flot descend ta the paltry necessities ai the occasion ta save this one or
please that one. That is beneath the
suprerne dignity of the Senate, and counter
ta the duty ai a wise and honourable legislator. This matter is mare serions than
some may think, but again I say an this
question, as I -stated yesterday ai the
labour question, the vast mass ai the peaple

press. A mani representing thousands and
tens ai thousands af workingmen throughout the country, said ta me to-day: ' Oh,
senator, we feel like yau, but if we hal the
opportunity and power ta express aurselves an
the floor ai the Senate,
aur cause would be better advanced'
And my answer was simply this: 'My dear
sir, aiten I arn alone in advocating these
causes which I think make for the righteauaness of a nation, for its spiritual and
physical welfare, and although I amn met
with a deaf ear ini this honourable Hause, I
know I have an open heart and open ear in
the people ai this country. I know when I
leave this Chamber that the sentiments I
express fln:l an echo in the corridor, in
the gallery and in the hearta ai men who
have no peltry low intereats ta serve, but
rather the upliiting and the bettering ai
humaü conditions under a wise law guided
by Christian principles.' That ia the position 1 hol1d in this honaurable House, and
will hold until God takes the breath out of
my mauth. I care nat who may be pleased
or displeased in regard ta this or ather
similar matters and I know I displease
some. I know there are senators here who
say, ' Simply because Senatar Claran advacates this we will vote against it. My
line ai conduct bas been chalienged, nat
openly in thia House, but in the corridors,
by hon, gentlemen. They have not the
courage ai their-I will not cail themn
calumnies, but - their indiscreet, unbharitable remarks. They dare not stand an
the floor af the Ohamaber and repeat in my
pre-sence 'what they say one ta the other.
That has fia weight with me when 1 decide in regard ta matters that appeal ta
the highest and best instincts af mani.
What I want is the protection ai the iamily
in its -marital relations, the protection ai
the iamily in its dealings with capital and
the employment ai labour. I arn bere for
that purpase and nothing else. I arn nat

interests have compelled me to give the
hon. gentleman hic answer to hic face, and
in a place where it >ought to be given to

in the Boston -' Transcript.' As l1cr as the'
Bill is concerned, in this case I amn not
going to enter any formai protest. 1 shall
leave it to the bouse if they have read the
evidence to cast their verdict according to
the evidence. There are things in this report which should neyer have been there.
There are assertions and recommendations
which sbould neyer have been in any *report of a divorce committee -since confcderation. The merits of the case are fairly
strong and would be doubly strong if the
committee bad reported in ahI cases alikc
in regard to this matter. That 1 arn not
going to deal with. There are.members o!
the committee, and members in this House
who are better posted. in regard to this
divorce report than I amn. I must confess

that I have not had the patience to go
through the wbole record. It is one of the
most lengthy that we have had this cession;
but I had heard enough in open heariiig
before the tribunal itself to make up rny
mind in regard to the matter. I understand
that members of the Divorce Oommittee
have -found. fault vith the report. I understand that a member of that committee has
asked to have the minority report put iii.
Where le it? I amn looking for it yet. It
has not been put in. These are facts withi
which I -arn not siifflciently acquainted to
make a etatement, but I can assert the fact
that objection was taken in the committee
itself against the report whieb je now presented to us. I hope the members of the
committee will juetify their finding. As far
as I am concernied, I will not discuse the'
matter on its menite.
Hon. Mn. WILSON-I expected that the
Chairman of the Divorce Comrnittee would
seek an opportunity to exple.in why this
report was brought in. My hon. fniend frorn
Victoria division (Hon. Mr. Cioran) is
quite correct. Thene was a request made
that a minority report ehould be presented.
that the allegation made by the petitioner
againet the reepondent was not proved in
:Lny particuhar. I still feel that. While I
amn upon that committee, and while I rnay,
to a certain extent, sympathize with the attecks made on my hion. friend in reference
to the charges of his co-religioniste, I say
without any hesîtation that I have the fullest confidence in every individuel member
of this Senate, be hie Gatholic or Protestant.
I believe they are prepared to do justice
to ail on every occasion. I give my hon.
friend that credit too. I do flot believeé he
would misrepresent a cingle fect, nor wouhd
hie be infiuenced by the desire or the fandies o! bis chunch. He bas a right to bis
belief. Eveny individuel member is free
and independent to act as hie rney think
best, both in reference to bis religion and
in neference to bis duty in the Senete.
Therefore I exonerete him. I believe he is
justified in tak ing the oourse hie bas taken.
I can also sympathize with him beceuse,
perbapa, hie bas been aettacked and hie
wishes to resent it. I do not tbink anybody would have any hesitation in saying
that the lion. gentleman has on each and

SENATE
every occasion the courage of bis convietion.s. If hie is attacked, I think he is capable of resisting and resenting that attack.
I believe hie is competent to defend bimself
on ail occasions, therefore, I bave no reason
to offer an excuse for hlm in defence of
the position hie assumes. He is justified in
many of the statements bie made. I am a
mnember of the Divorce Committee, and I
made a request for a minority report. That
minority report was not brougbt in; but I
have no besitation in saying that I did not
feel juetified in supporting this report as
brought in by the chairm-an of the Divorce
Committee. I do not feel that tbey were
justified in making the report they did. I
further believe that there was, to a certain
extent, collusion between the party asking
the divorce and the respondent. I believe
there was -an attempt made on the part of
the petitioner to force and alimost coerce bis
wife to consent to a divorce. Wbat the object was, and wby such was the case, I amn
not prepared t» state. He must know bis
reason, but I do not think that we have any
positive reliable evidence, uniess it be the
agreement between the petitioner and bis
wif e for the divorce. That being the case,
the law virtually says tbat wbere tbere is
any collusion, agreement or understanding
between the husband and the wife, or the
two parties asking for tbe divorce, that
voids the application for the divorce. I say

would be a vicions principle, indeed, and I
bave asked the chairman of the committee
if he cari puthiis finger upon a single thing
in the evidence submitted to prove the
crime was committed for whicb we would

adultery. Further, 1 say thaît lier evidence
is unreliable-she contradicts herseif. iShe
conveyed the impression of a certain condition, and shortly afterwards contradicted
ber statement. There has been no evidence
of crini.nality on the part of the wife. If
tihe husband, rnaking an application t4o
obtain a divorce, tries to coerce or force
his wife into makîng admissions which she
distinctly says are untrue, I say we ought
not to grant iA. I have siipported many
Bis of divorce, and consider it is a proper
thing to do if the husband and wife have
just cause for separation, but unless sufficient evidence is prodiiced I do not think
there is any justification for a husband to
orphan bis children and cast Vbem on the
public. If the petitioner Hamilton had the
good case that he pretended to have, and
had been suffering wrong at the hands of
bis wife, wby did hie require to put bis own
fiesh and blood on the witness stand and
try to prove the wrong-doing of bis wife by
the evidence of his children. Was there
any justification for that? The father casts
a elur upon bis own chiidren for ail time
to corne that their mother was this, that and
the other, yet hie pretends to say he had
suffered injustice at the hands of bis wif e
for some time. Are we to be so lost to common decency as to permit hîm to brand bis
own children for -ail time with the stigma
of being the children of an uni aithfui
mother? The fact that hie could not prove
bis case without, resorting to evidence of
that kind, is sufficient to convince me that
we ougbt not to grant a divorce to that man.
A man must be lost to ail moral sentiment and to ail sense of right wbo would
charge bis wife with the offence of adultry and the only evidence to substantiate
it ber forced confession. Why sbould she
confess? I do not wonder at ber confessing and consenting to a divorce. She wantcd to get rid of a monster and avoid living with hirn. I tbink any woman wouldl

This Act appiies te ail cases where a contracter is deing the work that would involve the empicyment ut the parties named,
the workmen, mechanic and the labourer.
I refer.te the Act relating Io the District

much higher. It la: «An Act relating te
the limitation cf the heurs* cf daily service
of mechanics employed on the public works
in the United States and the District cf

day, and imposes a penalty net te exceed
$50 or imprisonment for eue year. It provides for both fine and impriseument. In
Kansas the provision is:

hereafter be employed iby or on behalf of the

That is very much wider than ours. The
provision continues:

where it may ýbe necessary te work more than

Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Coluinbia)-Does the hon. gentleman think, that

We cmn only compensate the labourera by

play, and are being crushed-they revoît.
The next step is the formation of the socialîstic club. There are now from 75 to
80 of these clubs advocating socialisin,
which means the overthrow o! Christianity,
so that this is a broader question than the
mnere matter of reducing the hours of
labour from nine to eight. If it is going

SENATE
to encourage the belief of the workingman
that he is being treated as Christians ought
to be treated, and remiove from himi the
causes of disaffection, then we are solving
a serious problein, because in the lest tezi
years there has been a wonderful spread
of socialism, the cause of which is th2
treatment of the workingman by the capitalist. The question is, shall the government of this country be arlowed, in the
broader sense, to do what they have been
doing in the last twenty years and what
has been done day by day? Shall they
compel a contractor who is putting up a
building for them to observe this eight
hour law? Nothing is to be gained that I
can see by hesitating. The House of Coinmons hesitated for two years. They exhausted a large amount of turne in the
consideration o! this measure. I arn not
aware that there was a single voice urged
against it in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. POWER-Yes, there was.
Hon. Sir RICHARD'SCOTT-I speak subject to correction. I do not think there was a
division on it. Some membera might have
taken a view similar to that expressed by
the hon, gentleman from Halifax, that it
involyes a constitutional, question.
Hon. Mr. POWER-It involves too many
votes. That is the reason.
Hon. SIR RICHARD SCOTT-I arn glad
that they appreciated the fact that the
people had votes.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Columbia)-Does the hon, gentleman not think
this legisiation is one-sided? It binds the
employer aud does not bind the workingman. The labourers can say to-morrow,
' We will only work six hours.' and there is
nothing te compel them te work eight hours.
They will stop work, and the employer cannot get more out of them than that. Il
to-morrow the organized labour associations
of the country wanted a six-hour day they
wouid get it, and members o! parliament
dare flot resist their demand, because the
labourera have a vote.
Hon Sir RICHARD SCOTT-I eannot see
where the contractor is*injured. Before he
puts in his contract he knows it is to be
based on an eight-hour day. Therefore, lie
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT.

is flot damaged. As to any future demand,
we cannot make provisions for posterity. The eight-hour day will be more acceptable if it is given in an ungrudging and
cheerful way. I hope parliament is prepared
to so give it on the present occasion.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I amn afraid that
the question is not approached in its
truc liglit.
I periectly agree with the
hon. member from St. John (Mr. Ells)
that it shouid be regarded as a hurnanitarian and economic question.
I do
flot belleve that the intereats of capital
and of labour are opposed te each other.
Their interests are common, *and what we
are Iosing sight of is this, that while this
Bill *may work reasonably well in certain
cases, it is doubtful if it would be to the
advantage of the labourers if the hours were
limited to eight hours a day, for this reason,
that in this country, unhappily, labourera
can work only seven or eight rnonths in the
year, and therefore tbey have to earn within
that period the living for twelve months of
theinselvee and their families. This Bill
would prevent the labourer from working
more than eight hours -a day, and the effect
would be te increase the eost of living, becau-se the article produced by that labour
would be enhanced i cost frc>m the fact
that the producer must pay more wages for
the production of that article, and it miglit
place the producer at a great disadvantage
with his competiters in other countries for
the production of &a
like article. This is an
economic question of the widest importance,
and I am afraid that this Bill has been
passed in the House of Gommons, possibly
in ignorance of thest considerations and because they may have been afraid te antagonize the labouring classes. We should stand
above such considerations. For my part I
declare on this occasion, as I have declared
whenever I have had occasion to speak on
like questions, t.hat I rejoice and always
have rejoiced at the fact thaît the labouring
people have organized theinselves for their
proteection. I amn quite satisfied that if they
had flot donc so they would not have been
properly treated by capital, because capitalists, as well as every other class of
society, are hiable to -be greedy and oppress
the labouring- classes, especially those

APRIL 20, 1911
classes that do not take care to protect their
own interesits. I amn as jealou-s in the protection of labour as I amn in protecting capital. On the other hand, one must not lose
sight of very important conaiderations which
apply equally to the interestis of labour aind
to thc intereétis of capital. This Bill haa a
further abject than has been stated by the
hon. gentleman from Ottawa. It la not
merely for the purpose of authorizing the
governinent ta exact from labourers not
more than eight hours a day, but it ià for
the purpose of compelling thc governmciit
to insert a clause ta that cffect in every contract for publie warks. Now, if it is proper
ta apply the rule to public works, it should
be applied everywherc; and for my part I
would not be prepared ta go to that extent.
It would be against the inte-rests of labour
and against the interests'of the cornmunity
at large. In sorne countries where the principle has been adopted, the legisiation is
to the effect that eight hours shall constitute a day's work and that any hours in
.excesa of that shaîl be paid for at a higher
price, generally double Uic regular rate.
Now why should thc extra hours be paid for
at a higher rate? It has been properly
said that anc of the objecte in limiting
warking hc>urs ta eight is because the work
will bc more effective, and it la claimed
that work pratractcd two haurs bcyond that
la not as profitable -as 'work done during the
previous cight hours. Then why pay more
for the additional hours than for the cight
hours? SuTelý it is nct logical. The restriction should eithcr be absolute, or no
rule of the kind should be adopted. 1 ask
hon. gentlemen if a law of that kind could
be applied ta such occupations is farming?
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-It is nat
to be applicd ta farming.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I know, but why
should it not be? Why should it apply ta
public works if it is flot to be applied to
other works? That is what I fail ta sec.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-It la the first step.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-Is it the intention ta
give the labourera a gratuity at the expense
of the governmcnt? If the hon. gentleman in front of me can advocate a princi-

pie of that kind I shall be surprised. He
may be tempted to advocate legisiation calculated to win popularity in certain quarters, or certain sections; but Burely he has
too much respect for bis position s a member of this House ta contend that the labouring classes should be paid gratuities
by the government. They should be treated as ail other citizens are treated; thcy
should be paid f air and reasonable wages,
liberal wages if you like, but they should
not be set apart as a class and paid double
what other labourers are getting for like
occupation.
Hon.'Mr. CLORAN-Is, it nat a fact that
every employce in the Public Works Department here works only 6à or 7 hours a
day while ail other men exnployed in wholesale and retail establishments work. 8, 10
and even 12 bours a day?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-It is a fact that the
working classes have been able to enforce
their views on the government, and also
ini the printing establishmenits. Throughi
unions of their own they have compelled
printing establishments ta limait the day's
work ta eight hours, and to exact for any
additional hours vcry high pay; but that
does not solve the question. That does not
prove that it is fair or right. I admit that
there are accupations such as mining where
a law of that kind should be passed, and
possibly it shoulld apply to printing too.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN-And to lawyers.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-As a lawycr I have,
for rny part, been working for 25 years uf
my life, flot eight hours, but sixteen bours
a day without imparing my hea]th, and I
do not believe the workingman impairs his
health by working ten hours a day. It has
been stated that working people are flot
treatcd as they were years ago. We al
rejoice to know that the position of the
working people has been very much improved. They live much better than they
used to live, and their work is not

they work with machines most of the time,
and their work is flot as exacting as it used
ta be. That is no reason for adopting legislatian which may have a very dangerous
effeet, as far as the community at large and
as f ar as the working people themselves are
concerned.
It being six o'clock I move that the debate be adjourned until Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-The hon. gentlemani from De Salaberry just naw attributed
some words ta me-guessed something, because 1 did flot speak when he said that I
would have people working for the government get double pay. I neyer talked about
double pay or anything of the sort. What
I said was the government should be a
model employer, and if any one is ta give
shorter hours surely It should be the gavernment.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I understood the hon. gentleman who moved
the second reading of this Bill to say that
it was his intention ta take the second reading and refer the Bill ta a committee.
When that announcement was. made I declined ta discuss the merits of the Bill, reserving the right when it came before committee to give my opinion. 0f course if

Hon. Mr. WILSON-I object that there
should be an inducement held out by the
teaching bodies, the universities, for instance, 'wherein they decide the severity of
those examinations. The danger is that
they may be anxious to passa as many students as they possibly can, and, therefore,
will relax the curriculum of the standard
of the medical practitioner. I arn inclined
to think we have some illustrations of that
at the present time. Some years ago we
tried to reniedy this difficulty, and we
lound that some of the teaching bodies, the
universities of some of the provinces, would
nlot give up the licensing power. I believe
that MeGiI was perfectly willing to relinquish its charter, but Laval would not
give it up; therefore we were unable to have

year 1884 a similar question arose in this

the practice to aubmit the accounta and
vouchers of the Senate to the Auditor General; but it was tihen decided that these
accounts should go to the Auditor Geners*
and from that, Urne forwart that procti'
has been pursued. While we should, ta

independence of this House, In my individual opinion it would be wiae te arrange,

is about to be revoked, that no injury

the revocation of the licenae should continue in force; that is to say thse elevator
can be closed and no business may be
done. The revocatian of the license shall
have f ull force and effect pending tihe appeal. This fact would warrant the parties

on. Clause 123 is a matter af great importance ta, the majaority of the wheat growvers

the question of mîxing wheat and ail that
sort of thing, because 1 assume that hon.
gentlemen have read the evidence and
knaw pretty well about the practice of mixing af grain. The production ai wheat is
the great industry in Canada at the present
time, and is the industry' which has built
up the country. I believe the prosperity
of Canada in the last ten years is due ta
tihe breaking up af the plains in the western
country and growing wheat there. The
wheat growers are making Canada, and deserve some consideration. When I went
west, in the eariy days and the people
started ta grow grain. we were in tht liands
of a monopoly. Nobady was allowed ta
ship a bushel of wheat unleas hie put it
through a certain elevator. The raiiway

They paid a vast amount in fines, and

do, a.nd he said they should flot have done
it. The government couid flot prosecute
them for mixing grain, because they could
not get evidence to establish the fact. It
was shown that there was 'half a million
bushels more of No. I northern wheat went
out of the elevators than went into them.
That is established by the books of the in-.
spectors. It was also shown that there
was half a million bushels leas of the
lower grades went out of the elevator
than went into it, which proves that they
had been mixing the grain and changing
the grades. Ail they could be prosecuted
for was for making false returns. You could
not catch them mixing the grain. That is
very often the way that some bank officiais
have been prosecuted-not for the swindling
they have been carrying on, but for making
false reports to the government. In this case.
these gentlemen were fined some $5,500 for
making false returns. I submit that as
long as those gentlemen are allowed to go
on and do that sort of business there is no
safeiy for the public. My hon. friend, a
while ago, raisedl the question of vested
rights, and these gentlemen claimed that
they came into the country and'spent a
large amount o! money building elevators.
I do not think that anybody would, argue
tihat those gentlemen came here merely for
the good of their health. In !act one of
them very frankly said so--he said, to put
it short, he was here ' alter the stuff '.
These gentlemen tell us that they are
giving the fariners competition out in
the west; that is more important than
the terminal elevator question involved,
and that is the question of the monopoly these gentlemen -are building up
If we allow this sort of

thing to go on, in four or five years the
grain trade of the west will be in the bands
of one huge monopoly and there will be no
competition. These gentlemen daim that
their vested rights should be protected,
that they have put their money into elevators, and if they are flot sllowed to
operate them they will lose their money.
Téere is no proof of that. There la only
enough elevator accommodation et the
lakes to hold the grain that is now shipped
from the west, and the volume of wheat
goirig out is increasing rapidly. It appears

5

to me that if they were anxious to sel[
the elevators they would ±ind aomebody to
operate them. There is nothing to prevent
the producers f rom saying, ' If you operate
these elevators rigGit, we wiil continue to
send our wheat through them.' Now why
could they not do that? They say unless
they are allowed to do this business in the
way they have been doing it their capital
is endangered. But there are many amal
elevators throughout tihe western provinces
which were there before these gentlemen
came into the country. These gentlemen
to-day, by their manipulations, are gradually freezing those amail elevator owners
out, and if iL comes to a question o! vested
r1ghts, have flot those amaîl elevator
owners some ground for pleading that their
vested rights be protected. They are beingfrozen out now. You can remedy that by
putting these people out of the terminal
elevators. One man said, ' Last year when
I was buying wheat I loat 24 per cent on
grade.! He iost a spread of three to four
cents and that represents an enormous
amiount of money to à company tihat owns
three hundred elevators. If they were
fl.lled three times. they must have lost very
heavily. Now how do they make up that
loss? They made it up by mixing at the
terminais. The small men cannot do tihat.
When a farmer comes to seli his wheat.
the owner o! the small elevator looks at it.
If he finds that it is a littie short of No. 1
Northern, he can only give the price cf
No. 2 Northern. If the farmer refuses to
seli under those conditions lie ean go to
the representative of the combine. He
knows that if it is flot No. 1 Northern ha
can, by mixing and manipulation, make
it No. 1 and he buys the grain. That is
the way these people are putting the emali
men out of business throughout the western country. I should like to show how
the compatition is going on in the west.
and I take for my authority the report of
the departmant of whieh the right hon.
leader o! the House is head. Mr. Gage,
who is one of the gentlemen who gave
avidenca connectad with thesa big institutions, told us that they had a terminal

they controlled fiva or six companies out

I have taken the trouble to look into the

What a fine proposition for the farmera
there. Three elevators belonging to the
one combine. If a man drives into town
late in the evening with a load of very
good wheat, No. 1 Northern. He drives to
the first elevator and says to the man in
charge, ' I have a load of wheat I want to
seil.' The operator replies, «'Yes, No. 1
Northern, but I have no roomn for it. He
goes to the other man and he looks at it,
and he says «It is No. 1 Northern, but I
have no room for it, you had better try
the other man.' He tries the other man,
who scratches his head and says, ' Well.
that is beautiful wheat, No. 1 Northern,
but I bave no room for it, but I have some
room in my No. 2 bin, and if you will take
the price of No. 2 grade I will buy it.' The
poor farmer cannot take it home again,
and hie bas got, to, hand it over to these
people and up it goes into a No. 1 'bin,
and by this means the farmer is gradually
being ground out of his business, anci these
monopolies are being established and

and who tell you that they are «out for the

if they were put out of operating terminal
elevators they would lose their xnoney, it
should not be difficuit, to decide where our
duty lies. Every one of thern had to admit
that the elevators were paying. Mr. Gage
told us that he had an elevator of a capacity of one million bushels. I asked him.
«How much did you put through it?' Hie'
answer was, «Nie million bushels.' Everybody knows that if you can fill an elevator
three times in a season it will pay, and
hie succeeded in firling his elevator nine
times. But when you put on the screws
to find out how mucli profits were made

any information. They a-Il hal to acknowledge that they paid dividends. la there

and I sold out to some one, 1I o flot see
any reason why I woid not go on and

proper way. The saine principle applies to
the elevators. They can lease the termina]
elevator to sorne person and still route their
grain -in that way. But thiere would not
be any ma.uipulating carried on, and they
wvould flot be able to produce twenty-four
grades. It was pointed out that in the
province o! Manitoba the elevators Iost
rnoney. They did flot lose in grades as
they do not 'buy grain. How did they lose
the rnoney? By the opposition of these interior elevators, giviiôg highier grades, and
because they had not any way of fixing it
up at the other end as these gentlemen Iiad.
It is impossible to watch thern as long as
they are allowed to stsy in these elevators
and manipulate them. They work theni
at nights and on hoiidays, and thiey might

even work thern on Suindays. Mr. Cassel2

When the people of the country are interested, as the whole people o! Canada are

luminary, must have read the statement
of a Chief Justice o! England, that
there was no such thing- as a vested

is what these men are asking to-day. They
say, ' We want you to protect our vested

ence to local option. Men are licensed to
seil liquor and encouraged to build hotels,
and are put under a board of commissioners, just the same as the grain people.
These commissioners compel them to put
a.dditions to their hotels and change their
premises and make vast expenditures of
money. But the moment the people of any
county corne to the conclusion that these
men have been breaking the law, they take
a vote on the question and put them out of
business without any consideration of vested rights. If the elevator operators would
observe the laws of the country, you would
neot find much agitation to put them out of
business, but they are continually breaking the law like the others, and they corne
here and suggest what we should do te
keep them straight. 0f course they were
nlot asked directly if they broke the law,
but Mr. Jones or Mr. Brown would acknowledge that he had been fined for a
.breach of the law and some one would aak:
' Could you make some suggestion.' It
*was asking hlm te auggest some means of
keeping himself straight, when the question
waa boiled down. 1These people knew what
the laws were when they camne into the
eountry. They knew the law was subject
te change at any time, and that the government had control of terminal elevators and
was liable te do almoat anything' with
them, and in the face of that they go on
and build the elevators. One company

You

neyer heard of the farmers kicking
about any railroad company mixing their
grain. But are these farmers doing any
more kicking than the farmers did in Minnesota? No, they are not, and if there
were not some fire there would nlot be so
much amoke at the present time. There
la no doubt the elevator companies have
been breaking the law right along. The
object of 'the clause is te separate the two
interests. Clause 123 provides that no man
or body of men cau et the same time run
a string of interior elevaters in the country a.nd operate a terminal elevator. The
terminal elevator must be a storehouse
only, where they will take the grain in,
put it through and let it go out again.
These gentlemen aay, 'You can inspect
the grain and watch it.' Just imagine
where the grain ia running down several
aponta into a vessel the view one can get
of it then. You can legialate ail you like,
appoint ail the commissions you li.ke, and
the commission might watch these gentlemen night and day, but as long as they have
a right te be in the elevater and
operate it this evil will go on. The
only way it can be stopped is by dividing the terminal from the interior elevatera, and making these gentlemen go
out of the terminal elevator business. It
is an easy thing to do that. They are
interested in three or four line elevators
and in the terminal elevator. Some of
them can very eaaily sell their stock in
the terminal elevator and hand it over.
It la no trouble at all, and when it -cornes

when it was thought to be in the public

were set aside when they came in conflîct

because there are ho.nourable men in the
business-seemied to have no regard for
principle, no regard for the righte of their
neighbour, so long as they were able to
secure and build up their own interesta.
I arn not bere to tell you that I have
suffered. We individuaily raised a great
deal of grain, not as mucli as sorne people
li the far west, because we have other
agencies and business that involve our attention, but I have no kick personally in
connection with the grain question. Since
the elevator monopoly was broken up, as
you remember, by the establishment cf
loading platforrns throughout the country
in connection with ail the railway corporations, it lias answered a purpose, and the
least that we have realized in connection
with these platforrns being at the wiil of
the public, it saved us about from 7 to 9
cents a busbel year by year. Now, if it
was that rnuch advantLge to me, what
would it arnount to if you took into consideration the entire harvest that is raised
each season? It is not only that we have
been saved money and outlay li the loading cf our grain, but thixigs have corne
uxider my notice in this way; we have at
Gur own vinlage the very men who have
been giving testimony within the last
month to the members cf your committee.
We have thern with their elevators. As
soon as the Canadian Pacific railway laid*
the fou.ndation for a railway station they
were there, not the individuals, but pa-rtieg
belonging te corporations through which
they were doing business, and they put up
their elevators. The buyer from the elevator of one cf those United States firms
passed me on the platform, anid our men
were busy loading two loads cf grain, and
lie says, 'This is pretty good grain, it is
worth s0 and so, and it will go standard
s0 and so,' but it went on down to the
lakes, and we had the government weighmaster and the government inspection and
we sold it through the Bank cf Canada,
and we just nmade ten cents a bushel
more than if I had deait with the United
States buyer. I do net tae anybody else's
statement for it at ail. It is no straxige
experlence to us; but xny neiglibours and

SENATE
those about us who have net the facilities
we posseas for loading their own grain,
becauae they are living at a distance from
their loading platf cris cannot perhaps
taire that advantage; but they have the advantage that if the elevator operator dees
net do them justice, if they find him doing
what is unjust, they can possibly, by cernbining with their neighbours, load their
grain into the car ever the platformi and
make just as much money. A large portion
of the crop, according to Mr. Cassels, has
been sold or ahipped, transported in cars
given te them on application. Before these
platforms were introducedl, I fought for them
year after year in the Hotise cf Commons,
and they told me I was antiquated; they
toid me that it was ne way te hancile grain,
and who was going te build elevators and
1 said, ' Give me a hammer and saw and a
square and I will put ene up in a very
short time.' We forced them te erect elevators along the main line cf the Canadian
Pacific rafilway tili these little elevators
look like a village or sms.ii town. Ne accommodation could be got without them
and the Canadian Pacifie railway was not
able te provide cars te relieve the congestion that was apparent. I want te speak
in the interesta cf the three hundred theusand people who are engaged in agriculture
in that counitry and the millers aise, because they heid the same views w.. old
in reference te this Bill and the prudence
cf retaining the stringent clause which we
are new discussing. It is ail important
that they shouid have some enceuragement
when they are striving te do their duty
and build up a civilizatien in the w'est second te nene in Canada, that they should
have a hearing as they have hacl before
the gevernment lately in Ottawa, and if
there is one thing more important te theni
than another, it is the very questions that
are embodied in these clauses that are
now under consideration. They know quite
weli, from their experiences, that they cannet entertain any hope of putting a stop
te the fraudulent manipulation cf grain
if the buyers are allowed to retain a connectien with the terminal elevators at the
lakes. My ewn epinion, which I have discussed with the officiais ef the Canadiaii
Hlon.

MNr. DOUGLAS.

Pacifie raiiway more than once, is that if
anybody is responsible for elevators in that
country it is the railway corporations and
flot the people. 1 have iliustrated in this
way, and have received this answer by t.he
Ieading officials of the Canadian Pacifie
railway; that if 1 put down two thousand
bushels of grain in sacks upon your platform, would it net be expected that you
ehould take care of this shipment cf grain.
and protect it frem storma, dampness or
rain; that if I was ready to pay and did
pay ,the charges against it to an agent
cf the railway that the duty of preserving
it and sending it forward from that
point belonged to the railway company
and nlot te me; se that it is net the people
that are te provide the elevators. They are
neot the parties that are responsible for the
means cf carrying on this business as public carriers, but it is the railway ceinpanies, and if hion. members look closely
into the Dominion Raiiway Act and the
Common Carriers Act they wiii fin¶ we are
right on that peint.
The oniy reply given me by the officiais
of the Canadian Pacifie raiiway is this'Well, grain is a very important article.
We are anxious to carry it at the lowest
possible cost, and, therefore, wherever we
can get'aniy assistance, in the direction of
lowering the cost of transportation, we are
pleased te avail ourselves of it. They neyer
for a moment ciaimed that they had a right
to a.3k people to put capital into building
elevators. Sir Thomas Shaughnessy more
than once said te me, ' I have never szet up
a dlaim that the railway company had a
riglit te ask people te put in their cash; but
we have given them this privilege te put in
their money under certain conditions-that
the.v should build a certain size cf elevator,
equipped withi a certain kind cf machinery,
and w-e wouid provide the land for them.'
But they never claimed that it w-as their
duty te do se; it was their convenience te
enjoy it, that is ail. I have neyer spoken
ar-ainst the elevator system. It is perhaps
the best system we can have for the handlinge cf grain if we can get fair play and
honest dealing in connection with it. There
is a zood deai cf encouragement te the

to be piled on each s heli. The shelves that
were intended to accommodate only one or
tèwo tiers of books are now crowded by three
tiers, in many cases, and it means the
shelving accommodation as well as the
storage floor, and other places, are overtaxed. Then the idea of the stackroom,
such as suggested before, even if it were
used for bocks, would only afford temporary
accommodation, and aomething eise 'would
have te be provisded very shortly. By the
-plan prcposed, however, large additional
accommodation could be had, and by the
underground connection, se that communication could ba had with the library, it waa
fait that no greatar inconvanience could be
experianced in getting bocks from that part
of the buildfhg than is now, if yeu are
obliged to get bocks from the gallery. On
the whola, therefore, it seems that that was
the plan that would afford very substantial
addition te the accommodation, and 'with
regard te the staff, instaad cf amploying

system is net a novelty. It is now almost
entirely used in providing books rwhieh

and is 4ound to -work vary succasslully.
Bo that, on the whole, while it is faIt to
ha a larger measure than the other proposition, it is a vary 'lesirable suggestion.
It wae considared aise that it would give,
ta some extent, furthar accommodation for
committees of the Senata, se that two or
three committeas could meet at the samne
time. That, however, the committee deprecated as being net part cf the scheme
desirad. They thought the matter should
ba traatel entirely as one having relation
solely te the library accommodation required. Under these circumstances, the
members of the cemmittee faIt that aftar
all the efforts whichhad been made to arrive at a systam by which soe additional
accommodation cotild ha had, that this
presented the best means cf doing it, and
they, on that account, in the presanca cf
the experts cf the Public Works, the chief
architact being present, made the racom-

mendation, and it was the unanimous recommendation of the members of the cernmittee, composed cf members of both
Houses. Under these circumstances, I
venture te suggest that tabling the report
in this. way, would be misuinderstood by
the House of Gommons to some extent, and
it may only retard doing that which is feit
te be an urgent necessity at the present
time. 1 venture te suggest. therefore, that
instead of tabling the report, another course
might be adopted, which would throw the
onus cf providing accommodation ùpon the
department instead cf leaving it te the
committee.
Hon. Sir GEORGE W. ROSS-I think
this House shoul1 fot put any obstacle
in the way cf enlarging and improving the
librar accommodation. I remember nearly
some thirty years ago it was feit by members cf the House cf Gommons, that even
then the library was congested. There is
now ne room for newspaper files easy cf reference, as any member must know by experience. It is impossible to *make a classification cf such material as is used b'y the
members of the House in order to have
easy reference. A library, such as we require, ought to be 80 classifled that members cf this .House, and members cf the
other House, could easily avail themselves
of its contents, without any reference te
the librarian. 1 had the pleasure cf being
very familiar with the old library as then
arranged, and without any reference te the
librarian or his assistant, I cculd easily
find anything 1 wanted. The library is
flow so cver-loaded, net oilly with parliamentary literature, but literature of another kind, that without the assistance cf
the librarian and one or more cf bis clerks,
you are at a less te find anything yeu
want. As I understand, it is proposel te
make an addition to this end of the build-,
ing cerrespending te the additien made te
the west end. The Senate should net thrcw
any obstacle in the way cf improving, first
the general appearance cf this building and
secondly, afferding the accommodation required. At Washington, they have a
six million dollar i>uilding which is a
credit to them. It ought te be, for the
meney. This small expenditure, censidering the advantages which. it will afford te

HOURS 0F LABOUR BILL.
DEBATE CONTlNUEFD.
The order of the day being called:
Ltesuming the further adjourned debate cxi
the motion for the second readin of Bill
of
<Ne. 3) An A-et respecting the "onze6
Labour on Public Werks.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I have but a few
words to add to the remarks which I -made
the other day on this Bill. As I stated, in
my humble opinion it is a question in
which both capital and labour have a common interest, and if the hours of labour aire
to be shortened, they should be shortened
not only as regards the construction of
public works, but in the interest of labour
generally, and because it is net against the
interest ef the country at large. I have
very strong doubts as te whether it would
be in the interest of the country at large.
Take for instance, the effect on agricultural
labour. Agriculture in the neighbourhood
of largae centres is demoralized because it
is very difficult te obtain labour at prices
which prevail for farming purposes <when
much higher prices are paid in large cities.
If we wvere te add te the condition ef things
now prevailing the further condition that
people employed in the cities would 'work
enlv eight heurs a day, which is quite an
impossibility on farms, there would be a
great danger that farm labour would be altogether demoralized.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-This does
net apply te farm. labour or any ether
labour but governmnent labour.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I know perfectly wel
that At does not apply te, farm labour; but

SENATE
the measure 1 said that if the senators
would concur in the second reading without committing themselves to the principle
of the Bill, I intended to refer it to a
special committee. That committee I pro
pose to be composed af the iollowing gentlemen: Hon. Messrs. Casgrain, Watson,
Baird, Power, Thompson, Sir Mackenzie
Bowell, Lougheed, Ellis, and the maver.
There was a committee appointed in the
House of Commons who went very fully
into the question, and whose report is
published in a very voluminous document,
yet I doubt if very many members of the
Senate have perused that document or
really know the evidence that was submittei and the reasons that induced the House
af Commons te pass this Bill unanimously.
So I thought by referring it to a committee
such as I have named, they could discuss
the evidence that has been laid before parJiament and would be able to corne ta a
conclusion and offer a recommendation te
the Senate which would be a valuable one.
1 arn quite opposel to the views that have
bzen enunciated by the han. gentleman
from De Saiaberry (Mr. Beique), and the
hon. gentleman from Repentigny (Mr. Legris). First if was proposed that this Bill
was nlot wit.hin the power of parliament
to pass. That was proved to be erroneous
by the fact that parliament has acted already in this matter by establishing the
fair wagc clauses: So that it ia undoubtedly admitted that parliameni has the
right t0 pass this Bill. If is also contenicd that if is objectionable because it does
nlot apply to ahl classes and ail trades.
That I think is a one-sided and narrow
view fa take. The Bill only applies ta
public buildings. If we sfart xvith that,
and it proves in the interest of fhe public,
why should we nof extend the principle'r
if it does not prove ta be in the interest of
the workingman and of flic country, then,
parliament will not go any further. In
any event, I think if is right that we
should make a start, more especiallv as
cight hours is recognized as a dav's wvark
ail over. You cannot get a miechanie in
the city of Toronto ta work, more than 44
hours a week, 4 hours icss than this Bill
pravides for. It is the ordinary ru'le thaf
eight hours shahl constitute a day's labour,
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL

and I ioubt very much if in many public
buildings thilt are constructcd to-day flie
workmen work more than eight hours a
day. Therefore, in providing thaf eight
hours shaîl be a day's work on buildingerected by the Public Works Department,
we are making- a start as if were. If it
proves to be in the interests of the workingrnan and the community, everybely will
rejaice and we wilh go further. If, on the
other hand, if does nof, we certainly shahl
not go any further. It has been pointed
ouf that flic main objecf af parliament,
while they have ta consider the interefs
af aIl classes, should be ta carefully guard
ftle interests ai labour. The wealthy man,
the rich corporations, flic railway companies
have abundant means f0 bring influence f0
bz-ar upan parliament, and their righ'fs are
always protecfed; but parliament should
watci -and guard the inferesta ai the mari

that have been passed by this and previous
governments looking ta the benefit ai thc
ivorkingman have aIl tended to elevate and
ennoble the position and standing ai the
workingwnan, -and 1 venture ta say that in
Canada to-day aur mechanics and artisans
accupy highier and better positions tha-n

other part of the world. I remember when
it was the custom ta work from sunrise

of Canada must conclude that a second
Chamber should be of some use, and 1
know of no instance in which it shou:ld use
its independent thought more freely thaD
i the case now before us. The hon. gentleman went further; he said that the gQv.
ernment had already adopted the principle,
and that parliament had given them the
power to regulate the hours of labour in
the Printing Bureau. That is quite true.
They askezl for that power, and it was
necessary that they should have it, perhaps, though I am flot prepared to say it
is absolutely ueceasary, because every employer of labour can regulate the hours
for which he is willing to psy those who
work for him. It was not, therefore, absolutely necessary, but it is on the statu-tebook. The hon. gentleman who introduced
this Bill spoke very feelingly on the subject of the workingman, but he scarcely
touched the provisions of the Bill. This
measure only applies to contracts for the
construction of public buildings. The government may, for instance give a contract
for the building of a wharf, and another
contract for the construction of a warebouse on that wharf. The men working en
the wharf may be obliged to work ten or
twelve hours a day-in fact there is no restriction as to the number of hours they
may be require.i to work. But the contractor who is building the warehouse can
not require bis workrnen to work for more
than eight hours a day. I arn not opp,)sed
to the restriction of labour to eight hours
where it can be done in any branch of business, but if it is right in one case it
should be right in all cases. After hearing
the evils of workîng more than eight hours
a day, it is a marvel to me that there are
now any people alive. I commenced work
to earn a pittance when I was nine years
of age, and have been 'working ever since
often fourteen and fifteen hours a day, an i
I arn under the impression that it lias not
hurt me.

that there are tiines in ai printîng establishments when the employees have to work
almost any hours in order to get out the
edition of the paper. The best princîple,
to my mind, is to allow people who employ
labour to make their own bargains. This
is supposed to be a free country; but the
larws we are asked to place on the statutebook would soon cease to make it free. We
would be governed by arbitrary laws, some
of which are absolutely incapable of being
observed. I arn denounced very often as
an old Tory, but I must confess that the
radicalism of the. present day as embo;gied
in Bis of this kind, is more arbitrary and
tyrannical than any legislation of the past
to which mankind has had to submit. 1

know is that the government, being the
party making the contract, bas a right tu
impose such conditions as it pleases. If
so, why not leave it in 'that position? The
law gives the government power to regulate
the hours of labour in the Prirnting Bureau,
but there is notbing compulsory in the law.
Then, why make this, compulsory' If you
make it compulsory, do you not infringe

If you leave it in the power o! the government to do as they please, they can make

this or any other country that refused them
their just rîghts, or even rights that may
noft be exactly just, something to rernember
to their detriment as happened in the past

that the fundamental principle laid down

should be conceded to the workingmen.

They are morally as good as îrwe are. Their

their status more on a level with ours. ls
there anything wrong with that? No, hon.
gentlemen. Even if they were stretching
their demands, we who are in the full enjoyment of prosperity should be the last
to put any impediment in the a'ay of their
just demands. Bo long as they are reasonable, let us grant to themn what they ask.

They are flot asking for a sweeping ni6asure

They are giving practically entire satisfaction to the grain growers. So, we see
there would be only a capacity of about
7,000,000 for the, railway companies to acquire. That would give them control of
the whole thing, and there would be no
more trouble on this question.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-If the Canadian Pacifie railway gives entire satisfaction, how
la it that ail the grain is not shipped
through its elevator?
Hon. Mr. TÂLBOT-I suppose it is because the owners of these country elevators
control the rest oi the terminal elevators,
and have the grain shippel to their oWn
terminal elevators.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE-I arn speaking o!
the grain of the high-class faimers.
Hon. Mr. TALBOT-I supposé in mauy
cases it would not be convenient. Many
live along the lines of the Grand Tnk
railway and the Canadian Northern.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-It is ail in the handa
of a combine.
Hon. Mr. TALBOT-The Canadian Northern Railway Company owns some of these
elevators, but lease them. The samne remark applies to the elevators ownied by
the Grand Trunk Pacific. The men who
own the country elevators are those who
have formed the cômpanies andl leased
these terminal elevators for* the sole pur:
pose of making enormous profits out of
manipulation of the wheat, and that is certainly donc. The proposai made by the
majority of the committee which considered
this Bill would leave practically the whole
question in the hands of a commission. I
amn free te admit that some people might
be in favour of that. When the evidence
was taken before the special committee,
one o! the owners of the terminal elevators
sai-d that it would be impossible for mixing
of grain to take place unleas there n'as collusion bctween the operator of the clevator
and thc government inspecter. I think we
are quite justified in saying that it is truc
that manipulation of grain could not tal<e
place unlcas there was collusion o! thst
kind, and bear in mind that mixing has
taken place when governiment officiais wcre

5f

there-then there must have been collusion, and if these people are willîng to
bribe inspectors-and that may have beexi
done--it wvas possible te do it-is it net
possible that it may be done again? I amn
forced to the conclusion that the only
possible way to overcome the difficulty is
to deprive these people o! the power of
doing it. The minority report was for leaving these clauses exactly as they were in
the Bill at firat. I amn quite wiling te admit that they are pretty drastic, and perhaps unworkable, but it has been suggested that they should be slight.ly amended, and I offer the foilowing motion: instead cf clause 123, insert the following:
\-o person, owning. managing, operating, or
otherwise interested in any terminal elevators
shall bny or seil grain at any point in the
western inspection division.
This section shall net apply te any person

with the approval, cf the Governor in Concil.
I am sorry that the feeling throughout
this House is net more favourable te cernpelling railway companies te own and
operate those terminal elevators under the
superintendence or control cf the government.
Hon. '-%r. MACDONALD (B.C.)-What
%vould become of the country elevators ?
WVould they be abolished altogether?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL-I have net had
an opportunity te hook at the amendment
which has been offcred te the House; I
have only heard it rcad. However, as one
cf those who strongly supported the majority report cf the committee investigating
this matter, I desire te say a word or two
on the question. The whole complaînt for
years back has been that the grain, when
it w~ent te its terminal elevators at Port
Arthur and Fort William, was mixed, and
the quality deteriorated by mixing No. 2
with No. 1. The gevernment have from

S EN ATE
tine to time, at the request of the wuillers
of Ontario and the grain growers of thre
northwest devised more stringent regulations. They have particularly provided
.ueans by wfrich the farmers of the Northwest can ahip their grain direct. At one
,time a farmer could flot ship his grain un.less he passed it through an elevator and
1'aid a charge for that service. Ile government have provided that platforms shail
be erected so that any farmer wbo desires
to ship his grain can do so without passing
it through an elevator. He was also given
the privilege of obtaining cars. The railways at one time would not give the farmers cars; they gave them ail to the elevator men; but the government provided
that the farmers must get their cars just
the saine as the elevator men and so, as
the hon. meniher bas stated, the weights
were inspected, and provision was made for
the careful weighing of grain, and in
varjous ways provision was made to facilitate the direct sihipment of grain f rom the
Northwest, so that any farmer who had a
car-load of grain could ship it himself
direct through to the coast or to the terminal elevators at Port Arthur and Fort
William. But, notwithstanding ail these
precautions, we have found, as time went
on, that other amendments were required,
that mixing was being done at the terminal
elevators at Fort William. 1 do not believe
that this bas been carried on to any very
great extent the last year or two. ThE
firm. with which I arn connected handie
about one million bushels o! grain per
year fromn the northwest, and during the
past year I must say that we have had very
little cause o! complaint. Sometimes, of
course, car-loads of wheat would arrive at
our mill that we believed were not as good
as we bought, but that can be accounted
for in this way: you may have one hundred thousand bushels of No. 1 hard or
No. 1 Northern, identically the same
grade in every respect, put into a bin,
and when it is tak*en out and put in
a car here and a car there and a car
somewherelse, you will find the grain
from some cars will be very much poorer
than the grain from the others. That is
accounted for by the fact that tihe chaff
and so forth goes to the side, and by and

by cornes down in a bunch, and although
the grain is taken out of the same bin aird
was identically the sanie wheat when it
was placed in the bin, when it comes froin
the cars some is much poorer than others.
1 account for this from the fact that sornetimes during the last year we have got
cars that were not Up to the standard, but
no arrangements you can make will prevent that. It cannot be avoided. As the
grain goes in, the chaif goes to the sîde,
and when you corne to empty the bin it
will necessarily follow that some portions
of the grain wil not be as good or as dlean
as others. The charge was made, but notwithstanding ail the precautions taken,
notwithstanding ail the regulations t.hat
have been made and the facilities that
were given for the handlîng and preservatien of these different grades by themselves,
manipulation was going on in Fort William and Port Arthur. I believe that fact
was established st year, or a short time
ago. To remedy that, the government now
introduce another Bill, more stringent than
ever before, and they make an entirely new
departure. Their departure is that they
place tihe whole control of the grain in the
hands of three independent commissioners,
who are under oath of office, who have no
interest whatever in the grain, who cannot
buy a bushel of wheat, have no stock in
the elevator, entirely tindependent men,
obligaed to live at Fort William and Port
Arthur, and are given the widest possible
powers. There is no commission that could
be appointed who could possess wider
powers than these commissioners. A mari

out unless they see it going out and inspeet it. Tbey have the widest possible
powers to close up an elevator in 24 hours
for any infraction o! this law. The fines
are very severe. Nnt only fines, but imprisonment follows also, and if the terminal
elevator man attempts to mix or deteriorate
the grain, the means of inspection are so
easy and the penalty so great that a man
would be the biggest fool on eartb if he
attempted anything o! the kind. That

and an authority on the grain business,
gave evidence to the same effect. Tbey
were supportedi by Mr. McKenzie, who -represents the Manitoba farmerà, Mr. Bower
who mrepresents the larmoe of Alberta,
and the representative of the farmers of
Saskatchewan. They were ail very strong
on tbis point. My hon. friend has assumed that we cari control tbis trade by
appomnting a commission. If you appoint
& commission, and wbile they are in their
offices there are nine or ten terminal elevators working, with 75 or 80 spouta In
each, how is this commission to control
them any more than they have been controlled in years gone byP
We had first css supervision as far as
we could get it. We had Mr. Gibybs, a gentleman wbo would undoubtedly do bis duty.
We had Mr, Gassels and officiais of tha.
kiud, but unfortunately there are forty,
fifty, or one hundred men engaged under
these officers. There would be probably
twice as many ander the commission. When
these men made the statement that it was
imposeible te do any mixing witbtmt collusion between themselves and the operators, and we have the lacIs that mixing
has been done, that is clear evidence that
there bas been collusion, and tbey have
been bribing our officiais. Can tbey not
bribe tbem under a commission as well as
Ihey can under tbe present law? I say
tbey can. I do not care wbat commission
you appoint, as long as you have gain as
the incentive, and leave the men in the
elevators. Tbe men are a little better than
labourers, and are receiving small salaries,
and one hundred dollars looks the aize of
a cart wbeel to tbem. They would run
around the block once for $100. That iî
the evidence given by Mr. Flavelle,.and
Mr. Watts wbo represent the millers, Mir.
Hogg, who represents the grain section of
the Toronto Board of Trade, gave similar
testimony, and if we had the evidence
of members of the Montreal Board of
Trade il would be exactly in line with
that. I was speaking to members of the
Board of Trade in Montreal, and tbey are
of the same opinion as Mr. Watts and nther
gentlemen. Tbe bon, gentleman takes theý
ground that after the grain leaves the

farmer's hands they have no more interest
in it. Surely be il nlot sincere.

friend's argument the purchaser could take
the stuif out of tbe bottles and put inferior
stuif in them and oeil il as the genuirie
article, and Crosse & Blackweil would have
no interest in it at ail. The argument is
nonsensical. The farmers have tbe greatest interest in keeping Up tbe standard of
the grain tbey put on the market. If thev
had not, they would not fight the case so
strenuously. The gentlemen who are opposing tbis Bill are trying to deteriorate the
quality of oui grain, and wby sbould we
not endeavour te keep up the standard? My
bon. friend sys be is opposed te mixing.
and at the same time be sys that if tbese
gentlemen are not allowed to keep their
elevators they will take the grain to Duluth,
and so on. I suppose he means tbey c'ould
take it over there and mix it. If he is nlot
in favour of mixing, how will that work
out? If Lbey are allowed to mix in Duluth
tbey will take it over there and mix iL. If
my hon. friend is not lu favour of any mixing, lis argument is of no effect. The Bill
before us may require some amendment.
There were two or three flaws in iL. One
was in reference to the millers wbo had eIevaters on the other side of the lake. Tbe
amendment proposed by my hon. lriend
from Lacombe (Hon. Mr. Talbot) would
rectify that flaw, and I think if those
amendments are adopted the Bill will be

workable. My hon. friend goes on to sav
that they control only 8,00,000 bushels au
the present time, and is it not better ta
nip the monopoly in the bud, even if we
have to lease those elevators. Something
will have to be done, and we may as well
do it today as to-morrow, because we can
do it twice as easily now. If we leave it
over for a year or two they will have 16,000,000 bushels. We ahould allow the Cana.
dian Northern railway to take back their
elevators and operate them. As common
carriers, they are the parties to provide
atorage for any commodity. If the argument werc carried to its logical conclusion,
the railways would be forced to store the
grain in the country elevators. What difference is there between grain and other
merchandiseP If you take your merchandise to a station, the railway is supposed
to receive and ship it, and when it reaches
its destination they are supposed to store
it. There was no complaint as long as
the Canadian Northern railway and' the
Canadian Pacifie railway were handling the
terminais until these gentlemen came fromn
the other aide of the line-gentlemen who
have been dealing in this sort of thing in
the United States. If my hon. friend takes
a record of the grain trade in the United
States hie will find that they have paid a
great deal of money into the courts. The
hion. member speaks of the enormous fines.
What condition would the country be in
if we imposed enormous fines. Supposing
that by this crooked traffic the elevator
men are allowed to make one million dollars, and we impose on them a fine of
fifty thousand dollars, what position are
we in?

0f course there may be imprisonment.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS.

There wvas imprisonmient across the line~.
and I understand soine gentlemen ov. r
there are doing a termi now, and that may
be the reason for a lot of these gentlemen
doing business here. I do flot know anything' about t.hat. The terminal elevator
part of it, and the mixiing of the grain iis
not the worst feature. The greatest objection is that they are gradually getting their
clutches on the whole grain trade of the
west. They can do that by giving higher
prices for the grain than the men who are
competing wit~h them. Their competitors
can only pay what they can realize for the
grain, and a fair profit. These gentlemen
from the States can go a grade higlier and
fix it up with the terminal elevator. The
smaller man is frozen out. In the west,
one firm had two or three elevators in the
one town. Hon. members will find that
the samne thing exists in the United States.
If these people wanted to do an honest
business, why should the Peavey interest
corne into this country and organize tJxree
or four companies under different naines
when they control the whole thing! Why
should they not say, ' We are the Peavey
Company and are doing business all over

the country.'
under the name of the North Wind Company and the Golden West Company and s0
on? They jodn with anoîwner man named
Douglas and get hîm into a half partnership and organize another company, and
they are getting their clutches on the whole
grain trade of the west. If we do not do
something to chioke them off now-anid
these clauses -will have that effect-inside
of five years we will flot be able to do"it.
By that time they will have their clutches
on the grain trade of the west. My hon.
friend alluded to the fact that in one State
thev appointed a commirission to investigate
this thing, and they found that the farmers of one State were losing eight and a
half million a year in the manipulation of
their grain at the lake ports, and they
strongly advised the legislature to take
action to secure terminal elevators. My
hon. friend may say At is not in the finterest of the farmer to keep up the standard
of the grain; but I think it is not only in
their interests to preserve the standapd as
it was put on the British market, but 1

APRIL 27 1911
think At is the interest of evcry man,
woman and child in the country te see
that the reputatiien cf our goods is maintained. When an article has the government stamp on it, it is the same as a dollar bill and it should go to the market
when it has that stamp on it'in the same
condition that it leaves the farmers' hands
or the transportation company. That is
what we all desire, and the only question
is how can we carry it out. My hon. friend

says * Appodnt a commission.'
commission is ne use, because we had
government control before and these gentlemen got around that control. One of
the leading men in Port Arthur said, «They
are a very ingenieus lot of gentlemen; if
you close one hole they will open another.'
They are like gophers, you cannot stop
them; they have seventy spouts in the elevator and one man with a. littie' cup le
watching it go into the boat, and if they
pull another rope the stream. goes down
another spout, ani ha is none the wiser.
As long as these men are aflowed te stay
in the elevators, yen may appoint ail the
government commissioners yen like, but
yen will net control the trade. One gentleman, who represented the Peavey interest, said that ail the interest they had
at stake was $250,000. He said they
leased the Canadian Northern railway
elevators and were doing business, and
they had put up a bond cf $50,000 with the
gevernment. A. times they had upwards
of $5,000,000 worth cf grain in their possession. These men who had only $250,000
cf assets, had over $5,000,000 cf other people's property in their possession. I asked
the question, «Supposiug there was a fire,
who would the insurance be paid te"' The
answer was, «It would go through our
pockcts first.' There might be some
trouble about that. They say that they
cannot make away with the grain. That is
ail tommy rot. I know, as a matter cf
fact, that a gentleman came te Port Arthur
last year with a number cf warehouse receipts for grain that was supposel te be
in the elevators. and the grain was not
there. That is something that can be
preven. The grain had been loaned. One
gentleman said he had been fined for
Iending grain. They lend other peoplc's

property. They speculate with it. If you
had five car-loads of grain there and were
holding it, they would charge yen storage
on it, and at the same time they might
ship it to somebody else. That is where
they make part of their profits. I dlaim
that these clauses, with the amendment
which my hon. fricnd from Lacombe (Hon.
Mr. Talbot) has submitted, are absolutely
necessary to the welfare cf 'western Canada in particular, and te the whole Dominion. Now is the time te put it in force.
The government can look after the veste.!
rights. The govcrnment can lease the elevators. or do semething with thesu, but
let us put these men eut of them.

Hon. Mr. DAVIS-I do net think the
goverument wili be called upon et ail;

Suppesing my hon. friend owned a ter-minai
elevator at the head o! the lakes, and
owned three strings of interior elevators
in the country, and supposing tbe govern.
ment said that in the interests cf the people ef Canada they could net allow hini
te operate a terminai elevator any longer,
dees net my hon. friend think he could
seIl that elevator te somebody, if he couli
show by bis bocks that it wvas making 20
per cent profit? He could say te his cuIstomer, ' I still own these interior elevator'ý
and if yen buy this terminal elevator I
will route my grain thrcugh your terminal
elevater, se long as ycu treat me decently.'
If yeu sell a piece cf prcperty and take a

SENATE
mortgage on it, you would like to see the
nman 'who purchased it earning some money
so that he would be able to psy the principle and interest when due. I think this
whole argument about vested rights is a
big piece of bluff.
Hlon. Mr. McHUGH-Did 1 uilderstand
the hon. gentleman to make a statement
that the owners of these terminal elevatora
went out into the country and bought
grain at a higher grade than it really was?
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-If my hon. friend has
read the evidence he wiil find it there.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH-What is the answer
to that?
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-That the evidence says
£0.

Hon. Mr. McHUGH-Does not the grade
regulate the price?
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Mr. Gage, who gave
evidence before the committee, and several
others, said that they lost fifteen to, twenty
four per cent of their grades. That means
they Iost one-fourth. My hon. friend knows
that the epread fa somewhere about three
cents, so the amount of loss must have been
enormous. 1 asked the question, how
could a man doing business alongside of
!hein compete under the circumstances.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH-If they bought the
wheat, at a hîgher grade, did not the farmiers make the money?
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Yes, tempo rarily; bt
it would not continue that way.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH-If the farmer gets
a higher grade from these people, hie ought
io be thankful for competition o! that kind.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-lt is done to destroy
competition, and as soon as competitors
are squeezed out-and it wiIl not take very
long to, do that-the monopoly will have
the field to itself.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE--Complaints have
been made that the grain bas been
niixed to the detriment of ihe grain
growers. The fsct bas been proved, at

that mixing bas taken place; to what exHon. Mr. DAVIS.

tent the evidence is conflicting. But whether it has been done on a large or a smal
scale, we are ail agreed that it should lx
stopped. Even if the complaints, are not
well founded, s0 long as there is a suspicion in the minds of the grain growexs that
they are flot properly treated, that dmpression should be removed. That is the object of this Bill. It has been drawn Up on
the principle of creating a commission
which. should be entrusted with very wide
powers, a commission of experts which
would tske the matter in hand and set
that the grain growers are deait with faîr]y

has gone to this further extent, that At
may, if found necessary, expropriate the
ternihial elevators and run them as government property. Evidently the parties wh<
drafted this Bill had in mind that the conimission shouid first ascertain whether they
could flot work out the iaw in such a way
as to renuove all grounds of complaint and
render the expropriation and management
of the elevators by the government uninecessary. It seems to me that when a commission of experts às appointed, that commission should determine what rules and
reguistions may be necessary to attain the
object in view, and it would not be wis,on the part of this parliament, composed
as it is of men like myseif who are not experts, to attempt to lay down in detail the
rules which shall govern the commission
or which shall apply in the working out
of the Iaw. I do not think it would be
wise. Parliament proceeded in a different
way when the Railway Board was establisb.-d. Parliament gave the Railway Board
fulli power to enact ail rules and regulations which they migaht deem necessarY,
and the commission has worlçed to the
satisfaction of the community at large. For
mx' part, 1 expect and have great confidence that a competent expert commission
will easily find the means of attaining the
obiect in view without havin.L recolurse
either to confiscation or expropriation. If
it should be found necessary that the government must purchase the terminal elevators in order to remove ail grounds of comnplaint, I shail neyer consent to any legislation which would involve confiscation

oi property, whether owned by Canadians
or by citizens of the United States. Such
legisiation would be a blot upon our
statute-book. It ie ail very well to say,
as the hon. gentleman from Prince Albert
has said time and again, and waa stated
by Mr. Watts before the committee, that
when these gentlemen came into Canada
and invested their money in elevators they
knew that the laws could be changed. No
doubt they did, but they had a right to
expect that in changing the law, vested
rights would be respected.
Hon. Mr. DAVIS-Have they a right to
break the iaws?

mare stringent regulations can be adopted.
Instead of attempting now ta pravide that
the commission shail do thia or that, and
frame ruies and embody thcm in a Bill,
it will be much better ta leave the enforcing
of the law to the commission. It has been
argued that the terminal clevators should
be owned by the railway companies. To
that argument I have two answers; first,
that we are not dealing with that question
at ail. The Bill is not drafted an those
lines and we are confincd ta dcaling with
clauses 122, 123 and 242, which have nothing
to do with that matter. It wouid have to
be a different thing altogether. The matter ivould have ta be submitted ta the Rail%vay Board by way of calling on thcmn to
make regulations ta compel the railway
companies ta build elevatore at their terintai points, to what extent I am unable
ta suggest at the present moment.
My second answer je this: that it would
not be workable. There are to-day three
great companies interested at terminal
points, the Grand Trunk Pacific, the Canadian Pacifie raiiway and-the Canadian Northcrn railway. Five years hence there
may be five or six mare campanies intercsted. How would the government or the
commission which je ta be appointed or the
Railway Board apportion the elevators between the different railways? They wouid
have ta say that the Canadian Pacifie railwvav chall build ca many elevators, the
Grand Trunk Pacifie ca many, and the
Canadien Northern railway sa many.

H-on. Mr. CLORAN-I have a most profound respect for the opinions of the last

mean that I shouid endorse them. In bis
abie and very clear way of discussing the
question, he put before this honourabie
House a proposition which I for one amn
neot prepared to accept. 1 believe in the
efficiency of commissions to administer,
but I arn net going to accept the principle
that commissions shouid be the government. The Raiiway Commission or any
other commission shouid only have the
power to administer the law; they should
nlot be given the right to make the law.
Parliament only is entitled to make the
law, and At is not within our right to delegate our legisiative powers te any commission. We are here te express the wiil of
the people, to formulate that wili into law
and then wc can put that law into thc

ting considerable support in this country,
but it is a false principle, and I contend that the representatives of the
people should formulate the will of
the people afid then commit it to a
department or a commission to be administered. I cannot agree with my hon. frieiid
when he says that the governnient and
parliament will be relieved of ail responsibility by putting the administration of
this law in the hands of a commission.
~There are two hundred thousand farmers
in the west asking for a certain thing,
against the demands of three or four capitalists who are more or less jnterested in
certain property called elevators. We have
two hundred thousand farmers who represent a million of people, asking for a certain thing. Let us pass that, put it, into
law and then give it into the bands of a
commission to administer. We should flot
transfer our rights and duties to a body of
experts. We are here te listen to the appeal of from two to t.hree hundred thousand
farmers from the west who are asking- for
protection. Is that protection against the
interest of the country or against their interests? There is absolutely ne truth that
it is against the interest cf the country.
Ail the truth is that it is in the interest

of the farmers and their families. Wby
nlot give them what they ask? Why nlot
say to the farmers of the west, «You are
asking for this law; you want to seil your
grain under certain conditions; You are
masters-of the situation, and yeu shall dietate the conditions under which your product shahl be sold.' A few men have some
capital invested in elevators, and we are
asked to counteract the wiil of the people
in their intereat. Are the farmers asked
to' legisiate against the interest of the elevator onlyP They are net. The gratin will
stîhl pass through these elevators. Parliament should listen to the voice of the west.
The voice cf the west is going to be dominant in this country, and we are net powerful enough ini this Senate te go against it.
If the voice cf the west is streng enough,
then I say grant their request and let the
people knowv that they have a fearless,
independent body in the Senate That is
the position that 1 assume on this question and 1 amn entirely in harmony with
the hon. gentlemen from Saskatchewan and
Lacombe (Mr. Davis and Mr. Talbot) and
I think this legisiation ought te be adopted. The grain Bill, as far as it goes, is
good, and I do net see any reason why
parliament should object te the amendmnent
asked for on béhaif of these 200,000 farmers, who have ne objection te the elevators handling their grain, but they do net
want it handied under f aise pretenses.
Supposing I were a farmer in the west and
had 2,000 busheis of grain, 1,000 No. 1 and
1,000 No. 2 or 3; 1 have a right te say how
that shahl be graded and sold, as the hon.
gentleman said, te maintain net oniy my
interest but that of the country. I certainhy enderse the position taken by the
hon. senator fromn Saskatchewan.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-I should
like te refer te a point which bas net been
adverted te in this discussion, and that is
that Canada has attained a very high reputation for preducing the best grain in the
werid. The further north yeu have sunlight, and can grow grain successfully, the
more perfect it seems te be. There arp
elements in the Canadian grain that are
nowv being- discevered-a larger proportion

Lt is of the highest importance that the
national reputation for the production of
grain of that superior quaiity shall be
maintained. It is one of the reasons that
is now hringing to our land in the northwest not only American farmers, but iarmers from different parts of Europe. It is flot
many years since the people in Edinburgh
and Glasgow found that a bag of Canadian
No. 1 Northern wouid make mure loaves of
bread than the grain grown in England
from the best soil, and consequentiy there
arose a very great desire on the part of
mi1lers and others to obtain (Janadian grain.
Therefore, in any legislation we are going
to adopt we should take that as the primary
condition. Ail other interests sink into insignificance if the character of our grain
is to be distnrbed. We have had before
the Senate during the last ten years a
variety of Acts bearing upon this subject,
and after a great deal of discussion we have
fixed certain standards. It is of the highest importance that these standards shall
be preserved. Scientifia farmers, as described by my hon. friand from Lacombe,
are raising a very auperior quality of wheat,
and this qnaiity of wheat is being year by
year improved. If any hon, gentleman has
the curiosity to go to the Experimental
Farm in the neighbourhood of Ottawa, he
wiil find that they are constantly crossing
grades of wheat with'a view of improving
the grades that ,are grown now in the
northwest. That is a sort -of wealth that
Canada ought not to sacrifice, and if a
farmer at Edmnonton wants to send a car
load of wheat to Liverpool, the standard
cf that grain should be sacrediy preserved,
and there shouid be no mixing or mingiing
of it. We know that the great crime of this
age is aduiteration. Countries have been
obliged to pass pure food iaws. In the United States they are endeavouring to enaet
pure food laws, but they cannot do it. If
you look in the morning papers you wiii
read of frauds on the banks, frauds in
stocks of varions kinds, and other frauds.
It is the curse of the' day; ail the fraudulent schemes of past ages pale into insignificance when compared with the frauds
of our own age.

EIGHT HOURS DAY BILL.
The order o! the day being called:
Res'uming- the further adjourned debate on
the motion for the second reading (Bill 3),
* Ant Act respecting the Hours of Labour en
Public Works.'
Hon. Mr. POIRIER-Much scripture lias
been quoted during the discussion of this
Bill, the lion. gentleman from De Lanaudière making the first quotation. Arguments can be found pro and con in scripture; therefore I attacli no great weighit
to these quotations as bearing on the
question. We all know that one of the
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT.

L-salmus of King David praises this proposition in favour of the eight hour work
per day. The part of the scripture which
ha-s bearing on this question is the firat
condemnation that was passed on our"forefath'i
Yain the penalty to work ànd the
penalty to die. Ever since that time
humanity has tried to alleviate thn pains
and pangs that attend on death. Ever
since that time, men have tried to make
that severe law of labour that we shall
earn our bread by the sweat of our brow,
ligliter and ligliter. It is oniy within tlie
last centuries that the labouring classes
have reached a position which is acceptable
to them, and whicli goes to the crédit of
mankind at large. Remember that ignorance and excess of labour and of liardship
have for ages gone hand in liand. The
couritries wliere slavery and bondage existed
and wliere they now exiat, have been and
are the poorest in tlie world. I-t is not the
longest hours given to work, it is not the
severest drudgery, that brings tlie best resuits; it is intelligent work; it is the work
of the free, intelligent and instructed labourer. Not only ignorance but intempérance
goes band in hand witli excess of labour.
This is not pa-adoxical. It is a fact. When
a man finds that his whole life muet be
devoted to toil and drudgery, it lowers his
ambition and he gets out of heart, and on
his way home he is apt to take a drink
and to get into bad habits. He is much
more apt to do these things than a man

serted in this House, and in the other
House. History will not bear the contrary as~sertion. I may qurote évidence from
many practical men to prove my assertion.
In the committee of the House of Commons, Mr. Francq, of Montreal, in his testimony concerning the effect of overwork
on temperance, answered the charge that
if labourers were aliowed more leisure
hours they would devote tliem to drinking and debaucliery. Hlere is what he said
in bis evidence before the House: ' In my
own trade, the printing line; since we had
the eiglt-liour day, men le! t the crowded

districts of Montreal and proceeded at once
to their homes in the suburbs, and were
not loafing any more on St. Lawrence Main
street, but at four o'clock in the afternuon
when they quit work they went home, and
the moral -standard of our men has gained fifty per cent '. This is the te8timony
given by one of our own men. Experienced
men in the United States and Eng'land
produce proof s ta correborate this, but I
will simply give a few lines of what Lord
Brassey - says on the question: 'No class
uf men employ their leisure more wisely,
especially when they have around them
the means of improvement, and are encouraged in intellectual pursuits and moral
cultivation, than the labouring classes .
There is another question which I will
toucli on briefly; it is the effect of the
shortened hours upon production. I think
it is admitted by ail that there will be
no decrease in quality. I go further and
say boldly, that every one who has paid
any attention to the. question must admit
that there will be an increase in quality.
What about quantityP Committees have
been held trying to get information on this
point, and volumes have been printed from
the testimony of practical men to show
that even in quantity there is no appreciable loss, if any. Here is what Adam
Smith says, he being an autharity on tbis
question: 'A reduction in the hours o!
labour does not necessarily involve a corresponding- reduction in the amaunt of
work performed. A littie more diligence
would easily enable a workman to get
through as much work in nine hours as in
ten '. At that time it wvas flot a question of eight haurs, it was fine and ten.
Another authority an the same question
says: 'The man who wrorks sa moderately
as to be able to work constantly, not only
preserves his health longest, but in the
cours e of a year executes the greatest quantity of work '. I will flot give any more
quotations from authorities an thjs subject, but will conclude by saying, if I have
ta cite the scriptures again: ' Man liveth
nat by bread alone '. Labour is executed
for the gaining af one's earthly livelihood;
bread, shelter and clothing. Are we, who
have, through a merciful Providence, a
chance o! having something more than
bread, going ta stamp oui foot down and

from securing what is necessary ta their*

country; being free themselves and Christians. Even if they were pagans it wouldnot be fair to them, and it would flot be
fair to us, and would necessarily redound
against us if, having the helm, sud being
able Wo see further than they, we do not
steer the ship in such. a manner that the
whole crew will benefit by the voyage.
We are flot alone in tbis world because
we happe'n to hold power. The Czar is
nat alone in Russia, thougli he thinks he
is. The emperors of Rame, although they
thought the empire existed for them.
were only individuals when weighed separately. It is our bounden duty to give
what help we can, consistently with the
îights o! the cominunity, ta those classes
who are to-day before us asking only what
is reasonable-asking that which, if granted, will have no evil effeet upon the
country, will nat diminish the production
necessary for the community ai large, but
wil have this effect, that the-labourer who
can go to work at eight o'clock in the
morning and get home at five in the evening, will be able to have for his repast in
«dditýon Wo dry bread that which wîll
nourish his soul also. He will be able to
enlarge his intelligence, and devote some
time ta his home, his wife and chi'Idren,
do a litile gardening, and raise fram bondage into a- sphete much more desirable
and by rising materially rise likewise
morally. There is fia class o! men to-day,

or the mechanic or working man who,

a book. On Sunday he is nat ground down
by overwark, and he can spend the day
îea-ding instead o! sleeping ta recuperate
himself for the drudgery of the coming
week'. That is the class of men we should
strive ta niake. Ail we have ta do in this
instance is ta grant a request which, as 1
said before, is only reasonable. 1 might
here go furthe'r. I might illustrate my
argument by a reference ta the Civil Service. Twenty years ago the staff of civil

SENATE
servants was not haif as numerous as it is
now, while the work to be done was practically the sanie as it is to-day-at least
there were the -saine departments with
similar management.
The turne for work
was fron *a quarter te ten tintil four-six
hours altogether; to-day the civil servante
are employed. from. nine until five-eight
hours. I have paid some attention te the
queston, and I claini thst twenty years ago
there was as much work done i six hours
as there is to-day ini nine, and the civil
servants to-day. man for man, are as intelligent and capable as they were twenty
years ago. The service is well aatisfied
wi'th their salaries,
the governiment
treats Jthem fairly well, getnerally; but
here is what I fini, especially in winter:
The civil servant leaves bis office at
five, when it is dark. He has no turne to
attend to anytbing at home, and often lie
cannot afford to hire outside help for the
purpose. The reasonable attention which
hie should give to his home duties is limited; he must attend fromn day te day to
monotonous work, confined in impure at.
mosphere until hie gets tiýed and dyspeptie.
The civil servant requires exercise and open
air. This lie cannot get. What is the consequence? He goes back i the morning te
his work, listless, sluggish, and unable to
do bis work cheerfuilly.
The resuit ;s
that after nine heurs' work, the suin
total of what is acconplished, is not as
much as was done some twenty years
ago in six hours. I amn making no plea
for the Civil Service; it cornes up incidentally. Some hon. gentlemen dlaim te have2
worked 16 hours a day ail their lives. I
pity those men. We are not born to work
16 hours a day, and the man who, except
for charity, works over 12 hours a day,
and simply to amass wealth, becomes a
moral wreck before hie gets very old You
find that is invariably the case. Show me
a man who, for the sole purpose of gaining
iucre, unnecessarily overworks himself, snd
Yeu will find a man with a -dried hear, and
soul. It would be a mistake if the Senat-3
should reject the Bill which is now hefore us.
The Senate divided on the motion for the
second reading of the Bill, which -was

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL, moved that the

Hon. Mr. McMULLEN, moved in amendment that the naines of Hon. Messrs. fléique, Sir Geo. Ross and himself be added
to the committee.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-There is a
parliamentary rule, that when a special
conmittee is appointed to consider a Bil],
the opponents of the measure are net eligible for appointinent. If hon, gentlemen
who are opposed to the principle of the
Bill.are appointed to the committee it will
be a farce.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-I think it would
be better te let the motion stand until tonorrow.
Hon. Mr. McMULLEN-If ahi who are
opposed te the Bill are exchuded, there is_
no use in appointing a committee.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-I have stat.
ed what the parliamentary practice is.
The SPEAKER-I do net think we have
any such rule in this House. I know it is
the procedure in the House of Cominons
in England, but the practice is based on a
rule of that Rouse.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-I point out
to your Honour that that îs the rule laid
down in May.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARDi UARTWRIGHT
-I think I may be pardoned for pointing
out to my hion. friend that it has been a
frequent and a reasonable practice for us
that we should agree in casps where there
is a difference of opinion and where it is
desirable to get evidence, that w'.e would
not consider ourselves -bound te approve
of the principle of a Bill at the second
reading-we would ahlow it te go to the
second reading for the express purpose of
referring it to a committee to get evidence, which I think is the object of this
particular motion.

APRIL 27, 1911
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I quite
agree with the opinion expressed by my
hon. friend. It is laid down very clearly
in Bourinot that thase opposed to the principle of a Bill are nlot eligible to appointment -when a committee ie appointed
to consider it. I remember distinctly quoting it myself a year or two ago when a
committee was appointed to conter with
the Gommons in reference to a railway Bill.
I objected ta the appointment at that time
of the han. member from Portage-la-Prairie on the very ground that the hon, gentleman has called attention ta; but if that
objection is to be evoked on this occasion
there certainly is no use of appointing a:
committee and putting them to the trouble
cf meeting and considering a question
which the committee have already decided
by their vote is correct. When the intimation was given by the hon. senator from
York (Mr. Campbell) that he intended to
rend the Bill to a special committee,
I expressed the opinion that euch being
the case I did not intend te insist
upon a vote upon the second reading and would not have doue so. Being opposed te the principle of the Bill I
could not consistently vote for its second
reading, and, under the circumatances, it
was a matter o~f ind.ifference to me whether I sat on that cammittee or not. I
understood the right hon, leader of the
House a little while ago, te say that it
was desirable ta obtain information on
this question from any source from which.
it mlght be obtained, and it was also proposed too have a committee nlot composed
altogether of members holding one sided
Under the circumstances, it

seems to me it would be much better for

more consistent with the views expressed
by the leader of the House.

Consequently the committee who

will have charge of this Bill, as I understand, are nlot charged with amending iV.
Their function will be te take evidence and
report that evidence back ta the House. At
any rate, we have to take away from the
question altogether the suggestion that a
member who has voted against the principle of the Bill cazïnot ait on the committee,
because in this case the principle of the
Bill bas not really been voted against.
Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-I oppose the
reference Vo the committee. It je idle ta
talk about tuking evidence, wiVh 750 pages
ai evidence already before us.
Hon. 'Mr. YOUNG-Who bas read it?
Hon. Sir RICHARD. SCOTT-It is the
fault af the members if they have not read
it. I read extracts from iA the other day,
and I think there were some substantial
converte made by the evidence. We are,
moreover, departing irom. Our regular pre-tice. Public Bills do not go to sPeciffl
committees, as a rule. Possibly one per

Richard Cartbwright.
Rt. Hon. Sir RIOHARD CARTWRIG HTBefore we proceed ta the conisideration of
clause 123, I would say to my hon. frienda
that there were sorne few alterations sugested with respect to making provision for
hospital elevators. As far as I know, they
are not o! a contentious character. If any
o! them are contentious, I shial give notice
that *I 'will have them put ini on the third
reading. If, however, the lHou6e agrees ta
put them in now, 1 will read thern as they
corne, and then proceed to the consideration
o! clause 123. The firet that I would calA
attention to is the interpretation clauses.
I move to add these words ' Hospital elevator includes every elevator or warehouse,
situated et a terminal point, which is used
for the cleaning or other special treatrnent
of rejected or daznaged grain, and which is
equipped *with apeciai machinery for that
purpose.'
The arnendment was agreed te.
If hon. gentlemen will now turn to
section 20, I move to add to section 20 the
following, 'May also, with the consent of
the'Governor in Council, make such further
rules and regulations as the Board deemn

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-What la the object o! that? I observe the language o! the

2. Âny such elevator shal -be required to

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT.

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Can my hon.
friend from Killarney (Hon. Mr. Young)
say why such grain should not receive the
grade in which the inspector places it?
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-Heretofore this grain
had not been allowed to go into anything
higher than No. 3. I think it should go
into No. 1, should the inspector think it
is good enough for that grade.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-If an arbitrary
inferiorîty, s0 to speak, be placed upon it,
would flot that very greatly handicap
hospit-al elevators? Would not owners of
grain refuse to put their grain in if they
knew that it coid not corne out at a
higher grade than it was sent in?
Hon. Mr. YOUNG-There are minor afflicetions andi serious afflictions. Dirt is no
affliction. There is a class of grain that
%vouldgo to the elevators to which this amnendrnent would properly apply, and it is
the class rejectei-dornestic grain, for instance, or grain with excessive dirt. But
tlie subsection I read makes a distinction
of grain that has been scoured, treated
for smut, or sorne other affliction, and had
to undergo a chemnical treatment. That
grain has net been allowed into any higher
class than No. 3. Unfortunately, our Act
does net provide for the grain that is sent

separation removed the cause for which
the inspector sent it there with the
etamp on as rejected and by profler
authority. That class of wheat when separatel should ha graded according to its
merit. The question whether or flot the
grain treated by scouring, or chemicals,
should go into the higher grades is s matter to be determined. I was trying ta explain the distinction between the two
classes of grain that go to the hospital elevator under the grading as rejected.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I have been following this grain legialation and trying to
nnravel the problem to unierstand it, and
it seema to be a difflcult one to digest; but
I would think the inspector who grades
this grain, if hie were -a competent inspector,
alter it has gone through the hospital, and
was scoured or treated with chemicals,
should be in a position to form the beat
judgment as to whether it should be graed 1, 2 or 3. Il that is not the case, hie
is not the proper officer to originally grade
the grain. Surely the farmers in the Northwest will be sale to leave the determination of grades in the hands of the inspector, whether the wheat goes through
the hospital or nat. Whether the grain
carries a grade of No. 1, 2 or 3 at the
h.ands of the inspector, must be absolutely
a commercial proposition based on his
gra-ling. If it is -not, I do not know where
we will land.

both considered diseased wheat. It is injured wheat, aniJ though they can remove
the dark colour, they are not able ta remove the peculiar odour which belongs ta
it, and, furtherxnore, it is capable of sucb
improvement by this proceas of scauring
with chemicals, as to make it appear, ta
arl intenta and purposes, equal ta No. 1 or
No. 1 hard; but it has not impraved the
real character af the grain.
Han. Mr. THOMP6ON-Let me ask a
question. Would not that disability which
existed, that diseased 'wheat, be known to
the inspector, and would hie not refuse ta
grade it Na. 1 if it did not belong ta No. I?
Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS--Quite true. Laal
year we had a discussion in this Hanse for
nearly twa days on this point, and it was
then resolved that thia wheat shauld be aold
under -a peculiar naine ta prevent anythîng
like deceptian in the market. The millers
in Ontario found fanit with it because, an
looking at ià as mixed. with the higher
grade, it could flot 'be detected, but it is
detected when they came ta make it into
flour and when they bake it into bread.
The value is not in it, and they refuse ta
put it into that clase ta which the hon. gentleman has allnded. That is the neal reason.

lived above suspicion, and it is only fair
that we should give credit to those who
have been obeying the law. Another erroneous impression je that every sin that
can be charged againet the grain trade je
laid at the door of Fort William and
Port Arthur. There lias been supervision
at Fort William and Port Arthur, but no
supervision whatever over any link in the
chain of transportation, between those
points and the seaboard, either on the
Canadian or on the United States side.
Tt ie equally unfair to charge every grievance against those elevRtors at Fort Williamn and Port Arthur when the door lias
been wvide open for accidents, if nothing
less serioue, in aIl those various elevators
between the head of the ishes and the
seaboari. It also developed in the cvidence that the United States goverument
do nôt bond grain by grade. They bond
by quantity, and one can- readily see that
there ie an opportunity there which miglit
accotait for some cf the *mixing we hear
of, and for the grades not being kept s0
distinct and separate as they are on the
Canadian side. We muet remember that
when our grain goes through United
States channels, over which we have
no -supervision, we have to take whatever mixture is made. We have very little
to say about it. I agree with the Hon. Mr.
Talbot, that had the railways continued to
operate and manage their terminal elevators at Fort William and Port Arthur, we
neyer would have heard a -word of this trouble. The C. P. R. is the oniy one that is
now in that position, and if the other railways had not leased their terminais at Fort
William and Port Arthur there would have
been none of this agitation. Our friends
wvho are advocating the retention of these
clauses have made a minority report, which
will be found at page 824 of the minles.

whose interests 'were oppoeed te the public

They aise rely on the evidence given by

Mr. Watts, Mr. Flovel and others, representing the milling trade. Now, if we turn
te Mr. Watt's evidence we find that lie
urged upon the committee the retention of
these clauses. He is the centrai buyer of
the Millers' Association of Ontario. But
alter urging us te retaîn those clauses, when
has attention ie drawn te the fact that it is
possible the Goderichi elevater, owned by -a
section cf the miliers of Ontario, would
come under the Act, Mr. Watts suddenly
became aiarmed. When asked if this -elevator would not Ibe affeoted, he -says:
'«I do flot know. 1 neyer thought of it.
I will look at the clauses. I may have been
helping to pincli som'ebody.'
He seemed te admit there wae a pinch.
He is further examined:

Mr. Watt's eviclence, after ail, was that
it was a pinching clause if it caught the
elevatore owned and operated by the Ontario millers. It would look ta me as if
Mr. Watt's evidence were nlot very strong.
Another feature je that although Mr. Watt
was the central buyer for the Millers' Association of Ontario, I at leaat, did net
hear one single case of hie own experience
ini dealing with grain caming out of the
terminal elevators that was unsatisfactory,
and it was remarkable that a mani who,
buying and receiving grain and the agents
of these millers for years shouli1 corne
here and take up the time of the committee without citiug case after cas;e na
grain caming out of these terminal elevators that was nat up to the quality he
was entitled to receive by law. That looks
to me as if bis evidence could niot be reliedl
upon to any considerable extent. Mr. Fiavelle, in his evidence, makes the statement, at page 65 of the report, that the
consumers did not ask for this clause.
He said that the clauses, were certainly
not suggested by the consumers, and 1
do not think the producers suggested
them. But he did say that the gavernment, with the full knowledge of
the situation, placed them in the Bill
and therefore he urged them. The evidence of the millers is not very strong. The
atrongest evidence we could have that the
grain was not coming out of the terminal
elevators satisfactorily, ani that xnixing
was practised would be the citing of case
after case to the committee in which the
terminal elevators were nlot using their
customers f airly and the inspection departAgainat
ment was not doing its duty.

no single instance in this whole immenâe
quantity of grain had they any cause for
complaint, or had they asked for a survey,
or in any way were they dissatisfied with
the resuit of their shipments from the
various terminal elevators. No higher test
can be put te the grain coming out of the
terminal elevatiors than the tests which
these *big milling concerns give, converting it into flour and thus finding out exactly -what it will do. It je no gueeswork:
with them. I do not think a.ny higher
compliment could be paid to our system
than the fact that a large concern like
that shoull corne forward and give much
emphatic evidence, not from hearsay but
from their o'wn milling resnîts. Out of
the immense quantity of grain they have
handled they have not found grounds for
the slightest complaint sa far as the terminal elevators were concerned. Mr. Horn
alea gives very clear evidence. Up to very
recently, Mr. Horn was chief grain inspector of Canada, and he stands second
to none as a grain inspecter, we are proud
to say in the world. So far as the Eurepean end is concerned, he has been
complimented by the varlous boards of
trade, and not only Mr. Horn, but our inspection department as a whole, have been
paid very high complimente by the buying
people of Europe who have stated that it
is one of the most perfect they have had te
deal wîth. A few years ago, a meeting of
grain purchasers was held in England ta
diseuss the many grievances thlat they
have to deal with. *They received grain
from every part of the world and
it w-as remarked that the only country
not complained of was Canada, and the
compliment that was paii to the Canadian Department of Trade and Commerce
wvas very high and very gratifying. The only
wish of one of the speakers was that other
countries would adopt the Canadian systera and be as accurate and satisfactory in
the delivery of the grain as the Canadian
trade, and that they would be satisfied if
such were the case. That is a very high
compliment ta our system and I have no
doubt it deserved it or it would not have
received it. Besides this, and against the
course of the minority of the committee,

Hon. Mr. TALBOT-People who examine

certainly were flot No. 1 northerii. 1 wilI
relate a little incident I liad in miv own
experience. not on the ether sidc of tle Atlantic, but hiere. I was at a Certain~ uni]
soute years ago, and thev were unloading
some Manitoba wheat. 1. %valking around
it. took a look at the wheat, and I said to
the man unloading il. 'Do you grow iliat
wheat around here? ' nie said. ' No, that is

was No. 3. 1 went to the owner of tblf- ii]l
and I said to him, ' You are unloading soine
very fine wheat there. and lie said, 'Yes,
it is No. 1,' and 1 said, «Did you buy it for
No. W?and be asked, Whv?' I said. Bclion. Mr. YOUNÇG.

c,.use 1 know that wheat, and if youi boughit
ut for No. 1' you are a big chump.'
He
said, ' No, 1 did flot buy it for No. 1, but
for No. 3V A gentleman stated to us in ïevidence the other day that they had received
sorte forty samples front the other side of
the .Atlantic, and that these samples contained xnuch dirt, far above what would be
allowed under our statutes or sluould hiave
been allowed by the inspector. It is true
that when 1 asked the question if that wheat
liad gonie by the Cana.iaun route, the gentlnan could mlt assure me that it had; it
nmight have, but hie did flot know. Furthermore, in the taking o! samples on the oth-er
side of the Atlantic, for instance ut Liverpool, if a dispute arises over a cargo, as to
the quality o! grain, they have attached to
their exchiange an officiai sampler, and if a
sampie is to bie talc-en ut ail, it is to be:
taken by the officia] sampler, and il is only
upon a sample o! that kind that any action
is taken. As the hon, gentleman fromn Toronto pointed out the oth-er day, samples
cani be taken in a cargo that 'will flot represent the average quality of the cargo by any
manner o! ineans. Any of you who have
watched a heap o! grain sliding down know
that a great deal of dirt would accumulate
on the side of the wheat as it comes down,
and il you take a sample there it wouid be
worse than the average of the grain. The
law provides that certain grades shall be
dlean, but that means commnercially dlean.
We cannot handpick it. 'There wiil be
nmore or le8s
dirt
be-cause
of the
fact that the machines are not so perfect
as to dlean out everything that is foreigu
in the grain. After ail, there is a serious
phase in connection with thîs discussion
that 1 should like to call attention to. If
suc-h a discussion as this bas any effect ut
ail it will be that we are defaming the
cliaracter of the grain that we are sending to the other side of the Atlantic, and
that is a serions matter. If any attention
is paid to tiîis discussion, it cannot be
denied that we are saying to the men on
thie other side of the At]antic, ' Notwithstanding the confidence and the satisfaction you have had in our grain in the past,
we have beengo]dbricking you and you
have not been gettîng what you hought
and paid for, and what you werc entitled

MAY 2, 1911
to under our laws.' That is the serious
phase of this question which will revert
back to those who are producers. I do
nlot think this Senate would take the responsibility on their shoulders of saying
that we in«the Dominion of Canada, who
have been delivering grain so satisfactorily
fur such a iength of finie, have been giv.
ing to the public on the other side of the
Atlantic anything lcas than thcy were entit]ed to, and that our inspection system
has -not been closely watched and guard.
ed. I know that our grain stands high
and I think the proper course for us is
te owf up fa the fact that with the preponderance of evidence before ns we are
iustified in saving thaf wve have the finest
grain inspection and shipping systemn in
the world, and with the additional precautions taken, I do nlot think there would
be any more reason . in fact there wou]d be
less reason for any want of confidence in
the future than there bas been in tht'ý
past. 1 think we shauld bie very careful
before we say that thec grain we have been
shipping out has been inferior ini sny way
tW what the purchaser was cntitled te. It
lias been suggested also that this agitation
will continue until sncb time as these suppased grievances, are ail donc a'way with.
1 trust the agitation in this direction will
cease, because it is too dangeraus. In the
interests of Canada, let us drap this matter, and accept the evidence which I amn
sure the Minister of Traie and Commerce
himself, should he think if 'worth while fa

Hon. Mr. WATSON-The lion. gentleman got no evidence from any person that
the elevators has a bushel more than they
bought. The hion. gentleman knows that
they pleaded guilty and paid a fine on an
estimate made of the bins, and that when
the officiai weigh-up w-as made there was
not that shortag-e of grain. They paid the
fine long before the weighn-up, on an estimate of the bins. The hion. gecntleman ought

Hon. Mr. WATSON.

Hon. Mr. WATSON-My hion. frieand may
*be a nîind reader and may be able to
know what .Mr. Cassels would swear to.
Mr. Cassells remained in the committee
for days Iistening to the evidence and hie
coulà have been examined. Unfortunately
hie took ili and could not be called.
There is no evidence to prove that these
gentlemen were guilty of an offence. Mr.
Searle gave bis evidence and hie could have
been recalled and cross-examined at any
time. He aaid:
We -were charged with making incorrect reports. There was a difference in the report,
of a moderate amount as eompared with
the amocunt halidled, and we pleaded guilty
to that because the reports were flot in acerdane exaotly wi'th tuhe government figures.
We did flot know who was wrong, but we
maintain tliat we did no mixing ofri
in the Port Arthtur elevator ,and we asked
the güvernment to wait untîl the weigh-up
at the end of the year, and when they had
that -weigh.'up it only disclosed a very slighit
discrepancy which was almDst entirely covered by the rejectEd seed grades which was allowed te -be cleaned *by the governmnent and

This is bis statement and the statement
was that there was discrepancy between
the reports. That is bis statement. It was
that there was a discrepancy in the report.
The govcrnment entered suit against the
Thunder Bay elevator on the very Eame
charges made against these people, and
they feil down on the charges. It wag
claimed by these gentlemen that if tlîey
had not pleaded guilty and had gonie to
the trouble of having a weigh-up they
would not have been convicted, and evidently they could not have been according
to this gentleman's statement, because the
cleani Up showed there was not that discrepancy in the grades as they received
them. 0f course no elevator can corne out
exactly right. Mr. Horn made thiat statement and 1 venture to say that no man
who appeared before the committee was as
competent to give evidence as Mr. Horn
on the grain business. No man in Canada

ing to, any gentleman to hear that, as far
as the handling of our grain is concerned,
it was about as perfect as it could be made.
I concur iii what has been stated by the
lion. gentleman fromn Lacombe and the hion.
gentleman fromn Lindsay, and I have always
maintained that elevators ahould be operated by railways and then ail trouble would
be avoided. I think it is unfair of the hon.
gentleman froni Saskatchewan to suggest
that my hion. friend (Mr. Young) shouid
not vote because hie. is interested in country elevators. The hon, gentleman from
Prince Albert, who aides with the hion.
gentleman fromn Saskatchewan, says hie is
one of the men liable to be closed out o!
the business on account of the combine of
terminal elevators. I think no hion. member in the House iz entitled Io more credit
fromn the grain producers fromn the west
than the hion, gentleman froin 1üiiiarney
for the work hie has done in connection
with the handling of grain and the elevatoquestion. He bas the practical knowledg,ý
and has given the House the benefit of it,
and his information is always reliable,
which statement cannot be made regarding
information furnished by some hion. mnembers. 1 have no doubt that if the gentlemen who have leased those elevators
violate the law, with these heavy penalties,
where they are hable to lose their license,
that the Grand Trunk Pacifie and the Canadjan Northern railway wili soon cancel
thf, leases unless they conduct themselves
according to law, because the railway coinpanies cannet afford to have their terminais closed. I believe thiere is danger
there of not having a place to take care of
the grain. We have. backing up that view,

sdhould not be aiiowed to invest in a t<erminai elevator. I believe if the railway
companies, who own about two-thirda of
the elevators at Port Arthur and Fort WVilliam, operated those elevators, that you
could have ail the elev'ators you liked buiit
and ownei by the men who operated tne
ieriiinai elevators, and you wouid have

niot in favour oi mixing, but tme question
was asked by the hon. gentleman from.
Lacombe, does the farmer get wnat his
wheat is worth? Some get a littie more
and some a littie less. That must ne£essarily tbe, because there is a great spread
of between two and threè cents a bushel
between No. 1 and No. 2 grade. You have
to get the average of the bin, and the man
who has the wheat which will sample No.
2 Northern and very near No. 1, receives
the No. 2 Northern price. The man who
has wheat just above No. 3, and gets into
No. 2 is paid No. 2 price. One man gets
a cent more, and another a cent less than
the wheat is worth, and that is bound to
prevail in the systemn of handiing grain.
ff we couli have a systemn of buying wbeat,
a sample mnarket, which I have no doubt.
m.e rnay have under this Act, they may be
avoided. and the man who has a first class
&ample of No. 2, will get a premium for
that as No. 2-no doubt about that. He
mill get what it is worth. No evidence
bas been produced to, show a.ny great
mrongdoing in the handling of our grain.
At that wide open investigation, where ai]
the evidence that, could be produced was
submitted, hardly a case wvas cited where
there was Rctual wrong, or the inspection
was faulty. We had the testimony of the
millers of Ontario that for the iast year
there had been practically no complaint.

We had the testimony o! the inspector that
only two cargoes in the last year' had
gone abroad where there was any doubt
about it. The hon, gentleman froin Killarney has explained those two cases. One
was a case from Montreal and the other
from. St. John. No fauit was found with
the inspection at Port Arthur at ail. That
being the case, I think it la for us 10 say
tisaI our inspection is good. We are amnending this Act and imposing heavy penalties to please the public who are asking for it. We are imposing tbe penaltY

int the Grain Bill, which in itseif, entirely

character and calculated in every respect t0

the grain interests. I rememiber at one time
when my hon. friend irom Saskatchewan,
who speaks iii such laudatory terms to-day
of the railways was in the very vanguard
attacking the policy of the railways, with
reference to the crushing methods which
they were pursuing towards the farmer.
Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS-And there ivas very
good ground for it.
Hon. Mr. LOUGH-EED-I quite conceive
that. Legisiation was.granted and tise consequence was that the difficulties which
then existed were very Iargely remedied by
the enlistment of the capital which is now
being attacked, that is to say, Canadiani
capital and United States capital enlisted
in building up country and terminal elevators now fid the ,apitalistie interest coming in confiict with those wvho are interestel
in the growing of grain. The parliamient of
Canada, as well as the legaisiatures of Canada, have incorporated those companies,
and permitted them under the law of the
land, and very properly so, to invest their
money in the building up of terminal elefators, until to-day we find in Port Arthur
and Fort William several million dollars
invested not only by Canadian, but by
Jnited States people in the erection and
aperation of terminal elevators. Is there a
nian in Canada who would for a moment
criticise the laudable character of that investment? I will venture to say that mny
hon. friend from Saskatchewan, some few
.%7ears ago looked farward 10 the day when
these terminal elevators would be established at Fort William and Port Arthur by
capital o! this character. Anl impression
not based on facts, as I understand il,
seerns to have become deeply seated in the
!nindý of the grain z-rowersý of Canada that
abuse.s have grown up, and without a prorier analysis o! those alle2ed abuses. withoui a proper investi.-ation as to what the
foundation of the difficulty or wrong is, il
is assumed that Iliosp capitalistie iîsterests
must be wiped out at one fell blow. The
proposa! is that those men who have invested millions of money and built up an
immense industry at Port Arthur and Fort
William, as well as in the interior o! the
Narthwest, should have visited upon themn

Bill. I would a.sk my lion. friend to consider this, that these companies owning
terminal and country elevators shail not
be permitted any longer to carry on both
branches of their business, that they can
elect to carry on their terminal elevator
business, and cesse their country elevators,
or vice versa, and no provision whatever
is mnade ini the Bill as to how those men
shall be recouped for the enormous loss to
which they will be subjected.
Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS-That is not so.

ing ta go on?

Now, in view of these facts, can it be said
that there was no necessity for this Bill
and that everything was going on honestlyi
and honourably?

Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-The government inspectors could nlot be there for
twenty-four hours in a day. There was the
opportunity of committing frauzl and there
were facilities for doing it. Not only grain
but the mixing of foods of alIl kinds, la
one of the sins of the age. and it is becoming se generai that people believe there is
no harm in it. The running of two varieties of grain int onc speut, to form a
new variety or a highlier or lower quality
is looked upon as legitimate business. The
facilities ýfor doing .such things are so
great thnt human nature is nlot equal te
the strain; the temptation is too strong.
It is just one of those cases where fraud
is sure to be practised. We have paesed
laws for the purpose of protecting other
branches of industry, yet they are violatcd
every day. I need net go over the list cf
Acts that have been passed for the protection of other trades. They amou.nt to nothing; they are not put in force; this parliainent looks to the provincial government

bugged day after day b)v foois that are
not up te the standard. Not only wheaf,
but almost every article of food. I do not
propose to go into details, although 1
have a long list before me. Take for instance miaple syrup. Probably during the
early part of the season it is pure; but two
or three months from now, after the supply has been exhausted, you will find the
pure article is being advertised, a large
amount of which is beng adulterated, and
sO it is with*nearly every other article of
food. A month or two ago 200 carcasses of
diseased meat were seized in Montreal,
and a few weeks ago an equal quantîty of
diseased meat was seized on its wvay ta the
Ottawa market. Large quantities àre palnrred

lion. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-The Postmaster of the United States made a statement recently in which lie said that the,
fraud on the public through the mail.
through advertising stock that did flt
exiat, was $600,000,000 a year. The frauds
in the past few years of the present century
exceed the frauds of the ninreteenth century.
A century ago the world was aghast at the
South Sea Bubble fraud, but it was nothing
compared with fifty frauda committed teday. Therefore it is incumbent uit parliament to proteet those who want te preserve
the food that is produced in its. original
pure state. In reference to the scientific
farming that is now going on in the Northwest, where farmers on a large scale are
most careful to select their seeds, free frein
weeds, and cultivate their land thoroughly,
and reap from 30 'ta 35 bushels per acre of
No. 1 wheat; have they not the absolute
right to have that wheat sent in its best
condition to the market? If an opportunity
is given to tamper with it, it is sure to be
tamipered with. That was. the necessîty for
this Bill. The evidence in the department
is conclusive on t.hat point. It has beeri
goîng on for two or three years.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-If the

form?

Hon. Sir RICHARD SCOTT-It was
stated on both sides that this Bill was not
te apply to the elevators that were on the
lines of railway. It was ta apply only te
the terminal elevators at Fort Williami and
Port Arthur. Grain that is not sold is sent
there by the farmers. It is forwarded to
the elevator iii cars.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-And mixed while

tion and the opportunity to do it, and buman nature of this age is not equal to the
strain, with the opportiinity to either degrade or elevate the particular standard,
whichever may be in their interest. The
evidence that it bas been doue in the past
is absolute. The proposition is this: if it
is found to be the best course to pursue
that the persons who now have interesù;
in those elevators, spart from the Cenadian Pacific railway, speculaWors who are
interested in the elevators should be put
on a level with the general public and with
ai other persons, that they should have
no special interest in the elevator. It is
not fair that those who -are interested in
blending grain should alone have the opportunity of doing it at Port Arthur or
Fort William. Why should not the outsider, who owns other elevators up there
be on the same plane? Is there anything
unreasonable in it? One gentleman argued
against the proposition because it was confiscation. There is no confiscation about it.
Power will be given to expropriate in the
public interest, and in that expropriation
the owners of the elevator will get the full
value that was put into it. In ail cases
of expropriatio.n the person whose property is expropriated bas always haed the
advantage? I have had nearly hall a century's experience in expropriations, and
have acted for the governiment or as counsel for one side or thie other, and I do not
hesitate Io ssthat in ninety-nine cases

party ovni ng the grain should be entitled
to a certificate of inspection wh'en it was
leaving; that is, if a man sent to the elevator 1,000 bushels of No. i northern. he had
a right to receive a certificate for 1,000
bushels of No. 1 northern. It was deni-ed
in the argument that that should be insisted upon. As I read the former Act, il
think it was contemplated that in any case
the certificate should be given. The Act
pass-ed in 1908 readsor
'Any grain inspected. at Fort William
any other western points may bie reinspected
at Fort William or other terminal elevators
in the division without additional charge,
but any grain not inspected. west of Fort

There are 21 memibers representing the

is in regard to striking out this clause. My
recollection is that the report of the coinmittee was embraced in two or three lines.
They recommended that clause 123 be
stricken out. That is the crucial point.
Now, I niaintain that the Senate will on]y
be dealitig fairly with the Bill if they send
it down in the forni in which we received
it, and if the House of Comînons wish to

and the hion. gentleman seems to think
that that counts for nothing. Several other
changes are made in the law. With respeet to the clauses now under consideration, it was testified before the committee,
and I think the samne thing was stated in
the House, that the original Bill as framed
by the government did flot contain these
clauses, so my hon. friend is completely in
error in thinking thiat these clauses con,stitute the essence of the Bill. Then the
hon. gentleman undertook-it is a thing I
bave flot seen done often before-to divide
the special committee up into two classes,
the members of the committee who corne
from the grain growîng provinces and the
members who do not, and in or:ler to make
a case against the report of the majority,
hie said, as regards the members comin!z
front the grain growing provinces, that the
representatives were equally divîded. I think
that a member whio comes from outside

and fair judgment th&n a man who 's o>n

man, also, while dealing with frauds, did
not tell the whole story. It must be remembered that a year or so ago a new
practice was adopted of registering grain,
and the ho.n. gentleman did flot tell -the
House that during last season thete were
no complaints, as far as we know, and no
frauds. The frauds took l5lace under the
previons condition of thinga, and very
probably the action taken by the goveruiment in connection with the frauds whiclh
were supposed to have taken place at
Fort William has had the eff ect of preventing the repetition of frauds. If the
enforcement of the existing law wvill prevent. the iichief whicli these clauses were
intended to prevent, la not that sufficient?
Why should we pass such drastic clauses
if they are not necessary? The hion. gentleman took the ground. which has not
yet been taken by .ny of the gentlemen
who are in favour of the clauses, that instead of the property becoming forfeited,
which it practically woul'd under the operation of clauses 12-3 and 242, the only
result of fraudulent conduet on the part
of the'owners of an elevator would be expropriation.

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The speeches of my two hon. friends just
show what very different impression is
lik-eiy to be made by a Bill of this kind on
the mmnds of hon, gentlemen, even of their
long experience. Now, 1 t.hink, as is very
often the case, the truth will. be found to
lie bet.ween the two extremes. I say to the
hon, gentleman front Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Power) that when the government agreed
to remit this measure to a committee of
this House, it was after very strong representations from nsembers on both sides that
it was desirable that the parties affected,
in view of tise large interests and the coinpiexity of the question, should be heard,
and that the House should be fully informed
on thse question. I amn bound to say that I
think the House isas shown a great deal of
patience, and that the committee which took
this evidence has also shown mucis patience
and industry in endeavouring to arrive at
tise facts as far as they co-uld be arrived at.
The question is one that lias, beyond ail
doubt, dîfficulties on both sides. I niust
say that the evidence which appeared before my departînent goes Vo show that in
certain cases there were very grave. irregularîties comnsitted.

desirable, or was desirable, if it had beau
attended to at first, that the jïusiness o1
storing in these terminal elevators ehou'id
be separated from the business of buying
and selling. Ail parties will admit that it
is a desirable thing to be attained, but ;t
is desirable also, that having in view the
fact that large surns have been invested in
the purchase of country elevators worked
in connection with the terminal elevators,
that they should not be hastily or arbitrariiy confiscated or interfered with, and the
clause that I now propose te introduce will
give the commission power, while not receding from the principle laid down, Lo,

as stated, invested large sums of money.
The commission still retain the power, and
will rida.in the power of closing in certain
cases any elevators they have grounds to
suspect, or of declining to, leuse them.
With that power, in addition to the other
powers, ail parties might be fairly wel1
satîsfied for th-e time being. They may
rest assured that no arbitrary use will be
made of those powers. They will remember that there is an appeal te the Governor

that the gentlemen ivho will be appointed

mnent's desire in this inatter has been twofold. We wish, as far as we possibly can,
to do justice between the parties, and ve
wish very particularly to see that the high
-standard which Canadian wheat has attained shall be maintained and preserved,
and, il possible, improved. ihere is no
doubt 'whatever that the clauses to which
niy hion. friend has alluded are of a pretty
drastie character. Under ordinary circumêtances, we would nlot have proposed them;
but we have found by experience that this
business of handling grain and dealing with
grain is one which requires very close super.
vision and very great power. W~e propose
to entrust that to a commission. I iiyself,
as far as I could, endeavoured to steer a
middle course ini this business, and the government have taken the matter into thieir
very serions consideration. 1 tiink, iiere
is reason and ground for the demand that
claLuses 123 and 242 should be modified, but
1 do not think they should be abolished
iittogether, and 1 propose therefore to subiait for the consideration of my hon. friends
on both aides, amendments to botl those
clauses. 1 will just rend, briefly the amendment which I propose te submit to this
most important clause, 123. 1 'will add&
however, that it will involve likewise some
amendment to clause 242: but that can be
dealt with when we corne to it. I.propose
that ive shall add to the first section the
following:

MAY 3, 1911
ters for periodE of eight or ten years, t.hat
ini former times at any rate, there was a
great deal of improper manipulation of
grain a.nd that the interests of the farmers
throughout. the Northwest were seriously
affected thereby. Also. I think there is
flot much doubt that if we succeeded ini
preventing any improper manipulation, the
standard of the whole grain will be materiafIly improvei. Hon. gentlemen must ren'ember that w-hile it is perfectly true that
governiment
before grain receives the
stamp a man is free to do what he likes
vith his own. after grain bas received
the governmenit stamp he is not free ta
degrade that stamp or mix an inferior
quality of grain with the superiar quality.
That has been put Tery well by my hon.
frîend from Toronto *who. as a practica]
mnan, knows very -well how. considerable
the temptation ic to niix a quantity af inferior grades vith higher grades, and that
18 the thing that we wish to put a stop
ta. Without further preamble, I mave in
amendment ta the motion ta strike out the
clause, that the clause be amendel by
adding the following:

ests at once takes place; the terminal property of these campanies is divorced from
the country properties represented by their
interior elevatora, and until the commission
is set in operation and erercises, its discretion, its whim, its caprice, or whatever it
may be, the property of those men who
spent millions ai dollars is held in suspense. What may be the consequence to
their credit in the meantime? WJhat wil
be their position with the banks which mnay
be carrying their obligations that are incident to their large property interests? If
my right hon. friend had made provision in
the Bill te remove that suspense ta which
I have alluded, I cou]d appreciate the salicitude oi the government Ia proteet the property ai the parties interested; but that is
not the case. Now, the two conditions mentioned in the amendment do flot -exist taday, and will flot exist upon the passage of
the Bill until the commission exercises its
discretion either ta lease elevators, or to
give its approval ta the existing companies
aperating elevators. I appeal ta my right
hon. friend if that is not an unfair position
ta place them in.

Rt. Hou. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN-Before the anrendment is put, I should like to have a clemmr
understanding in regard to this matter. It
is one in which many of the representativ.es
of the people of this country are jnterested,

the Senate stands in regard to it, anid I alzu
desire to know. It -%vas stated in a former

this Senate that the Bill should be rejected,
I certainly wvould not be iii favour of the

the Bill, and they are irretritevablyv opposed
to it and will nlot hear any argument. They
are against the Bill, and no matter 'what
evidence you bring before themn they wvould
have a right to report to the Senate that
the Bill should be rejected. That is plot a
proper position for the House te be placed
mn. If the under6tanding is that thiis committee will have the right to report that the
Bill should be rejected or adopted-I care
flot which-it is nlot right. If the committee is te take evidence, the Bill can be kept
before them for the next three mnonths, and
that will be a way of killing it indirectly.
1 d-o not think that is fair on the part ai
this House towards the working classes of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. McMULLEN-Evidently there is
an omission from the record of an arnendment, mnoved by myself ta this. motion. It
-was that the names of Messrs. Béique, Ross,
and myseif be added to those rnentioned
in the motion. The hon, gentleman from
Ottawa toak some objection te the amnendment, but naw ha.ving withdrawn that
objection I renew my amendment.
Han. Mr. CLORAN-I should like tu
have sorne one explain the full purport and
meaning of the motion, and what the povers of this committee will be. If it is
necessary ta make the meaning célear. I amn
prepared ta add that they report the evidence and not merely the finding- of the
comnmittee.
The amendment was agreel to.
Hon. Mr. ELLIS-I have already txpressed
my view that to send this Bill ta a special
committee will not advance the cause ini
the slightest degree. Ail the evidence
that can possibly be adduced is already before the Senate in the repart ma-de by the
committee of the other Hanse, wvhere experts were employed ta take evidence upan
the subject. Nothing additional can be
done by a*cammittee, and my own observation is ehat a committee very often
rather interferes with the principle af a
Bill than advances t. Further than that,
the House has affirmed the principle af
the Bull, and ought ta be able ta decide
upon the arguments advanced and the evidence supp]ied whether the Bill is desir-

able or niot. Therefore, il would be better
to divide the Hanse upon the matter, and
I shall ask that a vote be taken.
Han. Mr. CLORAN-I amn heartily in
accord witb the views af the hou. gentleman frarn St. Jahn. He is in line with the
public sentiment af the country. I understand the motion before the Hanse naw la
ta refer the Bll ta a special cammittee.
Wauld not an amendment be in arder, that
this Bill be referred te a Committee
of the Whole Hanse at once? If the hon.

amendment, I shahl be happy ta second
it.

SONGHEES

INDIAN

RESERVE

BILL

SECOND READING.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
moved the second reading of Bill (No. 179)
Au Act respecting the Song-hees Indian
Reserve.
Hie said: This is a Bi11 to confirni an
agreement for the sale of this reserve,
which I understand is in the city of Victoria, and cov-ers .a very valuable tract of
property there which the governrnent of
British Columbia desire to acquire. The
full particulars are set out in the schiedule
hereto annexed, signezl by Mr. Oliver as
Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,
and Mr. W. Ross on behaîf of the British
Columbia government. The quantity of
land is not large, but is very valuable,. and
the rnain provisions in the agreernent, as
the House will see, are that the head of
each Indian family is to have $10,000 ap40
PEVISED

parently placed to his credit, and sorne
further portions of lani apparently are to
be set aside for their benefit. I thînk nobody can compluin that our Indian wards
are not being well treated in this particular matter. I believe the band is now very
smaîl. Probably rny hon. friend fromn
British Columbia can state whether that
is correct or not. At any rate, prirna facie,
the interests of the In dians appear te be
fully conserved, and, under those circurnstances, I presurne there will be no objection to the transfer being carried out mm:
between the two governrnents.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Is this fund adrninistered by the Superintendent General
of Indiau Affairs, or how is it administered? I mean will this arnount of $10,.
000 be placed to the credit of the head of
each farnily.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-This is a very peculiar case. I think the
surn total largely exceeds $10,000. That surn
will go to the heal of each farnily, which.
was the condition, I believe, o'n which
they were induced to sign; the balance, I
belleve, will rernain in the bands of the
Superintendent General to be adrninistered
for their benefit. They will also get. as h-e
will see, a certain reserve on which they
will be placed, in lieu of the landi that they
at present occupy. That, I understand,
was within the terrns of the Act. I do n'ot
see in this agreement the surn total mentioned, but that I beIlieve is the undertaking between thern-that each head of a
family shaîl receive $ 10,000, and that they
also get a piece of land sufficient for their
purposes, and that the balance be held by
the Superintendent General.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-That gives the
head o! each family absolute dominion over
the $ 10,000.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-So I understand.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I do not know
whether it is the practice of the Department o! Indian Affairs to admînister a
fund of that character.

-Under ordinary circumstances it cerEDITIOS'

tainly is flot; but this land, I believe, is
a tract in the centre of the cîty ot Victoria, or nearly so, and the inliabitants of
Victoria have been anxious for a very long
space of time-my hion. friend beside me
(Hon. Sir Richard Scott) says for a whole
generation-to get rid of the Indians in
some way or another. The Indians sat
tiglit, and apparently were more than a
match for the white man, and have made
their own ternis. I believe these Indians
are in a pretty advanced stage of civilization and very well able to take care of
themselves. How far they are pure bred
Indians, or how far they are Indians of a
mixed type I do not know. Perhaps the
hion, gentleman froin British Columbia
cati tell us; but in any case we are presented with this alternative, unless they
receive a large suni in cash for their absolute disposal they would not go, and apparently we liad no ineans of rnaking
them. go. On the other liand, it -%as very
mnuch in the interest of the people of Victoria that they should be rernoved. The.
two goveruments have corne to the conclusîon that this is the best that tliey can
do for them.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (British Colurnbia)-I arn sure the goveriment, is very
well pleased to have this matter settled
witliout any expense to the Dominion, If
lias been a long-standing -ore to some
people in British Columbia, although not
to me. There are hundreds of acres of land
unoccupied in tlie city of Victoria, across
the harbour from the heart of the city.
Perhaps it is a good thing to have these
Indians removed, but the price paid is excessive-$400,000 to forty Indians, and I believe the control of that rnoney is to be
given to the Indians. The mnoney is to be
placed in the Bank of Commerce until tliey
are removed, but alter their removal it is
to be theirs to, do -witli it as they like. The
worst is that they will be removed to some
land only three miles from Victoria, and in
the very best part of Esquimait liarbour,
wvhich is a naval base. In the interest of
xnorality it is the very wvorst thing- that
could be done. We know what sailors are
and what Indian wvomen are, and'wlien they
are placed in juxtaposition, we know wffiat
is likely to take place will not lie in the

iiittreSt oi muirality-. I told Premier '-\e
P3ride the saine thing, and lie said they
would flot be long there, that their location
there was only tem.porary and that they
would probably be removed in a few years.
They could have got plenty of land more
suitable for the Indians at less than hall
the price that lias been paid for this reserve. They are flot only paying $400,06ù
to the Indians, but they have bought 2M0
acres of land fraim the Hudson Bay Comnpany, in the most beautiful part of Britiali
Columbia, for which they have paid about
$200,000 more, making the cost of this reserve about $600,000. Aithougli I support
the government of British Columbia, I
cannot approve of the manner in which
tliey are administering the public funds in
this case. If the funds were their own, they
would not do wliat tliey have done in this
instance.
The motion wvas agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second turne.

has been leased ta the commission for operaflan, or which las been leased ta any person,
firm or company for operatian with the appraval. oi the commission.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-Just ai, that
point, when my hon. friend moved this
amendmnent yesterlay, I pointed out the
tact that subsection 1 af this section deait
with twa classes ai cases, and did not
touch a third class, whieh probably received more attention et the hands af the
committee than the two classes referred
to. The following classes are dealt with
in this subsection: one class ' Which lias
been leasel ta the commission for operation.' That wauld permit, of course, af the
owners ai the terminal elevators leasing
their property ta the commission. Then
there i9 another clacs, «Or which bas been
leased ta any persan, firi or campany, for
operation with the approval ai thre commission.» That would deal with another
class ai terminal elevators where the persons owning the terminal elevator had
leased ta other persans their terminal elevator with the appraval ai the cammission.
1 propose maving an amendment ta this
subsection, dealing with thre class ai elevator which bas 'not been l2ýasPd ta the
commission, or. which bas nat been leased
ta a company with the approval ai the
commission, but which may be manageà
and aperated by the owners thereof, subject ta being operated by persans approved
ai by the commission. The amendinent
would rend as follaws:
'Add to the

«Or which is

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-May I suggest
that the word «board ' should be used instead of 'commission.' The word commission should flot be used in the sectiuns.

-That is quite riglit.

READING.

Hon. 'Mr. DO'MVILLE nioved the second
reading- of Bill (X 2) An Act ta amend the
MVater Carniage of Goodý_ Act as regards the
delivery of wood. He said:- This is to
anîend a section of tise existing law -%vhich
is very liard on the shippers of lumber
througiout tise Dominion. 1 have here a
petition which I wishi to read. It is as follows:
To His Exceilency the Governor Generai and
te the H1onourable the Membere of the
Sonate aud tise Members of the Hous
of Commons of Canada.
The pottion of the undersigned humbly
sheweth:
1. That by Act assented te on tise fourth
day of May 1910 being 9 and 10 Edward VII,
Chiapter 61, it wae enacted by section 10 thereof, as follows:
'10. Ia case of wood goods, notwithstanding
anything in thse Charter Party, Bill of
Lading or other shippisîg documents, the
owner, charterer, master, or agent of tise ship,
or thse ship itself, shail oniy be bound to
deliver to the consignee tise pieces received
from the sisipper, and shahl not bie held
responsible for deficiency in measuremnent;
and any words inserted in any Charter Party,
Bill of Lading or other shipping document
for thse puruiose of mnaking tise owner,
charterer, master, or agent of thse ship or ship
itself, hiable for deficiency in measurement
in sucli case shaîl be illegal, nuil and void
of no affect.'
2. That tItis section lias created great difficulties to your petitioners and to alI others
tisis counIsîmber business
engaged in tise as purchasers ofinhumber in
try inasmudli
Great Britain and Ireland have refused to
contract for or purchase lumber slîipped from
Canada except on the terms of tise shipper
gunranteeing that the purchaser wili receive
tise nuniber of pieces and measurement invoiced.
3. That it was custonuary, prior to tise coin
ing in for-ce of tisis Act wisicis custom had existed as long as tise trade, to insert in nl]
Bille of Lading of wood goode a clause known
as tise conclusive evidence clause wisereby it
was stipnlated that thse Bili of Lading should

bie conclusive evidence as against thLe ship as
to the quantity receivred and the slip tlsereby undertook to become and becaine responcible for delivering the quantity of lumber
loaded on board of it as shows by the Bill of
Lading..
4. That snoh clause was fair to ail parties
as the ship had the opportunity of checkin,
the lumber whiie being loaded by a sworn
surveyor at a very smali cost aud as eachi
piece is marked with the size, and accurate
survey could ho readily obtained and the ship
thereafter had the custody and control. thereof, so that it alone could accounit for auy loss
or shortage.
S. That by section 10 of the said Act thse
conclusive evidence clause is rendered illegai
and the ship ie held nlot to be responsibie for
any deficiency in moasurement or pieces
specified in the Bill of Lading.
6. That your petitioners are under great
disadvantage in competition with tise rest
of the worid dealing with thse Britidsh, Irishi
South American, Austral ian and Africau
markets, especially with shippers from the
niortis of Europe, thse principali competitors of
Canada where no sucli legisiation obtains, and
thse said section of said Act opens a door to
fraud and causes great loas to your petitioners, and to thse lumber trade generaily of
Canada and is also in addition to thse financial
loss thse cause of great inconvenience and difficulty to ail Canadian ehippers of lumber.
7. That shortage in delivery when the samne
occure is due to matters happening after deiivery to the ship and while the goods are in
transit and it is unfair to the shippers to
throw upon them the burdon of accounting for
any loss thereby occaeioned, such circumstances being pureiy within the knowiedge of
the ship.
8. That the shipper has no opportunity of
checking the quantity deiivered by the ship
and therefore has te depend entirely upon the
purchasers or consignees figures excepting in
the iimited number of cases where thse cargoes are discharged in publie docks in Great
Britain, and it is unjust to transfer the
responsibiiity for ishortage ini number of
pieces and quantity deiivered from the carrier
wlîo actually makes the deiivery to the shipper who hias nothing to do therewith.
9. That by the elimination of thse respünsibility of the ship for the deiivery of the
quantity specified in the Bill of Lading, the
Bill of Lading is rendered of doubtful value
and practically ceases to ho a negotiabie docunment to the great ioss and damage and inconiveiience of tise Canadian shîppers: and
the timber trade generaily in Eigland wvio
have considered this question have agreed tu
refuse such Bill of Lading, this principle beiîsg

Bristol Channel Tumber Importers Association and thse Timber Trade Federation of tise
UJnited Kingoin heid at Liv erpool ontsHie 22îs<i

10. That thse legisiation affects disadvnntageonsiv the most important Canadian industry
and also causes friction with the trade
generally in Great Britain apd Ireland and
eisei-her-e and confers no benefit on any substantial Canadian interest.
il. That with great trouble and expense a

GRAIN BILL.
THIRD READING.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Hon. gentlemen will remember that in
Bill (Q). the Grain Bill that was read a
third time on Friday laut, t-here were certain clauses with which we could flot deal,
being money clauses affecting the salaries
of the commission, and one or two others
of the same sort. Those apparently shouli
not be in the Bill when we send it down
to the Gommons, or, at least, some words
should be attached to show that we do not
assume the power of dea]ing with money
clauses. The procedure, I believe, in the
House of Lords, is sonîething as follows:
they attach to the Bill a clause similar to
one I have here prepared, in which they
disclaîmi any intention of *iealing with
money clauses. As w'e do flot desire to
-have any collision on so fine a question
wvith the Lower House, I move. with the
*permission of the House, that the proceedings on the 5th instant, with regard to BflJ

SECOND READING.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
moved the second reading of Bill (No. 157)
An Act respecting the Inspection and Sale
of Seeds.
He said: I may observe that this Bill
has been reprinted for convenience. It is
thought more expedient to reprint the
whole Act and introluce the new clauses.
The chief object of the Bill is to grade and
fix the standards of various seeds whicli
are chiefiy in use, particularly grass and
choyer seeds. The Bill, of course, is somewhat minute in detail. The particudIar
points in if are that the fariner is exempted from labelling seed that is grown an1
sold by himiself. Also, that ini addition ta
the weeds named in clauses 5 and 6 iii
the old Act, ftue Governor in Counicil is
empowered to name others so as to deal
with cases if noxious weeds appear unexpectedhy ini the country. The ohject of
clauses 7 and 8 is to provide for uniform
grading and to define a certain standard or
quality for grass and choyer seeds and
other seeds of a sirnihar character. Provision is made for the testing of seeds for
farmers or merchants free at the Oftawa
haboratory. Clause 10 A is new. If Was
infroduced by fhe committee on agriculture

PROMOTION 0F SENATE OFFICIALS.
MOTION.
The doors being again opeued:
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON, moved the adop.
tion of the second report of. the Standing
Comniittee of thse Internai Economy and
Contingent Accounts of thse Senate. He
seid: The report simply rafars to the promotion of two members of the Senate staff.
The firat recommendation is that tise assistant postmestar of the Senete, Mr. T. B.
Waston, ha piaed under thse third division
of subdivision A cf thse civil service clas,
sification and that his title be assistant
postmastar. The salary attachad te the
position now is $800. While tise salary
attached te the position corrasponding with
this heid by an officiai in the House cf
Commons under the civil service classification is as recommended by the report, in
the House of Commons post office tisane are
three officiais. The postmnaster receives a
salary up te $2,800; the assistant postmaster
neceivas $800 te $1,600, and the second asistant a saiary from $900 te $1,200. W~e
have in Mr. Waston an officiai in the same
position as thse assistant postmasten, and
oun recommandation places him in the
ciass I have mentioned, that is third division of subdivision A, which would entit],
him te a salarv of $900 te $1,200. Those
two post office officiais of thse Senate would
stand in a position similar to tise assistant
and second assistant postmasters cf the
Com-mons.
The second recommendation
cf the committea is that Mr. J. De St.
Denis Lemoine, sergeant-at-arms, be promoted from second division subdivision A,
te first division, subdivision B of the civil
service classification. This promotion. if
approved of by thse Senate, would give 0sergeent at erms a salary cf $2,100 to
$2,800. In companison with tise salaries
paid for officiais in tise House cf Commons,
these salaries are low. These recommendations are made after due consideration.

SENATE
that there wvas no refiection on the
Speaker, under the Civil Service Act.
Under section 2 of the Civil Service
Act, the deputy head, in addition to, the
officers mentioned in paragraph 2, included the clerks of both houses and the
librarians of parliament. Then (c) includes the heads of departments in addition to the afficer mentioned in paragraph
2 and includes the Speakers of both flouses.
In s0 far as that can apply to the
Senate in its operatian we have founi it
unworkable. We have also had to refer to
the Minister af Justice at times to get
opinions.
We know that when parliament atternpted
ta operate under this Act, both flouses had
some difficulty in carrying out what were
the purposes and desires of either branch;
but my view of it is that the Senate is entirely a different order of institution from
the other branch of parliament. This Act
speaks of what the inside service shall he,
and may be suited ta the *iepartments
of government, having been made purposely
ta fit into the machiniery that belongs to
them under the Act. The Governor in
Council are as heads of departments
deal with ail questions of departmental
character in that way by conference of the
heads of the departments. The Senate is
entirely 'Jifferent. We are flot composed of
he'ads of departments. The Speaker has no
departmnent under his control. I cannot
iinag'ne that there is a department such as
this Act intended to refer to, which could
belang to the Speaker of the Senate to gov.
ern So far as the staff of the Senate are
concerned, they are for the purpose of
carrying out the actual wvork that cornes to
the indiv-*dual senator in respect o! committee work, and we are more familiar
,vith what thev do in the discharge of their
duties and with regard to vhether it iwould
be proper. to increase salaries or to make
promotions than it wauld be possible for
any Speaker to know. Section 24 of this
Act was brought to my attention, and reads
as follows:
24. Promotion, other than from the third to
the second division, shaîl be mnade for mernt
by the Governor in Council upon the recoinmendation of the head of the department,
based on the report in writing of the deputy
head and accompanied by a certificate of

qualification by the commission to be given
with or without examination, as is deterniined by the regulations of the commission.
There is no question in my mind-and 1
think it is merely necessary to make the
statement to have it accepted-that this
Act refera to -departmnents of governiment
such as we have now, and clearly does flot
refer to conditions in this branch of parliament. Section 45 of the Act reads as
follows:
45. Wherever under sections, 5, 8, 10 (paragrap h b of subsection 1>, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26
(subs'etion 2), 32, 33, 36 and 37 <subsection 4),
of this Act or under the Civil Service Act,
any action is authorized. or directed ta be
takien by the Governor in Council an by
order in council, such action, *with respect
to the officers, clerks and employees of the
House of Gommons or the Senate, shall be
takzen by the House of Commons or the,
Senate, as the case may be, by resolutian,
and with respect ta the officers, clerks and
employees of the library of parliament, and
to such other officers, cierks and emiployees
as are under the joint contrai of bath Houses
of Parliament, shahl be taken by bath Houses
of J.arliament by resalýution, or, if such action is required during the recess o! parliament, by the Governor in Council, subject to
ratification by the two Hlouses at the next
ensuing session.
It does flot say that they shahl follow out
the prescribed rules or regulations governing the department in respect a! that; at
least it is open to the view that the cormmittee that had been appointed for that purpose by the Senate, who have these questions in charge since the creation of the
Senate, would be the proper tribunal ta intraduce a resolutian upon the subject matter referred ta, in this question.
The SPEAKER-I take the liberty of asking, haw would the action be taken if it
were from a departmental head? Would it
not be by order ini counicil?
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Is that a question
o! order?
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-The individuals
in a department are certainly under contrai of the head o! the department, doinig
work for that individual head, for which
the head stands responsible as a member o!
the g-overnment. That certainly does not
apply in oui case. The Speaker is not
charged with the administration, or with
niatters concerning the officiaIs o! the Senate
in respect of the discharge o! their duty;

MAY 10, 19164

but in the case of a department there can be
no other possible way in which it can be
brought to the council, except when thiese
heads of the departments meet together for
the purpose of considering matters of this
nature. The heads of the departments would
bring this matter before the Governor in
Council. We are in the position of the
Governor in Coumcil, and flot the heads of
the departments, to desi with questions
brought ta us individually and collectively
by the members of the Senate. Under section 45 by resolution o! the House these
questions are to be determineà. It could
not be so in the case of a department, becaujse the head of the department would
have to deal with it as provided in a section of the Act. But while the decision is
made by the Governor in Council in respect o! departmental government in the
case of the Senate ani House of Comnions,
it is made by a resolution. So long as the
Senate consider it proper to contiuue the
Committee on Internai Economy, and untii they suspend that committee they have
imposed upon them the duties that I have
named. They are mentioned in Bourinot.
While we have that committee they have
that right to corne to the Senate, even under the Civil Service Act, and present
their report asking its commendation
or acceptance if they are disposed to give
it, and I dlaimi further, without any disposition whatever to refleet upon the appointnients made under this Act, that the action
of the committee is defensîble, and I have
been advised that in respect o! the report
made by the committee it will require
amenIments to *carry with it the salary
poposed. So long a-a this committee is
continued as part of its machinery, the
Senate should proteet the committee and
prevent encroachments on its rights, privileges and powers. Whether we report to
the Senate in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Act or flot, I
think it proper to submit that report. I
desire to add an amendment, that the
salary shall be as provided in the Civil Service Act o! 1908, and to date from, April 1.
I understand that if the Senate shouli
adopt the recommendat ion of the committee, the report should be amended to that
extent before a salary could be paid, and

with the consent of the Senate I desire to
amend the report as I have indicated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-I arn a member o! the committee, but had the misfortune of not being present at its last meeting. I should like tô express my opinion
o11 this report, inasmuch as I differ in toto
from the conclusions at which the committee arrived. The lion, gentleman lias prefaced Ibis recommendation by dilating on
the appointment o! that committee, dlaimiing that it hias jurisdiction in the matter,
sud the fact that it lias continued iii existence and that no action has been taken by
the Senate to modify the jurisdiction o! the
committee. This Cliamber lias very clearly expressed its opinion as to functions
whlîih this committee should no longer
exercise when it g-ave its assent to the
Civil Service Act which came to us from
the other Chamber. We are bound by that
legisiation, which hias completely altered
the powers of the Senate in dealing withi
the appointment and promotion o! its employees. As I understand the Civil Service
Act, which we made law, and whichi lbii<'
this Chamber as well as the House o!
Comnnons, we agreed tlîat the clerk of the
Senate should have the powers of a deputy
of a department, and that this Chamber
should .have the powers of the Gfovernor in
Council when acting upon the recommendations of a deputy head and a head of a
department. Now, if that is the view which
the majority of this Chamber hold, I believe that the report of the committcc is
absolutely out of order. My hion. friend
hias read section .24 of the Civil Service
Act. If wve have accepted this law, it
means that hienceforth there slial be no
more promotions in this Chamber unless
recommended by the clerk, wiho acts as
deputy head, and the Speaker, who acts
as head. I have differed with some hbon.
gentlemen as to the manner in which -,
should deal with such reports when they
conie before us from the hands of the
Speaker. Some have held that the House
could refer such a report to a committee of the Chamber; that the Senate acting
under the law as a substitute for the Governor in Concil, must deal wvith it direct-

ly. I have held that we could dispose of
those reports as we please-send thein to
one of our committees for examination and
report, and that while we did so we wvould
still remain in possession of the report and
with full authority to deal with such report as may be made upon it by any of
aur committees. Sa far, we have not been
so fortunate in dealing with this Act that
we should again tread on dangerous ground
and experiment in the way proposed by
the committee. If my view of the matter
is shared by the majority af this Chamnber, I shaîl ask that this report be not
now adopted, because I hold that the cernmittee can make no such recommendation,
but that it can act upan any matter sent
te it by the Senate. It cannot of its own
authority suggest or recornmend that any
appointment or promotion be made until
the Senate has deemed fit to seize that
committee with the question.

. Hon. Mr. LÂNDRY-I do not agree with
the suggestion made by the right hon.
leader of the House. That suggestion is
made to prevent us studying the law. lt
is giving to another party the right to interpret the law for us., But that does not
decide the question. I do not care for the
opinion of the Minister of Justice on the
subject. We passied the law and should
know what we have done without asking
the Minister of Justice to tell us what was
in our niinds when we were doing it. The
law is there and we should abide by it. It
is perfectly elear. If there was any difficulty in understanding the law we might
properly go to the Minister of Justice for
an interpretation, but hae would be in the

would have to study the law. I have made

Hon. Mr. LANDRY-Why? The law is
the saine for the twa Houses. If in the
House af Commons they interpret the raw
so as ta give to the postmnaster the place
which the law assigns hini in the division
of classes, why should we interpret the law
in a different way here? The classification
by the salary only cornes in when we
cannot place the rnan according ta the
law. The hon, gentleman invokes section
24, which provides that promotions ather
than frorn third to second divisions shall
be made for menit, on the recommendation
of the head of the department, based on a
report of the deputy head. That is for promotion, but I s'uppose we are not trying ta
prornote in this case, but merely trying to
rectify an errar.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I beg the hion.
gentlemans pardon, it is a promotion.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-How can the camrnittee invoke the promotion clause in
moving the sergeant-at-arms fram one class
to another? Where will the hon, gentleman
find the basis f'or such promotion? The law
says that officers shall be placed in such
and such classes. A bad classification w-as
miade at the outset, and the camrnittee are
now trying to rectify the errar cormitted
then, by taking an officer from ane class
and putting hîm inton another. That is a
violation of the l-aw. The hon. gentl-eman
has nlot followed the provision of the law
as set forth in section 24. Section 45 says
nothing, except that 'wherever under certain sections any action is authorized or
directed to be taken by the Governor in

Hon. Mr. LANDiIY-Section 45 does not
mean what the hon, gentleman says. It
means that in cases wbere section 24 cornes
in, when we speak of the Gavennor in
Council, it means the House of Commons
or the Senate. It does not say that At

the resolution shaîl have the effeet of an
aider in council, se when this House
adopts the resolution, it is equivalent to
an order in cauncil under the provisions
of section 45. Now, there is another section 'which. my hon. friend did not read,
section 8, which provides that as soan as
practicable aiter the Act cornes into force,
the head of each department shail cause
the organizatian ai his department to be
deterrnined and defined by arder in council, due regard being had ta the statuz of
each afficer or clerk, as the case may be.
The order in council shaîl give the namnes

that a man has been put in the praper
class. But the clause ta which I w'ish ta
cail special attention is the following:
After being sa determined and defined. the

What does that mean? It means that

of that committee, seerns very sensitive
as to the powers of that committee. The
privileges they assert are those which
they enjoyed prior to the passage of this
unfortunate Civil Service Act. I f ulIy
concur in the remark he made that it is
an Act difficuit to understand and difficuit to administer; but in this case there
can be no mistake in the provisions of
the law, and those provisions are precisely what have been pointed out by the
hon. members from Delorimier (Mr. Dan.
durand) and Stadacona (Mr. Landry); that
is if we are to accomplish what we think
the Contingent OCommittee could accomplish,
let the reports corne frorn the Clerk to the
Speaker, and the Speaker will refer thero
to the Senate, and I have no doubt thie
House wiIl concur in the recommendations:
but if the Senate think it advisable to refer a question to the Contingent Accounts
Cornmittee to ascertain their opinion, they
have full power to adopt that course. The
Contingent Accounts Committee have no
right, under the law, to arrogate to themselves the power to make recommendafions for promotion or appointment. The
provisions of the Act seem to me to be so
clear that any child who reads it can understand it; but he must flot forget when
he does read it that we have deprived ourselves of privileges which we enjoyed prioi
to the passage of the Act. If my hon.
friend the leader of the government w ants
to get rid of the question, in order to shunt
it over for the present, his suggestion
would be a very good one; but I arn quite
satisfied if the suggestion is adopted the

the House takes a different view as to the

Hon. Mr. GIBSON-I think the hon.

Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
hon. gentleman used the word. I do not
know vhat, he meant.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I do not think
the Act intended to tie the hands of the
Senate. I think section 45 of the Act to
which 1 referred, instead of saying the
Senate and the House of Gommons shal
be considered the Governor in Council, it
left the right to the Senate and the House
of Commons to exercise these powers under this Act simply by a resolution. If we
care to introduce it by the Speaker and
the Cierk to get it properly before us,
then aIl right. But if it meant the
Senate and the House of Gommons were
to be considered the sanie as the Governor
in Council it shouid have been so stated
in the Act, in the "ame way that makes
the Speaker the heal of a department.
Here they have provided a way in which
the House of Commons ai-d the Senate
can deal withi their officers, namnely by resolution. If we admit the doctrine laid
down by the Auditor Generai we absolutely tie the hands of the Senate. If such

Audi(or General ha-s eneveif found *fault
with us in respect of an action o! this
nature. This ivould not be a question
for the Auditor General. If the Senate,
by resolution, should adopt the aguggestion of the Committee on Internai Economy and Contingent Accounts you wouid
have no trouble from the Auditor General.
He wouid not aak us whether wa kept step

as to the modus operaudi o! our work. The
Sanate determinas certain things and
how we reach that conclusion is not
important. Whether we walk around this
sida o! the des], or tha other side is not
important. I have a differant view, and I
do not think any Act o! parliamant can
tie the Senate up so completely as to preits constitutional
vent it exercising
powers. In niy judgment it is antirely
within our power. Section 45 opens the
door and says to the Senatea that wvhile
,the depaztnents have to go round al
these subsections to reach an end, thre
Senate, by a resolution, does exactly virat

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-We passes a
Civil Service Act, and what was the principle on which it was based if not to stop
the irregular influences which brought about
promotions or nominations, and to devise a
means by which positions ini the service
would be filled by people who had passed
examinations, and were a.ppointed on certificate of capacity and merit, and who
would subsequently be promoted accordifig
the
upon
behavicur,
to their own
judgment passed on their subsequent conduct by the chiefs of departma'ents. This is
the underlying principle of the whoie Civil
Service Act, and the Governor in council,
vested with ail the authority he has as an
executive of parliament, could flot of his
own vol-tion increase the salary of an empioyee of any depart-ment 'without the recommendation of the deputy 'head and the
support and endorsation of the minister
himself, and of the Civil Service Commission as weil. This is the iaw to which we
are bound as a Senate, rightiy or wronglyI wiii flot say wrongiy, because parliament
cannot do wrong. We have passed the law;
it is the law of the country, and the -whole
staff of the Senate stands as to its promotion in the saine position as ail the staffs
and the officiais of the different departments. It is upon the report of the deputy
head to the head of our departinent that
we must act 'when it is recommended and
reported by His Honour the Speaker. 1 do
not see anything extravagant in that statement. It is the law as we have adopted ft.
I wiii not say that I would vote to rescind
that law. I have seen in this very chamber
increases of ealary which were flot just¶Bied
and yet which were voted. I have seen
actions taker&by committees of this House
that were not jus tifled, if they were exainined ini the iight of tire proper administration o! this Act. It was true, 1 was in the
minority. Perhaps I wvas wrong in the view
I held at the time; but we had our eyes
open when we passed that law, and we
decided that what -%vas good for thre departments was good for the Senate, and I believe when there is a case to be especially
examinied, wvhen tlic turne cornes for action
on the part of the deputy head, ha wlll do

a petition presented in 1904, signed by hundreds of workingmen empioyed. in the Aingus workshops, where there are about 8,000 people employed. This petitien was
presented te the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company. Many of the employees did not
]ike te sign, and the hon, gentleman can
nnderstand why. There are always people
who are afraid te appear te be antagonistic
te the companies that employ them.
Nevertheless, the petition was sîgned by
some hundreds and presented te the principal officers of the company. A Mr. AIlard, -who is one ot the principal officers
ef the workingmen, states that the officers
of the company replied that they had ne
objection te consider the demand ef the
empieyees, after the cempietion ef the
workshops, and wlhen the Banik of Montreai wouid have a branch batikl in thiat
vieinitv.

Hon. Mr. DAVID-I ask, permission to
make a change in my ametidment as ýt
appears on the erder. 1 want to strike eut
the word 'stations ' and insert ' mechanical.and car departments,' for this reason;
the w-ord 'stations' would apply te people
who have not asked for this Bill, to people
in the offices, and as it is designed to appiy oniy to artisans, I ask, to make this
amendinent. I %-as epposed te the Bill as
it stoed, becanse it w-ould have entailed
censiderabie hardship on the raiiway coinpallies; but, hiaving heard the representatives of the railway companies, I came te
the conclusion that thiz chiange wonid'remeve the objection. Being cenvinced that
it wvas right and preper te meet the deman3s ef the we-rkinrnneni, I tried te find a
means ef removing the principal objections
te the Bill. The principal objection wvas
stated by the hion, gentleman frern Halifax
in verv clear terris. It w-as that the Bill
had net beenl asked for. I think that assertion -was net weli feunded. It bas been

have evidence ef that tact which I desire
te Itv betore the Heuse. First, there was
flen. Mr. CLORAN.

Hon. Mr. DAVID-It is none the less
true. That is sufficient te show that the
railway empioyees made the demand, and
new the workshops having been finished
and nothing having been done te meet
their demands, they appiy te parliament
for legisiation. For the last three or four
years a Bill te meet this demand bas been
snbmitted te the House et Commons. For
reasons which I do net uinderstand, it w-as
net passed until this session; but new it

who met at Winnipeg snd Fort William
passed resolutions in favour of bi-monthly
payments of wages by railway companies,
and there was no opposition. At those conventions, ail the unions of railway employees weére represented. There are letters written by officers of the associations
of workingmen who contend that in general
the workingmen are in favour of this
measure. It is impossible to deny the
fact that the workingmen in general, and
the vast majority of railway, employees,
approve of the measure. The conductorE
and trainmen say they do not favour the
Bill, and it is because there are such peopie who are opposed to the Bill that I haxýe
made the amendment to apply it only f0
workingmen employed in the workshops
uf the railway company, because there can
be .no doubt but that thev are in favour
of suelh leg«islation. Another objection was
that if the Bill were adopted as first
worded it would have causel a great dea]
of trouble, inconvenience and expense to
the railway companies, a.nd would have
been almoat iinworkable. We are told that
if was a'lmost impossible to meet the demand of the workingmen. The Canadian
Pacific railway especially told us that if
,would be almost impossible within two
weeks to go over the whole system of
miles and collect the
ten thousand
pay-lists in order to pay the employees. I
meet fbis objection also by declaring
that the Bill shaîl apply on'ly to
men e.ngagel in the workshops and car
departmnents. Nobody can assert that that
wîll involve any great hardship on the comparties. The Bill evidently will apply only
f0 large cities likze Montreal. Toronto, Winnipeg and two or three others.

for the purpose of ascertaining what objection there can be, and have founid noire.
I spoke f0 people employed by the railway
company and none of them would say that
there w-as any difficulty in putting the Bill

in operation. 1 asked a representative of
a railway company, who was examined in
another place:- ' Vhat would you say if the
Bill were made to apply to certain classes
of employees only? ' He said: ' 1 have
nothing .to say.' That confir.med me in the
view I express now before you. 1 ask hon.
gentlemen in this House to consider if
there is a good reason to oppose this amendment, and if they show me a good reason
I promise to withdraw it; 1 am open to conviction. If, however, hon. membcrs can
make no serious objection to it, I hope they
will ail vote for it.
Hon. Mr. LANDRY-How does the hon.
gentleman answver the objection of the hon.
member from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique), that it interferes with provincial
rights?
Hon. Mr. DAVID-I do niot thiink Liat
question ean be raised ili comiectiLai with
this Bill, because the railways which I have
mentioned in connection with it, are railways subsidized by the federal parliament,
and being under the jurisdiction of the
federal parliament, they are under control of the Railway Commission. It has
been argued that if w.e commence to grant
such demands, there will be no limit to
them, and the employees will become more
and more exacting. I say no; on the contrary, if we give t.he workingmen what is
fair and reasonable the Senate will flot be
tied to th-em in the manner suggested. W~e
will be in a much better position to oppose
unjust aud unreasonable demands if they
niake any. The more we prove to thei
that we want to do what is just and reasonable, the better position will we be in f0
oppose unjust demnands, and I xviii be the
first to refuse requests which I consider to
l)e unjust or unfair. It cannot be denied
that there is a growing feeling in Canada
ag-ainst this House, because to a great extent the public are under the impression
that we are antagonistic to the demands of
the workingmen. I think, we wilI show

saries of life. Is there any demand for
thjs legisiation? When this Bill was reported from committee there was a sound
of trumpets; that tht committee had ohtained ail the information that was necessary to justify this legisiation. The chairman of the Railway Comînittee is here.
Has he explained what took place in coinmittee and what important suggestions were
made by outside railway men as to the
nature of the amendments that ougaht toý
be made? Will the hon. gentleman tell
us
what the amendments are? We have two
suggestions as to what should be incorporataci in the Railway Act, and it
is like the moui.tain in labour bringing
forth a mouse. Is the Senate prapared to
encroach on the rights of the provinces,
where they have a law permitting a garnishea when the amount due the labourer is
ever $25? If yeu caîl upon a railway coinpany to be a collecter of accounts froin
the wages due te labouring men, wil there
be any nioney left to pay the garnishee?
I have discussed this question with some
men who advocated two payments a month.
They said, ' If it is an encroachment upon
the Ont ario Statutes; it interferes with
the rights of the province, and the provinces should amend the law to make it correspond with Dominio.n legislation.' I think
the workingmen are satisfiad with the wagas
they are receiving. As a rule, raflway arnployees receive more pay and are more
comfortab]e in every way than other
labouring men. They receive from $75 to
$100 a rnonth.

Hon. Mr. WILSON-The more we encumber and dîsarrange the working of the
railways the greater the indebtedness and
the more the cost wîhl be incurred in
running the roads. There must be a raduction somewhere. The reduction in the
revenues of a railway to a great axtent is
made in the labour department. If you
increase the expense of running a road you
iecraase the rnoney payable to ernpioyeas.
I may add further, that I do not think

possible. The mnatter of expense is inconsiderable at the mast, inconsiderable in
amount and inconvenience, and even if it
were much greater than it is, I would be
prepared to take the step without any
hesitation. Then there is another side
which concernas the dignity, respect and
honour of this House wlieh is nat ta be
overlaoked. 1 do flot like to speak of
classes. We too olten divide ourselves into
classes, creeds and races; but there is such
a thing in tue air, in the public mind, and
that is, differentiating ta a certain extent
between what Gladstone said were 'the
classes and the masses.' The workingmen
belong to the masses pr'-perly speaking,
and they are a considerable body with
their rights, feelings and instincts, and I
do flot want the labouring people of Canada to feel that we are not as ready to
serve their interests as any body in Canada. I would regret very rnuch if that
feeling shouid go abroad. The Senate is
said to exist by sufferance, which I deny;
that is bas outlived its usefulness, which
I deny, and I should regret if it should
be regarded as a body which would throw
an obstacle in the way of that progressive
legisîstion which is spread over the whole
world, and whichi is tending not anly to
the elevation of the working classes but

There is'no echo of that in this House. The
railway companies keep the pay of the mp-n
earned day by day for 45 days and the company receives the interest on that 12 months
in the year, but where does the workingman
comp- in? It is a shame for a company to
prevent a man receiving what he earns we'ek

proposition. If it is going to be an expense
to the railway company to pay their men
bi-monthly $50,000, let themn expend $200,ON0 a year and pay their men weekly, the
saine as any other concern. Railway employees who want their money at the end
of two weeks should have it, and if it costs
the companies money let them pay for it.
You mnust consider the wants of the families of the nmen. Under the circumistances,

the one which took place at Moncton where

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-What bas given

Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-It is larg-ely due to difficuities wbich bave
arisen in certain cases owing to towns baving sprung- up on lands occupied as Indian reserves.- In almost ail these cases,
as a matter of fact, the Governor in Council bas been consulted, and is consulted
before any step is taken in the way of assuming possession of certain Indian reserves. It bas been the invariable practice for a considerable number of vears,

it neyer was intended or supposed that
Indian reserves shouid be maintained in

can see the extreme inconvenience of such
a conditon. On the other hand, under the
existing law, as I understand it, the Indians cannot be compelied to part with
their lands except by their own free will
and proper motion, and that has lead to
very considerable inconvenience. We had3
before us the other day a Bill dealing withi
the Songhees Indian reserve in Victoria.
It is thought expedient now to have a general statute bearing on the subject.
Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED-I notice that tlie

case; here is provision made in the first
clause of the Bill that they should take
over the line fromi Fredericton to Woodstock. Woodstock is a good many miles
fromn St. John, the point which the Intercolonial railway touches, and how the Intercolonial is going to operate the northern
portion of the road one cannot see. It
will have no connection with the Intercolonial. railway at ail. It will be up in

of the debates of the Senate. Wc find at

Tihe SPEAKER. I think this notice cf motien is flot, in fersu, a proper question.
1 desire te call attention to the iact that
I neyer called for the motion. The report
states ' The notice cf motion being called
by the Hon. Mr. Landry.'
As soon as I
rose te read my motion, the hon. Speaker
intervened and declared the motion out cf
order.
Therefore, 1 do not see why the
motion should appear in our Debates.
It
was neyer read. It was choked as soon as
it tried te show its head over the surface cf
these placid senatorial waters, and it was
choked and drowned immedintely by the
Speaker. I do net see why our reports
shculd say that the motion wns called by
the Hon. Mr. Landry. Before it -%vas eveni
read thse Speaker gave bis decision. As
a matter cf correct procedure our Debates
should record thse events as they take
place. I find an admirable speech afterwards by the hon. Speaker, in which
hie puts plainly, as lie views it,
the
matter before the Senate. I will net discuss that speech; but I think there are
some aditional matters in it which were
not given in thse House. I would like to
compare the notes cf the
stenographer
with the version we have before us to-day.

MNAY 17, 1911

The report seerns to have been corrected
before the usual time, because I find sornething new in it that I did not hear yesterday. The wording should be the wording
that was used in this House, and I think
the illusion that I called for the motion,
that I read the motion as given in the
Order Paper, and that the Speaker rose
afterwards to say that the motion was not
in conformîty with the rulies, shouid ail be
stricken out, as weIl as those things which
were put in afterwards. which did not occur in this House. I hope the report will
be arnended so that it will record exactly
the decision given by the Speaker in the
way he gave it, because-that is a feiture
I would like to conserve.

of the cash systemn would benefit workingmen generally, a subject in which then, as
now, I take a great interest, and Mr.
Eaton, who had occasion to look minutely
into the matter, brought forward a large
-number of instances in which he showed
a perfectly astonishing profit, as resulting
to workingmen from being able to deal for
cash insteal of for credit. He instanced
among other tbings the great success of the
English co-operative stores, which Nvas due,
to a large degree, if not altogether, to the
fact that the co-operative members did
deal, 1 believe, exclusively for cash, and,
as he very truly remarked to me, when the
relations between purchaser and 'seller are
those that the purchaser is considerably
in debt to the seller, the chances are ten
to one that the purchaser -ill corne off
with short measure and short weighlt, and
that he will, in a great rnany cases have
to accept a very inferior article at a very
high price. AIl these things are true, I be-,
lieve, and these things are considerations
which should weigh, and have weig-hed,
no doubt, with many members of the'
Senate in promoting leg-islation which wil]
accomplish this object. At the same time,
it is obvious that if we are going to enact
a penal law such as is proposed here,
the thing must be fully and carefully considered. I have received several communications from members of this House who
take a great interest in this matter, but
are not able to be present for various reasons, and also from other parties, asking
that this matter be flot pressed until after
the recess. If we had a littre more tirne at
our disposal, I would be inclined to say that
we could flot employ it better; but as this
Bill will require to go first to a committee, and afterwards to the bouse of Conimons, and as it is alino-t an imipossibility that it should pass under the circumstances, if there is any opposition to it
either here or there, ïny lion. friend who
moved the amendrnent would do well to accept the suggestion and allow the discussion of this measure to be postponed until
we meet again. I arn, as I have said, quite
in syrnpathy with his object; but, at the
same time, I mnust point out to hini that

considered. On that point I think he will
agree, and everybody will agree. I ar n ot
quite certain -what he means, and what
classes of persons he proposes to include iii
his arnendment. The classes I would desire to protect and assist in this way, and
whom I presume he desires hixnself particularly to protect are the classes of men
who receive comparatively low wages. To
them it is of more importance than to
any one else that they should get the best
value for their money. If this, as I rather
think it does, were to include men in receipt of salaries of say $ 1,200, and upwards
there might be objection taken to it wvith
sorne reason. The committee found it, I
believe, rather difficult at first to draw the
line, and I should be very sorry to see
this ineasure disposed of without giving, a
full opportunity to ail parties to be heard.
I therefore, miove that this discussion be
adjourned until this day wveek, by whichi
time the adjournment will in ail probability have commenced.
H<.n. Mr. ELLIS-The reasons which
the right hon. gentleman gives are sufficiently good for the average man, but I

should proceed with the measure and
the House should express its view. There
is a feeling in regard to this matter that
the Senate is mnerely playing with the
question, and that the object is to delay
it. I do flot know that that feeling is wel
foundel. No doubt there is an evil of a
very grave kind, and the House of Conimons having undertaken to remedy the
evii we should be bound by their action
in soine way or anothei, or at any rate
we should give it a thorough discussion. I
do flot wholly agree with the amendrnent
proposed by rny hon. friend behind nie;
but I would be willing to vote for that as
a reasonable move towards the solution
of what is desired by the working men.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE. When the debate wvas adjourned last Friday, I think it
was pretty well understood by everybody
that it was to be closed to-day. I put the

well understood we would take a voze
before the adjourniment. I do not see why
we should postpone the debate. Everybody
knows the merits and demerits af this
Bill. It lias been iully discussed in the
committee and lias been on the Order
Paper two or three weeks. I came down
specially this week to make a few remarks
on the Bill in order to close the debate
if nobody was ready to speak, and 1 amn
quite willing to vote on it now to ascertain ivhere we stand. As the hion. gentleman from St. John has aaid, some people
do not aeemi anxious to support the Bill
or to liet it pass. I think we should vote
on the amendment. If I understood the
right hion, leader, lie told us that we ought
to be very careful about the penalties
being imposed. I may tell himi that there
is no penalty, and the only question before us is to psy the men bj-nionthly.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-If my hion. friend will look at the Railway Act, ta which this would be an amendment, he, will find that a violation af the
Act would expose parties ta heavy penalties.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-That, is the
generai clause, but we have not to iook
for penalties in this Bill; Nve have just to
declare the simple principle of semi-nîonthly paymeflts.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-We create an offence which. is penal.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Thie question is
whether it is a proper thing to pay the men
bi-monthly. I arn a little surprised at this
suggestion coming from 'the 'rigit, hou.
leader of the government in this House,
and I arn not prepared to accept it. The
righttlhon. gentleman advances the reason
that an argument may take place on the
Bill in the other House, as the amendment
wîll have to be debated there. I amn informed that the amendment will be accepted there, and if we pass the Bill now
it will be ready to be assented to at the
eni of the week. I have taken sorne interest in this matter, especîally in regard
ta the working classes. Those who differ
with regard to the principle of the Bill
should be well prepared now to cast their

vote. I oppose the motion to adjourn th e
debate.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I arn
not asking this on my own behaîf, but 1
have received letters from senators who are
not present requesting, if possible, to have
lihe measure postponed until Fafter the
adjournment. I have my own opinions
about this question as on most others. and
I am prepared to express thern now
if the suggestion ta postpone is not accepted
by the hion. gentleman who moved the
amendmient to the report af the committee.
It is a very important matter, interferin,,
materially with questions that w,*Il affect

quires more serious consideration.
stated by the leader of the House, being
an amendment ta the Railway Act it will
render those who violate its provisions fiable ta the penalties impased by that Act.
The wording of the resolution itself would
not carry that impression. I have great rë spect for the action af the Commons, as,
they are the representatives ai the people,
but I say with ail deference ta supporters
ai this Bill that I do not think their action
should be held up a6 a reason why we
should adopt it. If the Senate is to be
guided by that consideration, there is no
necessity for a Senate. We are here for
the purpose of considering the legislation
which is presented ta us by the House of
Commons, and it is supposed that thase
who occupy scats in this Hanse will consider questions of this importance irrespective ai party, or ai the efiect it may have
upon any particular constituency which it
would directly affect. My ides ai the duty
ai a senator is-and I think without considering myself at ail eg-otistical, I have acted on that principle in this House-to treat
subjects on their merits as lie understands
them. I amrn ot speaking for other gentlemen, because human minds are not conýtituted alike, and aur reasoning powers
and intellect are not the sanie. Each one
is independent in thought and should be
iniependent in action, and matters ai such
great importance which. affect so materially the larger corporations ai this country,

Is parliament prepared to take this stp
and establish such a precedent? I had the
honour of being iu the Flouse when Sir
Leonard Tilley first introduced his Bill to
subsidize railways generally, and I remember speaking to hîm on the floor of the
Flouse, although nlot to the House, after
bis Bill was introduced, and sayinga, «Sir
Leonard you are establishing a precedent
that will involve Canada lu millions. 1
mean that you are using .railway subsidies
to subvent the subsidies given byv the Dominion to the province in lieu of a direct
subsidy, for if you ail the development of
the provinces bv railway subsidies vou
might as well do it by direct suhsidv.' Sir
Leonard's rep'ly was, ' I admit that what
you say is true, but in the east railway
construction is slow, and people are not
as well off there as they are in the west,
and we cannot get roads except in this
way. 1 arn forced to do what I have done

So it was done, and the garne was played.
The maritime provinces did not get more
than their sharÉ; neither did Quebec. Ontario got very little aid, the great provinces
of the west got abundant subsidies, no
doubt in the interest of Canada-I do îîot

which would certainlv develop a large
amount of freight if there were railwayF
built there. The question is whether this
road is to pay. 1 should judge from the
iinprovement made in the management
of the Intercol-onial railway, that if this
line were made a part of the Intercolonial railway it would be a paying enterprise. It will flot be a brandi, as thu
hon. gentleman said rwhi'le ago. I have
a suggestion which I have flot yet seen in
print, but which I think will be the outcorne if this legisiation passes, that when
the line is built to Grand Falsa, if there
are running rights over the Canadian Pacifie railway for 12 miles to St. Leonard, there
it would connect with the Grand Trunk Pa,cifie, and would meet the Intercolonial railway coming over from Campbellton. The
government lias introduced in the Coinnions a IBill to take over twelve branch
lines and mnake tlîem part of the Intercol.
ornai railway, and this road from St. John
river to Campbellton is one of the branches
they will take over. If this legislation
passes it will only be a few years until New
Brunswick has a beit line extending
along the north shore and then down the
St. John river to St. John. Then with
regard to the question of traffic, an hoil.
gentleman remarked that if we made con.
nection with the Grand Trunk Pacifie we
would get no freiglit. Freiglit goes wherever it is routed. The present management
of the Intercolonial railway seems to put
,considerable energy and business into the
concern, and if the politicians on the nortli
shore woulId only leave the management
alone I have no doubt it would lie made
one of the paying- roads ini New Brunswick,
tTnder good management I amn sure it will.
If the Intercolonial railway should wvake
up and become as energ-etie as the Canadian Pacifie railway it ean have its
agents ahl over Canada routing freighit
via the 1. C. R. That is a good business.
No railway would get business out of
its own line if it were not for the fact
that they have live and energetie men
looking np business, and with good management this proposed line would be a paying road.

reference to the cost of the equipment of
the road, the Intercolonial railway has a
lot of equipment that could lie used on that
road, and held as an aszef by the Intercolonial railway, it could be used on
this road and would not practically cost
the country any money. I was delightel

tl.at parliament is flot taking any financial
responsibility, except for the first one or
two years of the running of the road. After
that it will ta:ke care of itself.
Hon. Mr. POWER-The hon. gentleman
spoke of the great risk New B'runswick had
assumed in undertaking to contribute $25,000 a mile towards the building of the road.*
I gather from what the hon. gentlemen on
the other side of the House (Mr. Baird)
said, that there was Borne arrangement between the two governments before the New
Brunswick Act of 1910 was passed. The arrangement set forth in this Bill is that the
Dlominion government wvill pay 40 per cent
of the grass earnings as rentai. Will the
hion. gentleman undertake to tell me that
the province of New Brunswick is running
the risk of paying vers' muchi?
H-on. Mr. THOMPSON-I -really do not
think either government is running any
great risk on this road, whicli in my jud-mient will be one of the best pieces of railway in Canada. When the province itself
offers to guarantee $25,000 a mile, a larger
amount than has ever been given hy any
provincial government, I think it is the
strongest evidence that they have faith in
the work, and that it is really worthy of
the Dominion assumning responsibility iii
respect thereto.
Hon. Mr. POWER-If it is such a good
undertaking, why would the big railways
not take care of it, and *why is it necessary
to corne to parliament?
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-Tlie same rnight
be said &f the Canadian Northern. Why
is it necessary for the g-overnment ta step
in? The saine might be said with reference
I.o the rich province of Nova Scotia. The
goverrument propose to go into Nova Scotia
and construet a line. I do iiot know if the
lion. gentleman frorn Middlescx will approve of that.
Hon. Sir GEORGE W. ROSS (Middlesex)
-No.
Han. Mr. THOMPSON-Neither this government nor the government of New Brunswick will 'have any responsibility that will
amounit to anything after s few years.
Hon. Alr. CASGRLAIN-About the 40 per
cent, supposing that hranch takes in $5,000

a mile, the rentai that the government
would have to pay would be $2,000. Whiat
mieans would they have ta pay that?
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-They would pay
that towards the interest on the bonds.
In sa far as that is concerned, the obligation. of this government would be to pay it
tolvar(Is the interest on the $25,000 bonds
guaranteed by the provincial governent.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN-S up posing the
road worked steadily for some years without making any profit at ahl, where will
they -et the 40 per cent to. pay?
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-The province will
pay lt.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-There seems ta
be quite a feeling about this matter. I did
xiut hiear the remarks of the -lhon. gentleman from Middlesex, which 1 regret, because it is interesting ta hear him speak.
There seems to be a misconceptian about
this mat-ter. I believe in calling a spade
a spade and a shovel a shovel. The Grand
Trunk Pacific should not have gone to
Moncton. It is gaing through a part of the
province where the lumber is ail cut out.
I may be wrong, but my idea is that to
ple-ase bath Halifax and New Brunswick
that line was drawn on the snap to show
a direct line ta Halifax as the crow flues.
This road attempts ta find an outlet to St.
Jlohn through the valley of the St. John
river, and we might caîl it the base of an
isosceles triangle. We must face the fact
that it is an endeavour to divert the trade
from Quebec down to St. John that is the~
bottom of it, and we are proud of it. The
government xnay be forced into 'it.The
are ahl sort; of contingencies which force
governments ta do things they do net want
to. If the local «overnment is strong enouzh, what is there to prévent theni constructing the twelve miles connection between Grand Falls and St. Leonard thiemselves? We are advancing the arzument
that it is a good country, 'and the road la
goin-g to be a payîng proposition, I would
suggest that that twelve miles be built at
on.ee.
But I can see floating in the air the ide&
that the progressive city of St. John, whiere
the- people are fed on flsh, and think they
have ail the intdlligence in this and the

SENATE
oth-er House, or a great deal of it, is going
to benefit by this undertaking and become.
the wintier port of Canada on the Atlantic.'
1 arn afraid the hon. gentleman fromi Halifax does flot like the look of it, but you
cannot turn water up hili successfully. If
St. John is nearer Montreal than Halifax
is, and has an open port in the *winter,
why should we go against nature? I remember when the Canadian Pacifie railway was
projected to run north of Lake Superior, we
were told that there was nothing there to
sustain a railway, that the country was so
barren that a crow eould flot pick up a living there. Look at it to-day. WTe have flot
only the Canadian Pacifie railway, but a,
second, and a third transcontinental line,
and I should not be surprised if we should
have a fourth very soon, extending fromn
Chicoutimi to thre west. If this road is
going to help New Brunswick, we, who have
been watching the great development of the
northwest and are proud to think that the
government of the day are bending ail their
energies to build up western Canada, think
it is flot out of place ta give the people of
New Brunswick a chance. Supposing this
lime does flot pay, if it brings traffic do'wn
to our sea-ports it pays indirectly. Wie want
our country opened up. The boom has been
ini the west, and people in the eastern provinces have lef t their farms and gone west,
though you cannot, find any part of tire west
equal to New Brunswick. Acre for acre, New
Brunswick will beat anything on earth.
With this lime constructed, the farmer& will
cultivate farms near the coast, where they
have flot faciliti-es now to get their produets

thoughi it should be a losing proposition to
the country, it will huild Up an undeveloped
part of New Brunswick and improve

says t.hey are going ta build roads in
Nova Scotia. That is ail right. We do
mnot kick at amy thing that is done in
the west. We do iiot kick at tlie building
of a road ta Hudson bay. That is al
righit. 1 have always advocated it because
when we build aur fleet we want to put it
on the Hudson bay, wh-ere it will be safe.
No enemy could get at it there. The two
arguments used -against this projeet are,
first, that the road is ta run to St. John,.

country hias to psy for it. But it must be
remembered the government of New Brunswick have to do their part. If money is lost
they are guaranteeing the bonds. The only
possible loss ta the Dominion would be on
the operation of the line.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-Is there a company formýed ta build that railway?
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-Yes.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-An incorporated

Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-Oh, yes, incorpoiated in Newv Brunswick last year.

purpose of constructing this road, but there

I mention this ta showv that the hion. nienib.-r from Middlesex was well within th.e.

Hon. Mr. LANDRY-I suppose the hion.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I move that this
recommendation be referred to the Committee on Internai Economy and Conitingent Accounts for the purpose of inaking
a report upon it. I do not desire to be understood as expressing any opinion in respect to that memorandum, and it is nio reflection on the Speaker to say that I do flot
think bis report is (tuile iii accordance -with
the Civil Service Act, where it states that
the Speaker shall make a report on the recommendation from the clerk, in vriting to
him in a certain way; and this memorandum, as I read it, is simply a memorandum
from the Speaker direct to the Senate. But
,apart froin that, so long as this House
think it advisable to appoint a standing
committee on' Internai Economy, I arn
quite sure the House itself would feel dis.posed to treat that committee f airly, and
when .we consider the application of the
,Civil Service Act to the other branch of
parliament we can appreciate the tact that
the Contingent Committee of that House
acta, before the Speaker, under the Civil
,Service Act, makes bis report to the House
of Commons. By reference to the Act governing the House of Commons it wîhl be
found that there is no Contingent Committee appointed by the House ltself, but that
the Contingent Conimittee consista of an
(appointment made by the Goverrior in
Councîl, and the Speaker is the head of
that departmnent. So that, in point of fact,
the House itself, acting under the Civil
Service Act of 1908, takes the recommendation of the Internai Economy Committee in
respect of expenditure, -promotions, salaries, and otherwise before it reaches the
House itself. My hion. friend saîd that the
Act had repealed the governing powers of
this Senate, but I do not entertain any
454

such view. I do not think we have repealed in any sense the constitutional rights
of this Senate to act in respect of its domestic or internai matters, but even if we
tried to' follow up the provisions of the
Civil Service Act, as far as they are applicable to the Senate, when the Speaker
has made his recommendation it would
be only proper, having regard to our constitutional riglits, that this recommendation should be referred to the committee,
one of the institutions called upon to govern the expenditure of this branch of parliarnent. In making this speech I do so
without any desire to reflect on the Speaker
of the Senate, and without expressing an
opinion in regard to the application made
by my friend the assistant clerk, ,Nho sirnply presents a memiorial to the Speaker,
and the Speaker presents the memorial
with bis recommendation to the Senate not
in accordance with the Act as I read it. because under the Act the Clerk of the
House in writing must present te the
Speaker certain ric-ommendations 'which
the Speaker of thc House wili recommend
te the Senate. In that view of the case, I
move that this memorial be referred to the
Comnmittee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts.
The SPEAKER-Before putting the motion, I miglit be permitted to say a worl

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-I think we had
a recommendation of promotion here within a week, in which the Clerk made a recommendation to the Speaker in respect of
it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-That is flot promotion.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON-But we were
prornoting thern from one class to another
exactly as they are doing here.
The SPEAKER-But this, is flot promotion. This is rectifying a mistake. Section
8 of the Civi'I Service Act reads:
8. As soon as praoticable after the coming

3. After being so dot.er'mined and defined, the

That is, it shall not be changed with

The other classification was made two

adopted, and it is for the purpose of chan-ing that classification that we have to add
a motion to change it. I think thiat is according to law. The classification adopted
in the first instance by this House, on the
recommendation of the Committee on Internai Economy, has been the law up to taday, but according to clause 8 of the Act,
that classification shonuI be changed, and
the only way to change it is to have an order iu council. What is an order in council as applied to this House. By clause 48
of the Act an order in counicil is a resolution passed by this House; sa that if a
resolution is passed by this House you

what is asked to-day.

while the first part of the clause indicates
an intention to enter into a contract with
a company, in line 15 it adds, 'With the
governinent of the province of New Brunswicw.' I take objection to that and move
that the words 'with the governnient of
the province of New Brunswick' be struck
out, leaving the government of the Domninion free to make a lease with a company.
I want to prevent the Dominion entering
into entangling alliances with the government of a province. In confirmation of
xny view, clause 2 provides that the Board
of Directors of any railway company wit.i
whicb the government proposes to enter
into a contract may, with the consent ol
the shareholders given at a meeting, enter
into a lease, indicating that full power is
given in this Bill to mnake a contract with
a company entirely irrespective of its relations with the government nf the province.

ST. JOHN VALLEY RAILWAY BILL.

The House resumed in Committee of the
Whole on (Bill 150), an Act to authorize the

a certain line of raiway in the province of

New Brunswick.

(In tlic Committee.)
On the first clause.
Honi. Sir GEORGE W. ROSS (Middlesex)

of this clause. I raised the point in the

have no objection.

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-This Bill is
drafted in accordance with the law passed
last session by the New Brunswick legislature concerning the construction of the
St. John Valley railway. In every clause
of the Bill you wvill find the words: 'The
gover.nment ni New Brunswick.' Though I
arn opposed to the Bill, I think the hon.
gentleman sbould look through the measure passed by the governiment of New
Brunswick before pressing bis motion. Il

now before us is based, contains the words
' the government of New Brunswick,' and
the government of New Brunswick could
do nothing unless the very same wording
is fdllowed here. The lease to be made,
the plans and everything must be approved by the government of New Brunsthe Bill is passed it must be

passed as it is.
Hon. Sir GEORGE W. ROSS (Middlesex)
-Do 1 understond the hon, gentleman to
say that this contract could not .be made at
aIl if the government of New Brunswick
was excluded from the bargain?
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE-No, but the
government of New Brunswick will say it
is no use. They wvill say that the government of Canada has passed a law whicb
prevents us building the road.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Since we had the
Bill under consideration yesterlay, I took
the trouble to read the 'Hansard' in the
other House, also to look at the map and
consider the whole question, and I find the
position is much better than I supposed it
was yesterday. There is a history to this
road and the position is this: Mr. Hazen,
Premier of New Brunswick, said to the people of New Brunswick: 'I will guarantee
bonds to the extent of $25,000 a mile for
the construction of this roal, provided the
federal goverrment will give the usual subsidy of $6,400 a mile, and provided also that
it shaîl be operated by the Intercolonial
raiiway, the rentaI thereof being 40 per cent
of the gross earniýng«s.' I must say I wvas
shocked et such a proposition. Sînce then
I have foulid out that the Canadian Pacifie rEfflway lias already leased branches of
railway immediately near there on- the
sanie termns. giving to the owners of the
railways as a rentaI 40 per cent of the gros
receipts. . If this Bill is passed as it is
now, naturallv it is a sort of compromise
Aetween the two governments, and any
amendnient to the Bill as the hon, gentleman fromn Gran iville (Hon. Mr. Choquette)
says, would have the effect of destroying
the compromise entirely. If we pass this
Bill it is up to the government of New.
Brunswick to construct that railway.

713

Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-No, no0.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-That is the opinion I formed.
Hon. -Mr. DOM VILLE-la this a legal
opinion, or a commercial one the hon.
gentleman is giving? Evidently it is a
legal opinion.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-I was proceeding
to say that it is up to the goverument of
New Brunswick, or the company to build
that railway. When that railway is buit
to the standard of the National Transcontinental railway, it will be for this government, or wvhatever government may then
be at the head of affairs to say whether or
flot they will take the road over as part
of the Intercolonial railway. That is the~
whole question. This is simply enablingthe company or the provincial government,
one of the two, to build this road, and
when the road has been built, if it is constructel up to the standard of the National
Transcontinental railway, the government
of Canada can lease it and operate it like
the Intercolonial and pay a rentai of 40
per cent of the gross earnings. That is the
whole proposition as I understand it.
Hon. Mr. ELLIS-Does the hon. gentleman think the government is bound to take
it?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-My opinion is,
the government is not bound to take it unless it fulfils ail the conditions provided
for in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE. The statements
the hon. gentleman is making are already
in 'Hansard'. Why repeat them.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-Therefore, I for ont,
would be in favour of voting for this Bill
as it is at present, not amending it in any
way, to see whether the government of New
Brunswick, or the company that they mav
have in view -will ever build this road. I
will be frank with this House and say that
in my humble opinion I do not believe this
road wiIl be built by the New Brunswick
government, or by any company, for a very
good reason.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-I cannot allow
the hion. gentleman to put statements
before this House if they are flot correct.
The .government of New Brunswick do
not say they will build this road. They
are only -giving- facilities for boing so,
and do flot intend to build it themselves.
Hon. Mr. <JASGRAIN-Therefore I do flot
think this government is running any rizsk
whatever. It is doubtful in my mind whether it will be buit, and I think hon, gentlemen wifl agree wîth me. This road will
parallel the Canadian Pacific railway fromn
Grand Falls to Andover and into Woodstock, back into Fredericton, and into St.
John, and I understand that the people
down there are satisfied with the service
they are getting from the Canadian Pacifie
railway, and .their interests are quite
friendly. It is flot likely, therefore, that
they will build a road in competition with
the Canadian Pacifie railway. But by putting this Bill on the statute it wirl be up
to the people 'of New Brunswick to build
the road, or to say whiether they will build
it or not.
Hon. Sir GEORGE W. ROSS (Middlesex)
-The hion. gentleman has not answered
the objection I raiseci. I do flot object to
the construction of the road, but I do object to entering into a bargain with the
government of New Brunswick, and not
with a company. There is a company chartered by an Act of the provincial legisiature and that company will be given power
to construct that road, and that company
-will have power to issue bonds at so muchi
per mile for its construction. Let tbem do
so. -The Canadian Northern is being built
by a guarantee of the bonds of the company. We want to deal witlh that coin
pany and not with the government, and
I need not repeat that I think it is a most
dangerous precedent for this House to enter into transactions involving millions of
money with a provincial g-overnment wheu
it can be avoiiJed.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-Is the hion. gentleman objecting to the
legality or the expediency of it?
Hon. Sir GEORGE W. ROSS (Middlesex)
-The po]icy of it. I do not think it is
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

illegal. I think you could enter into a
bargain with a provincial government for
that purpose, but I think it is impolitic
and for that reason I objeet.
Hon. .Mr. CHOQUETTE-The hon. gentleman from Rothesay (Hon. Mr. Domville)
was objeeting that the hon. gentleman from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) was
speaking againat the railway because it
was in New Brunswick. I do flot care
where the road is built. It is not because
it is New Brunswick or any other province.
I objeet to the Bill because it is an iiifamous business proposition, and, moreover, for the reas6n given by the hon. genitleman fromn Middlesex, because we are
entering-not merely entering, but putting
this government in the bands of a provincial government, no matter whether it is
New Brunswick or any other province.
The eompany eau do nothing; they caiinot mnake a lease or equip the railway unless
the government of New Brunswick pass an
order in counicil and aceept it. We are at
their mercy. My hon. friend from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) says the Canalian
Pacifie railway has done the same thing. It
bias leased a railway and it pays as rental of
the gross earnings, 40 per cent. That may
be true, and I arn ready to vote for a measure of that kind; but have the Canadian
Pacific railway given to that railway a subsidy of $6,400 a mile, and equipped it at
the same tirne? The Canadian Pacific railway are paying about 40 per cent of the
receipts of the railway, but take the railway
already equipped. As matter of policy, I
objeet to a provincial government making
this bargain. I would object if it were the
province of Quebec. There is not a busmness man in his priva te capacity who
would make a bargain of that kind. I will
ask the right hion, leader of the Houie a
question just to show how serious it is for
this government to take the railway, ii)
pay $6,500 a mile subsidy, to pay 40 per
cent of the grosa earnings, and to equip
the railway. Yesterday the hon. gIijti,mau from Middlesex said the goveritmc"t
was going to assume the cost of equipment,
for which it uets nothing, and the right
hon. leader of the House in reply, said the
province is te deliver it fulIy equipped. Is
that quite correct?

If you ]ook at
the second subciause of the first clause,
you will find that the Dominion government are authorized to take it over in sections. If the road is equipped when taken
over, the government would flot suifer any
very serious inconvenience in operating it;
but il the road is not equipped, the government have no ineans of getting from the
Intercolonial railway, where they have
equipment, locomotives, cars and so on to
this new road. These sections are in the

-inister, but to an unfortunate circumstance which occurred, and which the House
is familiar with, which for a good mnany
days prevented that hion, gentleman fromn
taking part in the deliberations. I know
that he *was anxious that this ineasure
should have been brought up at an earlier
-date, and, therefore, on his behalf, I express his regret that hie was not able to lay
it before this Chamber at an earlier period.
As it is, however. and as the facts connected
therewith and the whole tenor and scope of
this Bill have been iully belore the country
and before the House of Commons for a
considerable period, and as I have no doubt
that miy hion. iriends generally have familiarized themselves with the discussion and
also with the details of the measure, I will
crave the indulgence of the House in moving the second reading. The measure, in
brief, proposes that we should give our
guarantee for a sum, of $35,000 per mile
over the estimated extent of 1,000 miles, for
the purpose of conn-ecting the Canadian
Northern railway in Manitoba and in the
Northwest with the other branches which
have been constructed by the proprietors of
the road, flot merely in the province of Quebec, but those also now heing extended
throughout the greater part of the province
of Ontario, and which wvill ultimiately conneet, I believe, with a number of lines
now in their handa and 'under their control in the maritime provinces. XVhile the
guarantee is a large one, no doubt that up
to the present time. although the Canadian
Northern have received a considerable
number of guarantees in various quarters
they have always punctually and faithfully
carried out their obligations, and* have, 1
think, %vithout fail, relieved the guarantora
from any liability, and in this case I have
no do-ubt wvhatever that they will pursue
an equally correct and honourable course
towards the country. The merits -of .th-e undertaking are briefly these: In the first
place, it will give us a through line of rail-way, and it will conneet two very important
systema of railways flow existing, those
that I have spoken of in the Northwest

719

and those that I have spoken of in Quebec
and Ontario, with each other, and it wil
likewise help, 1 think, to bring into iminediate settlement a large tract o! territory

will see that this will probably aid materially in the settling of that large tract of
country. It bas this great advantage also,
that both ends are at this present moment
actively employed. I need not tell the
House that the Canadian Northern is, at
the present moment, conveying a large pter.tion o! the grain and produce o! the Northwest, which is likely to increase very
rapidly and to assume very large proportions- very shortly. They are also, as my
hon. friends fromn Ontario particularly are
aware, doing very much what the Ca.nadian
Pacifie railway did a considerable number
o! years ago, that is, developing a large
systemi of new raiiways in the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec. the resuit o! ail this,
it is believed, will tend very considerably
Woproduce a wholesome competition between the several systems, and the great
growth of the Northwest ia likely to afford
ample work, for ail th-ese roads Wodo. We
could consider the details probably better
as we go through the Bill in committee, but
those are the main features of the undertaking. The goverment will, however, for
a year or two, provide the interest on the
amounit to be guaranteed the company.
Those are the chie! points of interest in
t'onnection %ith this measure, of whîch I
now move the second readirig.

-Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-That is largely the object the government
have in view. Whether that is being fully
carried out or flot I amrn ot sure. It would
hardly be until the railway is more advanced, but that is undoubtedly the object
that is to be attained.
Hon. Mr. POWER-This is a very
im'
portanit measure, and we should have a
chance to see what it really is. Neither
the hon. gentleman to my leit, nor myseif,
has had a copy of the Bill, and some step
should be taken to furnishi copies.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-The
rig&ht hion, leader of the House, in moving the second reading of this Bill, has
very properly called attention to the lateness of its being laid before us. We find,
unfortunately, that most of these importaint measures, involving directly or indirectly millions of money, are brought before us without one day's notice. It is true
that this question has been discussel for
some few weeks in the press, but we have
had no information such as would justify
a deliberative body in giving its assent to
so important a question as this. other than
the fact, that it is intendled to connect this
transcontinental line withi the Intercolonil railway. WVe had a few years ago a
proposition for leasing- the
Drurnmondi
County railway, but there were certain
conditions in that agreement which, so far
as I know, have not yet been carried out.
However, the first proposition was rejected, and a more favourable agreement to
the company was afterîvards obtained, and
a large amount of monexr was saved. How
far those -conditions have been carried
out in order to secure the amount of traffic from the west for the Intercolonial railway that was anticipated, I amn not prepared to say. This I do know, that difficulties arose between the Grand Trunk
railway and the government as to the carrying out of those conditions. What the
resuit was, the country bas nôt learned.
Now, if the conditions irnposed on the Canadis.n Northern in making this large guarantee, are of a sufficiently drastic char.

traffic, when it reaches Montreal, it wull
tend largely to justify the action of the
government in guaranteeing the bonds of
the company. It is true that there is a
provision by which shippers may route
their freight otherwise than by the Intercolonial railway. While I should like to
see the governrnent railway get aIl the
traffic, I arn not prepared to advocate a
system which would compel the shipper
to take that or any other route.
Rt. Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-I arn very sorry that this Bill has not
been distributed. If the lion. gentleman
has not a copy of it befo.-.i him, I may say
that clauses 13 and 14 deai w'ith that particular subject.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I have
not seen the Bill, but I have read tbe
resolution -which. provides that the trafflc
is to be handed over to the Intercolonial
railway, if not otherwise directed by the
shipper, and I presurne the saine provision
is contained ini the Bill itself. Now, in
reference to the dlay beit, I arn not so confident that this line will open up such a
large section as has been indicated by
those whio have discussed the question. I
notice on looking at the map that the line
runs as far south as the county of Hastings, passing through the township of
Monteagle, and then southeastwtard. The
dlay beit, as far as my experience anl
knowledge go--and I have been over a portion of it-commences at Haileybury. 1

THE ROYAL ABSENT TO BILLS.
Han. Mr. POWER-I propose ta say a
f ew words on what may be deemed a
matter ai privilege. I understand that
His Excellency is not at the present time
in the city, and, eonsequently, the remaike
I amn albout ta make are, perhaps, a littie
aut ai place; but an the last occasion when
Bills 'were aasented ta His Excellency was
in the city, ana instead ai corning himself
to give the ]Royal ssent, hie .deputed tAie
Deputy Governor General ta came. Nov,
that ils a praotice which. has not prevailed
in the past. JUnder .former gavern<ors, if
thie Governor General was absent fishing
at Cascapedia, or out in Bril>ieh Columbia,
his deputy came; Ibut if -the Governor
General vas in the city *he csrne and
assented ta Bille himseli. Consideing that
assenting ta Bis les, on the whale, the
mos't important part that thie Goverar
General has ta play in Canada, I think
it ie deairâble, at any rate when ie is in
tAie elty, that hie should corne here. Our
parlisment is compaeed ai -the two Houses
and the Governor General for thie time
being. Eah one ai 'these branches of
parlia-ment, should show a proper amount
ai respect for the other branches. Suppose,
we wil say at thie prorogation, that when
thie Black Red goes down ta the House ai
Gomomons ta summon them ta attend here,
instead ai sending up the Speaker'they -were
ta send the Deputy Speaker, that would be

143j

looked upo>n as showing a vant ai respect
ta the ol3her two branches of parliamentta His Excellency and the Benate. If the
Senate, when a message was ta Ro ta the
Hanse of Commons were, instead of sending the gentleman Usher ai the Black Bod,
ta send the doarkeeper, it wauld be looked upan as a highly irnpraper thing. This
House deserves ta be shawn every reasanable zesj>ect in its character s on ai the
three branches ai parliament. That is one
ai thie reasons why I regret the incident
w'hich ocurred the last time thie Bills were
assenited- ta, and the ather la this; I_.am a
very strang believer in British connectian,
I shauld very mnuch regret that the present
practi-ce of havmng the Gavernar General
came fromn England ehould be discontinued. I arn altagether opposed to the
idea ai aur becoming independent and
separate iram the mother country. The
cannectian which now exista is not any tao
strang, and I shauld regret that anything
should be dane wihih 'would teiqd to
weaken the fiken tiethat ibinds us ta the
mather country. The f aut that the gentleman whio reWresents the Crown here apparently ie desirotu ai aho'wing that he ie
nat necessary, and that we can get a chief
justice, ar an assaciate justice oi the
Supreme Court wha will disaharge his
most important funaction just qas well as
lie does, is Teally daing a gaad deal ta
teach the people ofi this country thýat we
do nat need a Gavernor General irom England. From that point ai view, it je ta
be hoped that future Governars General
will do, as was thie practice formerly, and
will, unless absent from thie seat of gov.
enmont, enake it a paint ta do whldt I
consider their duty as one constituent af
parliament.

MAY 19, 1911
flot understand the distinction my hion.
friend the right hion. leader of this House
draws. It is not a question of the adjournment of the House. It is a question
of sanctioning of the Bills that have been
passed by -parliament. The Governer General, the Senate and the Hanuse of Coinmons constitute the governinent in this
country, and when Bills are assented to,
they muet be assented to with the consent
of each one. The question arises as to
whether it would be more dignified and
better ta maintain, as fer as we possibly
can, 4the_ practices 'of the sovereigns of
England in Canada ta as fuil an extent as
possible. We do not ask the Governor
General ta corne down ta sanction aur

free will, but when the question arises as
to the granting of supplies for the carrying an of the governinent af the country
the sanction is given in the naine af the
Sovereign, and the Governor General being
the representative of the Sovereigu, the
question is whether it would flot be more
dignified ta have the Governor General
here unless preveited, by extraordinary
circumestmnces. snd then hie deputy cornes.
1 arn fully in accord with the sentiments
of the hon. gentleman from. Halifax with
regard ta the. position held by Canada
towards the empire, and the duties af the
Sovereign and of his representative in Canada. It is nat necessary, under ordinary
circumstances, that he should be expected
ta came here merely ta sanction Bis, with
ail the paraphernalia and gorgeous display that we have at the apenmng and
closing ai parliarnent. My recollection la
that Governors General came down in their
frock coats juat as they appear an the
street, ta sanction Bills during the session;
and I arn sure the hon. gentleman from
Halifax neyer thought for a moment, nar
do I think hie intended ta canvey the idea,
that the Governar General should came
down in state merely ta sanction aur adjournment. The Governar General is part
and parcel of the gov ernment ai the country. and the Senate and Hause af Coinmons, with the Governor General as a representative af the Sovereign, constîtute the
pawer that gives authority ta place laws
upon the statute-book, and particularly

with regard ta Supply.
From my personal knawledge af the official duties af
the Governor Generai ai Canada, 1 do not
think there is a member af the Senate who
would dissent froin the views expressed
and the sentiments uttered by the right
hon, leader with reference ta the canduct
af that gentleman. We have haed many
Governors General in Canada during the
period I have been in parliainent and
every one af them has taken a deep interet in the welf are af the country, and ail
have made themselves acquainted with the
industrial, social and' domestic conditions
cf the people and the capabilities of the
country ta the fullest extent. I know cf ne
gentleman who has taken a deeper interest
in the wellare of Canada than the present
Governor General, and it is a pleasure ta
those who visit Engiand te learn that the
deep interest taken by every Governor General who has been in Canada was continued aiter his return ta the mother
country. The position taken by my hon.
friend from Halifax is a correct one.
Han. Mr. poWER-I arn sonry the right
hon, gentleman should have misunderstood
me, which he did if he supposed I was in
any way reflecting on the present incumbent
cf the office of Governor General. I tbink
our Bills should be assented ta by the Governor Greneral personally if he is here, aud.
that it shows an unintentianal lack of due
deference ta the other tva branches cf parliament when the Governar General is iu
the city and sends bis deputy to assent ta.
Bis. The right bon. gentleman vho lead&.
the House spoke about the Sovereign in
England flot coming down ta Parliarnent.
The position there is altogether different.
The Sovereign does not represent anything.
He is hirnself. One af the reasons why 1 feel
strongly an this subject is that I thînk it,
tends ta weaken the tie that binda us ta the
mother country. That argument would not.
apply in the case cf the King hirneeli.
There ie no daubt, as bas been etated by the
hion. gentleman who preceded me, no Governar Generai bas taken more Pains ta
make birneff acquainted with the wants.
and interests of this country tban the present Gavernor General. My anly point vas,
that 1 theught that inasmuch as previaus

SENATE

Governors made it a point of coming down
to assent to Bis when they were in the city,
it was desirable that that practice should
continue, and it seerns to me that now, when
the terrni of the present Governor General
is about te expire, and whcn snythîng that
le said cannot affect his future course. is a
better time to cail attention to this matter
than to wsit until the ncw Governor General
comes. I do not know about the Marquis
of Lorne, but 1 know Lord Aberdeen always
came down te give the royal assent tb oui

Hon. Mr. DAVID-Knowing wliat we

never a Governor General wlio was more inelined te do everything whicb would be
agrecable to the people of tIbis country, or

not come here on every occasion when there
were Bille te be' sancbioried, it was because
lie was told bis presence couid be dispensed

INI)EMNITY TO SENATORS.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-I
desire to call the attention o! bhc House,
in order Ihat the right lion. leader may
direct the attention of hie colleagues be
what I consider incongruibies in the Indernnity Act. It is not rny intention to find

o! the Senate to it, but neither the Minister of Justice nor the government bas
Hlon. Mr. POWER.

given it any attention. The interpretation of the Act is such as to do an injustice to many senators and members of the
Gommons. The language of subsection 1,
of section 37, of the Senate and House of
Gommons Indemnity Act lias the effeet of
deducting from the amount paid to a senator ail the dsys that the Senate has been
in session prier to bis taking bis seat ini
this Chamber. It seems to me not only
an incongruity but a very great injustice
to these gentlemen. 1 propose to iflustrate
the operation of this Act in tbe case of
certain. senators since 1897, and the resuit
je this:
In the case of the hon.
gentleman sitting opposite me, who was
mntroduced a few days âge, it ie a very
grave question whether at the end of
the session hie wiTi nlot be indebted in
some $150 to the Senate instead of receiving anything. I know of a case where a
gentleman applied foi some money the other
day and ail lie could be paid was his travelling expenses. The Clerk said te hlm,
«Yeu, I can pay your travelling expenses
minus $5. You are $5 in debt, and lie
had oniy been introduoed a couple. of days.
Whetlier that is the intention of parliament I do nlot know, but. it ought not.to
continue. Witli reference te travelling expenses, under the law, if a senator resides
400 miles. frorn the seat of government, he
is entitled te $15 a day for the days cccupied in reaching Ottawa. The late Senator Vidal lived at Sarnia, 434 miles from
Ottawa. It took hlm two days to come
here, and lie would be entitied te $30. Sir
John Carling lives in London, 371 miles
from Ottawa. He cornes upon the same
train 'which. the senator fromn Sarnia takes,
the only differeuce being that the senator
frorn Sarnia travels a few hours longer, andi
ail lie is cnbitled te je the price of the
Pullman section, $4, andi his meals, whicli
Would arnount at tihe outside te $10. Is
that equitable and f air? Both of thein corne
on tlie saine train, and both occupy about
tlie sarne time in travelling. One draws
$1 and the other drums $30. 1 wiIl read
bhc lebter of the Minister of Justice on
this point. The Clerk of the Senate wrotc

act in regard to the payment of indemnity

'Dear MT. Chapleau,-Referring to your letter ai the 24th ultimo, addressed to Mr.

that a very high court of justice, tihe
Supreme Court of the United States, has
lately laid down, a doctrine which I hope
will spread, that a littie reasonable coinmon sense la to be im'po'rted into the interpretation of the law. Whether any reasona*ble common sense has been imported
into the interpretation of a law which
would penalize a gentleman for taking a
seat in this House, -as Lord Elgin would
say, I doubt it. As soon as I can interview the Minister of Justice, I intend to
occupy a portion of his leisure time to endeavour to rectify the misehief and reimburse my hon. friends for the burdens
they have incurred by accepting positions
in the Senate. It is not always desirable
to appoint eenators at a momnent'a notice
They should be appoiteld between sessions,

It being six o'clock, the Speaker left

Hon. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHIT

After Recess.
SUPPLY BILL.
FIR.ST, SECOND AND THIRD REÂDINGS.
A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill (No. 225) An'Act for
granting te His Majesty certain suman sif
money for the public service for the financial years ending respectively the 3lst
March, 1911, and the 31st March, 1912.
The Bill vwas read the first time.
Rt. Hou. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
moved the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-Could
the right hon, leader of the House state
the amount asked for, and probabiy what
is the amount that will be required for the
year ending the 31satof March, next?
Rt. Hou. Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT
-The amount required in the present Bil]
is for the service of the pust year ending
'the 31et of March, $353.000 which had flot
'been provided for. From thie consolidated
revenue for the service of the succeed.ing
year, 1912, t.he sum of $26,642,M2 is asked.
«A turther sum which had noot been pro'vided for of $2,9M4,000 is aiso required for
'%he service of the year wfhich ezipired on
%the 31st of March let. The Bill contains
a provision likewise that tue amount granted to the Northwest Territories shall not
be deeined te have lapfed. With resq3et
te the sum total, the amoumt required for
the whole service, capital and consolidated
'fund will range to about $157,000,000 ail
told, of which about one hundred and six
or one hundred and aeven millions will
be chargeable te consolidated fund, ordinary income account. The remainder is for
'the 'purposes niainly of carrying- on th(,
'work on the National Transcontinental
railway and certain other works chargeable
'te capital which. are in progress, including
one or two appropriations for the Hudson
Day railway, and certain pretty heavy expenditures in the maritime provinces with
respect to the Intercolonial r'ail'way. TMhose
are 'the main facts connected with the
measure.
Hon. Sir MACKENZIE BOWELL-That
is about the sum that I anticipated would

749

MAY 19. 1911
be rcquired for ail purposes during the
year. The hon. gentleman has added a
million t.o the amount of $150,0OO,0O0 which
I anticipated would be required. However, in these growing times, I do not
suppose that a million makes mach difference pro or con. Looking at the estimates that are now before the House, snd
also the estimates that wc have already
passcd, I have come to the conclusion that
the estimates for the ycar are a very good
barometer cf an approaching election.
When you sce the number of items in the
difierent provinces under the heading of
public buildings, harbourB and 'wharfs, it
rather staggers one whcn hie compares the'
past 'with the present. I propose to put a
few items on record in reference te the
point I have raised. *In looking at the
estimates as far as they are laid before
parliament this year, without rcferring at
ail to the larger sums that are included in
the estimates for public works and so on,
I ahail juat confine myseif to the figures
that relate te the works that arc to be
constructcd during the year, and, considering the nuxuber, it looks very much like
paying out te the different constituencies a
certain sum in order te secure votes. That
ia the inference one wculd draw. 0f course
I neyer would think cf accuslng the goverument of doing a thmng of that kind. I
propose te submit some figures for the
benefit cf those who are here and those who
like to read theux. I find the items votcd
te the different provinces are as follows:

The Senate must flot undcrstanid that I

Any one looking- at these items, anld the
purpoges for which they arc te be ascd,
can coine ta no other conclusàon than that
there is ,searcely a creck, hs.rbour, or a
village with even a few inhabitants that
has net a publie building or which i5 inot
having eoqne work donc, repairs made, or
a haxrbour built, sand -the large number of
items I think justifies me in saying that
we may look forward in a very short
periad te a gencral ciection. These figures
arc a very fair barometer cf what is te
corne. If I werc te attribute a reason for
the cxpcnditure of these surns ln the differcnt places, crceks and rivers, where perhaps, there is no w.ater, I mnust come te
the conclusion that there is some other
reason than the good of the country, unless the governnenet think that a return
to rower by -the means of using public
funds is for the good of the country. I
should like te concur in that view, but I
think my hon. friend who la listcning te
me wiil scarcely think I do. What further
estimates dmay bc subxnittcd te us in the
fature it is impossible te say; but in
nxaking appropriations for email work8

SENATE

v-here no possible general good cen arise,
and *where no local interest is involvel,

cular reason.
paet moneys have been appropniated for
creating harbours where there is no water,
where the cattie feed in summer, as soon
as the ground gets dry enough for the
grase to grow. That has occurred, and I
have no doubt if some person will go to
the trouble and expense of examining the
places to which these items now being
voted apply, they would find that the result iii the future would be precisely wbat
I have referred to in the pagt. It would
be very i.nteresting, if *e had turne, and
it would be still more interesting if the~
minister would take the trouble and know
enough about thern to explain rnany other
items in this estirnete.
But I suppose we have to bear it. These
expenditures have been increasing year
alter year. I have before me a staternent
of the amount of money that has been
spent the last eight or ten years in the
constituency represented by the Finance
Minister himself, and if I were to subrnit
it to the Senate, I am inclined to think
iflwould ho rather astonishing to those
who have flot taken the trouble to inquire
into the manner in which the public money
has been expended of late years. I arn not
opposed te the expenditure of rnoney for
public services where it is really requîred
for the benefit of trade and commerce, or
for the advantages of any 'locality where it
